## Question

Treatment for breast cancer stage 2 in 60 yo PM woman Er/PR positive HERS negative

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating a 60-year-old postmenopausal woman with stage II, ER-positive/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, including how to think about surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and extended therapy decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about staging and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the role of genomic assays to guide chemotherapy. Next, I will review local therapy sequencing and radiation options. After that, I need to select adjuvant endocrine therapy and duration, including extended therapy. Finally, I should consider special situations, monitoring, and summarize a practical plan with contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. Stage II disease typically spans T0–1N1 or T2–3N0–1, so nodal status and tumor size will drive systemic decisions; in a 60-year-old postmenopausal woman with ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative disease, endocrine therapy is foundational, and chemotherapy is added selectively based on nodal involvement, tumor features, and genomic risk, not age alone [^1145RiJE] [^115Ef7Xv].

> Wait, let me verify the role of genomic assays before jumping to chemotherapy. For ER-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative or 1–3 node-positive disease in patients aged 50 years or older, ASCO supports using validated assays such as Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, BCI, or EndoPredict to refine recurrence risk and chemotherapy benefit; for node-negative disease, a low recurrence score (commonly < 11–18 depending on platform and study) argues against chemotherapy, whereas higher scores support chemotherapy, and for 1–3 positive nodes, contemporary data (e.g. TAILORx and RxPONDER) inform decisions and often still favor chemotherapy in node-positive settings even with intermediate scores [^111hJDbG] [^115ekCx1].

> Hold on, I should verify the chemotherapy thresholds and how they apply here. Historically, many clinicians used an Oncotype DX threshold around 25–31 to consider chemotherapy, but with updated evidence and trial analyses, patients with node-negative disease and low-to-intermediate scores generally derive minimal chemotherapy benefit, while node-positive patients more often benefit regardless of exact score; thus, if this patient is node-negative with a low score, endocrine therapy alone is appropriate, whereas if node-positive or high-risk node-negative with a higher score, chemotherapy should be considered in a shared decision-making framework [^111hJDbG] [^116F475k].

> Next, I should review local therapy sequencing and radiation. Standard practice is breast-conserving surgery with sentinel node biopsy or mastectomy with sentinel/axillary evaluation; if lumpectomy is chosen, whole-breast radiation is typically indicated, though in carefully selected postmenopausal patients with small, node-negative, ER-positive tumors and very low genomic risk, omission of radiotherapy has been explored in trials with low locoregional recurrence, but this remains investigational and not broadly guideline-concordant outside trials; partial breast irradiation is an evidence-based alternative to whole-breast irradiation in suitable early-stage patients with favorable features [^1163R2F9] [^114cPDj3] [^117NvJ3W].

> I will now examine adjuvant endocrine therapy selection. For a postmenopausal woman, an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is preferred upfront given superior disease-free outcomes versus tamoxifen in multiple randomized trials; options include a nonsteroidal AI (anastrozole or letrozole) or a steroidal AI (exemestane) for 5 years, with sequencing strategies (e.g., tamoxifen 2–3 years then AI to complete 5–7 years) reasonable if AI intolerance emerges or based on patient preference and risk profile [^114NivtP] [^114ZLgGc] [^116VVPAx].

> Let me consider duration and extension carefully. ASCO recommends that many postmenopausal patients with node-positive disease be offered extended AI therapy up to a total of 10 years, and that selected node-negative patients with higher risk may be considered for extended therapy, whereas routine extension is not advised for low-risk node-negative disease; tools like CTS5 can help estimate late recurrence risk after 5 years to individualize extension decisions, and BCI can inform discussions about extended therapy after 5 years of endocrine treatment [^112XN5zM] [^116yJDU9] [^117KCZQQ] [^115ekCx1].

> But wait, what if the tumor shows low ER expression or other atypical features. I should double-check that ER-low (1–10%) disease behaves more like triple-negative and may respond less to endocrine therapy; in such cases, chemotherapy consideration may be intensified and endocrine benefit is uncertain, so I need to ensure the pathology report clarifies ER/PR quantitation and that we interpret results in light of ASCO/CAP guidance on low ER reporting and clinical implications [^116dBGex] [^11741BRr].

> Next, I should review special situations and sequencing. If the patient is borderline fit or declines chemotherapy, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with an AI can be used to downsize the tumor and potentially facilitate breast conservation; conversely, if she is node-positive with higher genomic risk, adjuvant chemotherapy followed by AI is standard, with consideration of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in high-risk postmenopausal patients to reduce distant recurrence, and if she becomes intolerant to AI, switching to tamoxifen to complete at least 5–7 years is reasonable [^113rcnwA] [^1145RiJE] [^111q4DV5].

> I need to ensure supportive care and safety are addressed. AIs increase the risk of bone loss, so baseline and periodic bone density assessment and calcium/vitamin D supplementation are prudent, with bisphosphonates or denosumab considered for osteoporosis prevention in high-risk patients; shared decision-making should explicitly weigh AI-related arthralgia and cardiovascular risks against tamoxifen's venous thromboembolism and endometrial risks in this age group [^116dP5fu] [^1145RiJE].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan contingent on key missing data. If node-negative with a low Oncotype DX (e.g., < 18), I would recommend breast-conserving surgery, whole-breast radiation, and 5 years of an AI, with consideration of extended AI to 7–10 years if higher-risk features or higher CTS5 risk emerge; if node-positive or node-negative with intermediate-to-high Oncotype, I would favor adjuvant chemotherapy followed by AI for 5 years, and extend to 10 years total for node-positive disease; if AI is contraindicated, tamoxifen for 5–10 years is acceptable, acknowledging a modestly higher recurrence risk versus AI in postmenopausal patients [^111hJDbG] [^112XN5zM] [^114ZLgGc].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and survivorship elements. After completion of primary therapy, surveillance with history, exam, and age-appropriate imaging is standard, with attention to adherence and late effects; given the propensity for late recurrence in ER-positive disease, vigilance beyond 5 years and individualized extension decisions are important, and patient education on symptoms of recurrence and adherence to endocrine therapy meaningfully impacts outcomes [^115wnrk4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the final recommendation is precise and evidence-aligned: for a 60-year-old postmenopausal woman with stage II, ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, management should be multimodal with surgery, indicated radiation, and endocrine therapy as the backbone; chemotherapy is added selectively based on nodal status, tumor features, and validated genomic assays, and extended endocrine therapy should be individualized using clinical risk and tools like CTS5, with AI preferred upfront and sequencing adapted to tolerance and preference [^114ZLgGc] [^111hJDbG] [^112XN5zM] [^117KCZQQ].

---

For a 60-year-old postmenopausal woman with stage II, ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, the standard treatment is **breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy** [^notfound], followed by **whole-breast radiation** if breast-conserving surgery is performed [^117NvJ3W]. Adjuvant endocrine therapy is **essential** [^114NivtP]; an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) for 5 years is preferred [^114ZLgGc], with tamoxifen as an alternative if an AI is contraindicated [^114ZLgGc]. Chemotherapy is **not routine** [^1129q98C] and should be considered only for higher-risk features (e.g. node-positive, high-grade, or high genomic risk) [^113zYAJP] or if the Oncotype DX recurrence score is ≥ 26 [^notfound]. Extended endocrine therapy to 7–10 years is considered for node-positive or high-risk disease [^112XN5zM] [^116yJDU9]. Management should be individualized based on comorbidities, patient preferences, and tumor biology [^113zYAJP].

---

## Surgical management

- **Breast-conserving surgery (BCS)**: Preferred for most patients with early-stage breast cancer, provided adequate margins can be achieved [^notfound].

- **Mastectomy**: Considered for patients with large tumors, multicentric disease, or those who prefer mastectomy.

- **Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)**: Standard for axillary staging in clinically node-negative patients [^notfound].

- **Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)**: Reserved for patients with clinically positive nodes or when SLNB is not feasible.

---

## Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is **indicated after breast-conserving surgery** to reduce local recurrence risk [^1179t9Pd]. For mastectomy, post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is considered for patients with **node-positive disease, large tumors (> 5 cm), or positive margins** [^1163R2F9].

---

## Systemic therapy

### Endocrine therapy

- **Aromatase inhibitors (AIs)**: Preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer [^114NivtP]. Options include anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane for 5 years [^114ZLgGc].

- **Tamoxifen**: Alternative for patients who cannot tolerate AIs or have contraindications. Tamoxifen is given for 5 years, with consideration of switching to an AI after 2–3 years if the patient becomes postmenopausal during therapy [^116VVPAx].

- **Extended endocrine therapy**: For node-positive or high-risk node-negative disease, consider extending endocrine therapy to 7–10 years, particularly with AIs [^112XN5zM] [^116yJDU9].

---

### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is **not routinely recommended** for all patients with stage II, ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer [^1129q98C]. It is considered for patients with **higher-risk features**, such as node-positive disease, high-grade tumors, or high genomic risk scores (e.g. Oncotype DX recurrence score ≥ 26) [^111hJDbG] [^113zYAJP].

---

## Factors influencing treatment decisions

Several factors influence treatment decisions in this patient population:

- **Tumor size and grade**: Larger, higher-grade tumors may necessitate more aggressive systemic therapy.

- **Lymph node involvement**: Node-positive disease significantly increases recurrence risk and may warrant chemotherapy.

- **Genomic profiling**: Tools such as Oncotype DX [^111hJDbG] and MammaPrint [^117FEJ5g] help identify patients who may benefit from chemotherapy.

- **Patient comorbidities and preferences**: Treatment must be individualized based on patient health status, comorbidities, and personal preferences [^113zYAJP].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence risk

Prognosis for stage II, ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer is **generally favorable**, with 5-year survival rates approximately 85–90% [^1163R2F9]. Recurrence risk persists beyond 5 years, particularly in hormone receptor-positive disease, underscoring the importance of extended endocrine therapy [^115wnrk4].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence and manage treatment-related side effects. Recommended surveillance includes:

- **Clinical breast examination**: Every 3–6 months for the first 3 years, then annually thereafter.

- **Imaging**: Annual mammography; additional imaging (MRI, ultrasound) as clinically indicated.

- **Bone density monitoring**: Regular bone density scans for patients on AIs or tamoxifen.

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Surgery | Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with SLNB |
| Radiation therapy | Whole-breast radiation after BCS; PMRT for high-risk features |
| Endocrine therapy | AI for 5 years; tamoxifen if AI contraindicated; extended therapy for high-risk disease |
| Chemotherapy | Consider for high-risk features or high genomic risk scores |
| Follow-up | Regular clinical exams, imaging, and bone density monitoring |

---

The standard treatment for a 60-year-old postmenopausal woman with stage II, ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer includes **surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy**, with chemotherapy reserved for higher-risk cases. Treatment should be individualized based on tumor characteristics, patient comorbidities, and preferences [^114PeyFo].

### What is the optimal endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer? [^113Ab8AT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old postmenopausal woman with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer was referred to discuss adjuvant therapy. Annual screening mammogram demonstrated a suspicious mass in the left breast. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma that was estrogen receptor (ER) positive and progesterone receptor (PR) negative and lacked amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ie, HER2 negative). She underwent excision and sentinel node evaluation. Pathology demonstrated a 1.9-cm grade 2 invasive cancer without lymphatic vascular invasion; clean margins were obtained, and both sentinel nodes were free of cancer. The 21-gene recurrence score was 16. She has a body mass index (BMI) of 28.5 but is otherwise healthy; levothyroxine is the only prescription medication she takes. She experienced vaginal spotting 2 years earlier because of an endometrial polyp, which was resected. She exercises regularly and takes a calcium supplement with vitamin D. Bone density study performed 6 months earlier was normal other than mild osteopenia in the femoral neck (T score, -1.3). Radiation therapy is planned.

### Breast cancer treatment: a review [^1163R2F9]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer will be diagnosed in 12% of women in the United States over the course of their lifetimes and more than 250 000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2017. This review focuses on current approaches and evolving strategies for local and systemic therapy of breast cancer.

Observations

Breast cancer is categorized into 3 major subtypes based on the presence or absence of molecular markers for estrogen or progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2): hormone receptor positive/ERBB2 negative (70% of patients), ERBB2 positive (15%-20%), and triple-negative (tumors lacking all 3 standard molecular markers; 15%). More than 90% of breast cancers are not metastatic at the time of diagnosis. For people presenting without metastatic disease, therapeutic goals are tumor eradication and preventing recurrence. Triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to recur than the other 2 subtypes, with 85% 5-year breast cancer-specific survival for stage I triple-negative tumors vs 94% to 99% for hormone receptor positive and ERBB2 positive. Systemic therapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer is determined by subtype: patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors receive endocrine therapy, and a minority receive chemotherapy as well; patients with ERBB2-positive tumors receive ERBB2-targeted antibody or small-molecule inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy; and patients with triple-negative tumors receive chemotherapy alone. Local therapy for all patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer consists of surgical resection, with consideration of postoperative radiation if lumpectomy is performed. Increasingly, some systemic therapy is delivered before surgery. Tailoring postoperative treatment based on preoperative treatment response is under investigation. Metastatic breast cancer is treated according to subtype, with goals of prolonging life and palliating symptoms. Median overall survival for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is approximately 1 year vs approximately 5 years for the other 2 subtypes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Breast cancer consists of 3 major tumor subtypes categorized according to estrogen or progesterone receptor expression and ERBB2 gene amplification. The 3 subtypes have distinct risk profiles and treatment strategies. Optimal therapy for each patient depends on tumor subtype, anatomic cancer stage, and patient preferences.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in clinical practice for early-stage node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: challenges and considerations [^112CnEce]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative breast cancer have traditionally relied on clinical and pathologic parameters. However, the molecular heterogeneity and the complex tumor genome demand more sophisticated approaches to the problem. Several multigene-based assays have been developed to better prognosticate the risk of recurrence and death and predict benefit of therapy in this patient population. Oncologists are often faced with the challenge of incorporating these various complex genome-based biomarkers along with the traditional biomarkers in clinical decision-making. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Breast Cancer are helpful in providing a general recommendation. However, uncertainty remains in the absence of definitive data for various clinical scenarios. This case report describes a postmenopausal woman with stage I breast cancer that is low-grade and ER-rich, and has an intermediate Oncotype DX recurrence score of 28.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology technology assessment on the use of aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: status report 2004 [^116dP5fu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the 2003 American Society of Clinical Oncology technology assessment on adjuvant use of aromatase inhibitors.

Recommendations

Based on results from multiple large randomized trials, adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should include an aromatase inhibitor in order to lower the risk of tumor recurrence. Neither the optimal timing nor duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy is established. Aromatase inhibitors are appropriate as initial treatment for women with contraindications to tamoxifen. For all other postmenopausal women, treatment options include 5 years of aromatase inhibitors treatment or sequential therapy consisting of tamoxifen (for either 2 to 3 years or 5 years) followed by aromatase inhibitors for 2 to 3, or 5 years. Patients intolerant of aromatase inhibitors should receive tamoxifen. There are no data on the use of tamoxifen after an aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting. Women with hormone receptor-negative tumors should not receive adjuvant endocrine therapy. The role of other biomarkers such as progesterone receptor and HER2 status in selecting optimal endocrine therapy remains controversial. Aromatase inhibitors are contraindicated in premenopausal women; there are limited data concerning their role in women with treatment-related amenorrhea. The side effect profiles of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors differ. The late consequences of aromatase inhibitor therapy, including osteoporosis, are not well characterized.

Conclusion

The Panel believes that optimal adjuvant hormonal therapy for a postmenopausal woman with receptor-positive breast cancer includes an aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after treatment with tamoxifen. Women with breast cancer and their physicians must weigh the risks and benefits of all therapeutic options.

### Estrogen and progesterone receptor testing in breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology / college of American pathologists guideline update [^113R8V1w]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Knoop, Eur J Cancer 2014 — DBCG 77C trial in postmenopausal high-risk breast cancer reports that between 1977 and 1982, 1716 patients with tumours larger than 5cm or positive axillary nodes were randomized to no systemic therapy or tamoxifen 30mg daily for one year; archival tumour tissue from 1515 patients was analysed and cancers were classified by ER/PR, HER2, and Ki67. In the intent-to-treat population, one year of tamoxifen improved disease-free-survival (DFS) (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.77–0.98), improved Breast Cancer Recurrence Rate (BCRR) (HR = 0.79; 0.69–0.90), and reduced breast-cancer-specific-mortality (BCM) (HR = 0.83; 0.73–0.93). BCRR improved significantly in luminal A (HR = 0.66; 0.53–0.84) and luminal B/HER2- (HR = 0.54; 0.39–0.74), with similar results for BCM with 30 years follow-up.

### Early breast cancer: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^11741BRr]. Annals of Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer, adjuvant systemic therapy, triple-negative, ESMO 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that HER2- tumors with 1–9% estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor expression (estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-low) represent a heterogenous group, with some exhibiting biological behavior similarly to triple-negative breast cancers. Adjust therapeutic strategies accordingly, as this may result in a higher response to chemotherapy response and reduced endocrine therapy efficacy compared to classical HR+ breast cancer.

### Challenges in the management of advanced, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer [^117Qxbiz]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer accounts for the majority-up to 80%-of all breast cancers. The evolution of breast cancer from early stage to the metastatic setting leads to increased heterogeneity, the occurrence of new mutations, and the development of treatment resistance representing a great challenge for management decisions. Unfortunately, little data exist to offer guidance in this context, and a reliance on traditional clinical parameters remains when deciding on optimal treatment. In advanced-stage oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) disease, ongoing issues include the choice between endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, the appropriate sequence of treatment agents, and the incorporation of biological agents, such as everolimus, into the treatment armamentarium. In metastatic disease, repeated biopsies can help to reassess the receptor or genetic mutational status; however, the evidence to support this approach is limited. In this Review, we examine the current evidence that can guide treatment decisions in patients with advanced-stage ER+ breast cancer, discuss how to tackle these therapeutic challenges and provide suggestions for the optimal management of this patient population.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy for breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^113rcnwA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To develop guideline recommendations concerning optimal neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer.

Methods

ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of the literature on neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer and provide recommended care options.

Results

A total of 41 articles met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the guideline recommendations.

Recommendations

Patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy should be managed by a multidisciplinary care team. Appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy include patients with inflammatory breast cancer and those in whom residual disease may prompt a change in therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy can also be used to reduce the extent of local therapy or reduce delays in initiating therapy. Although tumor histology, grade, stage, and estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression should routinely be used to guide clinical decisions, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of other markers or genomic profiles. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have clinically node-positive and/or at least T1c disease should be offered an anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen; those with cT1a or cT1bN0 TNBC should not routinely be offered neoadjuvant therapy. Carboplatin may be offered to patients with TNBC to increase pathologic complete response. There is currently insufficient evidence to support adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to standard chemotherapy. In patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR-positive), HER2-negative tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be used when a treatment decision can be made without surgical information. Among postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease, hormone therapy can be used to downstage disease. Patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative, HER2-positive disease should be offered neoadjuvant therapy in combination with anti-HER2-positive therapy. Patients with T1aN0 and T1bN0, HER2-positive disease should not be routinely offered neoadjuvant therapy. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.

### Systemic treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^1122NK9U]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Biomarker-guided systemic therapy — HR-positive metastatic breast cancer: Clinicians should recommend treatment with systemic therapy according to pathological and biomarker features when the results of biomarker testing and pathology are available. Basic immunohistochemistry (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PgR], and HER2) is an important step in characterizing the disease and should be sought when possible in every scenario, as this will critically inform treatment decisions.

### The optimal duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy for early stage breast cancer – with what drugs and for how long? [^111fwDBK]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy has made a significant impact in improving overall survival for women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. The anti-estrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used therapy, although in post-menopausal women, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have further improved outcomes either as an alternative to tamoxifen for 5 years, or given in sequential fashion following initial tamoxifen therapy. However, late recurrence remains perhaps the biggest risk in HR-positive breast cancer, with more than half all recurrences occurring beyond 5 years since primary diagnosis. As such, the current debate is whether extended AI or prolonged tamoxifen therapy should be given, and if so, to whom. We review some of the recent studies that have addressed this question and demonstrated further reduction in risk of recurrence, and discuss the clinical issues that face women and their health care providers in determining who should use which drug, and for how long.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer, adjuvant endocrine therapy, HR+ HER2-, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to consider offering adjuvant extended aromatase inhibitor therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients with node-negative, HR+ breast cancer based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors. Do not offer routine extended therapy in patients with low-risk node-negative breast cancer.

### Biomarkers for adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^113TTDmR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Breast Cancer Index (BCI) — For ER-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer in patients who are postmenopausal or age ≥ 50 years, the clinician may use the BCI to guide decisions for adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy. For ER-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive breast cancer, the clinician should not use the BCI to guide decisions about adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy; based on new information regarding other assays, if a patient is premenopausal and has node-negative or node-positive breast cancer, the clinician should refrain from using the BCI test to guide decisions for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Evidence ratings for the two directives are Type: evidence-based; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: moderate and Type: informal consensus; evidence quality: insufficient; strength of recommendation: moderate, respectively.

### Biomarkers for adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115ekCx1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update recommendations on appropriate use of breast cancer biomarker assay results to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy decisions in early-stage breast cancer.

Methods

An updated literature search identified randomized clinical trials and prospective-retrospective studies published from January 2016 to October 2021. Outcomes of interest included overall survival and disease-free or recurrence-free survival. Expert Panel members used informal consensus to develop evidence-based recommendations.

Results

The search identified 24 studies informing the evidence base.

Recommendations

Clinicians may use Onco type DX, MammaPrint, Breast Cancer Index (BCI), and EndoPredict to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in patients who are postmenopausal or age > 50 years with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (ER+ and HER2-) breast cancer that is node-negative or with 1–3 positive nodes. Prosigna and BCI may be used in postmenopausal patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2- breast cancer. In premenopausal patients, clinicians may use Onco type in patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2- breast cancer. Current data suggest that premenopausal patients with 1–3 positive nodes benefit from chemotherapy regardless of genomic assay result. There are no data on use of genomic tests to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with ≥ 4 positive nodes. Ki67 combined with other parameters or immunohistochemistry 4 score may be used in postmenopausal patients without access to genomic tests to guide adjuvant therapy decisions. BCI may be offered to patients with 0–3 positive nodes who received 5 years of endocrine therapy without evidence of recurrence to guide decisions about extended endocrine therapy. None of the assays are recommended for treatment guidance in individuals with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer. Treatment decisions should also consider disease stage, comorbidities, and patient preferences. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.

### Omission of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for women with breast cancer with low clinical and genomic risk: 5-year outcomes of IDEA [^114cPDj3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Multiple studies have shown a low risk of ipsilateral breast events (IBEs) or other recurrences for selected patients age 65–70 years or older with stage I breast cancers treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and endocrine therapy (ET) without adjuvant radiotherapy. We sought to evaluate whether younger postmenopausal patients could also be successfully treated without radiation therapy, adding a genomic assay to classic selection factors.

Methods

Postmenopausal patients age 50–69 years with pT1N0 unifocal invasive breast cancer with margins ≥ 2 mm after BCS whose tumors were estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative with Oncotype DX 21-gene recurrence score ≤ 18 were prospectively enrolled in a single-arm trial of radiotherapy omission if they consented to take at least 5 years of ET. The primary end point was the rate of locoregional recurrence 5 years after BCS.

Results

Between June 2015 and October 2018, 200 eligible patients were enrolled. Among the 186 patients with clinical follow-up of at least 56 months, overall and breast cancer-specific survival rates at 5 years were both 100%. The 5-year freedom from any recurrence was 99% (95% CI, 96 to 100). Crude rates of IBEs for the entire follow-up period for patients age 50–59 years and age 60–69 years were 3.3% (2/60) and 3.6% (5/140), respectively; crude rates of overall recurrence were 5.0% (3/60) and 3.6% (5/140), respectively.

Conclusion

This trial achieved a very low risk of recurrence using a genomic assay in combination with classic clinical and biologic features for treatment selection, including postmenopausal patients younger than 60 years. Long-term follow-up of this trial and others will help determine whether the option of avoiding initial radiotherapy can be offered to a broader group of women than current guidelines recommend.

### Role of patient and disease factors in adjuvant systemic therapy decision making for early-stage, operable breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology endorsement of cancer care Ontario guideline recommendations [^113zYAJP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

An American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) panel considered the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) recommendations on the role of patient and disease factors in selecting adjuvant therapy for women with early-stage breast cancer for endorsement.

Methods

ASCO staff reviewed the CCO guideline for methodologic rigor, and an ASCO panel of content experts reviewed the content of the recommendations.

Cco Recommendations

For making decisions regarding adjuvant therapy, nodal status, tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, tumor grade, and lymphovascular invasion are relevant; Oncotype DX score and Adjuvant! Online may be used as risk stratification tools; and age, menopausal status, and medical comorbidities should be considered. Chemotherapy should be considered for patients with positive lymph nodes, ER-negative disease, HER2-positive disease, Adjuvant! Online mortality greater than 10%, grade 3 lymph node-negative tumors (T > 5 mm), triple-negative (ER-negative, PgR-negative, HER2-negative) tumors, lymphovascular invasion positivity, or estimated distant relapse risk of greater than 15% at 10 years based on Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS). Chemotherapy may not be beneficial or required for small node-negative tumors (T < 5 mm) without high-risk features or for patients with HER2-negative, strongly ER-positive, and PgR-positive cancer with micrometastatic nodal disease, T less than 5 mm, or Oncotype DX RS with an estimated distant relapse risk of less than 15% at 10 years.

Asco Panel Conclusion

The ASCO panel endorses the recommendations with minor suggested revisions and highlights three areas that warrant further consideration: tumor histology and adjuvant therapy recommendations, risk stratification tools and proposed Oncotype DX RS thresholds to guide decisions about chemotherapy, and patient factors in decision making.

### The sequential use of endocrine treatment for advanced breast cancer: where are we? [^115asJAQ]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer is an increasing health burden. Although endocrine therapies are recognised as the most beneficial treatments for patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, the optimal sequence of these agents is currently undetermined.

Methods

We reviewed the available data on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of endocrine therapies in this treatment setting with particular focus on RCTs reported over the last 15 years that were designed based on power calculations on primary end points.

Results

In this paper, data are reviewed in postmenopausal patients for the use of tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and fulvestrant. We also consider the available data on endocrine crossover studies and endocrine therapy in combination with chemotherapy or growth factor therapies. Treatment options for premenopausal patients and those with estrogen receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumours are also evaluated.

Conclusion

We present the level of evidence available for each endocrine agent based on its efficacy in advanced breast cancer and a diagram of possible treatment pathways.

### Endocrine therapy of advanced disease: analysis and implications of the existing data [^115yteKJ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

Endocrine therapy remains an important approach to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer because of its effectiveness and excellent tolerability. In the last 10 years, a number of new endocrine therapies have been introduced. These include the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, which produce menopausal changes in premenopausal women; the aromatase inhibitors, which prevent production of estrogen in postmenopausal women; and the estrogen receptor down-regulator fulvestrant (Faslodex), which is effective in postmenopausal women whose tumors have progressed following response to other selective estrogen receptor modulators. The endocrine cascade for the treatment of premenopausal women with metastatic disease now involves the concurrent or sequential combination of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue and tamoxifen, whereas the cascade for the treatment of postmenopausal women can begin with tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor or with an aromatase inhibitor followed by tamoxifen. The optimal cascade following the use of an aromatase inhibitor and tamoxifen in postmenopausal women remains unclear, but fulvestrant and megestrol acetate or the use of an aromatase inactivator (exemestane) following an aromatase inhibitor are all available options with some activity. Over the next few years, clinical trials will clarify the optimal sequence of endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women. The use of estrogen and progesterone receptor status to select for endocrine therapy is undeniably crucial. HER2/neu overexpression may also predict response to endocrine therapy, but this remains controversial.

### Advances in adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women [^115TcAxM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Hormone receptor-positive cancers are the most common tumor subtype among postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Despite substantial improvements in disease-free survival and overall survival with tamoxifen and chemotherapy, recurrences still occur, and may ultimately lead to death from breast cancer. Importantly, disease recurrence includes both early and late events, with over half of all recurrences detected more than 5 years from initial breast cancer diagnosis. In recent years, a number of large, randomized trials have evaluated the role of the aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. These studies have tested one of three approaches: (1) an upfront AI, (2) a sequential approach after 2–3 years of tamoxifen, and (3) extended endocrine therapy beyond 5 years. Results of these studies have challenged the previous standard of a 5-year course of tamoxifen alone. While the AIs have become a standard component of treatment for most postmenopausal women, many questions remain as to how best tailor endocrine treatment to individual patients. In addition, despite the gains achieved with the AIs, many recurrences are not prevented, and novel strategies are urgently needed, particularly for those women at high risk of recurrence. In this article, we review the efficacy and toxicity data from the available trials of endocrine therapy in the postmenopausal setting. We outline controversies in choosing the optimal endocrine approach, and we discuss selected ongoing studies. Finally, we highlight future research directions, such as the need to understand host and tumor heterogeneity.

### Partial breast irradiation for patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^117NvJ3W]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASTRO partial breast irradiation (PBI) guideline — KQ1 indications frames the applicable population, evidence base, and clinical stance when considering PBI as an alternative to whole breast irradiation (WBI). The AHRQ inclusion criteria required adult women (age ≥ 18 years) with early-stage invasive breast cancer or DCIS defined as a small lesion ≤ 3 cm with minimal (up to 3 positive) or no lymph node involvement, treated with upfront breast conserving surgery, and the search did not include patients of male sex. Multiple RCTs evaluating the efficacy of PBI alone compared with WBI have demonstrated comparable IBR and long-term overall survival. There is broad consensus that PBI is an acceptable treatment option for patients with favorable clinical features and tumor characteristics (postmenopausal age range, estrogen receptor [ER]-positive status, grade 1 to 2, small tumor size, and no lymph node involvement), while uncertainty remains regarding features perceived as less favorable that represented a minority in RCTs (age < 50 years, DCIS, invasive lobular carcinoma, larger tumor size, grade 3, ER-negative status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-positive status, positive for lymphovascular invasion [LVI], and positive lymph nodes). Evaluation of these subgroups was restricted to the patients enrolled in the RCTs using PBI techniques that are recommended in KQ2, and the key question asks: In adult patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer or DCIS, what are the appropriate indications for PBI as an alternative to WBI?

### Endocrine treatment versus chemotherapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116mmGZg]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Although international guidelines support the administration of hormone therapies with or without targeted therapies in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, upfront use of chemotherapy remains common even in the absence of visceral crisis. Because first-line or second-line treatments, or both, based on chemotherapy and on hormone therapy have been scarcely investigated in head-to-head randomised controlled trials, we aimed to compare these two different approaches.

Methods

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis with a systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and online archives of the most relevant international oncology conferences. We included all phase 2 and 3 randomised controlled trials investigating chemotherapy with or without targeted therapies and hormone therapies with or without targeted therapies as first-line or second-line treatments, or both, in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017. Additional recently published randomised controlled trials relevant to the topic were also subsequently added. No language restrictions were adopted for our search. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was done to compare hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (the primary outcome), and to compare odds ratios (ORs) for the proportion of patients achieving an overall response (the secondary outcome). All treatments were compared to anastrozole and to palbociclib plus letrozole. This study is registered in the Open Science Framework online public database, registration DOI 10.17605/OSF. IO/496VR.

Findings

We identified 2689 published results and 140 studies (comprising 50029 patients) were included in the analysis. Palbociclib plus letrozole (HR 0.42; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.25–0.70), ribociclib plus letrozole (0.43; 0.24–0.77), abemaciclib plus anastrozole or letrozole (0.42; 0.23–0.76), palbociclib plus fulvestrant (0.37; 0.23–0.59), ribociclib plus fulvestrant (0.48; 0.31–0.74), abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (0.44; 0.28–0.70), everolimus plus exemestane (0.42; 0.28–0.67), and, in patients with a PIK3CA mutation, alpelisib plus fulvestrant (0.39; 0.22–0.66), and several chemotherapy-based regimens, including anthracycline and taxane-containing regimens, were associated with better progression-free survival than was anastrozole alone. No chemotherapy or hormone therapy regimen was significantly better than palbociclib plus letrozole for progression-free survival. Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was the only clinically relevant regimen that was significantly better than palbociclib plus letrozole in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an overall response (OR 8.95; 95% CrI 1.03–76.92).

Interpretation

In the first-line or second-line setting, CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapies are better than standard hormone therapies in terms of progression-free survival. Moreover, no chemotherapy regimen with or without targeted therapy is significantly better than CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapies in terms of progression-free survival. Our data support treatment guideline recommendations involving the new combinations of hormone therapies plus targeted therapies as first-line or second-line treatments, or in both settings, in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

Adjuvant endocrine treatment is an essential component in therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Among postmenopausal patients, options include tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or a sequence of these agents. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have distinctive side-effect profiles. Among premenopausal women, tamoxifen remains the standard treatment. The role of ovarian suppression in addition to tamoxifen is under investigation. Questions about the duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy, the use of biomarkers for treatment selection and prognosis, and the management of side effects of adjuvant endocrine therapy remain key areas of investigation.

### Endocrine therapy considerations in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative advanced breast cancers [^112heLmh]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The standard of care for patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative advanced breast cancer is endocrine therapy. Endocrine agents, including aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant, are often administered alone as first line treatment and demonstrate durable responses with limited side effects. Endocrine resistance represents a major clinical problem. In the future, poly-endocrine therapy and combination therapies with biological agents might become valuable options for the first line treatment of hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. However, it will be critical to develop clinical tools that can reliably identify the subgroup of patients most likely to benefit from endocrine therapy alone, and those who might benefit from alternative approaches. Herein, we will review and discuss current issues in the endocrine treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative advanced breast cancer.

### Differential long-term tamoxifen therapy benefit by menopausal status in breast cancer patients: secondary analysis of a controlled randomized clinical trial [^1168xdUx]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer patients have a long-term risk of distant metastatic disease, and premenopausal patients have a higher risk. Randomized studies with long-term follow-up are essential to understand treatment benefit. We elucidated the long-term tamoxifen therapy benefit by menopausal status in the Stockholm tamoxifen trials with 20 years complete follow-up.

Methods

Secondary analysis of 1242 estrogen receptor–positive and HER2-negative patients that were randomly assigned to 2–5 years of 40 mg adjuvant tamoxifen or no endocrine therapy. Distant recurrence-free interval in tamoxifen-treated vs endocrine untreated patients was assessed by Kaplan–Meier, Cox proportional hazards regression, and time-varying analyses.

Results

In premenopausal patients, a statistically significant tamoxifen benefit was observed for lymph node–negative (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.87), progesterone receptor–positive (adjusted HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.91), and genomic low-risk tumors (adjusted HR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.85) but only lasted beyond 10 years for genomic low-risk tumors. Postmenopausal patients showed long-term benefit for all good-prognosis markers including low-grade (adjusted HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.73), lymph node–negative (adjusted HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.64), progesterone receptor–positive (adjusted HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.80), Ki-67 low (adjusted HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.68), and genomic low-risk tumors (adjusted HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.37 to 0.74), and regardless of tumor size (≤ 20 mm: adjusted HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.77; > 20 mm: adjusted HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.94). Premenopausal patients with no poor-prognosis tumor characteristics (clinical marker score = 0) showed early benefit and postmenopausal long-term benefit.

Conclusions

Our study suggests differential tamoxifen benefit by menopausal status. Improved long-term endocrine therapy prediction in premenopausal patients is needed and could involve molecular markers because standard tumor characteristics cannot predict benefit beyond 10 years.

### Tailoring therapies – improving the management of early breast cancer: ST gallen international expert consensus on the primary therapy of early breast cancer 2015 [^112UK3fg]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

adjuvant endocrine therapy of postmenopausal patients

The Panel was almost unanimous that some postmenopausal patients can be treated with tamoxifen alone. However, virtually all Panel members regarded the involvement of four or more nodes; grade 3 pathology; or high Ki-67 as arguing for the inclusion of an AI at some point. A lesser majority also felt that HER2 positivity argued in favor of inclusion of an AI, but the Panel did not consider that age < 60 should indicate AI therapy. If an AI is used, the Panel was virtually unanimous that it should start up front in patients at higher risk, while the Panel was evenly divided on whether it should be used up front in all patients. The Panel was comfortable to contemplate switching from an AI to tamoxifen after 2 years if necessary.

The Panel was virtually unanimous that following 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, patients with initially node-positive disease should continue endocrine therapy to 10 years regardless of menopausal status, but did not consider such extension indicated for initially node-negative disease. A clear majority favored extension to 10 years for patients with grade 3 tumors; high Ki-67; and for patients premenopausal at baseline who became postmenopausal during 5 years of tamoxifen.

The Panel then considered the more complex situation of patients whose initial 5 years of adjuvant therapy had involved a switch from tamoxifen to an AI. A clear majority was in favor of continuing AI therapy to a total cumulative AI duration of 5 years.

Following initial therapy consisting of 5 years of a straight AI, the Panel was evenly divided between recommendations for 3–5 years of tamoxifen; 3–5 more years of an AI; or no further endocrine treatment.

### Blocking the cycle: cyclin-dependent kinase 4 / 6 inhibitors in metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer [^111mMG9Y]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman was diagnosed with breast cancer 6 years ago when she presented with a stage II (T2N1), right-sided, invasive ductal carcinoma considered grade 2 of 3 on core biopsy, with a positive fine-needle aspiration of a palpable, ipsilateral axillary lymph node. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression. She received neoadjuvant dose-dense doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel chemotherapy, followed by breast-conserving surgery and axillary lymph node dissection, which revealed residual disease in three of 11 nodes. She received adjuvant radiation therapy and initiated letrozole, with excellent compliance during the interval 6-year period. While receiving adjuvant letrozole therapy, she reported 3 months of worsening back pain. Skeletal scintigraphy and cross-sectional imaging confirmed widespread osseous metastatic disease and right supraclavicular lymph node enlargement (Fig 1). Core biopsy of the involved lymph node confirmed estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (90%), progesterone receptor-negative, HER2-negative recurrent metastatic breast cancer. The patient reported mild pain that was adequately controlled with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications. She has remained active with an excellent performance status.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies that met the following inclusion criteria and provided a clear description of patient characteristics were included in the NMA:
Population: Women with HR + /HER2 − postmenopausal advanced breast cancer.
Interventions and comparisons: Single-agent chemotherapy, endocrine therapy monotherapy, targeted therapy, and combinations of endocrine therapy with targeted therapy were considered.
Outcome: The HRs of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the objective response rate were examined. Adverse events (AEs) incidences were categorized into multiple groups: AEs of any grade, grade 3–5 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs leading to death. Attention was also given to the incidence rates of the three most common specific AEs, which included both hematologic and non-hematologic types, across any grade and specifically within grades 3–5. The presence of at least one Kaplan–Meier curve for either OS or PFS was a requirement. If specific data related to postmenopausal women were provided in any RCTs, those trials were included in this study.
Study design: phase II or phase III RCTs.

Some articles were excluded based on the following criteria:
Papers published before 2007.
Non-RCTs or single-arm RCTs.
Trials with unclear clinical outcomes.
RCTs that included only premenopausal patients and HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer patients alone.

All retrieved articles were imported into Note Express (version 3.2.0.7535). The literature was reviewed by two researchers (HS and MZ). Disagreements among the reviewers were settled through discussion. A third reviewer (GY) was consulted if necessary. Titles and abstracts were first screened. The full text of the literature selected for inclusion was then evaluated. Finally, the included literature was reviewed for the inclusion of the most recent data from the relevant studies.

Data extraction

Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were extracted independently by two investigators for participants in each treatment group in the following study designs: RCTs' names, sample size, median age, and follow-up time. Clinical outcomes extracted included HRs of OS and PFS, any grade AEs, grade 3–5 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment, and AEs leading to death. Additionally, we considered the three most common AEs, encompassing both hematologic and non-hematologic types, across all grades and specifically within grades 3–5. Survival data from the independent review committee were prioritized. For trials where independent review committee data were not available, investigator-assessed outcomes were extracted.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^114J45t9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy — appropriate sequence after 5 years of tamoxifen — includes the following directives: Women who have received 5 years of tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy should be offered additional adjuvant endocrine treatment. If women are postmenopausal, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years or should switch to up to 5 years of AI for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (Type: Evidence-Based, Evidence Quality: High, Strength of Recommendation: Strong). If women are premenopausal or menopausal status cannot be ascertained, they should be offered 5 additional years of tamoxifen for a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (Type: Evidence-Based, Evidence Quality: High, Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### Differential long-term tamoxifen therapy benefit by menopausal status in breast cancer patients: secondary analysis of a controlled randomized clinical trial [^116iY8m4]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients have a long-term risk of distant metastatic disease, and premenopausal patients have a higher risk. Randomized studies with long-term follow-up are essential to understand treatment benefit. We elucidated the long-term tamoxifen therapy benefit by menopausal status in the Stockholm tamoxifen trials with 20years complete follow-up.

Methods

Secondary analysis of 1242 estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative patients that were randomly assigned to 2–5years of 40mg adjuvant tamoxifen or no endocrine therapy. Distant recurrence-free interval in tamoxifen-treated vs endocrine untreated patients was assessed by Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards regression, and time-varying analyses.

Results

In premenopausal patients, a statistically significant tamoxifen benefit was observed for lymph node-negative (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.87), progesterone receptor-positive (adjusted HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.91), and genomic low-risk tumors (adjusted HR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.85) but only lasted beyond 10years for genomic low-risk tumors. Postmenopausal patients showed long-term benefit for all good-prognosis markers including low-grade (adjusted HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.73), lymph node-negative (adjusted HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.64), progesterone receptor-positive (adjusted HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.80), Ki-67 low (adjusted HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.68), and genomic low-risk tumors (adjusted HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.37 to 0.74), and regardless of tumor size (≤ 20 mm: adjusted HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.77; > 20 mm: adjusted HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.94). Premenopausal patients with no poor-prognosis tumor characteristics (clinical marker score = 0) showed early benefit and postmenopausal long-term benefit.

Conclusions

Our study suggests differential tamoxifen benefit by menopausal status. Improved long-term endocrine therapy prediction in premenopausal patients is needed and could involve molecular markers because standard tumor characteristics cannot predict benefit beyond 10years.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED FRONTLINE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH HORMONE RECEPTOR–POSITIVE MBC?

Hormonal therapy is the cornerstone of management for patients with hormone receptor–positive cancer. The type of hormonal therapy depends on the menopausal status of the patient. For patients who are premenopausal, therapy includes ovarian ablation, either by medical, surgical, or radiation means (see the section on Recommended Treatment for Premenopausal Patients with MBC for more). For patients who are postmenopausal, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) with or without CDK4/6 inhibitors can be used where available. Patients with high volume of hormone receptor–positive visceral disease where the risk of visceral crisis is a concern may be offered chemotherapy as an initial treatment.

### A critical evaluation of the role of aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with breast cancer [^115rFdvn]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The introduction of aromatase inhibitors (AI) has provided more options for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women; they are associated with improved disease-free survival, but less commonly with improvements in overall survival. Current evidence suggests that women at high risk of recurrence, especially those with node-positive disease, should receive an AI for 2 years as part of their treatment, but routine prescription of AIs to postmenopausal patients with low-risk disease is not appropriate. Not only the expected benefits but also the specific toxicity of the prescribed hormone therapy, and its cost, should be considered when selecting treatment.

### Biomarkers for adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111hJDbG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — biomarkers for adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer — clinicians may use Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Breast Cancer Index (BCI), and EndoPredict to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in patients who are postmenopausal or age ≥ 50 years with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative (ER+ and HER2–) breast cancer that is node-negative or with 1–3 positive nodes. Prosigna and BCI may be used in postmenopausal patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2– breast cancer. In premenopausal patients, clinicians may use Oncotype in patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2– breast cancer. Current data suggest that premenopausal patients with 1–3 positive nodes benefit from chemotherapy regardless of genomic assay result. There are no data on use of genomic tests to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with ≥ 4 positive nodes. Ki67 combined with other parameters or immunohistochemistry 4 score may be used in postmenopausal patients without access to genomic tests to guide adjuvant therapy decisions. BCI may be offered to patients with 0–3 positive nodes who received 5 years of endocrine therapy without evidence of recurrence to guide decisions about extended endocrine therapy. None of the assays are recommended for treatment guidance in individuals with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer. Treatment decisions should also consider disease stage, comorbidities, and patient preferences.

### The role of hormonal therapy in the management of hormonal-receptor-positive breast cancer with co-expression of HER2 [^116hDyZQ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Approximately half of breast cancers that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) also express hormone receptors (HRs). Although HR positivity predicts efficacy of endocrine agents, preclinical and clinical data suggest that HER2 overexpression confers intrinsic resistance to hormonal treatment. In addition, HER2 overexpression is an independent adverse prognostic factor regardless of the hormonal status of the tumor, indicating that patients with HR+/HER2+ breast tumors might not derive a benefit from single-agent hormonal therapy. These data provided a strong rationale for exploring the targeting of both HR and HER2 signaling pathways in HR+/HER2+ breast tumors to optimize hormonal therapy and overcome resistance to anti-estrogen therapy. Results from a randomized clinical trial that combined hormonal treatment with targeted anti-HER2 therapy in postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2+ advanced breast cancer indicate that this novel dual-targeting strategy significantly improves outcomes compared with endocrine treatment alone. Nonetheless, other data suggest that it might achieve an inferior outcome compared with anti-HER2 therapy plus chemotherapy. Therefore, targeting both the HR and HER2 signaling pathways upfront might not be the most-effective therapeutic strategy in the management of HR+/HER2+ breast cancer. We discuss the clinical implication of resistance to endocrine therapy, and describe new insights into the management of HR+/HER2+ advanced breast cancer.

There is now a deeper understanding of the biology of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer (EBC) that can be used to inform assessment of risk and prognosis, and also guide more effective adjuvant systemic therapies. For postmenopausal HR+ EBC endocrine therapy remains the mainstay of treatment with extended duration up to 10 years for some, the addition of targeted CDK 4/6 inhibitors for those with node-positive high-risk disease, and de-escalation of chemotherapy use for those in whom it is unlikely to be of benefit. As such, systemic adjuvant therapy is now highly tailored and individualized.

### Recommendations from the European commission initiative on breast cancer for multigene testing to guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early breast cancer, hormone receptor positive, HER-2 negative [^115qiNkz]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women. In the European Union, including UK, 404,920 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 98,755 died because of this disease in 2018. Hormone receptor (HoR)-positive (i.e. oestrogen receptor (ER)- and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer represents about 70% of breast cancer diagnosed in western countries. At the time of diagnosis, around 60% of this type of cancer has not spread to lymph nodes, and approximately 15% of these women will develop a recurrence within 10 years if treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone. The risk of recurrence could be reduced by the addition of chemotherapy. However, given the relatively low risk of recurrence and the partial effectiveness of chemotherapy in these women, most would be over-treated if all received chemotherapy. The same rationale would apply to women with HoR-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with 1–3 positive lymph nodes. Several prognostic factors, including clinical-pathological features such as age, tumour size, percentage of ER- and PR-positive cells as well as Ki67-index, – predict the risk of recurrence and can help identify women who would benefit the most from chemotherapy. Although these factors have been shown to discriminate different prognostic groups, they showed no or minimal predictive value on the response to chemotherapy.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^115wnrk4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update — extended adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal hormone receptor–positive breast cancer states that in postmenopausal women with stages I to III hormone receptor–positive breast cancer after 5 years of sequential endocrine therapy, many women with node-negative disease may be offered extended aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment, women with low-risk node-negative tumors should not routinely be offered extended therapy, women with node-positive disease should be offered extended AI therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment, and women who receive extended adjuvant endocrine therapy should receive no more than 10 years of total treatment; prevention of secondary or contralateral breast cancers is a major benefit of extended AI therapy and should inform the decision to pursue extended treatment; extended therapy carries ongoing risks and side effects and should be weighed against the potential absolute benefits in a shared decision-making process; and to date, none of the studies have shown improvement in overall survival with longer-duration AI therapy, so recommendations are based on benefits that include prevention of distant recurrence and prevention of second breast cancers.

### Strategies for the management of early-stage breast cancer in older women [^115Ef7Xv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

Older patients with breast cancer (aged ≥ 65 years) are often undertreated with both locoregional and systemic therapies and have been shown to have higher breast cancer-specific mortality. These patients are also excluded from most clinical trials; therefore, treatment recommendations are extrapolated from younger populations. The data that do exist, however, show that older patients usually tolerate and respond well to conventional treatments. When selecting treatments for breast cancer, age should not be the chief consideration; comorbidities and functional status are also important, as is life expectancy. For patients with an estimated survival of less than 5 years, aggressive treatment may be discouraged; however, if the estimated survival is 5 years or more, treatment according to recurrence risk is recommended. In the curative setting, undertreatment should be avoided.

### Optimizing endocrine therapy for breast cancer [^112MccTs]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Endocrine therapy has significantly improved outcomes for patients with early- and advanced-stage hormone-receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. Despite the success of adjuvant endocrine therapy, some patients with early-stage disease will experience relapse. Additionally, all patients with advanced disease will eventually experience disease progression on endocrine therapy due to resistance. Improved understanding of the mechanisms associated with resistance to endocrine agents has recently led to the approval of new therapeutics. Multiple questions remain unanswered, including the optimal duration of adjuvant therapy, the role of ovarian ablation in early-stage breast cancer in premenopausal women, and how to best incorporate targeted agents with endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting. This article reviews the optimization of endocrine therapy in patients with HR-positive breast cancer, focusing on these controversial areas.

### Impact of low versus negative estrogen / progesterone receptor status on clinico-pathologic characteristics and survival outcomes in HER2-negative breast cancer [^115SXsEX]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

TNBC is associated with inferior long-term outcomes compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Until recently, chemotherapy had remained the only available systemic treatment for patients with TNBC. However, recent years have seen advances in treatment for TNBC, with newer agents like immune checkpoint inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) showing promise. In the last two years therapeutic agents have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency specifically for treatment of TNBC: pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) plus chemotherapy for locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic PD-L1 positive (combined positive score ≥ 10) TNBC; sacituzumab govitecan (an ADC) for patients with unresectable/locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior systemic therapies; and pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as adjuvant treatment for high-risk, early-stage TNBC. Despite contemporary multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, though, 20–40% of patients with early-stage TNBC develop metastatic disease, and median survival with chemotherapy alone in metastatic TNBC is under two years, emphasizing the critical need for patients with TNBC to have access to the newly available life-prolonging TNBC-specific therapies. Supposing that HER2-negative, Low-ER breast cancer and TNBC demonstrate similar biology and clinical behavior, it is plausible that patients with Low-ER breast cancer may derive similar benefit from TNBC-specific treatments.

The current study utilizes a prospective multisite registry of patients treated in the contemporary era to assess the impact of low versus negative ER/PR expression on clinico-pathologic characteristics, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes in patients with HER2-negative breast cancers.

Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This open-label phase II trial was conducted in 13 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral ribociclib (600 mg once per day on a 3-week-on, 1-week-off schedule) plus ET (letrozole 2.5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg once daily orally; continuous daily schedule) with goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneous implant administered once on day 1 of each 28-day cycle) or combination CT of investigator's choice among one of the three regimens (docetaxel plus capecitabine, paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, or capecitabine plus vinorelbine; Data Supplement, Table S1, online only). If one CT agent was discontinued because of AEs, patients could continue the other agent as monotherapy.

Random assignment was stratified by the presence of liver metastases (present or absent) and a disease-free interval (the time between complete tumor resection for primary BC lesion to disease recurrence) < 2 years (yes or no; patients with de novo stage 4 disease were included in the disease-free interval ≥ 2 years group for the purpose of stratification only). The statistician was blinded to treatment until database lock. Patients received treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation for any other reason.

Participants

Eligible patients were pre/perimenopausal (hereby referred to as premenopausal) women age 18–59 years, with histologically or cytologically confirmed progesterone or estrogen (> 10%) receptor–positive (ER+ or PR+), HER2– ABC (locoregionally recurrent or metastatic, not amenable to curative therapy) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2. Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 was required. Patients were eligible if combination CT was clinically indicated per investigator's judgment for aggressive disease, namely symptomatic visceral metastases, rapid disease progression or impending visceral compromise, or markedly symptomatic nonvisceral disease. Patients who received (neo)adjuvant therapy for BC were eligible; adjuvant therapy with aromatase inhibitors was permitted if the subsequent treatment-free interval was > 12 months.

Patients were ineligible if they received prior systemic anticancer therapy for ABC. Patients with liver metastases were ineligible if bilirubin levels were > 1.5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if the AST or ALT levels were > 5× the ULN.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^1129q98C]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy for HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors states that patients with HR positive, HER2-negative tumors, receive adjuvant endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence and those deemed at high risk for distant recurrence despite adjuvant endocrine therapy, receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN Guidelines call for the determination of ER and PR content in all primary invasive breast cancers to determine whether a patient is a candidate for endocrine therapies. Given the limited efficacy data on the ER-low-positive group, individualized consideration of risks versus benefits of endocrine therapy and additional adjuvant therapies should be incorporated into decision-making, and patients with ER-negative, PR-positive cancers may also be considered for endocrine therapies; for the purposes of this guideline, any ER and/or PR-positive tumors is referred to as hormone receptor (HR)-positive. The magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy is dependent on level of ER-expression and on recurrence score (RS), low ER expression is less likely to benefit, and a high RS will gain less benefit with endocrine therapy alone versus those with low RS. Patients with invasive breast cancers that are HR- positive should be considered for adjuvant endocrine therapy regardless of patient age, lymph node status, or whether adjuvant chemotherapy is to be administered.

### Impact of low versus negative estrogen / progesterone receptor status on clinico-pathologic characteristics and survival outcomes in HER2-negative breast cancer [^1151zqzg]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, breast cancers with ER/PR expression 1–10% represent a small but appreciable subset of early-stage HER2-negative disease and mimic the clinical behavior, chemosensitivity, and survival outcomes of TNBC. Our study findings add further evidence for the need for systematic evaluation of this subgroup with respect to effectiveness of novel TNBC-specific therapies and degree of potential benefit from endocrine therapy. These findings also bring to the forefront the potential need to reevaluate the ER/PR cutoff for clinical trials in TNBC. If the Low-ER group is indeed similar to TNBC, then the current approach of adhering to the 1% cutoff may lead to denying this group access to effective TNBC therapy just to ensure that some marginal endocrine therapy benefit is not lost. Findings from the current study support consideration for inclusion of patients with Low-ER HER2-negative disease in future TNBC clinical trials.

Introduction

Among women worldwide, breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer, accounting for 24.2% of all cancer diagnoses and 15.0% of cancer-related mortality. The majority (68–73%) of women with breast cancer present with hormone receptor-positive (HR+; estrogen receptor-positive [ER+] and/or progesterone receptor-positive [PgR+]) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) disease, with 14–15% presenting with HER2+ disease and 10–12% with triple-negative disease.

Endocrine therapies, including aromatase inhibitors (AIs, e.g. letrozole), selective ER modulators (SERMs, e.g. tamoxifen), and selective ER degraders (SERDs, e.g. fulvestrant) that block ER signaling via ER inhibition, modulation, or degradation, and hence estrogen-promoted tumor growth, are mainstays of treatment for patients with HR+/HER2− breast cancer.

introduction

The fourteenth St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference, held for the first time in neighboring Vienna, Austria, confirmed, and extended the recommendations of earlier reports.

This report is focused on providing a practical approach to the allocation of available therapies to individual patients in the light of the most recent and reliable information from clinical trials, laboratory insights and the expert opinions of a large international faculty. To this end, attention is given to tumor factors and the condition of the host. Tumor factors are primarily the presence or absence of targetable features such as hormone receptors and HER2, and the metastatic potential, as reflected in measures of proliferation and anatomic extent of disease. Patient factors include menopausal status, age, comorbidity, and patient preference.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^113oz8DM]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using competing risk regression, we found that the current age‐based recommendations for patients with breast cancer after 5 years of follow‐up do not match with the actual risk of LRR and SP: the risk was lower for women aged < 60 years after 5 years of follow‐up who received annual follow‐up, compared with women aged 60–74 receiving less intensive biennial follow‐up. This contradiction was caused by the relatively low risk of the 50‐ to 60‐year‐old group, which lowered the risk of the complete group, including the age group of younger women (< 50 after 5 years of follow‐up, < 45 at diagnosis) with higher risks. With alternative cutoffs for the age groups (< 50, 50–69, > 69), this higher‐risk group was separated from the women with lower risk (aged 50–60) and more differentiation was achieved, resulting in recommendations that better match the actual risk. When comparing with the 5‐year risk of primary breast cancer in different age groups of women without a history of breast cancer that are invited to the biennial national screening program, the risk of LRR and SP after 5 years of clinical follow‐up was at least twice as high. Still, other factors than age were of greater influence on recurrence risk and should also be taken into account.

The large size of this study cohort from the population‐based NCR strengthens the reliability and generalizability of the results. Because of the required long follow‐up for our study, the data from 2003 and 2005 might not be generalizable to the current situation, as treatments have improved over time, resulting in lower recurrence risk. For example, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy for HER2‐positive tumors was not yet advised in the guideline in the year 2003, which means that patients in this cohort did not receive this treatment [3]. Still, the benefit of this treatment in the following years can be supposed by the nonsignificant sHR of 0.96 for HER2‐positive tumors. A positive hormonal receptor status, on the other hand, suggested a nonsignificant negative effect (sHR 1.11 for ER/PR+ compared with ER&PR−). However, when the endpoints were assessed separately, we see other (nonsignificant) outcomes: sHR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.71–1.24) for LRR and 1.29 (95% CI 0.99–1.67) for SP.

### Early breast cancer in the older woman [^117QyKbr]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Women aged ≥ 65 are generally underrepresented in early breast cancer studies. Therefore, the optimal management of this group of women remains less certain.

Methods

A literature review of recently published trials, reviews, and practice guidelines outlining the surgical and adjuvant management of early breast cancer in older women was performed.

Results

Surgery remains as the cornerstone treatment for early breast cancer in the elderly. Adjuvant radiation is generally considered if the projected lifespan is > 5 years. Hormone receptor-positive disease is best treated with adjuvant endocrine treatment; aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen are both options. Evidence for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab for high-risk disease in the elderly is more limited. Polychemotherapy is still preferred in fit older women. Certain toxicities from systemic treatments can be more pronounced and should be carefully managed. Treatment with systemic agents should be individualized, with consideration of patient preference, performance status, comorbidities, and projected lifespan. Molecular tumor signatures may help better select patients for treatment in the future.

Conclusions

Age in itself should not be an absolute contraindication to any breast cancer therapy. Comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessment of elderly patients is imperative in evaluating eligibility for beneficial therapies.

### Endocrine therapy considerations in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative advanced breast cancers [^116oL4Lr]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Overall, these trials demonstrated that, in a proportion of women undergoing first line single agent endocrine treatment, disease remissions lasting more than 12 months can be observed. Indeed, in the FIRST trial the median TTP for anastrozole was 13.1 months. In two trials comparing anastrozole versus tamoxifen, median TTP for anastrozole was 11.1 months and 8.2 months. However, a high proportion of patients enrolled in these trials had not received prior adjuvant endocrine therapy. Whether the same results would be achieved in patients who received adjuvant endocrine therapy (commonly with an AI) remains an open question.

Current clinical tools to distinguish patients who will benefit from endocrine therapy alone from those who will require an alternative approach are sub-optimal. Hierarchical cluster analysis has revealed that HR+ tumors can be divided into at least two molecular subgroups, namely luminal A and luminal B, with distinct clinical behavior and response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Additionally, in the adjuvant setting, molecular signatures are emerging as a powerful tool that could aid clinicians in therapeutic decision. However, the clinical utility of molecular subtypes and signatures in patients with HR+ HER2– ABC is yet to be established. The aforementioned clinical trials did not collect tumor samples, thus subgroup analyses based on molecular subtypes or any other biomarker could not be made.

### Personalizing the treatment of women with early breast cancer: highlights of the ST gallen international expert consensus on the primary therapy of early breast cancer 2013 [^114ZN1rd]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

For patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative disease, the use of molecular diagnostics was felt to be unnecessary in low-risk patients such as those with a tumour size of ≤ 1 cm in the setting of negative lymph nodes, since chemotherapy would be unlikely to be given anyway. Similarly, patients with a higher risk such as those with a tumour size > 5 cm, inflammatory breast cancer, those with four or more involved nodes, or a very low ER positivity (e.g. 5%) might not benefit from molecular diagnostics because chemotherapy would be likely to be offered in any case. Patients in whom chemotherapy was thought to be of uncertain indication and who might, therefore, benefit from molecular diagnostics were felt to include selected patients with node-negative disease, those with one to three positive nodes, and patients aged < 35.

In the determination of HER2 status for treatment purposes, the Panel did not believe that polysomy of chromosome 17, or heterogeneity of expression of HER2 need to be considered.

adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal women

The large majority of the Panel said that tamoxifen alone was the default adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal patients. In light of recent trial evidence, it was felt that at least some patients should have a treatment duration of 10 years, although this may not be needed by all patients. Most Panellists thought ovarian suppression need not be added to tamoxifen, but Panellists were evenly divided for patients < 40 years of age. Most of the Panel regarded both ovarian suppression alone without tamoxifen and its combination with aromatase inhibitors as inappropriate unless tamoxifen was contraindicated.

adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women

The Panel strongly believed that some postmenopausal women could be treated with tamoxifen alone. If an aromatase inhibitor were included in the regimen, Panellists were equally divided whether treatment should start with the aromatase inhibitor, although this strategy was strongly preferred for patients at high risk. Most Panellists believed that initial aromatase inhibitor therapy could be replaced by tamoxifen after 2 years, if there were a reason to do so. Extension of aromatase inhibitor therapy beyond the first five years for patients with node-positive, but not node-negative disease was strongly supported, for patients whose initial treatment was tamoxifen or whose initial therapy was < 5 years of an aromatase inhibitor. The Panel was equally divided concerning an extended duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy beyond 5 years of treatment with these agents. Extended adjuvant endocrine therapy using tamoxifen is a consideration after a 5-year course of an aromatase inhibitor, though this approach has not been directly studied.

### Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in primary breast cancer: indications and use as a research tool [^112jGF7F]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

For patients with locally advanced breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is commonly recommended to improve surgical outcomes. However, for postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease, endocrine treatment is a logical alternative because of its established efficacy in the adjuvant setting and the increasing recognition that chemotherapy may be less effective in ER+ HER2− disease. Historically, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was reserved for older and frail patients with ER+ breast cancer. However, recent studies of this treatment modality in younger and healthier postmenopausal women showed that the improved surgical outcomes and response observed with the endocrine approach do not show an interaction with age, justifying the increased acceptance of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in younger postmenopausal women with better performance status. For premenopausal women, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy remains investigational. In this review, we will present results of the major neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) trials and discuss recent progress in using neoadjuvant endocrine therapy as a research tool to assess endocrine responsiveness and evaluate novel therapeutic interventions.

### Clinical management update: evaluation and management of older patients with breast cancer [^115XD7sD]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Recent gains in life expectancy, coupled with aging as a risk factor for breast cancer, make breast cancer primarily a disease of older women. Evaluation of the biology of breast cancer according to age has suggested that estrogen receptor-positive, low-S-phase, low-tumor-grade, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative tumors are more common in older than younger women. However, this has not translated into any major survival advantage for older women with breast cancer over their younger counterparts. Several reasons, including undertreatment and underrepresentation in clinical trials, may account for this age-related disparity. In this brief review, recent practice-changing breast cancer updates of relevance to the care of older patients with breast cancer are discussed and summarized. Because the population is aging and the number of older patients with breast cancer will continue to increase, it is imperative that older patients with breast cancer be encouraged to participate in cutting edge research and that state-of-the-art oncology care be provided to this underserved population.

### Impact of low versus negative estrogen / progesterone receptor status on clinico-pathologic characteristics and survival outcomes in HER2-negative breast cancer [^115E1yur]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is defined by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and absence of HER2 overexpression and/or gene amplification, accounts for 15% of all breast cancers in the United States. The 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guideline recommended that invasive breast cancers with immunohistochemistry ER expression of ≥ 1% be considered ER-positive. The primary purpose for this recommended threshold for ER positivity was to serve as a predictive marker for benefit from endocrine therapy, as some studies had suggested potential adjuvant endocrine therapy benefit in patients with as little as 1% ER expression. Following the publication of these guidelines, an immunohistochemical expression of < 1% for the definition of ER/PR negativity has been adopted for TNBC designation (in addition to ASCO/CAP criteria for HER2 negativity).

It has, however, been noted that HER2-negative breast cancers with low ER expression of 1–10% (Low-ER) show molecular features similar to ER-negative breast cancers and are more likely to be basal-like compared to ER-high (> 10%) breast cancers. Furthermore, there is paucity of data regarding the extent of adjuvant endocrine therapy benefit in the setting of low ER expression 1–10%. Accordingly, the 2020 ASCO/CAP update introduced a new reporting category of "ER-low positive" for breast cancers with 1–10% ER positivity, with a comment stating, "there are limited data on the overall benefit of endocrine therapies for patients with low level (1–10%) ER expression, but they currently suggest possible benefit, so patients are considered eligible for endocrine treatment". In addition, the 2020 ASCO guideline also acknowledges that "there are data that suggest invasive cancers with these results are heterogeneous in both behavior and biology and often have gene expression profiles more similar to ER-negative cancers". Similarly, the 2015 St. Gallen Consensus reported that ER expression values between 1% and 9% should be considered equivocal and that endocrine treatment alone, in the absence of chemotherapy, should not be considered a reliable adjuvant treatment for these patients. As reflected in these practice guidelines, there continues to be ambiguity regarding the clinically relevant ER threshold for endocrine therapy benefit. As a result, most clinical trials in TNBC generally exclude patients with Low-ER expression.

### Breast cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^116F475k]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast Cancer Treatment –Health Professional Version General Information About Breast CancerGo to Patient Version. The use of molecular profiling in breast cancer includes:

- ER and PR status testing.
- HER2 receptor status testing.
- Gene profile testing by microarray assay or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. On the basis of ER, PR, and HER2 results, breast cancer is classified as one of the following types:

- Hormone receptor positive.
- HER2 positive.
- Triple negative. ER, PR, and HER2 status are important in determining prognosis and in predicting response to endocrine and HER2-directed therapy.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists consensus panel has published guidelines to help standardize the performance, interpretation, and reporting of assays used to assess the ER-PR status by immunohistochemistry and HER2 status by immunohistochemistry and. Patients in this study with a low-risk score were found to have very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with endocrine therapy.
- The RxPONDER trial included 3, 350 postmenopausal and 1, 665 premenopausal women with HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who had a recurrence score of 25 or less. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy. Results have been reported in abstract form; the primary study end point was IDFS. Because a prespecified test for interaction between treatment assignment and menopausal status was significant compared two chemotherapy regimens in patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative disease. Chemotherapy was not offered to patients with recurrence scores below 12, but they were followed. For a full description of the chemotherapy regimens, see Postoperative systemic therapy for HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. P = 0.007).
- In a secondary analysis of the ATAC trial, the BCI was prognostic in patients with node-negative breast cancer for both early and late distant recurrence. For patients with stage I HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive tumors, a high H/I ratio predicted significant rates of late distant recurrence.

### Clinical review on the management of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer | JCO oncology practice… [^112PM9F5]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

1Hormone receptor–positive breast cancer makes up approximately 65% of all breast cancers diagnosed. The prognosis for early-stage disease is excellent, and death rates for advanced disease have been falling over time. 2These improvements are the result of earlier detection and improvements in treatment. In regard to treatment, the most important advances have come from targeting estrogen receptor signaling, which has evolved over time from the use of selective ER modulators, to aromatase inhibitors, and selective estrogen receptor degraders. Clinical Presentation and Management Several clinical factors should be considered when choosing treatment for patients with the newly diagnosed HR+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative breast cancer in the frontline setting and beyond. When feasible, a biopsy at first recurrence should be obtained for repeat biomarker testing.

In addition to confirming hormone receptor status, it is important to establish HER2 status as the approach to HR+ and HER2+ breast cancer is different from HR+ and HER2– disease. Of note, a recent randomized phase II study in premenopausal women evaluated the combination of palbociclib plus exemestane with ovarian suppression versus capecitabine in women with advanced ER+ and HER2– breast cancer and demonstrated a median PFS of 20. 1 months (95% CI. Although performed in the early-stage setting, Robertson and colleagues recently reported the results of a randomized presurgical study in patients with treatment-naive early-stage HR+ and HER2– breast cancer awaiting surgery. 63, 64 In conclusion, the past decade has seen significant improvements in our treatment options for patients with advanced ER+ breast cancer. After years of searching for effective doublets, we now have the CDK 4/6 inhibitors, everolimus, and the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib.

Current data strongly support the use of CDK 4/6 inhibitors with ET in the frontline setting. Few patients will have a contraindication or will be unable to tolerate them, and chemotherapy use in the frontline setting should be reserved for the minority of patients who present with significant visceral compromise. In endocrine-resistant disease, CDK 4/6 and fulvestrant combinations are effective. The use of everolimus and, for PI3K-mutated patients, alpelisib remains options after progression on CDK 4/6 inhibitors.

### Hormone therapy for breast cancer fact sheet-NCI… [^113iHpim]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

Breast cancers that lack ERs are called ER negative, and if they lack both ER and PR they may be called HR negative. Approximately 67%–80% of breast cancers in women are ER positive. Approximately 90% of breast cancers in men are ER positive and approximately 80% are PR positive. Some women with advanced breast cancer are treated with a combination of hormone therapy and one of several targeted therapies:

- Palbociclib, is approved for use in combination with letrozole as initial therapy for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Palbociclib inhibits two cyclin-dependent kinases that appear to promote the growth of HR-positive breast cancer cells.

Palbociclib is also approved to be used in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose cancer has gotten worse after treatment with another hormone therapy.
- Abemaciclib, another CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, is approved to be used in combination with fulvestrant for postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after treatment with hormone therapy. Abemaciclib is also approved to be used alone for women and men with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease got worse after treatment with hormone therapy and previous chemotherapy given for metastatic disease. Abemaciclib is also approved to be used with an aromatase inhibitor as first-line hormone therapy in postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
- Some women with advanced breast cancer that is HER2 and HR positive may receive hormone therapy plus trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab. Neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer: The use of hormone therapy to treat breast cancer to reduce tumor size before surgery has been studied in clinical trials. These trials have shown that neoadjuvant hormone therapy — in particular, with aromatase inhibitors — can be effective in reducing the size of breast tumors in postmenopausal women, but it is not yet clear how effective it is in premenopausal women.

### Management of older women with early-stage breast cancer… [^117G4w4n]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

For patients with an average life expectancy of less than 5 years, the value of adjuvant endocrine therapy and certainly chemotherapy is likely to be minimal except in the case of patients with extremely high-risk disease. In older patients with small hormone receptor–positive tumors, including those with hormone receptor–positive, HER2-positive tumors, endocrine therapy with either AIs or tamoxifen is the mainstay of treatment. Survival benefits are similar for both AIs and tamoxifen but overall risk of relapse is a few percent lower with AIs. The absolute added value in improving survival with the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in older patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative tumors is highly dependent on the risk of tumor recurrence. In general, the majority of patients with node-negative hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative tumors will derive little benefit from chemotherapy.

The decision to consider chemotherapy in these patients is best made using multigene molecular assays such as the recurrence score or other assays, which can provide prognostic or predictive information. Patients with a life expectancy of less than 5 years, irrespective of nodal involvement, are not likely to derive any benefit from chemotherapy if they have hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative tumors. For older patients with triple-negative breast cancer and a life expectancy exceeding 5 years, the major systemic treatment consideration is chemotherapy. Several chemotherapy regimens are appropriate in these patients and can be roughly divided into anthracycline and nonanthracycline treatments. Older patients with HER2-positive tumors can benefit greatly from chemotherapy and trastuzumab.

Both patients with hormone receptor–positive and hormone receptor–negative tumors benefit, but the greatest absolute benefit is seen in those with a hormone receptor–negative, HER2-positive phenotype — the most aggressive phenotype for patients who do receive adjuvant systemic therapy. Recent data have suggested that a combination of weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab for patients with stage I, node-negative disease provides outstanding disease control with an estimated relapse-free survival of 98% at 3 years. 53For those with triple-negative breast cancer and good life expectancy, anthracycline and taxane regimens can be used. For patients with HER2-positive disease, neoadjuvant therapy that includes pertuzumab in addition to trastuzumab provides the best chances for tumor reduction. 54, 55A summary of our recommendations for adjuvant systemic therapy is shown in Table 2.

### Managing a long and winding road: estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer… [^115s7LZn]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract We review key topics in the management of estrogen receptor –positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative breast cancer. The single biggest challenge in management of this disease is late relapse, and we review new methods for identifying which patients are at risk of late relapse and potential therapeutic approaches in clinical trials. Using CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Early-stage and Advanced Hormone Receptor–Positive Breast Cancer. Advanced Breast Cancer The addition of CDK4/6 inhibition to the first-line ET of patients with advanced breast cancer is the standard for the vast majority of patients with advanced estrogen receptor –positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 –negative breast cancer.

Given the good tolerability of CDK4/6 inhibitors, advancing age and minor comorbidities should not be a reason to give ET alone, although patients with significant comorbidities or poor performance status may occasionally not be appropriate. Adjuvant CDK4/6 Inhibition Two years of adjuvant abemaciclib, in addition to AI with or without ovarian suppression, has become the standard therapy for high-risk patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. The initial results of the MONARCH-E trial showed benefit from adjuvant abemaciclib, although the report was after only a median follow-up of 15. 5 months, with very few patients having completed a full 2 years of follow-up. 53On the basis of these data, US Food and Drug Administration granted approval to elacestrant for postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2-negative, ESR1-mutated ABC or mBC with disease progression following at least one line of ET.

Determination of ESR1 mutations is required through liquid biopsy, which is an approved companion diagnostic tool. 53In addition, longer duration of benefit on previous endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor benefit was associated with more pronounced elacestrant benefit. A further oral SERD that demonstrated promising antitumor activity in initial phase I/II studies was amcenestrant. In the phase II AMEERA-3 trial, amcenestrant was compared with ET of physicians' choice in postmenopausal patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC who had received ≤ 2 previous lines of ET and ≤ 1 previous chemotherapy or ≤ 1 targeted therapy for advanced disease.
