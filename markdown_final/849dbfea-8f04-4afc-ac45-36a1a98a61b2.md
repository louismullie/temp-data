## Question

How does albumin help with edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how albumin helps with edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the Starling forces and where albumin fits. Then, I should verify albumin's direct oncotic mechanism and whether this translates into fluid shifts. Next, I will consider the "supplementation" role beyond simple volume expansion. After that, I should review the evidence base across clinical scenarios where albumin is used for edema. Finally, I will examine dosing, safety, and monitoring, and synthesize a balanced, practical takeaway that aligns with guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the physiological framework: edema reflects a net outward filtration exceeding lymphatic return, governed by hydrostatic and oncotic pressures across the capillary wall, plus capillary permeability and the glycocalyx, so albumin's effect hinges on its contribution to colloid oncotic pressure and how permeability and hydrostatic gradients respond in a given disease state [^1144arSP] [^111nSY5Z] [^1151AcZj].

> I will now examine albumin's primary oncotic mechanism. Wait, let me verify the intravascular retention of colloids versus crystalloids. Human data show that iso-oncotic albumin yields substantially greater intravascular volume expansion than lactated Ringer's, and hyperoncotic 20% albumin expands plasma volume by roughly the infused volume or more in some contexts, which is precisely why hyperoncotic preparations can theoretically mobilize interstitial fluid back into the circulation and reduce edema when hydrostatic pressures are controlled [^115TfPdZ] [^114sHcK1] [^115VYHyv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply "giving albumin" for edema; I need to ensure I separate two clinical strategies. One is resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin to acutely expand plasma volume and recruit interstitial fluid, and the other is supplementation to raise serum albumin toward or above 30 g/L to mitigate ongoing edema formation in hypoalbuminemic states, with meta-analytic data suggesting fewer complications when albumin is corrected above 30 g/L, though causality and timing remain debated [^112EVfzn] [^115VYHyv].

> Next, I should review where the evidence is strongest for edema management. In cirrhosis with large-volume paracentesis, I should confirm that albumin prevents paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction and is recommended by major guidelines; doses of 20–25% albumin at 6–8 g per liter removed when more than 5 L are tapped is standard, with some guidance to consider albumin even for smaller volumes in high-risk patients, which aligns with the pathophysiology of acute effective hypovolemia after rapid ascitic decompression [^116A3Q1P] [^116pF5Jz] [^111Yb1bd].

> For nephrotic syndrome, let me consider the data carefully. I initially thought the evidence was uniformly supportive, but wait, the Cochrane review found only one small, methodologically limited RCT in children and concluded uncertainty, so I should correct that overstatement; however, pediatric guidelines and observational pediatric data support selective use of albumin, typically 0.5–1 g/kg of 20–25% albumin over 4–6 hours with furosemide to achieve diuresis and short-term weight loss, while recognizing that benefits are transient unless proteinuria remits and that complications like hypertension and respiratory distress can occur, so patient selection and monitoring are critical [^113B8aVV] [^112eni4o] [^11323XVW].

> I need to check burn resuscitation next. The American Burn Association recommends considering albumin in the first 24 hours, especially for larger burns, to improve urine output and reduce total resuscitation volumes. Evidence suggests a fluid-sparing effect and faster decline in fluid administration when albumin is used, but there is uncertainty about timing and pulmonary edema risk with early administration, so rescue use or protocolized use with careful monitoring is prudent rather than routine early use in all patients [^112Pjx8P] [^112XNjdi] [^117M7gCA].

> For ARDS and critical illness, I should double-check that restrictive fluid strategies with diuresis and, in some protocols, albumin in hypoproteinemic patients can improve oxygenation and reduce ventilator days, though mortality benefits are inconsistent. Thus, albumin may be considered as part of a restrictive, de-escalation approach in selected patients with low albumin, integrated with hemodynamic assessment to avoid fluid overload [^112WeLYB] [^115VYHyv].

> But wait, what about the pleiotropic effects; do they matter clinically. Albumin's binding, antioxidant, and endothelial glycocalyx effects may modulate permeability and microcirculation, and these could theoretically aid edema resolution beyond simple oncotic shifts; however, large trials have struggled to translate these into consistent survival benefits, so I should be cautious in over-ascribing non-oncotic mechanisms to routine edema management outside specific contexts like sepsis or cirrhosis where signal exists [^116kJiEp] [^111qMbfm] [^112x7Pvh].

> I should confirm dosing nuances and formulations. Hyperoncotic 20–25% solutions are favored when mobilizing edema fluid with minimal sodium load, whereas 5% solutions are used more for volume replacement. For large-volume paracentesis, 6–8 g per liter removed is standard, for SBP or HRS phenotypes, 1.5 g/kg day 1 and 1 g/kg day 3 is the regimen with evidence, and in pediatric nephrotic edema, 0.5–1 g/kg with furosemide is customary, all with vigilant monitoring for volume responsiveness and pulmonary edema [^114sHcK1] [^116A3Q1P] [^112pdkH7] [^112eni4o].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. Pulmonary edema and fluid overload are the most consequential risks, particularly in cirrhosis and critically ill patients. Therefore, I need to ensure careful bedside assessment of intravascular volume, dynamic fluid responsiveness when feasible, and early use of diuretics to prevent albumin from simply raising hydrostatic pressure and worsening edema. Dynamic strategies like pulse pressure variation or mini-fluid challenges can help personalize therapy during optimization and de-escalation phases [^112N9Sqj] [^112a2mUa] [^115VYHyv].

> Hold on, I should verify that we are not conflating "edema" with "hypervolemia". In inflammatory states with capillary leak, patients can be intravascularly depleted yet edematous. In such cases, judicious albumin with vasopressors may be appropriate initially, whereas in true hypervolemia with low albumin, diuresis and albumin as an adjunct to enhance natriuresis may be reasonable, so I need to align the intervention with the patient's volume phenotype and disease phase [^111FEnrJ] [^114Unsoc] [^113UPeAa].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: albumin helps with edema primarily by restoring colloid oncotic pressure, thereby favoring transcapillary fluid reabsorption when hydrostatic pressures are controlled, and by allowing smaller-volume, more efficient plasma volume expansion compared with crystalloids. Clinically meaningful edema reduction is most consistently supported in cirrhosis with large-volume paracentesis, selectively in severe nephrotic edema, and as a fluid-sparing adjunct in burn resuscitation, while in ARDS and critical illness it may be considered within restrictive, albumin-guided strategies but with modest and context-dependent benefits. Across all uses, monitor closely for fluid overload and tailor dosing to the clinical objective and patient response [^116A3Q1P] [^112eni4o] [^112Pjx8P] [^112WeLYB] [^114sHcK1].

Albumin helps edema by **raising plasma oncotic pressure** and drawing interstitial fluid back into the vasculature [^114gd531], thereby reducing peripheral and pulmonary edema [^114EEu27]. It is most beneficial in **hypoalbuminemic states** (nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, ARDS) [^114EEu27] and is often used with diuretics to enhance fluid removal and stabilize hemodynamics [^113B8aVV] [^112dKmXy]. Albumin is not effective in normal albumin states (e.g. heart failure) [^notfound] and carries risks of fluid overload and pulmonary edema, so careful patient selection and monitoring are essential [^112N9Sqj] [^114h6xpq].

## Physiological mechanisms of albumin in edema management

### Colloid oncotic pressure

Albumin is the **primary contributor to plasma oncotic pressure**, retaining fluid intravascularly [^114xAjJj]. In hypoalbuminemia, reduced oncotic pressure promotes interstitial fluid accumulation and edema [^112KY5LA]. Intravenous albumin increases plasma oncotic pressure, draws interstitial fluid back into the vasculature, and reduces edema [^114EEu27].

---

### Volume expansion and hemodynamic stabilization

Albumin expands plasma volume and improves hemodynamics, increasing effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion [^11176k9G]. This can **enhance diuretic responsiveness** and facilitate fluid removal in hypoalbuminemic edema [^112dKmXy].

---

### Pleiotropic effects

Albumin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and endothelial protective effects that may reduce capillary leak and edema formation, particularly in critical illness [^116kJiEp] [^112x7Pvh].

## Clinical indications for albumin use in edema

Albumin is most beneficial in **edema associated with hypoalbuminemia**:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism of edema** | **Role of albumin** |
|-|-|-|
| Nephrotic syndrome | Proteinuria → hypoalbuminemia | - Increases oncotic pressure <br/> - Enhances diuresis with loop diuretics [^112oWTSw] [^112eni4o] |
| Cirrhosis with ascites | - Hypoalbuminemia <br/> - Portal hypertension | - Prevents paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction <br/> - Improves hemodynamics [^116A3Q1P] [^116pF5Jz] |
| Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) | - Increased capillary permeability <br/> - Hypoalbuminemia | - Improves oxygenation <br/> - Reduces pulmonary edema [^112WeLYB] [^111JNNnk] |
| Burns | - Capillary leak <br/> - Hypoalbuminemia | - Reduces resuscitation volume <br/> - Improves hemodynamics [^112Pjx8P] [^117M7gCA] |

## Clinical evidence supporting albumin use in edema

- **Nephrotic syndrome**: Albumin plus furosemide increases diuresis and reduces edema in hypoalbuminemic patients [^114CHX3w] [^11323XVW].
- **Cirrhosis**: Albumin during large-volume paracentesis prevents circulatory dysfunction and renal impairment [^112h8B6T] [^116pF5Jz].
- **ARDS**: Albumin with diuretics improves oxygenation and reduces pulmonary edema [^112WeLYB] [^111JNNnk].
- **Burns**: Albumin reduces resuscitation volume and improves hemodynamics [^112Pjx8P] [^112oWTSw].

---

## Limitations and risks of albumin administration

- **Fluid overload**: Risk of pulmonary edema, especially in heart failure or renal impairment [^112N9Sqj] [^114h6xpq].
- **Cost**: Expensive compared to crystalloids; use should be judicious [^115VYHyv] [^114gd531].
- **Limited benefit**: No clear benefit in normal albumin states (e.g. heart failure) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Cirrhosis**: Albumin recommended for large-volume paracentesis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^116A3Q1P] [^112pdkH7].
- **ARDS**: Consider albumin with diuretics in hypoalbuminemic patients [^113UPeAa].
- **Burns**: Consider albumin in large burns to reduce resuscitation volume [^112Pjx8P] [^117M7gCA].

Albumin helps edema by **increasing oncotic pressure**, expanding plasma volume, and enhancing diuretic responsiveness in hypoalbuminemic patients. It is most useful in nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, ARDS, and burns, but carries risks of fluid overload and high cost, so patient selection and monitoring are critical [^115VYHyv].

American Burn Association burn shock resuscitation — scientific background highlights that following thermal injury involving greater than 20% of the TBSA, intravascular volume depletion and edema threaten perfusion, and recognition of "fluid creep" over 2 decades ago underscored that provision of excessive resuscitation fluid leads to increased morbidity and mortality in major burn patients. Both historically and currently, urinary output (UOP) has been the primary guide to the titration of resuscitation fluids, though alternative approaches using malperfusion markers, hemodynamic endpoints, or algorithm-based and computer supported decisions have been considered. Virtually all resuscitation formulae specify that colloids should be started at some point during resuscitation; albumin data suggest that early addition of albumin reduces total resuscitation volumes, while two study level meta-analyses of the 4 RCTs found no effect of albumin on mortality and reports note no effect of albumin on compartment syndrome development, renal function, or respiratory complications. For adjuncts, in humans the infusion 66 mg/kg/hour of ascorbic acid has been examined with mixed findings regarding reduction in resuscitation fluid volumes, and concerns have been raised about a possible association with oxalate nephropathy and development of AKI.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^112Pjx8P]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation — albumin administration in adults with major burns is addressed as follows: We recommend that clinicians consider providing albumin in the first 24 hours of resuscitation to improve urinary output and to reduce the total volume of resuscitation fluids. The strength of this recommendation is greater for patients with larger burns, and weaker for patients with smaller burns. We also recommend administration of albumin in "rescue" situations where resuscitation is deteriorating despite receiving escalating amounts of crystalloids. We have low confidence in the strength of the limited available evidence to make any recommendations on the use of albumin to limit edema-related complications. Question 2: Among adults with burns ≥ 20% TBSA should albumin be initiated early (< 12 hours post burn) or late (after 12 hours post burn) during acute fluid resuscitation to (a) reduce total fluid resuscitation volume or total crystalloid resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours post burn, (b) increase urine output, or (c) decrease edema-related complications. We identified only one study that met criteria for inclusion by addressing the PICO question of administering albumin "early" (< 12 hours) vs "late" (> 12 hours). Patients who received albumin < 12 hours (N = 118) had significantly larger and deeper burns than those who received albumin later (N = 135). There was also a critical difference between those 2 groups; up to the point when albumin was initiated, those that received early albumin had been administered significantly more crystalloids and had a significantly higher in-to-out (I: O) ratio than those who were given albumin late. Thus, this study cannot answer the question of early versus late albumin with respect to any of our specified outcomes. However, one finding using a linear mixed effect model did show a faster rate of decline in fluids if albumin is given compared to not giving it (point estimate −29.52, 95% CI, −24.21 to −34.83, p < .001). Thus, one might hypothesize that the sooner albumin is administered, the faster the fluid infusion rate will decline, potentially leading to less fluid administration. This is theoretical, and no firm conclusion can be reached about the effects of earlier versus later albumin administration from the ABRUPT study.

### Why Do the mechanistic actions of albumin not translate into tangible clinical benefits? [^111qMbfm]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Albumin has only reduced crude mortality in one randomized controlled trial conducted to date. This raises the question as to why potentially beneficial oncotic and pleiotropic properties of albumin do not consistently translate into clinically important outcomes. Four postulated explanations are provided as to why the theoretical advantages of albumin are not apparent in clinical trials: diminished oncotic action due to leakage of albumin from the intravascular compartment, modification of the pleiotropic properties of albumin both in vitro and in vivo, the ability of other plasma proteins to take over the major functions of albumin, and possible adverse effects.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^112pdkH7]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ascites, more specifically with respect to intravenous albumin, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to administer infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3 in patients with SBP and increased serum creatinine or rising serum creatinine.

### A review of the use of human albumin in burn patients [^115neF67]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

This review article examines the use of human albumin (HA) in burn treatment. Generally, there are two scenarios where HA may be administered: acutely as a volume expander during burn shock resuscitation and chronically following resuscitation to correct hypoalbuminemia. Although colloids were the cornerstone of the earliest burn resuscitation formulas, HA was in fact rarely used. More recently however, with the recognition of fluid creep, HA usage during resuscitation has increased. Animal studies demonstrate that during acute fluid resuscitation, administration of colloids, including albumin (ALB), have no ability to arrest the formation of burn wound edema, but they do reduce edema formation in the nonburn soft tissues and help preserve intravascular volume and reduce resuscitation fluid requirements with no apparent increase in extravascular water accumulation in the lung. Human studies suggest that immediate use of ALB during acute resuscitation achieves adequate resuscitation using a lower total overall volume requirement, transiently provides better maintenance of intravascular volume and cardiac output, produces less overall edema gain than crystalloid resuscitation alone but may be associated with increased extravascular lung water accumulation during the first postburn week. However, many questions remain unanswered, and modern, large-scale prospective studies are desperately needed. Maintenance of normal serum ALB levels through continuous supplementation of HA following burn resuscitation is even less well understood. Although this approach makes physiologic sense, the limited amount of available data from human burn studies reveal that chronic ALB supplementation is expensive and may not result in any major clinical benefits. Again, modernized prospective studies are greatly needed in this area.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^113UPeAa]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of albumin administration may also depend on the simultaneous use of diuretics to prevent an albumin infusion-induced increase in hydrostatic pressure, which may increase (rather than decrease) edema formation. Some studies have suggested that the concurrent use of albumin may increase furosemide-induced diuresis in hypooncotic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury and cirrhosis-induced ascites, although not in all critically ill patients; whether this strategy has any effect on patient-centered clinical outcomes is unclear.

In 1999 Sort and colleagues published the results of a RCT in 126 patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis comparing treatment with intravenous cefotaxime or cefotaxime plus intravenous albumin for plasma volume expansion. Renal impairment developed in fewer patients in the patients who received albumin (P = 0.002) and these patients also had reduced hospital and 3-month mortality rates (both P = 0.01). A more recent RCT reported beneficial effects of albumin plus antibiotic on renal and circulatory function in 110 patients with cirrhosis and infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; treatment with albumin was an independent predictive factor of survival. A meta-analysis of 16 RCTs also suggested that albumin use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.86) and renal impairment (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.75) in patients with cirrhosis and any infection. Two small RCTs have also demonstrated improved renal function in patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome treated with albumin and terlipressin.

Diuretics

Diuretics should be used with caution and only in the case of intravascular fluid overload (as evidenced by good peripheral perfusion and high blood pressure), because they could induce or increase hypovolaemia and promote thrombosis (Box 4). In most children with CNS, diuretics improve oedema and fluid control and enable fluid administration to provide adequate nutrition, especially when given in conjunction with albumin infusions. We recommend considering an intravenous bolus of furosemide (0.5–2 mg/kg) at the end of each albumin infusion, in the absence of marked hypovolaemia and/or hyponatraemia.

In patients with severe oedema, we recommend commencing furosemide at 0.5–2 mg/kg per dose intravenously or orally up to six times daily (maximum 10 mg/kg per day) based on the degree of oedema and diuresis achieved. Adequate monitoring is required and should involve assessment of fluid status, electrolytes (the presence of hypokalaemia or hyponatraemia), blood pressure and kidney function (diuresis and estimated glomerular filtration rate). High doses of furosemide (> 6 mg/kg/day) should not be given for periods longer than 1 week and infusions should be administered over 5–30 min to avoid hearing loss –. Furosemide must be stopped in the case of anuria.

In stable patients, furosemide can be given orally at doses of 2–5 mg/kg per day in combination with a thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretic with appropriate monitoring. Experimental evidence suggests that proteases in the urine, such as plasmin, directly activate the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and thus contribute to salt retention and formation of oedema in patients with nephrotic syndrome. As this direct activation of ENaC is independent of the mineralocorticoid receptor, it will not be inhibited by mineralocorticoid receptor blockers such as spironolactone. Therefore, if potassium-sparing diuretics are used, blockers of the ENaC, such as amiloride, are preferable to spironolactone.

### Fluid administration and monitoring in ARDS: which management? [^112WeLYB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Modalities of fluid management in patients sustaining the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are challenging and controversial. Optimal fluid management should provide adequate oxygen delivery to the body, while avoiding inadvertent increase in lung edema which further impairs gas exchange. In ARDS patients, positive fluid balance has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stay, and higher mortality. Accordingly, a restrictive strategy has been compared to a more liberal approach in randomized controlled trials conducted in various clinical settings. Restrictive strategies included fluid restriction guided by the monitoring of extravascular lung water, pulmonary capillary wedge or central venous pressure, and furosemide targeted to diuresis and/or albumin replacement in hypoproteinemic patients. Overall, restrictive strategies improved oxygenation significantly and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, but had no significant effect on mortality. Fluid management may require different approaches depending on the time course of ARDS (i.e., early vs. late period). The effects of fluid strategy management according to ARDS phenotypes remain to be evaluated. Since ARDS is frequently associated with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure, the prediction of fluid responsiveness is crucial in these patients to avoid hemodynamically inefficient-hence respiratory detrimental-fluid administration. Specific hemodynamic indices of fluid responsiveness or mini-fluid challenges should be preferably used. Since the positive airway pressure contributes to positive fluid balance in ventilated ARDS patients, it should be kept as low as possible. As soon as the hemodynamic status is stabilized, correction of cumulated fluid retention may rely on diuretics administration or renal replacement therapy.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^1168yVYi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and hepatorenal syndrome–AKI (HRS-AKI) — albumin and vasoactive therapy: Best Practice Advice 8 states that IV albumin is the volume expander of choice in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites presenting with AKI, and for those with intravascular volume depletion current recommendations include a trial of volume expansion with albumin at a dose of 1 g/kg of body weight daily for 2 consecutive days (with a cap of 100 g/d); lack of response to albumin is one of the diagnostic criteria of HRS-AKI, and fixed dosing may be insufficient or cause volume overload and complications such as pulmonary edema; Best Practice Advice 9 specifies that vasoactive drugs (terlipressin, norepinephrine (NE), or combination of octreotide/midodrine) should be used in the treatment of HRS-AKI but not in other forms of AKI in cirrhosis, and among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and AKI, between 15% and 43% have HRS-AKI.

### The added-up albumin enhances the diuretic effect of furosemide in patients with hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled study [^116bZfeW]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The potential effect of the combination of furosemide and albumin is still controversial. Fliser et al. have found that the effect of the combination of furosemide and albumin can significantly, but modestly increase urine output and sodium excretion in nephrotic syndrome patients. In contrast, others failed to demonstrate this effect. In studies of hypoalbuminemic cirrhotic patients, one study has shown the benefit of the combination while others have shown no significant differences in water and sodium excretion between furosemide alone and the combination of furosemide plus albumin.

Although there is a common usage of the combination of furosemide and albumin in hypoalbuminemic patients in clinical practice, whether there is any significant benefit of this combination for the treatment of edema in hypoalbuminemic patients especially in patients with chronic kidney disease is still unknown. Due to the high price of albumin and allergic reactions which can occur to it, we conducted a randomized controlled crossover study to compare the efficacy of diuresis between furosemide alone and the combination of furosemide plus albumin for the treatment of edema in stable hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease patients by measuring urine output and urine sodium.

Subjects and methods

Subjects

Twenty-four patients with stable chronic kidney disease (no fluctuation of GFR > 10% in two months) who presented with edema (pretibial pitting edema from physical examination) and low serum albumin were enrolled in this study. CKD patients were defined as patients who have GFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² and low serum albumin was defined as serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL. Exclusion criteria were patients with GFR < 10 mL/min per 1.73 m², heavy proteinuria (24-hour urine protein > 3.5 g/d), critically ill patients such as congestive heart failure, acute renal failure, shock, on respirator and/or previous history of furosemide usage within two weeks. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Studies at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand (ID 06–52–18). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The study protocol was also registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registration (ANZCTR 12611000480987).

### Blood volume and hemodynamics during treatment of major hemorrhage with ringer solution, 5% albumin, and 20% albumin: a single-center randomized controlled trial [^11176k9G]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of major hemorrhage is a challenge for the clinician whenever it occurs in the prehospital setting, in the operating theatre, and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although blood transfusion is preferred in uncontrolled hemorrhage (trauma patients), hemorrhage in better controlled environments is treated with "clear fluids" until a pre-specified blood hemoglobin level ("transfusion trigger") is reached. Intravenous fluid administration during surgery should still be planned to maintain normovolemia and adequate hemodynamics. However, fluid management is more challenging than in the awake state, as general anesthesia obtunds the body´s ability to correct both fluid overload and hypovolemia; the diuretic response to infused fluid is only 10–15% of normal and the depressive effect of intravenous and volatile anesthetics on lymphatic pumping promotes hypovolemia and decreases the ability to compensate hypovolemia by capillary refill.

Therefore, well-performed fluid therapy requires knowledge about both the hemodynamic adaptation to general anesthesia and to the blood volume (BV) expanding properties of available fluids in scenarios where surgery is associated with major hemorrhage.

Animal models provided evidence in understanding the mechanistic effect of fluid administration in hypovolemic shock. However, quite few randomized studies compare the clinical efficacy of crystalloid and colloids fluid during major hemorrhage in humans, and they have usually been focused on trauma cases. Because crystalloids quickly equilibrate between the intravascular and interstitial volume, very large fluid volumes are needed if only crystalloid fluids are used, which increases the risk of overfilling the patients, raising complications like pulmonary edema, re-bleeding due to dilution effect, and poor healing. Smaller volumes are believed to be needed when colloid fluids are used, which is due to their different pharmacokinetic profile. Dextran and hydroxyethyl starch have left the market, leaving albumin as the colloid fluid of choice in the ICU and in the perioperative setting, but its documentation is mainly based on old literature. The hyperoncotic 20% albumin is known to offer strong plasma volume expansion (PVE) per infused volume, being approximately twice the infused volume, in volunteers and during surgery with minor hemorrhage. However, the efficacy of albumin solutions during major surgery has been questioned based on the belief that the capillary leakage rate is markedly increased by shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx layer.

### Albumin infusion rate and plasma volume expansion: a randomized clinical trial in postoperative patients after major surgery [^115Qdx89]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Major surgery initiates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome which disrupts the normal regulation of transcapillary fluid exchange and may induce tissue edema and hypovolemia. Fluid replacement is therefore a cornerstone in the perioperative treatment of these patients as well as in patients suffering from increased vascular leakage of other etiologies. Although fluid therapy is life-saving, it is also associated with side effects such as further edema formation and compartment syndromes which may adversely affect the outcome.

From a clinical perspective, it is therefore important that fluid administered to counteract hypovolemia is retained intravascularly as much as possible. Colloids are macromolecules for which the vessel wall has a low permeability, and less volume is required for an equal plasma volume expansion compared to crystalloids. However, extravasation of colloids is not only a function of the vessel wall permeability but is also dependent on the volume of fluid that is filtered across the capillary wall, which in turn depends on the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure. This indicates that infusion rate may influence extravasation of colloids by effects on hydrostatic pressure, but the importance of such an effect on plasma volume expansion by a colloid is unclear. The hypothesis is supported by studies in rodent models of sepsis showing that plasma volume expansion in experimental sepsis is greater after a slow infusion compared to a rapid infusion of the same volume of colloid. In contrast, no effect of a high infusion rate on extravasation of albumin could be demonstrated in porcine endotoxemia.

### Fluid management of the neurological patient: a concise review [^115PKeQr]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Maintenance fluids: which ones?

A recent review summarized current knowledge on risks and benefits of different types of fluids that are used in traumatic brain injuries, and therefore this will not be dealt with in depth here. Some key points regarding the fluid compounds in brain-injured patients are as follows: (1) isotonic fluids are the mainstay of maintenance fluid therapy; (2) synthetic colloids may be harmful after SAH and have not been thoroughly investigated in TBI; (3) contrasting evidence on albumin exists in TBI — its use has been associated with both harm (SAFE study) and benefit, but consensus exists that it should generally not be used in TBI and in SAH there is currently insufficient evidence on definite benefit from albumin; (4) in SAH, standard fluid management with saline may have alternatives with more balanced solutions resulting in more stabile electrolytes, less fluid intake and less activation of the pituitary axis stress hormones (cortisol, TSH); and (5) sodium lactate may hold promise as an alternative fluid to saline solutions in routine fluid management in severe TBI because a recent pilot RCT showed improved ICP control, better electrolyte profile and decreased fluid intake, and its use may have interesting metabolic benefits for the injured brain and its susceptibility to secondary injuries. Of note with regard to the SAFE study, equipoise exists regarding whether the adverse effects of albumin on ICP were related to the relative hypotonicity of the 5% solution or leakage of albumin through a disrupted BBB creating oncotic shifts that promote oedema.

### Hypovolemia with peripheral edema: what is wrong? [^114Unsoc]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinician is frequently confronted with the combination of hypovolemia and peripheral edema. In healthy humans, compensatory mechanisms including lymphatic return of extravascular fluid and transcapillary Starling forces act in concert to attenuate edema by increasing plasma volume. When this does not occur, treatment is a challenge, as administration of a diuretic will likely worsen hypovolemia and cause hypotension, while fluid administration worsens the edema. The most common explanation of this confusing condition is that capillary permeability has increased due to damage to the endothelial glycocalyx layer. However, increased capillary leakage normally accelerates lymphatic flow which normalizes the balance between the body fluid volumes, and might even increase the plasma albumin concentration ("interstitial washdown").

This paper discusses how inflammatory insults and certain drugs may disturb the normal exchange of infused crystalloid fluid between the plasma and the interstitial space by mechanisms other than increased capillary leakage. Our review focuses on the possibility that decreased lymphatic return of fluid and protein alone can create hypovolemia, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema. The pathophysiology responsible for poor lymphatic return might involve a reduction of the interstitial hydrostatic pressure (P i) or failure of the intrinsic contractility of lymphatic smooth muscle cells. These mechanisms are distinctly different from lymphatic obstruction due to tumors, compression during compartment syndromes and resistance to thoracic duct outflow.

Regarding medical management for hepatorenal syndrome, more specifically with respect to intravenous albumin, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to administer albumin solution (20%) at the dose 20–40 g/day. Consider obtaining serial measurements of central venous pressure or other measures of assessing central blood volume, apart from routine monitoring, to prevent circulatory overload by optimizing the fluid balance and titrating the albumin dose.

### The evidence for small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin in critical illness [^116mwa5v]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Small-volume resuscitation of critically ill patients with hyperoncotic albumin offers a number of theoretical advantages, such as increasing intravascular volume in excess of the volume of fluid administered and reducing interstitial edema. Whilst iso-oncotic albumin has been shown to be equi-effective to isotonic saline for the resuscitation of critically ill patients without associated traumatic brain injury, the efficacy of hyperoncotic albumin for resuscitation has not been evaluated in large-scale randomized-controlled trials. Overall, the evidence for resuscitation with hyper-oncotic albumin is limited by studies of poor methodological quality with heterogenous study populations and control regimens. There is marginal qualitative evidence of improvements in surrogate outcomes in disparate patient populations, but no evidence of any survival benefit associated with resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin. Given the lack of evidence and clinical uncertainty about the efficacy of hyperoncotic albumin, a large-scale randomized-controlled trial is required to determine its role in the acute resuscitation of hypovolemic or hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients.

Recommendations and conclusions

Many changes within intensive care medicine have come as the result of the realization that traditional practices once thought to be therapeutic were in fact detrimental. Human albumin solutions have been available for almost 60 years and provide effective resuscitation with less fluid required than for crystalloid solutions; for many years, however, albumin was widely and perhaps nondiscriminantly used as a resuscitation fluid with little realization that it may not be appropriate in all patients. Although criticized for its methodology and the heterogeneity of the studies included, the 1998 Cochrane meta-analysis brought this possibility to the attention of the wider community and stimulated the conduct of large, multicenter RCTs. As the results of these studies become available, the role of albumin in today's critical care unit is becoming clearer and several recommendations can be made:

- Albumin administration, although unlikely to cause harm in most patients, is not necessary in all critically ill patients and should be reserved for use in specific groups of patients in whom there is evidence of benefit.

- A hypotonic albumin solution should be avoided as a resuscitation fluid in patients with traumatic brain injury, based on the results of the SAFE subgroup analysis.

- There is now enough evidence – albeit largely from subgroup analyses – and plausible biological rationale to support use of albumin in patients with septic shock when a colloid is considered.

- Albumin administration should be considered in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but possibly also other infections; in hypooncotic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome; and also in patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome.

Future research should be focused on patients who are most likely to benefit from albumin administration in whom the evidence is inadequate or controversial because of conflicting study results. In addition to observational cohort studies and RCTs focusing on specific patient groups, mechanistic studies are necessary to further elucidate the molecular and physiologic rationale for the beneficial effects of albumin and explore how albumin's pleiotropic actions may be important in specific groups of critically ill patients. Such studies also need to better elucidate the mechanisms of development of hypoalbuminemia. Studies also need to clarify issues of dosage and appropriate targets and whether different albumin solutions have unique differential effects on patients' responses and outcomes to albumin administration. The effects of albumin infusions on drug (especially antimicrobial) dosing also need clarification.

### Rational use of human albumin: plan-do-check-act cycle in clinical practice [^114gd531]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2025). High credibility.

Albumin is primarily used for plasma volume replacement or to correct hypoalbuminaemia, and it may alleviate oedema associated with hypoalbuminaemia by increasing colloid osmotic pressure and producing a diuretic effect. Based on the current evidence, using HA to increase serum albumin concentrations to achieve the normal range is not recommended in patients with hypoalbuminaemia, and from a clinical standpoint, correcting albumin based on fluid status is more important than achieving target albumin levels; concurrently, the potential cause of hypoalbuminaemia ought to be determined, as hypoalbuminaemia is not a disease itself, but rather a symptom of an underlying disease.

HA is one of the most highly anticipated therapeutic interventions in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and a large number of randomised controlled trials have shown HA to be effective in preventing or treating some complications of cirrhosis (such as ascites). However, when HA is used for other conditions, if the primary disease cannot be treated, it might also fail to reduce the incidence of complications or improve clinical prognosis.HA is an expensive agent and unnecessary for many patients. First, in the physiological conditions, albumin synthesis involves only 20%–30% of hepatocytes, and it indicated that most patients with hypoalbuminaemia still have a large functional reserve. Similarly, Berg et al demonstrated that patients with reduced postoperative albumin do not require HA infusion as their albumin levels usually recover around 7 days postoperatively. Second, compared with the crystalline solutions, HA is costlier, and as a blood product it carries certain risks, including an increase in transfusion-mediated allergic reactions and disease transmission, which means it should be used with more caution in clinical settings; therefore, in many situations, although HA is available, it is not the first choice.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — algorithmic management begins with an "Acute increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL", after which stage 1 is split into "AKI 1a: creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL" and "AKI 1b: creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL", and "AKI 2–3" represents higher-stage disease; initial stage 1 care is "Risk factor management*: monitor 48 hours", while persistent cases and higher stages receive "Risk factors management* Albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". Nonresolution prompts "Urinary biomarkers" to triage to "Consistent with ATN", for which the action box states "Renal replacement therapy on individualized basis", or "Consistent with HRS", for which the action box states "Vasoconstrictor therapy + albumin". The legend clarifies that "Initial management of AKI (increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours) is geared toward reversing risk factors", and that "When the serum creatinine has increased > 1.5mg/dL (Stage 1b), or to ≥ 2 times baseline value (stage 2; stage 3 when serum creatinine has increased > 3 times baseline value) and remains above these levels despite risk factor management for 2 days, then vasoconstrictor agents are indicated provided patient meets HRS criteria"; it also defines response thresholds: "Complete response to therapy is defined return of the serum creatinine with treatment to < 0.3 mg above baseline value; partial response is defined as reduction in serum creatinine but to > 0.3 mg above baseline value". Risk factor management "involves holding diuretics, beta-blockers, and nephrotoxic drugs and discontinuing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) agents; treating infections and other precipitating causes; and expanding plasma volume as required", and "Careful monitoring for fluid overload is required when albumin is administered in patients with AKI because of the risk of pulmonary edema".

Cerebral edema — evidence quality and research priorities — "Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials", and "The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments". Accordingly, "There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema". Research goals "should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures", and efforts "should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on clinical outcomes".

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113vmt6N]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

In acute wounds or infected areas, repair is stimulated by proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, and visible wound edema occurs due to expansion of the interstitial space (Figure 1). Both phases of cytokine and growth factor expression support different inflammatory processes. In the initial proinflammatory phase, the affected area is prepared for repair via removing debris by macrophages, promoting angiogenesis, and increasing permeability. In this phase, there is a preponderance of Th1 helper cell–induced cytokine and growth factor release. Importantly, debris and products of damage or infection are cleared, preparing the affected areas for repair. In the subsequent anti‐inflammatory phase, healing mechanisms prevail with important stimulatory roles for Th2 helper cell activity. When this phase is successful, inflammation has been shown to resolve slowly in the course of months, promoted at least in part by lipid‐derived mediators. 11 From the start of the insult, platelet‐derived growth factor in acute wounds and interleukin (IL)‐6 and nitric oxide (NO)‐induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in all other inflammatory states are highly expressed (Table 1). They induce an increase of capillary permeability and angiogenesis, in turn promoting entry of cells and plasma solutes, such as albumin, fibrinogen, immunoglobulins, electrolytes, and nutrients into wounds and growing tissues. Other sites (muscle and adipose tissue in collaboration with the liver and, possibly, the kidney 12) release these solutes into the vascular compartment from where they enter the extravascular extracellular compartment (interstitium) at increased rates, also facilitated by the increased capillary permeability. 4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 The interstitial space, plasma volume, and cell mass constitute the distribution volume of several solutes including serum albumin, as well as other proteins and electrolytes. Due to cycling of these substrates between these spaces, their expansion has a lowering effect on substrate concentrations. Immune cells and platelets swell in sepsis, but not much is known regarding myocytes, adipocytes, hepatocytes, etc. However, abundant clinical evidence exists showing that after severe trauma or sepsis, fat‐fee mass increases 5–15 liters or even more. 4 Total and extracellular water, sodium, and chloride content of muscle have been found to increase after injury, and despite nutrition, while muscle potassium and magnesium decrease. 18, 19 In studies in patients with liver cirrhosis, decreased total body potassium and creatinine excretion were found, correlating with the results of bioelectrical impedance analysis, while body weights were relatively well preserved due to water retention. 20

Albumin infusions

The use of albumin infusions in children with CNS varies between centres. Some centres administer intravenous albumin only when deemed clinically indicated, whereas others use regular albumin infusion protocols (1–4 g/kg/day). Potential advantages of regular albumin infusions are replacement of lost protein to support growth and psychomotor development, stabilization of intravascular volume and minimization of oedema. The disadvantages of regular albumin infusions are the need for a central line, which increases the risk of infection and/or thrombosis of large vessels, which endangers future haemodialysis access, the need for prolonged hospitalization (although home administration has been reported) and the associated costs. Retrospective studies show no difference in long-term outcomes with these two strategies. As most of the infused albumin is lost in the urine within hours, the purpose of albumin infusion is not to normalize serum albumin levels but to support intravascular volume and reduce extravascular fluid retention in patients with symptomatic hypovolaemia. Symptoms that are suggestive of hypovolaemia are prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria and abdominal discomfort. Impacts on quality of life and school attendance should be taken into account when considering regular albumin infusions.

We acknowledge that some children with no or minimal symptoms do well without regular albumin infusions and do not need a CVL. Others may need frequent albumin infusions to prevent the clinical consequences of hypovolaemia and failure to thrive. In the latter, we recommend basing the frequency and dosage of albumin infusion on the clinical indicators of hypovolaemia listed above, rather than on serum albumin levels. In patients with severe disease, daily albumin infusions of up to 1–4 g/kg may be initiated. In stable patients or when CKD progresses, albumin dose may be reduced and infusions might subsequently be made less frequent or even stopped.

Vascular access

When possible, we recommend avoiding CVLs in children with CNS owing to the high risk of thrombosis and the need to preserve the vasculature for future haemodialysis access. However, when regular albumin infusions are inevitable, a CVL becomes necessary. In such cases we recommend administering prophylactic anticoagulation for as long as the line is in place (discussed further below). We also recommend avoiding peripherally inserted catheters and unnecessary venepunctures to preserve arteries and veins for the potential future creation of arteriovenous fistulae.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111nSY5Z]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

The Pathophysiology Underlying Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia is largely a function of increased vascular permeability and increased interstitial volume. In this section we will discuss the role of inflammation in mediating these responses, not only in pathologic states, but also in life events such as pregnancy, lactation, and cancer growth.

Inflammation, Increased Capillary Permeability, and Hypoalbuminemia

Increased vascular permeability for cells and plasma solutes is a universal reaction in trauma, critical illness, chronic disease, life events, multiple or isolated organ failure, and cancer. This response is evident in circumstances including edema in healing wounds and the necessity to maintain intravascular volume by "overhydrating" traumatized or postsurgery patients. Adequately resuscitated patients are maintained in a positive fluid balance of 5–10 liters after clean elective major surgery or other types of trauma. 4 Fluid resuscitation is necessary in these circumstances to avoid hypovolemia and the development of shock. The same happens in children after burns, where fluid balance is positive despite the effort to prevent overhydration. 5 The fact that fluid retention inevitably and visibly occurs in wounds as well as at the whole‐body level after trauma and burns could reflect that this response is beneficial to some extent, but may become harmful when the inflammatory stimulus cannot be adequately overcome or treated. 6, 7 In wounds, virtually every type of immune cell appears, producing cytokines and growth factors that support the healing process. Increased cytokine expression does not only happen after trauma or infection, but also in physiologic states including pregnancy and other situations where increased cell proliferation and matrix deposition are required. 8, 9, 10

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^115ZRFs4]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The impact of cerebral edema on outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was investigated in 374 patients. In a multivariate analysis assessing 16 significant univariate predictors, cerebral edema demonstrated by computed tomography was an independent risk factor both for death (odds ratio 2.5; CI 1.1 to 5.6) and for either death or severe disability (odds ratio 2.5; CI 1.2 to 5.4). Severe disability was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of > 3. These observations support a causal role for cerebral edema in producing poor outcomes and prompted the investigators to conclude: 'Critical care management strategies that minimize edema formation after SAH may improve outcome'. Similarly, in a prospective study of 113 non-traumatic SAH patients evaluated by comprehensive neuropsychological testing at 3 months, cerebral edema was an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment.

Hyperoncotic albumin may be of particular clinical value in edematous states such as those encountered in liver disease, high-risk neonates, brain injury and nephrotic syndrome (Table 3). While edema may pose problems in sepsis as well, this review suggested advantages of HES over albumin in sepsis, e.g. higher cardiac index and oxygenation. However, follow-up in all the included sepsis trials was only 5 days. With follow-up of 30 days or longer HES has been shown in randomized trials to increase the incidence of acute renal failure among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Hyperoncotic albumin displays protective effects on the kidney and hence would likely offer a safer fluid management alternative than HES in sepsis.

The randomized trial evidence showing the capacity of hyperoncotic albumin to reduce edema is supplemented by non-randomized clinical studies and animal models in the areas of high-risk neonates, brain injury and nephrotic syndrome. Among 10 normotensive premature infants with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome, 20% albumin reduced body weight (p < 0.01), indicating lessened edema, and improved urine output (p < 0.05) within 6 h.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^111JNNnk]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

1.1 Hypovolemia

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% is indicated in the emergency treatment of hypovolemia with or without shock. Its effectiveness in reversing hypovolemia depends largely upon its ability to draw interstitial fluid into the circulation. It is most effective in patients who are well hydrated. When blood volume deficit is the result of hemorrhage, compatible red blood cells or whole blood should be administered as quickly as possible. [1, 2]

When hypovolemia is long standing and hypoalbuminemia exists accompanied by adequate hydration or edema, 20% - 25% albumin solutions should be used. [1]

1.2 Hypoalbuminemia

For subjects with hypoalbuminemia who are critically ill and/or are bleeding actively, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions may be indicated. [3] When albumin deficit is the result of excessive protein loss, the effect of administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% will be temporary unless the underlying disorder is reversed.

1.3 Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used to maintain cardiovascular function following the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites. [2]

1.4 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used as a plasma expander in fluid management relating to severe forms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). [7, 8]

1.5 Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions may be indicated in conjunction with diuretics to correct the fluid volume overload associated with ARDS. [5]

1.6 Acute Nephrosis (Treatment Adjunct)

### Albumin rather than C-reactive protein may be valuable in predicting and monitoring the severity and course of acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients with or at risk for the syndrome after new onset fever [^112KY5LA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Therefore, the search for accurate biomarkers reflecting the severity and course of alveolocapillary inflammation and increased permeability underlying the non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema of ARDS is ongoing. We and others described that circulating albumin levels, in cross-sectional studies, inversely relates to increased alveolocapillary permeability and that hypoalbuminemia predict ARDS and edema formation in at risk patients. Extravasation of albumin following increased permeability lowers albumin levels and the resultant low plasma colloid osmotic pressure promotes edema formation. Inflammation and injury markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) have been suggested to help predict early onset ARDS and its outcome in cross-sectional studies. Since both clinical classifications systems allow coincident ARDS and hydrostatic edema, inflammatory markers such as CRP may be of value in separating non-hydrostatic from hydrostatic edema. Meduri et al. showed a decline in CRP and LIS in early ARDS patients responding to corticosteroids. However, the ARDS monitoring value of these routine biochemical markers, often available on a daily basis in the intensive care unit (ICU), is unknown. Associations with the severity and course of ARDS, if any, could be of value in monitoring and therefore in the management of the syndrome at the bedside.

The aim of the present study is to determine whether albumin, CRP and LDH levels are associated with the severity and course of ARDS in critically ill patients after new onset fever with or considered at risk for the syndrome defined by the Berlin and the LIS criteria. The hypothesis was that decreasing albumin and increasing CRP and LDH reflect, accurately enough for clinical use, increasing severity of ARDS if judged by both clinical classification systems. Indeed, we reasoned that the overlap of systems would be a better reference standard for potential biomarkers than either system alone.

### High-dose albumin treatment for acute ischaemic stroke (ALIAS) part 2: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial [^114Mm3zs]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

In animal models of ischaemic stroke, 25% albumin reduced brain infarction and improved neurobehavioural outcome. In a pilot clinical trial, albumin doses as high as 2 g/kg were safely tolerated. We aimed to assess whether albumin given within 5 h of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke increased the proportion of patients with a favourable outcome.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial between Feb 27, 2009, and Sept 10, 2012, at 69 sites in the USA, 13 sites in Canada, two sites in Finland, and five sites in Israel. Patients aged 18–83 years with ischaemic (ie, non-haemorrhagic) stroke with a baseline National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score of 6 or more who could be treated within 5 h of onset were randomly assigned (1:1), via a central web-based randomisation process with a biased coin minimisation approach, to receive 25% albumin (2 g [8 mL] per kg; maximum dose 750 mL) or the equivalent volume of isotonic saline. All study personnel and participants were masked to the identity of the study drug. The primary endpoint was favourable outcome, defined as either a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1, or an NIHSS score of 0 or 1, or both, at 90 days. Analysis was by intention to treat. Thrombolytic therapies were permitted. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00235495.

Findings

422 participants were randomly assigned to receive albumin and 419 to receive saline. On Sept 12, 2012, the trial was stopped early for futility (n = 841). The primary outcome did not differ between patients in the albumin group and those in the saline group (186 [44%] vs 185 [44%]; risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.84–1.10, adjusted for baseline NIHSS score and thrombolysis stratum). Mild-to-moderate pulmonary oedema was more common in patients given albumin than in those given saline (54 [13%] of 412 vs 5 [1%] of 412 patients); symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 24 h was also more common in patients in the albumin group than in the placebo group (17 [4%] of 415 vs 7 [2%] of 414 patients). Although the rate of favourable outcome in patients given albumin remained consistent at 44–45% over the course of the trial, the cumulative rate of favourable outcome in patients given saline rose steadily from 31% to 44%.

Interpretation

Our findings show no clinical benefit of 25% albumin in patients with ischaemic stroke; however, they should not discourage further efforts to identify effective strategies to protect the ischaemic brain, especially because of preclinical literature showing convincing proof-of-principle for the possibility of this outcome.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^117M7gCA]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation — albumin versus crystalloid in adults with large burns is assessed among adults with burns ≥ 20% total body surface area (TBSA) during the first 24 hours to evaluate effects on resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours, urine output (UOP), and edema-related complications. In nonrescue comparisons, two high-strength studies and 2 low-strength studies showed either a significant decrease or a trend to lower resuscitation volume with albumin compared to crystalloid alone, whereas most rescue studies found higher volumes with albumin; in rescue studies, patients were generally sicker, had bigger and/or deeper burns, and were already receiving large amounts of crystalloids, potentially influencing outcomes. Across rescue situations, three studies observed that initiation of albumin rapidly lowered the in-to-out (I:O) ratio, suggesting that albumin appears to have a fluid-sparing effect. For UOP, one high strength study showed a tendency to higher UOP in albumin-treated patients, but most studies did not directly examine or report this variable. Edema-related findings were mixed: a predetermined-use, high-strength study found pulmonary edema significantly worsened over the first post burn week in albumin-treated patients; another rescue study saw no respiratory compromise with colloids compared to crystalloid alone; and one meta-analysis found a lower odds of abdominal compartment syndrome with albumin infusion but pooled heterogeneous study types. Mortality was not evaluated due to underpowered and heterogeneous crystalloid-versus-colloid evidence, and larger high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed (e.g. ABRUPT 2, NCT03456859).

Management of hormone-related swelling and edema for palliation and at the end of life

Swelling and edema in patients with NETs may be related to uncontrolled hormonal secretion (VVinik et al. 2000). Still, other causes should be considered, including hypoalbuminemia status due to malabsorption, volume overload related to advanced carcinoid heart disease, and venous compression due to bulky retroperitoneal nodes. Ascertainment of the correct diagnosis is critical for optimal management. Diagnostic investigations include albumin/pre-albumin level, 5-HIAA, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, (NT-proBNP), serum serotonin, cardiac echocardiogram with a careful view of tricuspid and pulmonary valves and multiphase CT of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out venous compression. If an uncontrolled carcinoid heart disease is suspected, judicious use of diuretics is recommended as right-sided heart failure is a pre-load dependent state, and patients are at risk of hypotension. Cardiology consultation should be considered.

Edema and swelling-related hormonal excess may occur in the setting of progressive or increasingly functional tumors, and medical management should be maximized if tumor debulking with surgery or liver-directed therapy is not possible. Dose escalation of long-acting SSA therapy has been shown to improve symptom control and is an appropriate first-line therapy, as is the use of short-acting octreotide. Use of the telotristat which improves carcinoid syndrome-related diarrhea is also helpful in a significant reduction in other carcinoid syndrome symptoms as high serotonin may be a contributor to swelling and edema. Judicious use of diuretics may be considered with caution to avoid hypovolemia as patients are at risk of hypotension-related vasoactive amine release. Subcutaneous interferon-alpha has been shown to palliate advanced carcinoid syndrome, including swelling. It is associated with hematologic toxicities and flu-like side effects and may be considered for refractory patients.

Treatment of grade 3 ascites — initial management states that for patients presenting with tense ascites, large-volume paracentesis (LVP) combined with hyperoncotic human albumin is the initial treatment of choice, even in the presence of hyponatremia. Patients with massive peripheral edema may require a second paracentesis shortly after the first because a rapid shift of fluid may occur from interstitial to ascitic cavity. After LVP and a significant reduction in the intra-abdominal pressure, diuretics can be instituted, which may eliminate or reduce the frequency of paracentesis.

### The physiologic perspective in fluid management in vascular anesthesiology [^1151AcZj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Vascular surgery patients frequently suffer from atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial occlusive disease generating endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, ischemia and reperfusion during surgery damage endothelial cells and, especially, the endothelial glycocalix. The damage of the glycocalix promotes an increase in permeability. Not only crystalloids, which freely diffuse between the intravascular and the interstitial compartment, but also colloidal fluids cross from the intravascular space in the interstitial space with the consequence of edema formation. Possible tissue edema may result in an impairment of tissue oxygenation, leading to wound healing disturbances and initiation of inflammatory responses up to tissue apoptosis. Particularly in vascular anesthesia, this possibly means that colloids only should be administered in acute volume resuscitation immediately after unclamping a big vessel for immediate volume restoration. Which colloidal fluid should be administered is still under intense discussion. From a theoretical physiologic point of view, iso-osmolar albumin is the best choice regarding volume effect, antioxidative properties, and protection against destruction of the glycocalix. Nonetheless, albumin experimentally has not lived up to its promise in the clinical setting. Thus, further well-conducted large randomized clinical trials are necessary to ascertain the optimal fluid therapy in vascular surgery patients.

### Drug insight: the role of albumin in the management of chronic liver disease [^114xAjJj]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulation. Its main physiologic function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure. Better understanding of albumin's other physiologic functions has expanded its application beyond maintenance of intravascular volume. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin has been used as an adjunct to diuretics to improve the diuretic response. It has also been used to prevent circulatory dysfunction developing after large-volume paracentesis. Newer indications in cirrhotic patients include preventing hepatorenal syndrome in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and treating established hepatorenal syndrome in conjunction with vasoconstrictor therapies. The use of albumin for many of these indications is controversial, mostly because of the paucity of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials. The cost of albumin infusions, lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and fear of transmitting unknown viruses add to the controversy. The latest indication for albumin use in cirrhotic patients is extracorporeal albumin dialysis, which has shown promise for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy; its role in hepatorenal syndrome or acute on chronic liver failure has not been established. Efforts should be made to define the indications for albumin use, dose of albumin required and predictors of response, so that patients gain the maximum benefit from its administration.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^112EVfzn]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should albumin infusions target albumin levels?

The need to make decisions as to whether or not a particular patient should receive albumin based on their albumin level is related to whether the considered use is targeted as resuscitation or supplementation. Most patients requiring resuscitation fluids in the ICU are hypoalbuminemic and, as mentioned earlier, the fluid will be given largely for its effects on COP – that is, limiting edema formation – provided that the hydrostatic pressure does not increase excessively. In such patients, monitoring the albumin concentration is probably of little value.

In more prolonged administration as supplementation, however, serum albumin levels may be a useful guide to ongoing needs, in combination with disease severity, hemodynamic status, and nutritional status; just as an arbitrary cutoff hemoglobin concentration should not be used to define absolute need for blood transfusion in all patients, so a specific serum albumin threshold for albumin administration is unlikely to be relevant to all. The meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients mentioned earlier suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. As a result, the ALBIOS study protocol stipulated that albumin administration should be titrated to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l. Albumin levels were measured on a daily basis and 200 or 300 mL of 20% albumin were administered in patients with albumin levels between 25 and 30 g/l or < 25 g/l, respectively. Following the time course of albumin levels, especially in response to an albumin infusion, may be more valuable than a single albumin level, but optimal albumin levels during critical illness are not clearly defined.

What type of albumin preparation?

Currently available human albumin solutions are developed using various techniques, such that the various commercially available albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidant properties, charge, capacity to bind drugs, and so forth. This is a difficult topic to evaluate because there are few data available about the precise composition of the different albumin solutions and whether or how this may impact on its clinical properties, but the differences may help explain some of the different study results. One study comparing six different commercially available preparations of albumin with serum albumin from healthy volunteers reported large differences between the solutions, particularly in terms of the presence of oxidized cysteine 34 (23% in human volunteer albumin vs 54 to 60% in commercial preparations), which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions. Precise compositions of albumin solution should be clearly identified in future study reports.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^116MdHAg]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Safety

The capacity of hyperoncotic albumin to shift fluid from the interstitium to the intravascular space may be viewed as a two-edged sword, depending upon the hydration state of the patient. In edematous states, such fluid shifts may be desirable. Conversely, hyperoncotic albumin should probably be avoided in patients with severe dehydration.

High doses of hyperoncotic albumin could potentially increase pulmonary edema and capillary leak. In one widely cited randomized trial of Lucas et al. patients receiving very high hyperoncotic albumin doses (1,142 g) and total fluid volumes (44.9 l) displayed impairment in pulmonary function. Commentators have ascribed that result to fluid overload rather than hyperoncotic albumin per se, however. The trial of Lucas et al. was not included in the present review because albumin was administered with the aim of elevating serum albumin concentration rather than expanding intravascular volume, and indeed the attained central venous pressure (mean 18.6 cm H₂O) was supranormal.

In a dose-escalation study of 25% albumin treatment in 82 patients with acute ischemic stroke, mild or moderate pulmonary edema was observed in 13% of the patients. This adverse effect was readily managed with diuretics, and 25% albumin doses up to 2 g/kg could be tolerated without major dose-limiting complications.

None of the trials included in the present review or in a prior systematic review of both hyperoncotic and 4 to 5% albumin has indicated harmful effects attributable to albumin. A Cochrane meta-analysis encompassing both 4 to 5% and 20 to 25% solutions suggested increased mortality among albumin recipients (RR 1.7). That finding could not be replicated either in the SAFE trial or a more comprehensive subsequent meta-analysis. In the present survival meta-analysis, which was adequately powered to detect a relative mortality risk increase only half as great as that reported by the Cochrane investigators, there was no evidence of poorer survival among hyperoncotic albumin recipients.

### Acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery: current understanding and future directions [^1179PSAP]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Prevention

Several practical interventions are available for the prevention of AKI, starting with the management of intravenous fluid administration. Although cardiac surgery is associated with microvasculature injury and tissue edema, colloid administration is not clearly superior to crystalloid. Colloid administration marginally improves maintenance of intravascular volume compared with crystalloid, and both albumin administration and hydroxyethyl starch administration have been associated with increased rates of AKI in some studies. However, a recent clinical trial of hypoalbuminemic patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OpCAB) demonstrated that albumin administration decreased the incidence of AKI compared with crystalloid. The results suggest hypoalbuminemia may be a modifiable risk factor for AKI associated with OpCAB. It is not clear whether benefit was derived from improved renal perfusion or direct effects of albumin on the kidneys. Additional studies are needed, particularly in on-pump surgery where inflammation and tissue edema are often worse than in off-pump surgery. With regard to crystalloid composition, isotonic normal saline administration has recently been associated with AKI, possibly as a result of the excess chloride load. A meta-analysis of 21 studies that included 6253 subjects found high-chloride solution administration to be independently associated with increased risk of AKI (relative risk (RR), 1.64 (95% CI: 1.27–2.13); P < 0.001) and metabolic acidosis (RR, 2.87 (95% CI: 1.95–4.21); P < 0.001), although mortality was unaffected. Interventional trials of hyperchloremic and balanced-salt crystalloid solutions have thus far confirmed that administration of normal saline may be harmful or at least no different from administration of a balanced-salt solution during critical illness.

### Mitigation and management of adverse events associated with amivantamab therapy [^114JYTaP]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Incidence and management of MET -associated amivantamab AEs

Common AEs

Peripheral edema

Peripheral edema is commonly reported with MET inhibitors in 21%-50% of patients treated with capmatinib, 51% with crizotinib, 26%-63% with tepotinib, 21%-54% with savolitinib, and 18% with amivantamab.

Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia, reported in 16% of patients treated with tepotinib, 23% with savolitinib, and 27% with amivantamab monotherapy, is a class effect of MET inhibition. It is also a marker of inflammation and an important prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC, as declining albumin levels can occur in the setting of increased active disease burden.

Other MET-related AEs

Of note, some MET -related AEs, such as pleural effusion and increased creatinine, have not been reported with amivantamab. Pleural effusion is reported in 8% of patients treated with tepotinib, and increased creatinine is reported in 19% of patients treated with capmatinib and 18% of patients treated with tepotinib. Although the cause of MET -associated AEs is not clearly identified, some may occur due to the role of MET in regulating vascular endothelial permeability; thus, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors are currently being investigated.

In the absence of formal guidelines, Table 1 summarizes the management techniques recommended by previous review articles for the most common MET -related AEs associated with amivantamab and other MET-targeting agents.

Prevention and management of peripheral edema

In addition to the strategies listed in Table 1, it is important to identify any other medical conditions (cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease) or medications (including chemotherapies, antihypertensives, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories) that may contribute to peripheral edema. If peripheral edema occurs, thorough examination and history taking are essential to elucidate underlying causes. Interventions other than dose interruption or modification are rarely effective.

Prevention and management of hypoalbuminemia

Prevention strategies are not commonly used for hypoalbuminemia. HCPs may refer patients to a nutritionist, and any underlying inflammatory cause should be treated (Table 1).

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115VYHyv]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin is administered in a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios including complications of cirrhosis, intradialytic hypotension, volume resuscitation, and priming of cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Iso-oncotic albumin often is used to maintain intravascular volume in patients with hypovolemia, assuming that crystalloid resuscitation will be ineffective given its shorter intravascular half-life. Hyperoncotic albumin is used to correct low serum albumin levels or to mobilize extravascular fluid.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in acute and chronic illness. Hospitalized patients with hypoalbuminemia have been described as having greater morbidity compared with patients with preserved albumin levels, promoting the use of IV albumin. In the postoperative period, serum albumin levels decreases precipitously by 10 to 15 g/L; hypoalbuminemia is thought to be the result of suppressed synthesis by inflammatory cytokinesand transcapillary loss. In addition to its use in patients with hypoalbuminemia, edema, or both, albumin also is used for the prevention and treatment of hypovolemia, particular after administration of large volumes of IV crystalloid solutions.

Practice audits describing the use of albumin show highly variable practice among regions. Albumin is manufactured from large volumes of plasma and is expensive (approximately $130/25 g United States dollars; warehouse acquisition cost of albumin), with the acquisition cost likely a fraction of the total health care expenditure. Albumin also can be associated with adverse consequences, including fluid overload, hypotension, hemodilution requiring RBC transfusion, anaphylaxis, and peripheral gangrene from dilution of natural anticoagulants. Because potential benefits and risks are associated with its use, a multidisciplinary, international guideline panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of albumin in patient populations where it is prescribed commonly. These guidelines are designed to assist clinicians in their decisions on the use of albumin for its most common uses.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^112ETXfB]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Albumin in critically ill cirrhosis notes that albumin administration is recommended in the management of patients with cirrhosis for select indications (large-volume paracentesis, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP], and hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]). In single-institution open-label RCTs, 20% albumin versus Plasma-Lyte in 100 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher rates of shock reversal but no survival benefit and increased pulmonary complications, and 5% albumin versus normal saline in 308 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher reversal of hypotension with higher 1-week survival (43.5% vs. 38.3%, p = 0.03). There are no large RCT specific to the use of albumin in patients with ACLF; in the Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure trial, 777 hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis were randomized to daily albumin infusions versus standard care with no difference in the composite primary endpoint and possible higher rates of pulmonary edema and fluid overload, and overall its broader use as a resuscitation agent in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and/or ACLF is not well defined.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^116kJiEp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Albumen is doubtless one of the most important of the animal proximate principles.

(Henry Ancell)

Albumin solutions have been used worldwide for the treatment of critically ill patients since they became commercially available in the 1940s. However, driven largely by the results of a widely publicized meta-analysis in 1998 that reported increased mortality rates in patients who received albumin solutions, the role of albumin administration in critically ill patients became highly controversial. It is well known that albumin has multiple physiological effects, including regulation of colloid osmotic pressure (COP), binding and transportation of various substances (for example, drugs, hormones) within the blood, antioxidant properties, nitric oxide modulation and buffer capabilities, which may be of particular relevance in critically ill patients. It is also well established that low serum albumin levels, a common occurrence in critically ill patients, are associated with worse outcomes. There would therefore seem to be a good rationale for use of albumin infusions in critically ill patients. However, albumin solutions also have limitations, including high costs relative to possible alternatives, notably crystalloids, and potential (rare) risks of transmission of microorganisms, anticoagulant, and allergic effects. Because there are no definitive randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating an outcome benefit of albumin in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients, routine administration of albumin for fluid resuscitation is not warranted in all patients, but there is evidence to support its use in some patient populations.

The purpose of this article is not to review in detail the multiple functions and roles of albumin or the many comparative studies and meta-analyses that have now been performed, although we will briefly summarize this information to provide some context. Rather, we wish to provide some clear suggestions and guidance for albumin use based on the current available evidence and highlight important areas for future research.

### Choice of fluid in acute illness: what should be given? An international consensus [^115Vn6XH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid management during critical illness is a dynamic process that may be conceptualized as occurring in four phases: rescue, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation (mobilization). The selection and administration of resuscitation fluids is one component of this complex physiological sequence directed at restoring depleted intravascular volume. Presently, the selection of i.v. fluid is usually dictated more by local practice patterns than by evidence. The debate on fluid choice has primarily focused on evaluating outcome differences between 'crystalloids vs colloids'. More recently, however, there is interest in examining outcome differences based on the chloride content of crystalloid solutions. New insights into the conventional Starling model of microvascular fluid exchange may explain that the efficacy of colloids in restoring and maintaining depleted intravascular volume is only moderately better than crystalloids. A number of investigator-initiated, high-quality, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that modest improvements in short-term physiological endpoints with colloids have not translated into better patient-centred outcomes. In addition, there is substantial evidence that certain types of fluids may independently worsen patient-centred outcomes. These include hydroxyethyl starch and albumin solutions in selected patient populations. There is no evidence to support the use of other colloids. The use of balanced salt solutions in preference to 0.9% saline is supported by the absence of harm in large observational studies. However, there is no compelling randomized trial-based evidence demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with the use of balanced salt solutions compared with 0.9% saline at this time.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^114E8B4z]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Where next?

Having briefly reviewed the background to the albumin story so far, where are we left? Who, if anyone, should be given albumin? Some answers will be provided from further analysis of the results from recent and ongoing studies, but in the meantime we believe there are six key questions that need answering.

Resuscitation versus supplementation (medication)?

Initially considered largely as an acute resuscitation fluid for its beneficial short-term effects on COP and blood volume, recognition of the adverse outcomes associated with hypoalbuminemia and new knowledge about vascular barrier functioning has led to an increased interest in use of albumin solutions as a supplement to correct and maintain albumin levels. Nevertheless, it is difficult to separate volume effects from the effects of maintenance of serum albumin – particularly in critically ill patients, many of whom are hypoalbuminemic and in whom it is difficult to clearly relate the timing of interventions to the onset of disease. Thus, most studies of albumin administration actually combine a degree of resuscitation with a degree of supplementation/maintenance of serum albumin. As a resuscitation fluid, the major benefit of albumin will be from its impact on COP, resulting in a short-term increase in intravascular volume. As supplementation, effects on COP are also important, potentially reducing the risk of interstitial edema, but some of albumin's other actions, such as transport and antioxidant effects, may also become important.

Efforts to substitute synthetic colloids for albumin as part of perioperative fluid therapy have not been very successful. Hydroxyethylstarch solutions can persist for long durations in the skin, the liver and, most importantly, the kidney, with a potential risk of renal failure and even increased mortality rates in septic patients. Gelatin solutions have been less well studied, in part because they are not available in the United States, and their persistence is quite short.

### Early response of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) in diabetic macular edema (DME) management: microperimetry and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings: a pilot study at national eye center of third world country [^116QvbVV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in people with diabetes mellitus (DM), especially of productive age in developing countries. It is one of the biggest eye problems in the world. DME can occur at any degree of diabetic retinopathy or as a manifestation. DME is a complex long-term condition with multifactorial pathogenesis, including dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller's cell, damaged Blood Retinal Barrier (BRB), non-perfusion of retinal capillaries and neuronal damage. All of this has implications for the complexity of the development of macular edema.

In 2018, the International Council of Ophthalmology (ICO) changed the classification of DME based on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) in DME management. ICO classifies DME into 3 degrees: without DME, non-center-involving DME (non-CI DME), and center-involving DME (CI-DME). Various parameters specific to the OCT picture have been proposed to evaluate DME and determine its various phenotypes, but the ICO classification is the most frequently used in everyday practice.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has implications for the pathogenesis of BRB changes and is believed to be a key mediator in the pathogenesis of DME. VEGF can trigger angiogenesis and cause BRB damage destructively, as t ight junction interstellar retinal endothelial cells play an essential role in the function and regulation of the BRB. This BRB damage then leads to the accumulation of plasma proteins such as albumin, causing an increase in the oncotic pressure of neural networks and resulting in interstitial oedema in the macula. Inflammation also plays a vital role in the process by involving several chemokines and cytokines. Many r andomized controlled trials (RCTs) show strong evidence supporting intravitreal anti-VEGF as a first-line therapy in managing sharp vision loss due to DME. Therefore, DME therapy's goal has changed, namely from preventing blindness to improving vision. Anti-VEGF drugs such as bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept are very effective and safe, although bevacizumab is used regularly. It is more widely used in practice, is off-label, and is much cheaper.

### Hypovolemia with peripheral edema: what is wrong? [^1114BEBo]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Volume kinetic simulation

Volume kinetics is a macroscopic method that is useful for the study of whole-body fluid maldistribution. Simulations based on volume kinetic theory confirm that inhibition of lymphatic flow is likely to create marked disturbances of fluid and albumin distribution even when capillary filtration is normal and no other pathophysiological disturbance is present (Fig. 1). This model and our synthesis of evidence explaining the combination of hypovolemia and peripheral edema is focused on distributive changes between the plasma and the interstitial space (and, importantly, sub-compartments therein). This analysis contrasts with the macroscopic changes between the stressed and unstressed plasma volumes that are part of hemodynamic derangements which occur solely within the vascular compartment.

Fig. 1
Computer simulated volume expansion of the plasma (A), extravascular space (B) and the plasma albumin concentration (C) in response to infusion of 30 mL/kg over 30 min followed by 15 mL/kg over 1 h of Ringer´s acetate/lactate. The percentages imply the degree of inflicted restriction of lymphatic return of fluid and albumin. The albumin kinetics assumes a capillary leakage of 5% of the intravascular pool per hour which, at steady state, is fully returned by lymphatic flow, and is unaffected by fluid loading. The volume kinetic parameters were taken from a mixed population of conscious and anesthetized patients. Each gram of albumin was modeled to bind 10 mL of fluid. The extravascular volume expansion could not be divided into a fast and slowly exchanging pool because it is unknown from which pool the lymph originates

Box 3 Recommendations for fluid and albumin administration

We recommend rapid referral of children with CNS to a specialized paediatric nephrology unit due to the complexity of the disease and fluid management.
We recommend avoiding intravenous fluids and saline. Oral fluid intake should be concentrated if necessary to avoid marked oedema.
We recommend using albumin infusions based on clinical indicators of hypovolaemia (including oliguria, acute kidney injury, prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia, hypotension and abdominal discomfort) or upon failure to thrive. We do not recommend administering albumin infusions in children with CNS based on serum albumin levels.
When possible, we recommend avoiding central venous lines in children with CNS owing to the high risk of thrombosis. If central venous access is required for repeated albumin infusions, we recommend administering prophylactic anticoagulation for as long as the line is in place (Box 7).

General approach

We recommend rapid referral of children with CNS to a specialized paediatric nephrology unit. These children are often born prematurely and amniotic fluid may be stained with meconium but ventilator therapy is rarely needed. Pregnancy is usually uneventful. Given the wide variation in clinical findings in infants with CNS, individualized therapy is needed, with a number of key objectives: preserve all central and peripheral arteries and veins for potential dialysis access; avoid peripherally inserted catheters and unnecessary venepunctures; optimize fluid, protein and caloric intake; minimize administration of salt-containing fluids; prevent thrombosis, particularly in patients with a CVL or hypovolaemia; and treat infection when clinically suspected by starting empiric antibiotics before culture results are available. C-reactive protein and leukocyte levels are not reliable indicators of septicaemia in patients with CNS.

Fluid management

As no studies have investigated specific treatments for oedema in CNS, treatment should focus on assessment of volume status (that is, overfill versus underfill) and salt restriction, as recommended for adult patients. Fluid restriction is advocated for hyponatraemia and in the most severe cases of oedema.

Fluid prescription in patients with CNS should primarily be used to provide adequate nutrition. Intake of fluid should be limited, when feasible, by using concentrated high-calorie formulas to meet age-related energy needs, guided by the advice of expert renal dieticians. Intravenous albumin is the treatment of choice for acute symptomatic hypovolaemia (see below).

### Combined furosemide and human albumin treatment for diuretic-resistant edema [^116AhgaC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical usefulness of combined furosemide and human albumin for the treatment of diuretic-resistant edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome and cirrhosis.

Data Sources

Clinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-May 2002). Key search terms included furosemide, albumin, human albumin solution, nephrotic syndrome, and cirrhosis.

Data Synthesis

Hypoalbuminemia, edema, and ascites are often manifestations of nephrotic syndrome and cirrhosis of the liver. Many patients with these conditions are resistant to the effects of diuretics. The combination of furosemide and human albumin solution is occasionally used in these patients. An evaluation of published studies focusing on combined furosemide and albumin in the management of nephrotic syndrome and cirrhosis was conducted.

Conclusions

Published studies report conflicting results regarding the efficacy of combined furosemide and albumin. Although it is difficult to generate firm conclusions, it appears the combination may provide clinical benefits for select patients. Given these findings, we believe that the addition of albumin to enhance diuretic efficacy should be reserved for patients with recalcitrant edema or ascites in whom diuretic doses have been maximized and those with severe hypoalbuminemia.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, albumin, ABA 2024 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence on whether to initiate albumin before or after 12 hours to reduce the volume of administered fluid, improve urine output, or decrease edema in situations where albumin is part of the resuscitation plan (not a rescue situation). Consider initiating albumin any time in the first 12 hours in the context of a research study, given the uncertainty about the undesirable outcome of pulmonary edema related to early albumin provision and the overall importance of timing.

For resuscitation in patients with traumatic brain injury

In the SAFE trial, patients with traumatic brain injury treated with albumin had worse outcomes than saline-treated patients. Using pattern mixture modeling, the probable mechanism for the increased mortality appeared to be albumin-induced increases in intracranial pressure. The hypotonic and hypooncotic nature of the albumin solution used may also have played a role.

For albumin replacement in patients with hypoalbuminemia

The effects of increasing albumin concentrations by giving exogenous albumin have also been investigated in the critically ill. A meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. However, in a subgroup analysis of the SAFE study in patients with hypoalbuminemia, using a cutoff value of 25 g/l, there were no significant differences in outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients and normoalbuminemic patients who received albumin. In a pilot RCT of 100 hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients who were randomized either to receive 300 mL of 20% albumin solution on the first day and then 200 ml/day if the serum albumin concentration remained < 30 g/dl or to receive no albumin, Dubois and colleagues reported that organ function (as assessed by change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) improved more in the albumin-treated patients (P = 0.03); these patients also had a less positive fluid balance (P = 0.04). There was also a beneficial effect on cumulative calorie intake during the first week, suggesting that albumin may have helped decrease intestinal edema.

Circulation: the optimal resuscitation fluid

Fluid therapy is integral in achieving volume expansion and reaching the SBP targets mentioned previously. However, this must be balanced with maintaining a neutral fluid balance and avoiding hyponatremia and worsening cerebral edema. There has been an ongoing debate over the optimal crystalloid due to insufficient evidence concerning different aspects: how much volume should be given, does using a bolus versus infusion affect mortality rates, and whether the solution used should be hypertonic or isotonic. The initiative to compare crystalloid with colloid resuscitation for TBI has lost momentum since the publication of the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) trial in 2007. The trial showed that albumin resuscitation caused a twofold increase in mortality compared with saline resuscitation. However, the comparison of crystalloids is still a subject of ongoing research.

Rowell et al compared the use of normal saline and lactated Ringer's (LR) administration in prehospitalized patients and found a higher 30-day mortality rate with LR (HR 1.78; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.04) despite no difference in admission biochemical or physiological parameters, 6-hour RBC, or crystalloid requirement in either group. A possible explanation could be that balanced salt solutions closely resemble human plasma and thus have a lower sodium and chloride content than 0.9% saline with the addition of a buffer such as acetate or lactate. These fluids (eg, Ringer's lactate, Hartmann's solution) have minimal effects on pH but are relatively hypotonic which can exacerbate edema particularly cerebral edema in the injured brain.

The potential utility of hypertonic crystalloids in TBI is twofold; they are potent vascular compartment expanders, and they can reduce cerebral edema. A recent RCT compared the effect of continuous hypertonic saline (20%) for 48 hours with standard hospital care on 359 patients. The study showed that there was no significant difference in neurological outcome (GOS-E) at 6 months (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.47). There was no significant difference in the secondary outcomes of 6-month mortality (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.28) or development of intracranial hypertension (IHT) (absolute difference −2.6%; 95% CI −12.3% to 7.2%). These findings are in line with a recent meta-analysis of six RCTs comparing prehospital hypertonic fluids with isotonic fluids in terms of survival.

### In my opinion: serum albumin should be maintained during neurocritical care [^116YgmWe]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is common among critically ill/injured patients and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the patients with and without neurological conditions. Normal serum albumin is important as the primary intravascular antioxidant, in transporting a variety of hormones, medications and electrolytes, in providing colloid osmotic pressure during trans-compartmental fluid movement, in enhancing organ and tissue blood flow, and in supporting acid-base balance. Studies of albumin administration during intravascular resuscitation have not addressed potential longer term benefits to sustaining serum albumin concentrations during critical care. Evidence for such benefit is present although additional prospective studies are needed.

### Efficacy of albumin and diuretic therapy in children with nephrotic syndrome… [^11323XVW]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective. To examine the efficacy and complications of albumin and diuretic therapy in the treatment of edema due to the nephrotic syndrome. Methods. The clinical and biochemical effects of 35 treatment courses of albumin and diuretics administered to 21 children with nephrotic syndrome were retrospectively examined. Treatment consisted of intravenous infusion of 25% albumin and furosemide. A second diuretic was administered in addition to furosemide during 10 treatment courses. There was an average of 5 infusions per hospitalization. Results. Albumin and furosemide therapy resulted in a 1. 2 ±
0. 2% body weight loss per infusion. The administration of albumin with two diuretics did not result in improved weight loss compared to albumin and furosemide alone. Patients whose nephrotic syndrome was in remission at the time of posthospitalization follow-up had a sustained weight loss both during and after albumin and diuretic treatment.

Patients with persistent proteinuria transiently lost weight during therapy, but returned to a weight similar to their pretreatment weight at 2-week follow-up. Albumin infusion resulted in hypertension, requiring acute antihypertensive therapy in 16 treatment courses and increased maintenance antihypertensive therapy in 12 treatment courses. In addition, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and hyperbicarbonatemia developed in 40%, 17%, and 11% of treatment courses, respectively. Albumin and diuretic therapy resulted in the development of respiratory distress during four treatment courses, including one patient who developed respiratory failure and one patient who developed congestive heart failure. Conclusions. Albumin and diuretic therapy results in fluid removal and weight loss in children with the nephrotic syndrome; however, this effect is transient unless remission of proteinuria occurs.

While this is a retrospective study, the findings suggest that albumin and diuretic therapy can be associated with frequent and potentially serious complications. Comments.

### Approach to leg edema of unclear etiology [^113fbkTh]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A common challenge for primary care physicians is to determine the cause and find an effective treatment for leg edema of unclear etiology. We were unable to find existing practice guidelines that address this problem in a comprehensive manner. This article provides clinically oriented recommendations for the management of leg edema in adults. We searched on-line resources, textbooks, and MEDLINE (using the MeSH term, "edema") to find clinically relevant articles on leg edema. We then expanded the search by reviewing articles cited in the initial sources. Our goal was to write a brief, focused review that would answer questions about the management of leg edema. We organized the information to make it rapidly accessible to busy clinicians. The most common cause of leg edema in older adults is venous insufficiency. The most common cause in women between menarche and menopause is idiopathic edema, formerly known as "cyclic" edema. A common but under-recognized cause of edema is pulmonary hypertension, which is often associated with sleep apnea. Venous insufficiency is treated with leg elevation, compressive stockings, and sometimes diuretics. The initial treatment of idiopathic edema is spironolactone. Patients who have findings consistent with sleep apnea, such as daytime somnolence, loud snoring, or neck circumference > 17 inches, should be evaluated for pulmonary hypertension with an echocardiogram. If time is limited, the physician must decide whether the evaluation can be delayed until a later appointment (eg, an asymptomatic patient with chronic bilateral edema) or must be completed at the current visit (eg, a patient with dyspnea or a patient with acute edema [< 72 hours]). If the evaluation should be conducted at the current visit, the algorithm shown in Figure 1 could be used as a guide. If the full evaluation could wait for a subsequent visit, the patient should be examined briefly to rule out an obvious systemic cause and basic laboratory tests should be ordered for later review (complete blood count, urinalysis, electrolytes, creatinine, blood sugar, thyroid stimulating hormone, and albumin).

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^116APA1a]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Albumin solutions have been used worldwide for the treatment of critically ill patients since they became commercially available in the 1940s. However, their use has become the subject of criticism and debate in more recent years. Importantly, all fluid solutions have potential benefits and drawbacks. Large multicenter randomized studies have provided valuable data regarding the safety of albumin solutions, and have begun to clarify which groups of patients are most likely to benefit from their use. However, many questions remain related to where exactly albumin fits within our fluid choices. Here, we briefly summarize some of the physiology and history of albumin use in intensive care before offering some evidence-based guidance for albumin use in critically ill patients.

### Hydroxyethyl starch for perioperative goal-directed fluid therapy in 2020: a narrative review [^114ccNMi]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: is there a place for a colloid solution in GDFT protocols?

YES.

From a physiological perspective, it seems obvious that colloid solutions have a role in GDFT protocols. Colloid solutions remain longer intravascularly than do crystalloid solutions, continuing to create oncotic pressure, so theoretically they are associated with a decrease in the amount of fluid needed to achieve and maintain hemodynamic goals. The exclusive use of crystalloid solutions, because of their lower volume effect and shorter intravascular persistence, is associated with greater volumes of fluid administration resulting in fluid overload and its potential complications in the perioperative period. Indeed, compared to colloid solutions, greater crystalloid fluid volumes may be required to restore intravascular volume. In an experimental study, Hiltebrand et al. showed that compared to a crystalloid solution (Ringer's lactate), administration of HES boluses, guided by the measurement of venous oxygen saturation, reduced the total volume of fluid infused and, more importantly, improved microcirculatory blood flow and intestinal oxygen partial pressure after abdominal surgery. Excessive fluid administration (mainly crystalloids) has been shown to increase the risk of intestinal tissue edema, leading not only to delayed resumption of intestinal activity and anastomotic leakage, but also to a risk of pulmonary edema and postoperative respiratory complications, all of which increase the hospital length of stay. The use of large volumes of isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) also leads to an increased risk of hyperchloremic acidosis, which can lead to gastrointestinal and renal dysfunction, secondary to the vasoconstrictive properties of the chloride ion. Importantly, volume effects of colloids have been demonstrated to be context sensitive. Administration of iso-oncotic colloids (5% albumin or 6% hydroxyethyl starch) during acute bleeding when carefully maintaining intravascular normovolemia led to volume effects of more than 90%. In contrast, preoperative volume loading in a non-bleeding patient resulted in a volume effect of only 30–35%, two-third of the given bolus leaving the vascular space toward the interstitial compartment within minutes. Colloids and crystalloids cannot be exchanged by simply adapting the amount. Recently, Orbegozo Cortes et al. reviewed all studies comparing crystalloid and colloid solutions in all types of patients (medical, surgical, and trauma patients), many of which likely had altered vascular permeability. They reported that greater volumes were required to achieve similar targets with crystalloid than with colloid solutions (estimated ratio: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.36–1.65). Figure 2 represents the comparison of the crystalloids vs colloids ratio extracted from the study from Orbegozo et al. in the context of an administration of crystalloids without or with a certain amount of colloids. These results were confirmed by Annane et al. in the CRISTAL study. Although this ratio would be expected to be greater than 1.5, it is important to note that none of these studies strictly compared a pure colloid with a pure crystalloid strategy as the colloid groups also always received some crystalloid infusion.

### Furosemide and albumin for diuresis of edema: a pilot study… [^1123ipAP]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

whether the addition of albumin, which encourages the movement of fluid from tissues back into blood vessels, can improve the effectiveness of diuretics, the basis of edema treatment. Who can participate. Adults admitted to the intensive care unit for any reason, who have normal blood flow and low. protein levels in blood, and judged to be in need of diuresis. What does the study involve. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive albumin or placebo, given two hours before the diuretic treatment. Study treatment will continue for 72 hours, or less if. Patients will receive access to a potentially beneficial strategy of diuresis involving the use of albumin in addition to the usual care. There are no known cases of transmission of germs from receiving albumin despite decades of use, and the overall risk is therefore extremely remote.

Some study tests will require one extra tube of blood to be collected; all other data collection. We hypothesize that hyperoncotic albumin, given prior to diuretics, in edematous critically ill patients with hypoproteinemia, will improve diuresis, oxygenation, and hemodynamics. This trial is a pilot RCT to assess the feasibility of such a trial. On 17/04/2014 the anticipated start date was changed from 01/01/2014 to 04/03/2014.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^117XFm6H]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Management of AKI in cirrhosis: the initial management follows three broad principles — identify the phenotype of the AKI, remove or treat the precipitating factor, and perform a trial of fluid challenge; because for every hour delay in the start of antibiotics there is an increase in mortality by 1.86 times, in patients suspected of bacterial infection early administration of empiric antibiotics is recommended once cultures have been taken; in SBP, albumin in conjunction with antibiotics can prevent kidney dysfunction; in ACLF with abnormal hemodynamics, diuretics or nephrotoxic drugs should be withdrawn and fluid challenge given; the recommended fluid challenge is 25% albumin at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight to a maximum of 100 g/day for 48 h, with close monitoring for signs of volume overload/pulmonary edema; for HRS-AKI not responsive to volume challenge, the mainstay of treatment is vasoconstrictor therapy together with albumin (20–40 g/day), and in a recent terlipressin trial for HRS1 respiratory failure was observed in 8% of patients who received terlipressin, so patients should be carefully monitored for pulmonary edema and the total amount of albumin administered prior to terlipressin should be considered.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^114Gkx8V]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Management of HRS-AKI — prevention focuses on modifiable triggers and cautious albumin use, noting uncertain long-term benefit. Prevention measures include "avoidance of alcohol use, monitoring of serum creatinine and electrolytes when patients are on diuretics, albumin infusion with therapeutic paracentesis, administering antibiotics with episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and avoiding use of nonselective beta-blockers and nephrotoxic medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs". It is stated that "It is unclear whether long-term albumin infusion prevents HRS. Long-term albumin administration reduced the likelihood of developing HRS and improved 18-month survival in one study, but the results were not replicated in another study". Patients "may derive most benefit when the serum albumin is kept above 4 g/ dL", and clinicians should recognize that "Albumin infusion may be associated with volume overload and life-threatening pulmonary edema".

### Human albumin infusion for treating oedema in people with nephrotic syndrome [^113B8aVV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Oedema is a common clinical symptom in people with nephrotic syndrome and human albumin has been widely used in the treatment of oedema by increasing vascular volume and this inducing diuresis. It may be used with or without diuretics such as furosemide. However, the quantitative contribution of human albumin in treating oedema is not fully understood. If human albumin were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of oedema, it could help clinicians to develop therapeutic strategies to improve the management of diuretic resistance associated with nephrotic syndrome.

Objectives

This review aimed to examine the benefits and harms of human albumin infusion for treating oedema associated with nephrotic syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 23 June 2019 through contact with the Information Specialists using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effect of human albumin infusion compared with placebo or no intervention, human albumin with diuretics compared with diuretic alone, human albumin compared with diuretics and other treatments, clinical outcomes, death, quality of life, kidney function and adverse effects in people with nephrotic syndrome. We excluded cross-over studies but data for the first period was to be included if available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. Two authors independently assessed eligibility, risk of bias, study quality and extracted data. We calculated mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

One study met our inclusion criteria (26 children with minimal change nephrotic syndrome) and 11 were excluded (nine cross-over studies, one where albumin was not used for nephrotic syndrome and one where authors did not state whether the children had oedema). Risk of bias for the included study was unclear for selection bias, high for performance and detection bias, low for attrition bias, and high for selective reporting. The included study compared albumin plus furosemide with an equal volume of dextrose. Of our prespecified outcomes, the authors reported clinical improvement as weight change, serum sodium and adverse outcomes (blood pressure). The authors reported a greater weight loss in the albumin treated group initially but no difference overall at 10 days. However, the data in the text and the figures were inconsistent so we could not confirm the authors statements (very low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether albumin infusion improves serum sodium when compared with an equal volume of dextrose (MD 2.00 mEq/L, 95% CI -0.09 to 4.09), systolic blood pressure (MD 2.00 mmHg, 95% CI -3.52 to 7.52) or diastolic blood pressure (MD 2.00 mmHg, 95%CI -4.29 to 8.29). Death, quality of life, and kidney function were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified only one small study that was relevant to our review, therefore we are unable to draw any conclusions regarding the use of human albumin with or without diuretics in nephrotic syndrome. More RCTs are needed.

### A plea for personalization of the hemodynamic management of septic shock [^112a2mUa]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Personalization of resuscitation therapies

Personalization of fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes should be tailored to tissue perfusion indices and cardiovascular state, taking into account the response to therapy.

Personalized fluid management

Fluid management is essential in septic shock. During the salvage phase, fluids can be liberally administered as the benefits largely outweigh the risks. During optimization, the situation is more complex. The proportion of patients responding to fluids progressively decreases while the likelihood of adverse events increases. Per-formula strategies, being dry or wet, are clearly inappropriate and personalized strategies are preferred.

The personalized way of fluid administration comprises several steps. First, there should be a clear indication for fluids, i.e. a perfusion impairment that is expected to respond to fluids. Second, the patient should be predicted to respond to fluids. Prediction of fluid responsiveness is better achieved with dynamic tests over static measurements of preload. Third, the response to fluids should be carefully evaluated using the fluid challenge technique.

During stabilization, resuscitation fluids, maintenance and dilution fluids should be minimized. In the de-escalation phase, safe fluid withdrawal using diuretics or ultrafiltration should be achieved with minimal monitoring. First, the identification of the patient potentially benefitting from fluid removal is critical. Patients with signs of pulmonary or systemic venous stasis are ideal candidates. Measurement of EVLW (by TPTD or ultrasound) can be used to trigger fluid removal and assess its efficacy. As for many other variables, the EVLW target should be individualized. As stated above, it sounds logical not to withdraw fluids in fluid-responsive patients as it may compromise their hemodynamic state. Second, indices of intolerance to fluid removal should be checked. Indeed, the individual capillary refill rate is difficult to assess in clinical practice and high fluid removal rates may not be tolerated.

While guidelines suggest balanced crystalloids, individual factors such as chloride and albumin levels, as well as the presence of edema, should be considered when selecting between albumin and crystalloids, and between 0.9% saline and balanced crystalloids (based on chloride levels). During stabilization and de-escalation, one should also try to minimize non-resuscitation fluids and sodium load.

### Albumin administration – what is the evidence of clinical benefit? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^114EEu27]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The advantages of albumin over less costly alternative fluids continue to be debated. Meta-analyses focusing on survival have been inconclusive, and other clinically relevant end-points have not been systematically addressed. We sought to determine whether albumin confers significant clinical benefit in acute illness compared with other fluid regimens.

Methods

Database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and other methods were used to identify randomized controlled trials comparing albumin with crystalloid, artificial colloid, no albumin or lower-dose albumin. Major findings for all end-points were extracted and summarized. A quantitative meta-analysis was not attempted.

Results

Seventy-nine randomized trials with a total of 4755 patients were included. No significant treatment effects were detectable in 20/79 (25%) trials. In cardiac surgery, albumin administration resulted in lower fluid requirements, higher colloid oncotic pressure, reduced pulmonary oedema with respiratory impairment and greater haemodilution compared with crystalloid and hydroxyethylstarch increased postoperative bleeding. In non-cardiac surgery, fluid requirements, and pulmonary and intestinal oedema were decreased by albumin compared with crystalloid. In hypoalbuminaemia, higher doses of albumin reduced morbidity. In ascites, albumin reduced haemodynamic derangements, morbidity and length of stay and improved survival after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In sepsis, albumin decreased pulmonary oedema and respiratory dysfunction compared with crystalloid, while hydroxyethylstarch induced abnormalities of haemostasis. Complications were lowered by albumin compared with crystalloid in burn patients. Albumin-containing therapeutic regimens improved outcomes after brain injury.

Conclusions

Albumin can bestow benefit in diverse clinical settings. Further trials are warranted to delineate optimal fluid regimens, in particular indications.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^111soQKq]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In the resource-limited environment, the use of cheaper crystalloid solutions is still recommended due to lack of data showing significant outcome benefits of more expensive synthetic colloids. A selection of different crystalloid solutions is often not available in resource-limited settings, making the available solution the only and best choice. In a Cochrane review, the use of hypertonic saline for the resuscitation of trauma victims has failed to show any benefit over isotonic or near-isotonic crystalloids and two adequately powered trials investigating mortality as an endpoint were halted early due to futility. Controversy, however, still continues fueled by animal studies demonstrating benefits that have not been reflected as outcome benefits in human studies. Heterogeneous populations and methodological differences between studies make the interpretation of evidence difficult. Hypertonic saline may have a role when used in the head-injured patient as a bridge to neurosurgery.

Several trials show either no benefit, or in some cases worse outcomes, with albumin thus making this solution not recommended in the resuscitation of trauma patients.

The physiological impact of the volume of fluid infused may be as, or even more important than the type selected. Excessive fluid results in a dilutional coagulopathy and diffuse tissue edema. This negatively impacts organ function at both a macroscopic and cellular level by increasing the distance over which electrolytes, elements and oxygen have to move. The consequence is worsening renal, hepatic and cardiac function as well as increasing volume of extra vascular lung water that worsens ventilation–perfusion mismatch. Abdominal hypertension/compartment syndrome may progress to a polycompartment syndrome.

Therefore, until such time as blood and blood products are available, clear fluid resuscitation should be limited to only that which is necessary to maintain adequate organ perfusion. Several factors influence decisions at this point of the resuscitation. Trauma units with easy access to on-site blood and blood products should commence resuscitation of patients with massive blood loss with these products from the start. In environments where blood products are limited, the authors suggest judicious use of clear fluids to sustain organ perfusion while avoiding the negative effects of excess fluid. Response to fluid administration and determining the need for further fluid administration is discussed in the next section.

### The pathophysiology of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome [^112kptrf]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The mechanism of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome has long been a source of controversy. In this review, through the construct of Starling's forces, we examine the roles of albumin, intravascular volume, and neurohormones on edema formation and highlight the evolving literature on the role of primary sodium absorption in edema formation. We propose that a unifying mechanism of sodium retention is present in the nephrotic syndrome regardless of intravascular volume status and is due to the activation of epithelial sodium channel by serine proteases in the glomerular filtrate of nephrotic patients. Finally, we assert that mechanisms in addition to sodium retention are likely operant in the formation of nephrotic edema.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^113C2dSC]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Small-volume resuscitation can rapidly correct hypovolemia. Hyperoncotic albumin solutions, long in clinical use, are suitable for small-volume resuscitation; however, their clinical benefits remain uncertain.

Methods

Randomized clinical trials comparing hyperoncotic albumin with a control regimen for volume expansion were sought by multiple methods, including computer searches of bibliographic databases, perusal of reference lists, and manual searching. Major findings were qualitatively summarized. In addition, a quantitative meta-analysis was performed on available survival data.

Results

In all, 25 randomized clinical trials with a total of 1,485 patients were included. In surgery, hyperoncotic albumin preserved renal function and reduced intestinal edema compared with control fluids. In trauma and sepsis, cardiac index and oxygenation were higher after administration of hydroxyethyl starch than hyperoncotic albumin. Improved treatment response and renal function, shorter hospital stay and lower costs of care were reported in patients with liver disease receiving hyperoncotic albumin. Edema and morbidity were decreased in high-risk neonates after hyperoncotic albumin administration. Disability was reduced by therapy with hyperoncotic albumin in brain injury. There was no evidence of deleterious effects attributable to hyperoncotic albumin. Survival was unaffected by hyperoncotic albumin (pooled relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.17).

Conclusion

In some clinical indications, randomized trial evidence has suggested certain benefits of hyperoncotic albumin such as reductions in morbidity, renal impairment and edema. However, further clinical trials are needed, particularly in surgery, trauma and sepsis.

### Assessment of volume status and appropriate fluid replenishment in the setting of nephrotic syndrome [^115jYJmH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

When the permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier increases, leading to proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome (NS) occurs. First episodes or relapses of NS can be concurrent with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) infections. This condition can cause further deterioration of the hypovolemic state, as intravascular water is lost through both AGE-related vomiting/diarrhea and NS-related fluid shifting into the interstitium. In this case report, we wish to raise the issues about the difficult management of children presenting with both NS and AGE.

Case Report

We report two cases characterized by concurrence of NS and AGE. Despite our intervention, case #1 required dialysis, whereas in the case #2 we restored the patient's liquid homeostasis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? No guidelines helping general physicians in the management of children presenting with both NS and AGE are available in the literature. However, it is common for these patients to seek the first line of treatment at emergency departments. In these patients, restoring the liquid homeostasis is a challenge, but some key points can help the physicians with first-line management: 1) carefully evaluate the signs of hypovolemia (edematous state can be misleading); 2) bear in mind that-in hypovolemic, severely hypoalbuminemic (serum albumin levels < 2 g/dL) NS children-initial fluid administration should be followed by a 20% albumin infusion if oligoanuria persists; intravenous 4.5% albumin may be a valid alternative as a first-line therapy instead of crystalloid and 20% albumin; and 3) pay attention when using furosemide; it should only be administered after albumin infusion or after hypovolemia correction.

### Comparison of the effects of albumin and crystalloid on mortality in adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112x7Pvh]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Various reasonable explanations are available for the encouraging results using albumin in septic shock patients. Fluid expansion is a life-saving management for resuscitating septic shock patients. The goal of fluid resuscitation is to expand the intravascular space and restore effective volume. However, fluid often moves into the extravascular space and induces tissue edema in septic patients. While exploiting oncotic pressure gradients to counteract the movement, albumin provides intravascular volume expansion more effectively and restores the fluid in the intravascular space. All these above factors affect fluid resuscitation in a more timely and efficient manner. In addition, albumin is a key transporter and binder of active molecules. Albumin also acts as a radical-scavenging antioxidant, its role on inhibition of platelet aggregation and maintenance of the capillary membrane permeability also takes a great part in being beneficial to outcome.

This meta-analysis has some limitations that should be noted. First, only five trials were included, and two of these trials had small sample sizes. Second, some included trials were subgroups of large randomized controlled studies with variable methodological quality. Thus, the results are potentially overstated. In addition, the endpoint was different in each study. Some of the trials included both 28-day and 90-day mortality values, whereas one trial only reported 28-day mortality. The remaining trials reported hospital mortality. The mortality rates obtained from various time points may influence the overall results. Finally, the concentration of albumin used in each study was different, and contained two colloid families, the hypooncotic and hyperoncotic albumin. The differences in formulation potentially do not influence the results in the same manner.

There are two other highly anticipated ongoing studies of albumin in patients with septic shock. The Five Percent Albumin vs. Normal Saline as Fluid Resuscitation Strategies for the Management of Early Suspected Septic Shock (NCT00819416) study has enrolled 47 patients up to now. The Early Albumin Resuscitation during Septic Shock (NCT00327704) study completed enrollment of 794 patients in January 2011 though it has not been updated for three years. All the results of the studies above will contribute significantly more to further guidance of the optimal resuscitation fluid for septic shock.

### Etiology and management of edema: a review [^1144arSP]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

The development of peripheral edema can often pose a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for practitioners due to its association with a wide variety of underlying disorders ranging in severity. Updates to the original Starling's principle have provided new mechanistic insights into edema formation. Additionally, contemporary data highlighting the role of hypochloremia in the development of diuretic resistance provide a possible new therapeutic target. This article reviews the pathophysiology of edema formation and discusses implications for treatment.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^115KCnYd]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In another larger randomized non–placebo-controlled study by Thevenot et alincluding patients with a higher MELD score and non-SBP infection (also predominantly pneumonia and urinary tract infection) with 13% having severe sepsis, albumin use was not associated with a significant benefit in either the 3-month development of renal dysfunction (primary outcome) or in 3-month survival (secondary endpoint). As in the study by Guevara and colleagues, a third of the patients did not have ascites. Of note, pulmonary edema developed in 8 of 96 patients in the albumin group of whom 2 died, leading to the premature discontinuation of the study. Investigators cautioned against the use of albumin in the "sickest cirrhotic patients".

A third multicenter study (INFECIR-2) was recently performed in a study population that was more similar to the Guevara et al's study. The study did not show significant differences in in-hospital and 90-day mortality rates between treatment arms, confirming the results of the prior RCTs. In fact, the trial had to be terminated prematurely when less than a third of the planned number of patients had been enrolled because of lack of effect on survival and, as in the 2 other studies, because of a greater incidence of pulmonary edema in the albumin treatment group. In post hoc analyses, albumin prevented secondary bacterial infection, decreased inflammatory biomarkers, and improved circulatory dysfunction.

The dose of albumin used in the 3 trials are those recommended for SBP that, as mentioned above, were empirical: 1.5 g/kg of body weight on day 1 and 1 g/kg of body weight on day 3. Since the 3 trials had pulmonary edema as the main complication it is obvious that doses of albumin recommended are too high and should not be weight-based. This would be particularly relevant for patients with NASH, the currently most common etiology of cirrhosis in the United States, where obesity is more prevalent compared with other etiologies. Importantly, patients with pneumonia were the most prone to develop pulmonary edema in these trials and special attention should be placed when volume expanding these patients independent of the indication.

Based on 3 negative RCTs and a meta-analysis, one cannot recommend albumin in the management of infections other than SBP, in a similar way as for SBP. There may be a subgroup of these patients that may benefit from albumin use and these may be those with AKI, for whom albumin is already recommended at lower doses (see above).

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^11531HUR]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

In the survival meta-analysis, the short median follow-up of 5 days may account partly or entirely for the lack of overall effect. Follow-up of 30 days or longer is typical for outcomes trials. Even at 30 days survival, differences may be substantially underestimated compared with those observed at 90 days. In all three included trials designed to assess survival, the follow-up period was at least 90 days.

As in previous systematic reviews of albumin administration, one of the control regimens represented among the trials in this review was no albumin, accounting for six of the included trials (24%). No albumin as the designated control regimen did not necessarily mean no volume expansion, however. In one surgery trial the no-albumin control group received a cumulative mean volume of 24 l non-colloid fluids over the course of the 5-day study. In two trials of high-risk neonates, the no albumin control regimen consisted of routine fluid or 5 ml/kg infant maintenance fluid. No albumin control group volume expansion, if any, in three other trials was unspecified. If control patients in any of those three trials did not receive volume expanders, then observed differences between the hyperoncotic albumin and control arms might have reflected volume expansion rather than a specific effect of hyperoncotic albumin per se. In that scenario, it is possible that an alternative fluid could exert effects similar to those observed with hyperoncotic albumin.

These limitations highlight the need for further trials. There is consistent evidence that hyperoncotic albumin has the capacity to reduce edema; however, the impact of edema reduction on outcomes requires further investigation. Short follow-up has been a deficiency of most hyperoncotic albumin trials to date, and future trials with longer follow-up are essential to assess outcomes. Especially in the areas of surgery, trauma and sepsis existing data need to be supplemented by additional trials. Lastly, standardized and well-specified control regimens will be important in future trials so that clearer inferences can be drawn concerning the specific effects of hyperoncotic albumin vs those of particular alternative fluids or generic volume expansion.

INTRODUCTION

Albumin is the most abundant protein in human plasma, accounting for half of all serum proteins. It transports, by means of its numerous binding sites, endogenous compounds and drugs, and is essential in regulating the flow of water between blood and tissue. Around 33% of albumin in the body is intravascular, with 49% in exchangeable extravascular locations and the remainder in remote extravascular compartments such as the skin. An imbalance in intra–extravascular albumin may potentially result in edema. Albumin concentrations may be accurately measured in urine or blood samples, with altered levels caused by changes in rates of synthesis, catabolism or extravascular leakage. Low levels of albumin have been linked to critical illness and may be a risk factor for myocardial infarction. The body's natural transcapillary exchange rate of around 5% of intravascular albumin per hour may increase in damaged or angiogenic vessels. Localized increases in extravascular macromolecular content may be symptomatic of, for example, reperfused myocardial infarction or tumor angiogenesis.

### We should avoid the term "fluid overload" [^111FEnrJ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Although hypervolemia is always associated with some edema, the reverse is not always true, i.e. edema is not always associated with hypervolemia, particularly in acutely ill patients, especially those with sepsis or other types of intravascular inflammatory responses (e.g. pancreatitis, burns), who often have altered capillary permeability. In such patients, protein-rich fluid leaks from the intravascular to the interstitial space even when mean circulatory filling pressure is low, leading to combined hypovolemia and peripheral edema. Hypoalbuminemia, common in critically ill patients, can exacerbate such edema formation and slow its resolution. If vasoplegia coexists, then mean circulatory filling pressure can be even lower, even though absolute blood volume may not be as decreased as would be the case if tone were normal. This is the rationale for the proposed initial aggressive fluid bolus resuscitation step in the management of septic shock. Thus, in these patients one often sees functional or real hypovolemia associated with increased total body water and generalized edema. These patients often need more intravascular fluids if in shock, not fluid restriction or diuretics. However, whether aggressive fluid resuscitation or combined volume expansion and vasopressor infusion is the most efficacious initial therapy is unclear. Vasopressor infusions in vasoplegic states minimize the volume infusion requirements needed to achieve acceptable mean arterial pressure targets in volume responsive patients.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^114sHcK1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Which concentration of albumin solution?

Albumin solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, mainly 20 to 25% or 4 to 5%, and which concentration should be used has generated some debate. Direct blood volume measurements in humans have revealed that the intravascular volume effect of isooncotic preparations of human albumin solutions is much higher than that of crystalloids (> 80% vs < 20%). However, the albumin concentration chosen largely depends on whether other fluids, especially crystalloids, are administered simultaneously – a 20% (20 g in 100 ml) albumin solution given simultaneously with 500 mL of normal saline solution is equivalent to a 3.3% (20/600) albumin solution. Nevertheless, hyperoncotic albumin may be a better choice if edema is already present, avoiding excessive sodium and chloride loads and their attendant complications.

Which dose of albumin?

Determining the ideal dose or volume of albumin that should be used is difficult. Early physiological studies demonstrated that administration of 5% albumin to septic patients expanded the plasma volume by an amount equivalent to the volume infused. Different studies have used different doses, and perhaps the dose should be adjusted according to a target serum albumin concentration, as in the ALBIOS study. The dose chosen by Mira and colleagues in the EARSS study (100 mL of 20% albumin 8 hourly for 3 days) achieved an increase in serum albumin to 25 to 29 g/l, raising the possibility that the albumin dose used may have been too low to show definite benefit – although this increase was similar to that reported in the SAFE study subgroup analysis of patients with sepsis, in whom a benefit was reported.

### Hypovolemia with peripheral edema: what is wrong? [^1129vbVu]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Fluid normally exchanges freely between the plasma and interstitial space and is returned primarily via the lymphatic system. This balance can be disturbed by diseases and medications. In inflammatory disease states, such as sepsis, the return flow of fluid from the interstitial space to the plasma seems to be very slow, which promotes the well-known triad of hypovolemia, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema. Similarly, general anesthesia, for example, even without mechanical ventilation, increases accumulation of infused crystalloid fluid in a slowly equilibrating fraction of the extravascular compartment. Herein, we have combined data from fluid kinetic trials with previously unconnected mechanisms of inflammation, interstitial fluid physiology and lymphatic pathology to synthesize a novel explanation for common and clinically relevant examples of circulatory dysregulation. Experimental studies suggest that two key mechanisms contribute to the combination of hypovolemia, hypoalbuminemia and edema; (1) acute lowering of the interstitial pressure by inflammatory mediators such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 and, (2) nitric oxide-induced inhibition of intrinsic lymphatic pumping.

Serum albumin and congestion assessment in HF — serum albumin levels should be checked routinely at HF admission, and peripheral edema should be interpreted with caution in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, which has been associated with up to 6-fold higher in-hospital mortality; reduced plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia enhances extravascular fluid accumulation, for which overzealous diuresis may deplete intravascular volume and decrease renal function and blood pressure, particularly with nephrotic syndrome or chronic malnutrition.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113HqmsY]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia represents a risk factor for medical treatment. It has long been known that patients in intensive care suffering from shock, infection, or trauma react inadequately to a renewed challenge like surgery. This has also been called the phenomenon of the second hit. 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131 Despite not always appreciating the precise cause of the connection with inflammation, many surgeons know that a low serum albumin level is a bad omen for outcome after surgery. 100, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138 The problem is apparently due to the preexistent inflammatory state, compromising a further adequate inflammatory response after surgery. To improve outcome, treatment should be directed primarily to decrease inflammation by eliminating the inflammatory cause. This is especially relevant when dealing with infection before embarking on a surgical approach. If this is impossible, eg, in the presence of generalized peritonitis or abscesses, acute surgical intervention is required. However, the surgical approach should be adapted, avoiding extensive oncologic surgery or the construction of hazardous intestinal anastomoses, but instead only trying to achieve "damage control". 100, 128, 139 This may include drainage of abscesses or removal of infected, damaged, or ischemic tissues. When this approach is successful, nutrition support becomes effective, promoting fat‐free mass (muscle) and adequate healing after eventual reoperation, for instance, to restore gastrointestinal continuity and to close the abdominal wall. 100, 139 It should be noted that with successful treatment of the cause of the inflammatory response, patients will lose weight due to reduction of edema and to fluid loss, but will regain function. In addition, full recovery and normo‐albuminemia will only be reached after months. A restorative reoperation should be postponed at least 6–12 weeks.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^114CHX3w]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Decreased cerebral edema after hyperoncotic albumin administration was shown in one included randomized trial. Reduction in cerebral edema and other sequelae of brain injury by hyperoncotic albumin has also been repeatedly demonstrated in other studies. In a non-randomized trial of 22 patients with putaminal hemorrhage, 50 to 100 ml/day of 25% albumin with concomitant furosemide significantly reduced brain edema as assessed by computed tomography. No albumin recipient died or remained in a vegetative state compared with 27% of crystalloid recipients. In a cohort study of 10 patients with elevated intracranial pressure and brain edema, infusion of 2 g/kg 25% albumin over 60 min produced a significant and long-lasting (≥ 9 h) decline in intracerebral pressure. Among hemorrhagic stroke patients, rapid infusion of 50 mL 20% albumin promptly and significantly reversed electroencephalographic abnormalities. The randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multi-center Albumin in Acute Stroke (ALIAS) clinical trial funded by the US National Institutes with a target enrollment of 1,800 patients is evaluating the neuroprotective effects of 25% albumin as compared with saline.

According to experimental cerebral ischemia studies, hyperoncotic albumin can reduce infarct volume and edema, augment cortical perfusion and improve functional outcome. In head trauma models, hyperoncotic albumin increased neurological score and reduced brain tissue edema and damage.

All three included randomized trials in nephrotic syndrome indicated the ability of hyperoncotic to promote diuresis, and one of these trials also provided direct evidence of edema reduction. In a non-randomized study of 14 severely edematous children with minimal change nephrotic syndrome, 20% albumin infused at an albumin dose of 0.5 g/kg over 1 h followed by furosemide reduced pretibial edema and body weight within 1 h (p < 0.05). These effects persisted for at least 24 h (p < 0.005).

### Fluid management in the critically ill [^111fSKis]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Fluid therapy, which is provided to restore and maintain tissue perfusion, is part of routine management for almost all critically ill patients. However, because either too much or too little fluid can have a negative impact on patient outcomes, fluid administration must be titrated carefully for each patient. The "salvage, optimization, stabilization, de-escalation" (SOSD) mnemonic should be used as a general guide to fluid resuscitation, and fluid administration should be adapted according to the course of the disease. In the initial salvage phase, lifesaving fluid should be administered generously. Once hemodynamic monitoring is available, fluid administration should be optimized by determining the patient's fluid status and the need for further fluid. This determination can be difficult, however; clinical indicators of hypovolemia, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, may not detect early hypovolemia, and edema is a late sign of fluid overload. Dynamic tests of fluid responsiveness such as pulse pressure or stroke volume variation can be used in only a small percentage of critically ill patients, and thus a fluid challenge technique is most frequently used to assess ongoing fluid requirements. Once a patient has been stabilized, efforts should start to concentrate on removing excess fluid. Which fluid should be used remains a matter of some debate. Crystalloid solutions are cheaper than colloid solutions, but colloid solutions remain in the intravascular space for a longer period, making edema less likely. Thus crystalloids and colloids should be used together, especially in patients likely to require large fluid volumes. Human albumin is a natural colloid and may have beneficial effects in patients with sepsis in addition to its volume effects. Fluids should be prescribed as are other medications, taking into account individual patient factors, disease processes, and other treatments.

### Albumin in critical care: SAFE, but worth its salt? [^1165JqZG]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Intravascular fluid therapy is a common critical care intervention. However, the optimal type of resuscitation fluid, crystalloid or colloid, remains controversial. Despite the many theoretical benefits of human albumin administration in critically ill patients, there has been little evidence to support its widespread clinical use. Previous systematic reviews have led to conflicting results regarding the safety and efficacy of albumin. The recently reported Saline versus Albumin Evaluation study has provided conclusive evidence that 4% albumin is as safe as saline for resuscitation, although no overall benefit of albumin use was seen. Subgroup analysis of the albumin-treated group revealed a trend towards decreased mortality in patients with septic shock, and a trend towards increased mortality in trauma patients, especially those with traumatic brain injury. The results of these subgroups, as well as the use of higher albumin concentrations and other synthetic colloids (dextrans, starches), require rigorous evaluation in clinical trials. Finally, the Saline versus Albumin Evaluation trial represents a methodological milestone in critical care medicine, due to its size, its efficient trial design, and its logistical coordination. Future studies are still required, however, to establish a therapeutic niche for albumin and other colloids.

### The intravascular volume effect of Ringer's lactate is below 20%: a prospective study in humans [^115TfPdZ]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Isotonic crystalloids play a central role in perioperative fluid management. Isooncotic preparations of colloids (for example, human albumin or hydroxyethyl starch) remain nearly completely intravascular when infused to compensate for acute blood losses. Recent data were interpreted to indicate a comparable intravascular volume effect for crystalloids, challenging the occasionally suggested advantage of using colloids to treat hypovolemia. General physiological knowledge and clinical experience, however, suggest otherwise.

Methods

In a prospective study, double-tracer blood volume measurements were performed before and after intended normovolemic hemodilution in ten female adults, simultaneously substituting the three-fold amount of withdrawn blood with Ringer's lactate. Any originated deficits were substituted with half the volume of 20% human albumin, followed by a further assessment of blood volume. To assess significance between the measurements, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) according to Fisher were performed. If significant results were shown, paired t tests (according to Student) for the singular measurements were taken. P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results

A total of 1,097 ± 285 mL of whole blood were withdrawn (641 ± 155 ml/m² body surface area) and simultaneously replaced by 3,430 ± 806 mL of Ringer's lactate. All patients showed a significant decrease in blood volume after hemodilution (-459 ± 185 ml; P < 0.05) that did not involve relevant hemodynamical changes, and a significant increase in interstitial water content (+2,157 ± 606 ml; P < 0.05). The volume effect of Ringer's lactate was 17 ± 10%. The infusion of 245 ± 64 mL of 20% human albumin in this situation restored blood volume back to baseline values, the volume effect being 184 ± 63%.

Conclusions

Substitution of isolated intravascular deficits in cardiopulmonary healthy adults with the three-fold amount of Ringer's lactate impedes maintenance of intravascular normovolemia. The main side effect was an impressive interstitial fluid accumulation, which was partly restored by the intravenous infusion of 20% human albumin. We recommend to substitute the five-fold amount of crystalloids or to use an isooncotic preparation in the face of acute bleeding in patients where edema prevention might be advantageous.

### Is the literature inconclusive about the harm from HES? No [^114sGC8N]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colloid solutions may be more effective than crystalloid solutions in expanding the intravascular space, which may result in improved hemodynamics and reduced tissue edema. Whether this is clinically important is unknown. Despite lack of evidence of overall benefit in terms of clinical or patient-important outcome measures, hydroxyethyl starch (HES), an artificial colloid solution, has been used in a variety of clinical settings to treat hypovolemia including during surgery, after trauma and burns, in sepsis, and in critically ill patients. As we will outline below, HES has clear side effects based on well-described pathophysiologic pathways resulting in worse outcome in critically ill patients.

### Hypovolemia with peripheral edema: what is wrong? [^112JX1jG]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We have reviewed molecular and macroscopic evidence showing that the interstitial space plays an active role in the development of pathological fluid distributions characterized by hypovolemia, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema. An important pathway consists of swelling of the gel phase due to loss of integrin-cellular interactions caused by inflammatory signals. This dramatically reduces the interstitial hydrostatic pressure which applies a suction effect on the plasma and prolongs the time period when distributed fluid resides in the interstitium. Associated actions of nitric oxide involves an inhibition of lymphatic pumping. These events are reflected in macroscopic studies using volume kinetics, which identifies a small interstitial pool of rapidly exchanging fluid and a large pool which equilibrates slowly. General anesthesia modestly increases of the absorption of fluid into the slowly exchanging pool. Inflammatory disorders (cholecystitis and sepsis) greatly prolong the time period when the infused fluid resides in the slowly exchanging fluid pool, and the resulting swelling occurs in part at the expense of the size of the rapidly equilibrating pool.
