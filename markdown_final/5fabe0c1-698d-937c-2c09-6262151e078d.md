## Question

Alcoholism and low potassium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between alcoholism and low potassium, including mechanisms, clinical significance, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and how often hypokalemia occurs in alcohol use disorder. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms, including gastrointestinal losses, renal handling, and transcellular shifts. Next, I will examine the clinical consequences, especially cardiac and neuromuscular complications, and consider special contexts like alcoholic ketoacidosis and withdrawal. After that, I need to check guideline-based management principles, including potassium repletion, magnesium correction, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical approach and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology so I don't overstate the risk. Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients, and alcoholism is a recognized risk factor, with one inpatient series noting hypokalemia in 12.6% of hospitalized patients with alcoholism, which is substantially higher than the 2% seen in otherwise healthy adults, underscoring the clinical relevance in this population [^fe682e77] [^0fb89e21].

> Now, I need to verify the mechanisms linking alcoholism to low potassium. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the causes are multifactorial. Chronic alcohol use can cause direct renal magnesium wasting, and because hypomagnesemia disinhibits ROMK channels in the collecting duct, potassium excretion increases, worsening hypokalemia; this mechanistic link is well described in contemporary reviews and explains why hypokalemia in alcohol use disorder often coexists with hypomagnesemia [^7e9504e6]. I should also consider gastrointestinal losses from vomiting and diarrhea, which are common in heavy drinkers, and the catecholamine surge during withdrawal that can shift potassium intracellularly, transiently lowering serum potassium despite total body deficits [^7e9504e6] [^b043e50d]. But wait, what if the patient has alcoholic ketoacidosis? In that scenario, poor intake, vomiting, and metabolic acidosis with beta-hydroxybutyrate accumulation can compound electrolyte losses and shift potassium intracellularly, so I need to keep AKA in mind when evaluating severe hypokalemia in alcoholics [^bd48e7e6].

> Next, I should review the clinical consequences so I prioritize appropriately. Severe hypokalemia can precipitate life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation, and it also causes muscle weakness that can progress to rhabdomyolysis; case reports document rhabdomyolysis secondary to profound hypokalemia after binge drinking, with marked CK elevations and renal dysfunction that improve with potassium repletion and supportive care [^0fb89e21] [^65478ef0]. I should double-check the neuromuscular phenotype; acute hypokalemic myopathy in alcoholism can present with diffuse weakness without pain or tenderness and is largely reversible with potassium correction, which helps distinguish it from other myopathies [^28b1ae2f]. Let me also consider that hypokalemia is a recognized predictor of progression to delirium tremens in trauma patients with alcohol withdrawal, reinforcing the need to correct electrolytes proactively in at-risk populations [^ae0fc0c6].

> I will now examine the management principles, starting with potassium repletion. For severe hypokalemia, especially with symptoms or ECG changes, intravenous potassium chloride is indicated, whereas oral potassium is appropriate for mild to moderate deficits; I should confirm that contemporary primary care guidance supports reserving IV potassium for severe cases or when oral therapy is not feasible, which it does [^db4d3633]. Wait, let me verify the role of magnesium; because hypomagnesemia perpetuates renal potassium wasting, correcting magnesium is essential to durable potassium repletion, and ASAM recommends selectively correcting hypomagnesemia in patients with alcohol use disorder, particularly when arrhythmias or prior withdrawal seizures are present [^62315262] [^017dfaba]. I should also remember that in the setting of alcoholic ketoacidosis, management includes dextrose, thiamine, fluids, and electrolyte repletion, with close monitoring of potassium as insulin and glucose shift potassium intracellularly during treatment [^bd48e7e6].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and safety nuances. In patients with alcohol use disorder, electrolytes should be checked frequently during acute care, and in those at risk for refeeding syndrome, potassium, magnesium, and phosphate should be monitored every 12 hours early in feeding, with thiamine given before dextrose to mitigate Wernicke risk; this is standard in ASPEN guidance and aligns with addiction medicine practice [^a7d9f186] [^62315262]. I need to ensure I'm not overpromising on magnesium for withdrawal itself; while correcting hypomagnesemia is important, ASAM notes insufficient evidence to use magnesium as prophylaxis or treatment for alcohol withdrawal per se, so magnesium should be used for documented deficiency or specific indications rather than routinely for withdrawal symptoms [^e6a57e4b] [^2c7ade66].

> Let me consider special contexts that change management. In trauma patients with alcohol withdrawal, baseline hypokalemia predicts progression to delirium tremens, so I should have a low threshold for aggressive correction and close monitoring in this group [^ae0fc0c6]. In adolescents with acute alcohol intoxication, hypokalemia is a frequent laboratory abnormality, reminding me to screen broadly for electrolyte derangements even when the clinical picture seems straightforward [^4db1cce9]. But wait, what if the patient also has hyponatremia? In chronic hyponatremia, especially with alcoholism, malnutrition, or hypokalemia, the risk of osmotic demyelination is higher, so sodium correction should be conservative, typically not exceeding 8 mmol/L in 24 hours in high-risk patients, with even stricter limits in some guidelines, to mitigate ODS risk [^cf662663] [^ea1ef1fd].

> I should double-check the practical approach so it's actionable. First, identify and treat the underlying alcohol use disorder and withdrawal while correcting electrolytes. Second, assess severity and symptoms to choose oral versus IV potassium. Third, check and correct magnesium concurrently because hypomagnesemia undermines potassium repletion. Fourth, monitor potassium closely, anticipating rebound hypokalemia in some cases, and adjust repletion accordingly. Fifth, address nutrition and thiamine to prevent refeeding complications and Wernicke encephalopathy. And sixth, educate on recurrence risk and arrange follow-up electrolyte monitoring after discharge [^62315262] [^a7d9f186].

> In summary, alcoholism is a major risk factor for hypokalemia through renal magnesium wasting with secondary potassium losses, gastrointestinal losses, and transcellular shifts during withdrawal; clinically, this can manifest as arrhythmias and rhabdomyolysis, and management hinges on prompt potassium repletion with simultaneous magnesium correction, vigilant monitoring, and attention to withdrawal and refeeding dynamics, which together reduce morbidity and improve outcomes in this high-risk population [^fe682e77] [^7e9504e6] [^65478ef0] [^62315262].

Alcoholism is a major cause of **hypokalemia** due to gastrointestinal losses (vomiting, diarrhea), renal wasting (polyuria, ketoacidosis), and poor intake. Hypokalemia in alcoholics increases the risk of **arrhythmias**, muscle weakness, and rhabdomyolysis, and is often worsened by coexisting hypomagnesemia. Management requires **correcting potassium and magnesium**, treating withdrawal, and monitoring for complications; **oral potassium is first-line** unless severe or symptomatic, with IV potassium reserved for emergencies [^db4d3633].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of hypokalemia in alcoholism

Several mechanisms contribute to **hypokalemia** in patients with alcohol use disorder:

- **Gastrointestinal losses**: Chronic alcohol use often leads to gastritis, vomiting, and diarrhea, resulting in significant potassium loss [^0fb89e21].

- **Renal losses**: Alcohol-induced polyuria, ketoacidosis, and renal tubular dysfunction increase renal potassium excretion [^7e9504e6].

- **Poor dietary intake**: Chronic alcoholics frequently have inadequate dietary potassium intake, exacerbating deficiencies [^0fb89e21].

- **Magnesium deficiency**: Alcoholism commonly causes hypomagnesemia, which impairs Na+/K+-ATPase function and promotes renal potassium wasting, making hypokalemia refractory to treatment until magnesium is corrected [^7e9504e6].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

Hypokalemia in alcoholics is clinically significant and associated with **severe complications**:

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Hypokalemia increases the risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac disease or alcohol withdrawal [^0fb89e21].

- **Muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis**: Severe hypokalemia can cause profound muscle weakness, paralysis, and rhabdomyolysis, especially after binge drinking [^65478ef0].

- **Neuromuscular symptoms**: Patients may present with cramps, paresthesia, and tetany, significantly impacting daily functioning [^0fb89e21].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with alcohol-related hypokalemia may present with:

- **Fatigue and muscle weakness**: Particularly in the proximal limbs [^0fb89e21].

- **Cardiac symptoms**: Palpitations, chest discomfort, and syncope due to arrhythmias [^0fb89e21].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, and constipation [^0fb89e21].

- **Neuromuscular symptoms**: Cramping, paresthesia, and tetany [^0fb89e21].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **Serum potassium measurement**: Confirm hypokalemia (normal range 3.5–5.0 mmol/L) [^0fb89e21].

- **Magnesium level assessment**: Identify coexisting hypomagnesemia, which is common and critical for management [^7e9504e6].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Detect arrhythmias or characteristic changes (flattened T waves, U waves, ST depression) [^0fb89e21].

- **Assessment of acid-base status**: Identify metabolic alkalosis or acidosis contributing to potassium shifts [^0fb89e21].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of hypokalemia in alcoholics involves:

- **Potassium supplementation**: Oral potassium chloride is first-line for mild to moderate hypokalemia; intravenous potassium is reserved for severe cases or when oral intake is not feasible [^db4d3633].

- **Magnesium correction**: Essential for successful potassium repletion, as hypomagnesemia perpetuates renal potassium wasting [^7e9504e6].

- **Addressing underlying causes**: Treat alcohol withdrawal, correct acid-base disturbances, and manage gastrointestinal losses [^62315262].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor serum potassium and magnesium levels, especially during active treatment and withdrawal management [^aa417251].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

The prognosis depends on the severity of hypokalemia, underlying comorbidities, and adherence to treatment. Recurrence is common without sustained alcohol abstinence and dietary improvement, necessitating **ongoing monitoring and support** [^notfound].

---

Alcoholism is a significant cause of **hypokalemia** through gastrointestinal and renal losses, poor intake, and magnesium deficiency. Hypokalemia in this population can cause severe complications, including arrhythmias and rhabdomyolysis. Management focuses on correcting potassium and magnesium, treating underlying causes, and monitoring for complications, with recurrence common without sustained abstinence and dietary improvement.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^fe682e77]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range of plasma potassium is 3.5–5.1 mmol/l. Daily potassium requirements of a 70kg male are 70 mmol compared to a 40kg woman who will need 40 mmol. Hypokalaemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised patients. When defined as a value of less than 3.5 mmol/L, hypokalaemia is found in 20% of hospital inpatients, but occurs in only 2% of otherwise healthy adults. Approximately 5% of hospitalised patients with confirmed hypokalaemia have serum potassium concentrations of < 3.0 mmol/l. Additionally, up to 50% of patients with normal potassium on admission may develop hypokalaemia during their inpatient stay.

Deviations to both extremes (hypo- and hyperkalaemia) are related to an increased risk of cardiac complications. Potassium levels below 3.0 mmol/l may cause significant Q-T interval prolongation with subsequent risk of torsade des pointes, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death. Those at particular risk are patients with cardiac ischemia, heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy, in whom even mild-to-moderate hypokalaemia increases the likelihood of cardiac arrhythmias. For example, the mortality rate of hospitalised hypokalaemic patients with cardiovascular disease was 10-fold higher than the general hospitalised population.

Hypokalaemia can be life-threatening when severe (< 2.5 mmol/L) but is usually well tolerated in otherwise healthy people and patients are often asymptomatic. Consequently, the diagnosis is easily missed and recognition of high risk patients, frequent laboratory monitoring, and prompt treatment is essential to reduce the incidence of hypokalaemic complications. Risk of hypokalemia in patients taking diuretics is higher in the elderly and enhanced by concomitant illness, such as heart failure or nephrotic syndrome. Latrogenic causes are also important to consider. Of patients taking non–potassium-sparing diuretics, 10% to 40% develop hypokalemia. Other morbidities associated with a higher incidence of hypokalemia include; 21% of hospitalised patients with AIDS, 12.6% of hospitalised patients with alcoholism, and patients after bariatric surgery.

### Binge alcohol consumption leading to hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis [^65478ef0]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 43-year-old man presented with acute onset rapidly progressive weakness in all four limbs (proximal greater than distal), following an episode of binge alcohol ingestion, and was admitted for evaluation and management. There was a history of decreased urine output since 2 days with dark-coloured urine. He was found to have severe hypokalemia and renal dysfunction. Serum creatine kinase was significantly high, and further investigation revealed significantly elevated serum and urine myoglobin levels suggestive of rhabdomyolysis, which was secondary to severe hypokalemia. Following supplementation with intravenous and oral potassium and supportive care, the weakness improved significantly, and he was subsequently discharged. This case describes severe hypokalemia, resulting in rhabdomyolysis and generalised lower motor neuron weakness, in a setting of binge alcohol ingestion, which is an entity rarely described in literature.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^0b5f80bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and dilutional hyponatremia) should be monitored and corrected. A high index of suspicion for malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies (folate, vitamins A, D, E, K, and complex B) needs to be maintained. Early supplementation of these nutrients is also recommended, particularly in alcoholic liver disease. Hypoglycemia, from impaired gluconeogenesis, should also be expected and promptly corrected. Blood lactate level, a specific marker of tissue ischemia, can be significantly elevated in the context of chronic liver disease due to impaired hepatic clearance. Nevertheless, the trend in serial measurements in serum lactate in response to resuscitation may be a useful adjunct in hemodynamic assessment. Mild increases in aminotransferases (AST and ALT) are commonly noted in chronic liver disease, reflecting active hepatic injury. Marked elevation (greater than 1000 IU/l), however, suggests acute viral, alcoholic, or ischemic hepatitis. In asymptomatic patients with three or more fold increases in ALT/AST levels or any elevation in bilirubin, the incidence of undiagnosed cirrhosis ranges from 6 to 34%.

The precise etiology of the underlying hepatic disease mandates specific treatment measures. Thiamine replacement with glucose infusion is indicated to prevent progression of Wernicke encephalopathy. The risk of symptoms from alcohol withdrawal also mandates supportive measures, as well as multivitamins. Patients on chronic steroids for autoimmune hepatitis should receive a stress-dose adjustment in the perioperative period. Finally, delays in restarting anti-viral therapy for hepatitis should be avoided.

### Magnesium biology [^7e9504e6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

MAGNESIUM PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Mg 2+ deficiency (serum Mg 2+ < 0.7 mmol/L) can result in symptoms such as fatigue, muscle cramps and arrythmias, and in severe cases developmental delay and seizures. Risk factors for the development of hypomagnesemia include age, gastrointestinal track diseases, type 2 diabetes and excessive alcohol consumption, as well as the use of certain pharmacological drugs. With a prevalence of ± 2.5% in the general population and about 12%–20% in hospitalized patients, hypomagnesemia is especially important in patients with pre-existing comorbidities, and needs to be treated adequately.

Patients rarely present with hypermagnesemia, which can be caused by excessive amount of Mg 2+ ingestion either through Mg 2+ supplementation or drugs high in Mg 2+ such as laxatives and Epsom salts.

Notably, hypomagnesemia often is accompanied by hypokalemia or hypocalcemia. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased inhibition of ROMK in the collecting duct in response to hypomagnesemia. ROMK is inhibited by Mg 2+, stimulating basolateral excretion of K +. Therefore, low Mg 2+ levels lead to decreased inhibition of ROMK, resulting in increased efflux of K + into the pre-urine resulting in hypokalemia and increased excretion of K +.

Low Mg 2+ levels lead to increases CaSR signaling in the parathyroid gland, resulting in decreased PTH secretion ultimately resulting in decreased Ca 2+ levels via secondary mechanisms such as decreased vitamin D levels needed for Ca 2+ absorption. However, the exact mechanism and regulation of Ca 2+ levels in response to hypomagnesemia remain elusive.

Alcohol-induced hypomagnesemia

Hypomagnesemia is often seen in people with increased alcohol consumption. It has already been shown decades ago that chronic alcohol consumption is associated with decreased serum Mg 2+ levels and hypermagnesuria. Next to the direct effect of alcohol on urinary Mg 2+ wasting, secondary effects such as vomiting or diarrhea may further contribute to hypomagnesemia in alcohol-dependent patients. Furthermore, other comorbidities of alcohol abuse, such as acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis, have been shown to be associated with decreased serum Mg 2+ levels. Mg 2+ supplementation has been suggested to ease alcohol withdrawal, while it is remains inconclusive whether Mg 2+ positively influences this process. A recent study demonstrated that 60% of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome have hypomagnesemia, which was associated with an increased 1-year mortality risk.

### Acute alcohol intoxication in pediatric emergencies [^fc56050d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol intoxication in pediatrics is a growing problem in our environment. The objectives of this study are to define the prevalence of acute alcohol intoxication in the pediatric emergency department (PED) and to describe the associated symptoms and their relationship with potential risk factors.

Methods and Material

This cross-sectional study includes patients younger than 16 years with a diagnosis of acute alcohol intoxication between March 2010 and October 2018 in the PED of a tertiary hospital. Patients with concomitant intoxication by other substances were excluded. The association between qualitative variables was determined using the χ 2 or Fisher exact test and quantitative with the Student t, Mann-Whitney U test, and simple linear regression.

Results

There were 136 episodes of alcohol intoxication, which represents a prevalence of 24.1/100,000 emergencies. After excluding 10 patients because of positive screening for other drugs, 126 patients with a mean age of 14.5 years (SD, 1.2 years) were included, 57.9% of whom were women. A total of 25.4% of the patients were younger than 14 years. Ethanolemia was determined in 88.9%, and its mean concentration was 195.7 mg/dL (SD, 56.5 mg/dL), with potentially serious levels (> 300 mg/dL) being found in 3.6% of the patients. A relationship was found between the Glasgow Coma Scale score and ethanolemia (B = -12.7; 95% confidence interval, -8.1 to -17.4; P < 0.001), as well as with potassium (B = -31, 9; 95% confidence interval, -6.6 to -57.3; P = 0.014). No patient had seizures or hypoglycemia. A total of 10.3% of the patients required admission.

Conclusions

Alcohol intoxication is a rare consultation reason in the PED. They usually present with mild and self-limited symptoms, being the decrease in the level of consciousness and hypokalemia the most frequent symptom and analytical alteration.

### Metabolic alkalosis from unsuspected ingestion: use of urine pH and anion gap [^7163ea70]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Underlying causes of metabolic alkalosis may be evident from history, evaluation of effective circulatory volume, and measurement of urine chloride concentration. However, identification of causes may be difficult for certain conditions associated with clandestine behaviors, such as surreptitious vomiting, use of drugs or herbal supplements with mineralocorticoid activity, abuse of laxatives or diuretics, and long-term use of alkalis. In these circumstances, clinicians often are bewildered by unexplained metabolic alkalosis from an incomplete history or persistent deception by the patient, leading to misdiagnosis and poor outcome. We present a case of severe metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia with a borderline urine chloride concentration in an alcoholic patient treated with a thiazide. The cause of the patient's metabolic alkalosis eventually was linked to surreptitious ingestion of baking soda. This case highlights the necessity of a high index of suspicion for the diverse clandestine behaviors that can cause metabolic alkalosis and the usefulness of urine pH and anion gap in its differential diagnosis.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^694c3309]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our treatment of hyponatremia should be informed by the best possible data, addressing two critical questions: How much correction is enough and how much is too much? Valid answers to these questions require studies of populations at high risk of complications from both excessive and inadequate correction of hyponatremia — patients with very low serum sodium. A study of individuals diagnosed with MRI-documented myelinolysis in the Swedish National Patient Register during 1997–2011 identified 83 patients with the disorder; 86.7% of patients were hyponatremic (all chronic), with a median sodium level at admission of 104 mmol/L, and all but six had been corrected by > 8 mmol/L in 24 hours. To be reliable, such studies will require rigorous methods to quantify increases in serum sodium throughout the hospital course and to accurately identify all complications — not just the most severe. In the future, those methods might include sophisticated software. But for now, meticulous chart review by hand, the method used when "osmotic demyelination syndrome" was given its name 37 years ago, remains the best approach.

Thankfully, changes in practice patterns have made osmotic demyelination syndrome less common than it was in the 1980s. On the basis of what we know today, correction of a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L by > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours or by > 18 mmol/L within 48 hours should be avoided — not because raising the serum sodium too rapidly commonly causes osmotic demyelination syndrome but because it can cause the syndrome. It has always been clear that overly rapid correction of hyponatremia does not inevitably lead to osmotic demyelination; rather, it is associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination.

The longer the duration of hyponatremia and the lower the serum sodium, the greater the risk for injury from excessive correction. If the sodium is ≤ 105 mmol/L or if there are additional risk factors for osmotic demyelination syndrome (alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease), correction by > 8 mmol/L per day should be considered excessive. The cost of limiting correction (more frequent blood draws and perhaps a somewhat longer hospitalization) is trivial when compared with the devastating consequences that can affect even surviving patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome. We strongly believe that abandoning established safeguards now is a bit like discarding your umbrella because you have remained dry in a rainstorm. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### The effects of magnesium coadminstration during treatment of hypokalemia in the emergency department [^aa410cac]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypokalemia is a common disorder that can negatively affect organ function. Magnesium supplementation is frequently recommended despite limited evidence to support its use.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of magnesium coadministration in patients treated for hypokalemia in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center study evaluated adults treated with intravenous (i.v.) potassium for hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mMol/L) in the ED between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020. Patients given magnesium supplementation within 4 h of potassium administration (MG+) were compared with those not given concurrent magnesium (MG-). The primary outcome was time to potassium normalization (≥ 3.5 mMol/L). Secondary outcomes included clinical effects, adverse effects, and dosing of magnesium and potassium.

Results

Two hundred patients were included (MG+ = 100; MG- = 100). Patients in the MG- group more frequently had history of myocardial infarction (16% vs. 6%; p = 0.02) and alcoholism (16% vs. 6%; p = 0.02). Patients in the MG+ group had higher incidence of symptomatic hypokalemia (34% vs. 19%; p = 0.02) and severe hypokalemia (serum potassium < 2.5 mMol/L) (15% vs. 8%; p = 0.03). There were no differences in time to serum potassium normalization, change in serum potassium after treatment, or incidence of potassium normalization within 24 h of treatment. MG+ patients required more potassium within 24 h of treatment and more frequently developed hypermagnesemia (serum magnesium > 1.1 mMol/L).

Conclusions

Magnesium coadministration during hypokalemia treatment did not affect time to serum potassium normalization but was associated with more hypermagnesemia.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^f1ae8ce8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Electrolyte management — Recommendation V.9 states, "For patients with hypomagnesemia, cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte disturbances, or a previous history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, magnesium should be administered". Recommendation V.10 states, "If phosphorus is < 1 mg/dL supplementation should be provided", and "in the case of moderate hypophosphatemia (1–2 mg/dL), if the patient is malnourished or chronically ill, phosphate supplementation may be considered".

### Etiologic and therapeutic analysis in patients with hypokalemic nonperiodic paralysis [^c5a60cf5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypokalemic nonperiodic paralysis represents a group of heterogeneous disorders with a large potassium (K(+)) deficit. Rapid diagnosis of curable causes with appropriate treatment is challenging to avoid the sequelae of hypokalemia. We prospectively analyzed the etiologies and therapeutic characteristics of hypokalemic nonperiodic paralysis.

Methods

Over an 8-year period, patients with hypokalemic nonperiodic paralysis were enrolled by excluding those with hypokalemic periodic paralysis due to acute shift of K(+) into cells. Blood and spot urine samples were collected for the measurements of electrolytes, pH, and biochemistries. Intravenous potassium chloride (KCl) at a rate of 10–20 mmol/h was administered until muscle strength recovered.

Results

We had identified 58 patients with hypokalemic nonperiodic paralysis from 208 consecutive patients with hypokalemic paralysis, and their average K(+) concentration was 1.8 ± 0.2 mmol/L. Among patients with low urinary K(+) excretion (n = 17), chronic alcoholism, remote diuretic use, and anorexia/bulimia nervosa were the most common causes. Among patients with high urinary K(+) excretion (n = 41) and metabolic acidosis, renal tubular acidosis and chronic toluene abuse were the main causes, while primary aldosteronism, Gitelman syndrome, and diuretics were the leading diagnoses with metabolic alkalosis. The average KCl dose needed to restore muscle strength was 3.8 ± 0.8 mmol/kg. Initial lower plasma K(+), volume depletion, and high urinary K(+) excretion were associated with higher recovery KCl dosage. During therapy, patients with paradoxical hypokalemia (n = 32) who required more KCl supplementation than patients without (4.1 ± 0.7 vs 3.4 ± 0.7 mmol/kg, P < 0.001) often exhibited significantly higher plasma renin activity and received a higher volume of normal saline before its appearance.

Conclusions

Understanding the common etiologies of hypokalemic nonperiodic paralysis may aid in early diagnosis. Patients with initial lower plasma K(+), renal K(+) wasting, and hypovolemia required higher recovery K(+) dosage. Paradoxical hypokalemia is prone to develop in hypovolemic patients even during K(+) supplementation with volume repletion.

### Steroid-induced hypokalemic periodic paralysis: a case report and literature review [^78c67cc5]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is a rare channelopathy characterized by episodic attacks of acute muscle weakness concomitant with hypokalemia. The etiology of hypokalemia is the shift of potassium into the cells, and the clinical symptoms resolve when potassium starts to leak back to the serum. Most of the time, the underlying ion channel defects are well compensated, and an additional trigger is often required to initiate an attack. Well-known trigger factors include carbohydrate-rich meals, exercise followed by rest, stress, cold weather, and alcohol consumption.

Case Presentation

Here, we present the case of a 26-year-old Asian man who suffered from an acute onset of bilateral lower limb weakness with hypokalemia following dexamethasone injection. He was diagnosed with HPP.

Conclusions

We would like to remind physicians to think of steroids as an unusual precipitating factor while managing patients with HPP, per results of this case study.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^075181d3]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The applicability of guidelines remains a major issue. The target audience are the clinicians who may infrequently encounter an ill patient with either acute symptomatic hyponatraemia requiring urgent correction or a patient with profound chronic hyponatraemia and additional risk factors (malnourished, hypokalaemia, history of alcoholism) for the osmotic demyelination syndrome. It is improbable that clinicians would always be able to quickly access or indeed assimilate the comprehensive advice in scholarly recent publications on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia. For instance, Spasovski et al. (European Guideline Development Group) produced a 39 page clinical practice guideline and Verbalis et al. (Expert Panel Recommendations) published an extensive narrative review running to 42 pages. These guidelines are freely available but have several important differences, particularly in relation to the drug treatment of chronic hyponatraemia, which may lead to some confusion for clinicians. If appropriate, fluid restriction is used in the management of chronic hyponatraemia but this is frequently of limited efficacy. Additional pharmacological agents have been used, including demeclocycline, lithium, urea, loop diuretics, and vaptan drugs (conivaptan and tolvaptan). Tolvaptan has been used more extensively in the USA for the treatment of hypervolaemic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia compared to Europe, where tolvaptan's licence is restricted to hyponatraemia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone. The European clinical practice guideline has been widely endorsed by European specialist societies for nephrologists, endocrinologists, and intensive care medicine clinicians.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^9c7ca528]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide.

Gynecomastia

Gynecomastia may develop in association with the use of spironolactone; physicians should be alert to its possible onset. The development of gynecomastia appears to be related to both dosage level and duration of therapy and is normally reversible when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are discontinued. In rare instances, some breast enlargement may persist when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are discontinued.

Somnolence

Somnolence and dizziness have been reported to occur in some patients. Caution is advised when driving or operating machinery until the response to initial treatment has been determined.

Information for Patients

Patients who receive spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide should be advised to avoid potassium supplements and foods containing high levels of potassium including salt substitutes.

Non-melanoma Skin Cancer

Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening.

Laboratory Tests

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be done at appropriate intervals, particularly in the elderly and those with significant renal or hepatic impairments.

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists, Aldosterone Blockers, Potassium Supplements, Heparin, Low Molecular Weight Heparin, and Other Drugs Known to Cause Hyperkalemia

Concomitant administration may lead to severe hyperkalemia.

Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics

Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

### Disulfiram [^ddaf0f49]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial with Alcohol

During early experience with disulfiram, it was thought advisable for each patient to have at least one supervised alcohol-drug reaction. More recently, the test reaction has been largely abandoned. Furthermore, such a test reaction should never be administered to a patient over 50 years of age. A clear, detailed and convincing description of the reaction is felt to be sufficient in most cases.

However, where a test reaction is deemed necessary, the suggested procedure is as follows:

After the first one to two weeks' therapy with 500 mg daily, a drink of 15 mL (1/2 oz) of 100 proof whiskey, or equivalent, is taken slowly. This test dose of alcoholic beverage may be repeated once only, so that the total dose does not exceed 30 mL (1 oz) of whiskey. Once a reaction develops, no more alcohol should be consumed. Such tests should be carried out only when the patient is hospitalized, or comparable supervision and facilities, including oxygen, are available.

Management of Disulfiram-Alcohol Reaction

In severe reactions, whether caused by an excessive test dose or by the patient's unsupervised ingestion of alcohol, supportive measures to restore blood pressure and treat shock should be instituted. Other recommendations include: oxygen, carbogen (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide), vitamin C intravenously in massive doses (1 g) and ephedrine sulfate. Antihistamines have also been used intravenously. Potassium levels should be monitored, particularly in patients on digitalis, since hypokalemia has been reported.

### Approach to treatment of hypophosphatemia [^b01c68f0]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatemia can be acute or chronic. Acute hypophosphatemia with phosphate depletion is common in the hospital setting and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Chronic hypophosphatemia, often associated with genetic or acquired renal phosphate-wasting disorders, usually produces abnormal growth and rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Acute hypophosphatemia may be mild (phosphorus level, 2–2.5 mg/dL), moderate (1–1.9 mg/dL), or severe (< 1 mg/dL) and commonly occurs in clinical settings such as refeeding, alcoholism, diabetic ketoacidosis, malnutrition/starvation, and after surgery (particularly after partial hepatectomy) and in the intensive care unit. Phosphate replacement can be given either orally, intravenously, intradialytically, or in total parenteral nutrition solutions. The rate and amount of replacement are empirically determined, and several algorithms are available. Treatment is tailored to symptoms, severity, anticipated duration of illness, and presence of comorbid conditions, such as kidney failure, volume overload, hypo- or hypercalcemia, hypo- or hyperkalemia, and acid-base status. Mild/moderate acute hypophosphatemia usually can be corrected with increased dietary phosphate or oral supplementation, but intravenous replacement generally is needed when significant comorbid conditions or severe hypophosphatemia with phosphate depletion exist. In chronic hypophosphatemia, standard treatment includes oral phosphate supplementation and active vitamin D. Future treatment for specific disorders associated with chronic hypophosphatemia may include cinacalcet, calcitonin, or dypyrimadole.

Inpatients

Inpatient specialist referral may be warranted for patients admitted with harmful drinking or alcohol‐dependence who are experiencing acute withdrawal or at high risk of this (Box 1). This includes urgent/emergency cases and patients admitted for planned detoxification. Close liaison aids early awareness of any potential issues but also facilitates assessment of community withdrawal success and guides the decision for further support.

Box 1
Clinical features of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Adapted from

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome
Acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome describes a spectrum of clinical sequelae typically occurring after abrupt cessation of alcohol consumption in patients with chronic, harmful intake.
It has been attributed to impaired neurotransmitter regulation in the central nervous system, whereby chronically elevated cerebral ethanol concentrations decrease sensitivity to inhibitory gamma‐amino butyric acid (GABA) and interfere with glutamate receptor binding, causing compensatory upregulation of excitatory N‐methyl‐D‐Aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The sudden absence of ethanol in this context results in a pro‐excitatory imbalance that causes many of the observed symptoms and signs during withdrawal states.
Minor symptoms typically occur within 6 h and include insomnia; tremor; anxiety; gastrointestinal upset; headache; diaphoresis; and palpitations. More severe features, described below, may occur in some patients.

Withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens
Generalised tonic–clonic seizures may occur, most commonly in patients aged 40–50 years with prolonged harmful intake. Seizure activity is most common 12–48 h following cessation of alcohol intake.
If untreated, one third of alcoholic seizures may progress to delirium tremens, characterised by hypertension; tachycardia; confusion; hallucinations; agitation; and diaphoresis. It is distinct from isolated alcoholic hallucinations, which are not usually accompanied by confusion or deranged vital signs.
With appropriate recognition and management, the mortality from delirium tremens is now < 5%.

Metabolic abnormalities
Patients may be hypovolaemic and demonstrate a metabolic acidosis, frequently accompanied by electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia; hypophosphataemia; and hypomagnesaemia.
Deranged metabolic findings in this group are often multifactorial and interrelated, and themselves may result in organ dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiac failure, arrhythmias, reduced seizure threshold and mortality.

### Hypokalaemia and drinking green tea: a literature review and report of 2 cases [^0abf91a6]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We report the association between excessive consumption of green tea and hypokalaemia in an Oriental couple. Both patients were asymptomatic and the abnormal electrolyte level was only detected on routine blood tests. When they were advised to reduce the consumption of green tea, the abnormally low potassium level was reversed. We have not found such an association reported in the medical literature. The health benefits of green tea consumption are well publicised but the potential side-effects of overconsumption are less well known. We would like to report this association to alert clinicians about this potentially serious complication. This is especially relevant for those who are also taking prescribed medications that can lower potassium levels and/or sensitise patients to potential harm from hypokalaemia.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^69875517]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^cf662663]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

### Disorders of potassium [^891fbdb7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormality identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypo- and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

### An unusual cause of bulbar palsy in the emergency department [^d2d4ced1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osmotic demyelination syndrome commonly occurs after rapid correction of hyponatremia. But it has also been reported after graded correction of hyponatremia in the presence of other risk factors like chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, liver disease, and hypokalemia.

Case Report

We report a case of a 67-year-old man who presented with dysphagia and nasal regurgitation and had features suggestive of bulbar palsy on neurological examination. He had spontaneous rapid correction of hyponatremia from a serum sodium level of 122 mEq/L to 132 mEq/L after discharge from our hospital. Neuroimaging was suggestive of extrapontine myelinolysis involving the basal ganglia. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? An emergency physician should be aware of this because osmotic demyelination syndrome should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with bulbar palsy to the emergency department.

### Potassium chloride supplementation alone may not improve hypokalemia in thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis [^e829a458]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This article reports a 29-year-old man who came to the Emergency Department because of sudden onset of bilateral lower extremity weakness and inability to walk after intake of a high carbohydrate meal and alcohol. He was found to have severe hypokalemia, with K(+) level at 1.7 mmol/L. However, after administration of potassium chloride (KCl), 10 mEq/h intravenous (i.v.) drip for 4 h, follow-up serum potassium was even lower at 1.5 mmol/L and the patient complained of persistent weakness. Twenty mg of propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, was given orally and a dramatic improvement of muscle power to grade 5 was noted after 30 min of administration. On the fifth day after discharge, he had another episode of bilateral lower extremity weakness after ingesting a mouthful of alcohol. Muscle power recovered completely after i.v. drip of KCl, 20 mEq. Laboratory data revealed an underlying primary hyperthyroidism for which he was given anti-thyroid agents and beta-blockers.

### Acute alcohol intoxication-related metabolic and biochemical disturbances in adolescents: a matched case-control study [^4db1cce9]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

We aimed to investigate clinical and laboratory characteristics of acute alcohol intoxication (AAI) in adolescents who presented to the pediatric emergency department (ED) at a tertiary referral center from 2006 to 2019. All consecutive adolescents with AAI (n = 335) and their sex- and age-matched control subjects (n = 335) with undetectable ethanol levels were included in this case-matched study. Mean serum ethanol level was 156.4 ± 58.4 (range: 50.8–341.2) mg/dL in the acute alcohol intoxication (AAI) group. Glasgow coma scores were lower in AAI group (14 [14–15] vs 15 [15–15], P < .001). Acidosis (16.3%), hyperlactatemia (60.9%), hypoglycemia (1.7%), hypernatremia (2.2%), hypokalemia (12.3%), hyperchloremia (20.4%), hypocalcemia (13.9%), hypermagnesemia (9.7%), and hyperalbuminemia (10.4%) were significantly more common in the AAI group than the control group. Blood pH, lactate, Na+, K+, Ca++, Mg++, albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid levels were correlated with serum ethanol levels. This study shows that AAI frequently leads to mild to moderate metabolic/biochemical derangements in adolescents.

### Caffeine-induced hypokalemia: a case report [^d092a7d9]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

This patient had no history of diabetes, but was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus through serially measured blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c after hospitalization as the third event. Hypokalemia has been reported to be associated with diabetes mellitus in various ways. Hypokalemia is known to be associated with impaired insulin secretion by hypokalemia-mediated beta-cell dysfunction, increased hepatic glucose production, and decreased peripheral glucose utilization resulting in glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia. Also, there is a study showing that insulin sensitivity was restored after correction of hypokalemia. In this patient, chronic clinical or subclinical hypokalemia may have been associated with diabetes mellitus. However, although the hypokalemia was completely improved and did not recur through the change of the diet (mainly on reducing caffeine), the oral anti-diabetic drug was not able to stop, so it is considered that his diabetes was a part of metabolic syndrome.

At our patient's first and second visits, we tried to calculate the TTKG from his spot urine values, but there was a limitation to interpreting the TTKG because his urine osmolality was lower than his serum osmolality. He reported urinating at least 10 times a day while awake, and our findings suggested that his polyuria was related to the excessive caffeine intake itself and urinary concentrating defect in hypokalemia. That also explained why his spot urine osmolality was too diluted to calculate TTKG. In this patient, 24-hour urine potassium excretion was measured once and high potassium excretion was shown. However, since clinically urgent potassium repletion was required at the time, the urine collection was proceeded with concomitant IV potassium replacement. Therefore, although the 24-hour urine potassium excretion is the most accurate method to measure urinary potassium excretion, it is thought that potassium excretion measured by spot urine is more meaningful than the value of 24-hours potassium excretion in this setting.

Excessive caffeine intake was not considered as a major cause of hypokalemia in previous studies. Although there are individual differences, modern people ingest reasonable amounts of caffeinated beverages daily. However, physicians should pay attention to patients' drinking habits of caffeinated beverages during evaluations of hypokalemia.

In conclusion, excessive caffeine intake can cause repetitive episodes of hypokalemia. Physicians should pay more attention to patients' caffeine intake as well as several metabolic or endocrinological causes during the work-up for hypokalemia by taking a detailed history.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^7dd0da49]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Other risk factors for SAWS have been inferred from small, retrospective studies lacking separate validation cohorts. Importantly, the strongest identified predictors of SAWS include previous hospitalizations complicated by SAWS (e.g. prior episodes of severe withdrawal), diagnosis of AUD, and heavy alcohol consumption as measured by using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (,–). In one meta-analysis, a history of delirium tremens had a likelihood ratio of 2.9 for the development of SAWS and was a stronger predictor than a history of withdrawal seizures. Other variables, including demographic characteristics, vital signs, laboratory values, and comorbidities, have been reported, but findings were mainly from small retrospective studies. Among this list of reported variables are an elevated systolic blood pressure, a blood alcohol concentration above 200 mg/dl, elevated blood urea nitrogen, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia (,–). Few studies have examined how differences in patient characteristics (e.g. demographic data, laboratory values, vital signs, mental status, medical history) influence the utility of existing tools for predicting SAWS. Measurable inpatient variables may be confounded by the effects of comorbid conditions that commonly coexist in acutely ill patients, diminishing their potential utility for the assessment of SAWS risk. The potential for misclassification should also be considered a limitation in applying these findings to critically ill patients, and further studies are needed to demonstrate their added value.

Diagnosis and Disease Severity

Early and aggressive titration of pharmacotherapy guided by clinical effects is necessary to improve treatment outcomes, but among hospitalized patients, psychometric evaluation of SAWS is complicated. Hospitalized patients often have physical ailments and/or barriers precluding verbal communication (e.g. mechanical ventilation). To achieve the clinical benefits of symptom-triggered management, objective scales must be used that do not rely on patient-reported symptoms.

The CIWA-Ar is the most commonly described tool for grading the severity of AWS. The original CIWA scale was designed for alcohol withdrawal research (as opposed to clinical practice) and was validated in select cohorts of patients with mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal and no acute comorbidities (including seizures). The CIWA was not designed to diagnose or grade disease severity in hospitalized patients with SAWS. Nevertheless, the CIWA-Ar scale has been used in ICU patients and continues to rely on patient self-report of gastrointestinal symptoms, tactile and auditory disturbances, anxiety, and headache.

### Clinical features and recovery pattern of secondary hypokalaemic paralysis [^25ab00fb]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Information regarding frequency, details of neurological signs and recovery patterns of patients with secondary hypokalaemic paralysis (HP) is limited. This study aimed to analyse the frequency, aetiology, clinical features and recovery patterns of patients with secondary HP.

Methods

The clinical and laboratory records of 18 consecutive patients with secondary HP aged ≥ 18 years admitted to our hospital between April 2011 and March 2022 were reviewed. Patients with inherited hypokalaemic periodic paralysis were excluded.

Results

Of the 18 patients, 16 had a common aetiology: chronic alcoholism, diarrhoea or an imbalanced diet. Initial symptoms, such as fatigue, were often atypical. Three patients had prominent asymmetric limb weakness and four had predominant upper limb weakness. On admission, the mean serum potassium and creatine kinase (CK) levels of the patients were 1.90 mmol/L and 4488 U/mL, respectively. Ten patients (56%) had decreased potassium levels after admission, despite potassium replacement treatment (rebound hypokalaemia). Twelve patients presented with increased CK levels even after 2–5 days (delayed hyperCKaemia). Low serum magnesium levels significantly correlated with rebound hypokalaemia.

Conclusions

Secondary HP can be caused by a variety of conditions, but mainly occurs due to lifestyle conditions/disorders. Secondary HP often presents with atypical symptoms, and the initial symptoms can be non-specific. Rebound hypokalaemia and delayed hyperCKaemia are common in secondary HP, despite potassium replacement. As such, careful serial monitoring is needed for patients with secondary HP.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis / hyponatremia in COVID-19 [^fcfc39a6]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Treatment of hyponatremia in COVID-19 patients

EFV = extracellular fluid volume

With regard to the 24 h and 48 h limits, published guidelines suggest that serum [Na +] increases should be limited to ≤ 8 mEq/L and ≤ 18 mEq/L, respectively. Although the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is reduced in acute hyponatremia, in patients at high risk of ODS (i.e. serum [Na +] ≤ 105 mEq/L, hypokalemia, alcoholism, malnutrition, advanced liver disease), the limit of correction of serum [Na +] in the first 24 h should be lowered to 6 mEq/L. A case report-review article published in 2024 retrieved a total of 14 confirmed cases of ODS in patients with COVID-19 infection, in addition to the case presented in the article. However, in most cases neither the initial serum [Na +] nor the rate of correction were reported. As a matter of fact, initial hyponatremia was documented only in 4 cases. Among the few cases, in which serum [Na +] increase was reported, apparently only in one case the established limits of correction were exceeded (38 mEq/L serum [Na +] increase in 48 h). It has to be said, as the authors mention, that the diagnosis of ODS is difficult in ICU, where encephalopathies of different etiologies are rather common. The gold standard for the diagnosis of ODS relies on an MRI assessment. MRI may not be easily feasible in an ICU setting and among the 15 cases of ODS reported in the literature it was performed in only 6 cases. It has to be also added that ODS, which is due to extracellular osmotic changes resulting in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and disruption of myelin sheaths, may be caused by conditions other than rapid serum [Na +] correction. These include other electrolyte alterations, such as hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, decreased food intake. Thus, admittedly the association between serum [Na +] correction and ODS in COVID-19 patients, as reported in the literature, appears in most cases elusive.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^ea1ef1fd]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Close monitoring of pNa is recommended during the active correction phase. Hourly urine output monitoring is very helpful, as often treatment of the underlying cause of hyponatraemia (e.g. volume replacement in hypovolaemic hyponatraemia) can lead to suppression of AVP, and a rapid aquaresis, resulting in rapid rise in pNa. Both European and American consensus guidelines recommend that plasma sodium rise in chronic hyponatraemia generally should not exceed 10 mmol/l per 24 hours, with the US guidelines specifying that the rise should ideally be restricted to < 8 mmol/l. The US guidelines also include revised targets for patients deemed to be at greater risk of osmotic demyelination, such as those with liver disease, alcohol misuse, hypokalaemia or malnutrition. In these scenarios, targets are revised downwards to a maximum recommended elevation in plasma sodium of < 6 mmol/l and should not exceed 8 mmol/L in 24 hours (Table 3).

Table 3.
Targets for elevation in plasma sodium concentration recommended to avoid osmotic demyelination in chronic hyponatraemia.

In patients with acute hyponatraemia, when the acuity of onset is certain, the rise in pNa need not be restricted. Both guidelines now recommend 3% hypertonic saline bolus in the treatment for acute and symptomatic hyponatraemia, the goal being an initial brisk rise in pNa to reduce cerebral oedema. In chronic symptomatic hyponatraemia, the goal then quickly shifts to maintaining 24- and 48-hour correction within the safe thresholds for chronic hyponatraemia.

The case presented here describes a condition of ODS associated with overly rapid correction of serum [Na +] in a patient with severe hyponatraemia. ODS was first described in 1959 in a series of alcoholic and malnourished patients who developed quadriparesis and pseudobulbar palsy. Post-mortem assessment revealed the presence of a demyelinative lesion within the central pons. Its relationship with electrolyte disorders was not apparent, because routine measurement of serum electrolytes was not available at that time. A link between ODS and overly rapid correction of hyponatraemia was established only in the mid-1970s. ODS is recognized as a rather rare disease, although the exact frequency with which occurs is not known. The largest autopsy series indicated a prevalence of 0.25–0.5% in the general population with a peak incidence in males aged 30 to 60 years. From a pathological point of view, ODS is characterized by loss of myelin sheath, whereas axons and neurons are relatively spared. Traditionally, ODS has been associated with rapid correction of hyponatraemia; however, a number of different conditions have been reported in association with the development of this syndrome, independent of serum [Na +] alterations. The most common predisposing condition is chronic alcoholism, which was not present in our case. Many patients developed ODS during the terminal stage of binge drinking; however, a few case reports of ODS after alcohol withdrawal have been reported. In these instances, the osmotic change due to a decreased intake of food or water that occurs during binge drinking or alcohol withdrawal may be the cause of ODS development.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^f043ec85]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^24fe5704]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of ODS typically present in a delayed manner, one or more days after overcorrection occurs. Clinically, patients with severe symptomatic hyponatremia may initially improve as the pNa rises; however, with the onset of ODS this may be followed by neurologic deterioration that is progressive and sometimes permanent. ODS symptoms include dysarthria, dysphagia, flaccid quadriparesis that later become spastic, horizontal gaze paralysis, "locked-in" syndrome, and coma. Clinical features associated with extrapontine myelinolysis include tremor, ataxia, parkinsonism, dystonia, and catatonia. The 2 largest contemporary case series to date, a report of 83 individuals with ODS in Sweden and 45 cases in the United States, reported 7.2% and 13% in-hospital mortality, respectively. After 3 to 6 months of follow-up, around 60% of patients were functionally independent, while the remainder of survivors had persistent functional limitations.

Risk factors for ODS, other than an extremely low initial sodium concentration (eg, < 105 mmol/L) and rapid correction (eg, > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours), include hypokalemia, alcohol abuse, malnutrition, and advanced liver disease (Table 3). These factors may impair the ability of glial cells to import or resynthesize organic osmolytes. Reduced endothelial cell membrane concentration of Na-K-ATPase with hypokalemia may also impair the transport of electrolytes, further predisposing glial cells to injury associated with the rapid rise in the serum sodium concentration.

Table 3.
Risk factors for development of osmotic demyelination syndrome following correction of chronic hyponatremia, based on observational data

ODS may occur as the result of overcorrection that is either iatrogenic (eg, excessive administration of hypertonic saline) or spontaneous (eg, a negative water balance due to increased urinary electrolyte-free water clearance after resolution of a temporary nonosmotic stimulus to AVP). Higher-risk clinical scenarios for overcorrection include a reversible cause of hyponatremia (eg, cessation of potentially causative medications [eg, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, desmopressin]), glucocorticoid replacement in adrenal failure, or provision of solute in patients with malnutrition and low solute intake (eg, alcohol abuse ('beer potomania'), or poor "tea and toast" diet in older individuals).

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^0fb89e21]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### Severe hyponatremia correction, mortality, and central pontine myelinolysis [^67c65547]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, sodium correction rates are frequently limited in patients with severe hyponatremia to prevent neurologic complications. The implications of correction rates on overall mortality and length of hospital stay are unclear. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we evaluated the association of sodium correction rates with mortality, length of stay, and central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) in patients hospitalized with severe hyponatremia (admission serum sodium level less than 120 mEq/l). RESULTS: The cohort included 3274 patients. A correction rate of less than 6 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 38%, 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 29%, and greater than 10 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 33%. Compared with 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours, a correction rate of less than 6 mEq/l/24 hours exhibited higher in-hospital mortality in multivariable-adjusted and propensity score–weighted analyses. Compared with 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours, a correction rate of greater than 10 mEq/l/24 hours was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter length of stay in multivariable analyses. Seven patients with CPM were identified, with five of seven developing CPM despite a sodium correction rate of less than or equal to 8 mEq/l/24 hours. Six of seven patients who developed CPM had alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hypokalemia, or hypophosphatemia. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting the sodium correction rate was associated with higher mortality and longer length of stay. Whether the sodium correction rate influences neurologic complications needs further evaluation.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^c2eeb022]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

Administration of desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone) either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction. The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours. On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal; because their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome is extremely low, the US/Irish expert panel deemed efforts to prevent or reverse excessive correction to be unnecessary. Similarly, in most patients presenting with a sodium > 120 mmol/L, relowering the serum sodium after correction by > 8 mmol/L or even > 12 mmol/L was not recommended. In patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, initial correction by 8–12 mmol/L is more than necessary, but unlikely to be harmful unless the 48-hours limit of 18 mmol/L is exceeded; the panel deemed relowering of the serum sodium to be optional after correction by > 10–12 mmol/L but recommended that further increases in serum sodium should be avoided for the next 24 hours. Other experts have adopted the stricter limit of 8 mmol/L in 24 hours for all patients.

### An atypical presentation of high potassium renal secretion rate in a patient with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: a case report [^02c230f3]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP), a disorder that primarily affects the lower extremities, occurs due to excess thyroid hormone secretion, which causes an abrupt intracellular shift of potassium ions. However, hypokalemia with hyperthyroidism does not always indicate the diagnosis of TPP. Some case reports have previously stated that patients with hyperthyroidism who presented with renal potassium wasting had a final diagnosis other than TPP, such as chronic alcoholism and primary aldosteronism. Low renal potassium excretion, a normal acid–base balance in the blood, and hyperthyroidism are the hallmarks of TPP. However, in some conditions, TPP may present with high potassium secretion rates.

We highlight an atypical presentation of TPP with renal potassium wasting in the early stage of presentation. The early recognition of TPP is crucial to provide appropriate treatment and to avoid the risk of rebound hyperkalemia if high-dose potassium replacement is administered. Appropriate and timely management decrease morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome in trauma patients: a study using the trauma quality program participant user file [^ae0fc0c6]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

A large systematic review and meta-analysis from 2014 sought to identify predictors of severe AWS in all patients. The strongest predictor of DT or alcohol withdrawal seizures was a previous history of one of these events. Furthermore, baseline thrombocytopenia and hypokalemia were predictive of progression to DT. Our study, specifically focusing on trauma patient populations, identified additional predictors unique to the trauma patient, including history of AUD or cirrhosis, positive BAC, positive drug screen for barbiturates or tricyclic antidepressants, and AIS head score of ≥ 3.

Trauma patient populations have a higher prevalence of AUD and therefore an overall higher risk of developing AWS. Current national guidelines recommend screening for AUDs among all trauma patients. One previous study of three US trauma centers showed a rate of AWS 0.88% of all trauma patients. While the overall rate was low, the incidence of severe AWS (CIWA-Ar score > 20) was high in that patient population, with 53% being classified as having severe AWS. That study also identified baseline CIWA-Ar score of 10 or more and age greater than or equal to 55 to be predictors of DT. Furthermore, in patients with severe AWS, severe head injury also predicted progression to DT. Hospital LOS, intensive care unit LOS, and complications of AWS differed by severity of AWS, but mortality did not, except for patients who progressed to DT who had an overall mortality of 11.1%.

Phentermine HCl/topiramate extended release — drug interactions, pharmacokinetics, and common adverse effects are summarized as follows. It may alter the exposure to oral contraceptives, causing irregular menstrual bleeding but not an increased risk of pregnancy, and oral contraceptives should not be discontinued if spotting occurs. It may potentiate central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and patients should avoid concomitant alcohol, and it may potentiate hypokalemia of non-potassium-sparing diuretics. Phentermine is metabolized by the liver, with most excreted by the kidney, whereas topiramate is excreted mainly by the kidney. In clinical trials, adverse reactions occurring more than or equal to 5% of the time included paresthesia, dizziness, dysgeusia, insomnia, constipation, and dry mouth. Laboratory abnormalities may include metabolic acidosis, elevated creatinine, lowering of glucose levels, and hypokalemia in patients treated with non-potassium-sparing diuretics.

### Impact of plasma potassium normalization on short-term mortality in patients with hypertension and hyperkalemia [^3773dacf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposure Variable

Normal plasma potassium interval varies within populations. Therefore, different reference intervals are used worldwide. 9, 10, 11 The Nordic Reference Interval Project defines hypokalemia as plasma potassium concentrations < 3.5 mmol/L and hyperkalemia and potassium levels > 4.6 mmol/L. 10

As potassium does not have a linear relationship with mortality, the second potassium measurement was divided into 8 intervals: 2.2 to 2.9 mmol/L, 3.0 to 3.4 mmol/L, 3.5 to 3.7 mmol/L, 3.8 to 4.0 mmol/L, 4.1 to 4.6 mmol/L, 4.7 to 5.0 mmol/L, 5.1 to 5.5 mmol/L, and 5.6 to 7.8 mmol/L. Plasma potassium interval 4.1 to 4.6 mmol/L was used as the reference for statistical analyses. We chose this interval as the reference group on the basis of the study of Krogager et al 3 and the lowest mortality risk observed in a restricted cubic spline curve (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Restricted cubic spline curve showing the adjusted hazard ratios for all‐cause mortality as a function of second plasma potassium measurement.

Knots at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of plasma potassium. The model is adjusted for age, sex, plasma sodium, renal insufficiency, malignancy, heart failure, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, atrial flutter/fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, antihypertensive therapy, corticosteroids, antimicrobials, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, xanthines, laxatives, digoxin, and potassium supplements.

Outcome

The primary outcome of the study was all‐cause mortality within 90 days of the second plasma potassium measurement occurring 6 to 100 days after the first plasma potassium measurement indicating hyperkalemia. The secondary outcome was cardiovascular death within 90 days of the second potassium measurement.

### Occurrence, predictors, and prognosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and delirium tremens following traumatic injury [^7a1cdd58]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine occurrence, predictors, and prognosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and delirium tremens in patients with traumatic injury.

Design

Retrospective multicenter cohort study.

Setting

Three U.S. trauma centers.

Patients

Twenty-eight thousand one hundred one trauma patients admitted from 2010–2014.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Measures included occurrence of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and delirium tremens, injury characteristics, risk factors for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, clinical outcomes, pharmacologic treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity was defined by CIWA-Ar score as minimal (< 10), moderate (10–20), and severe (> 20). Alcohol withdrawal syndrome developed in 0.88% (n = 246), including 12% minimal, 36% moderate, and 53% severe. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome progressed to delirium tremens in 11%. Before adjustment, alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity was associated with injury severity, hypokalemia, baseline CIWA-Ar score, and established alcohol withdrawal syndrome risk factors. Logistic regression identified the following predictors of delirium tremens: baseline CIWA-Ar score greater than or equal to 10 (odds ratio, 6.05; p = 0.02) and age greater than or equal to 55 (odds ratio, 3.24; p = 0.03). In patients with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, severe head injury also predicted progression to delirium tremens (odds ratio, 6.08; p = 0.01), and hypokalemia was borderline significant (odds ratio, 3.23; p = 0.07). Clinical outcomes of hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome complications differed significantly by alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity and were worse with more severe manifestations of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Mortality also significantly differed by alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity but was only greater in patients who progressed to delirium tremens (11.1%; p = 0.02); otherwise, there were no differences in mortality by severity (4%, 4%, and 0% by minimal, moderate, and severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome).

Conclusions

Trauma patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome experience a high occurrence of delirium tremens that is associated with significant mortality. These data demonstrate the predictive ability of baseline CIWA-Ar score, age, and severe head injury for developing delirium tremens.

### Alcohol intoxication among Dutch adolescents: acute medical complications in the years 2000–2010 [^3556073f]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate acute medical complications of alcohol intoxication among adolescents presenting to Reinier de Graaf Hospital, a major nonacademic hospital in Delft, the Netherlands.

Methods

The frequency of reduced consciousness, hypothermia, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, and acidosis along with alcohol intoxication was retrospectively studied in the medical records of patients aged 11 to 17 years admitted between January 1, 2000, and April 30, 2010.

Results

Reduced consciousness (45%) and hypothermia (43.1%) were the most common clinical findings. More boys than girls experienced hypothermia (P = 0.028), probably because of the higher blood alcohol concentration level (P = 0.026), which was associated with lower temperature (Pearson's r = -.37; P < .001). The most frequent electrolyte disturbance was hyperchloremia (31.1%), followed by low bicarbonate (22%), hypokalemia (11.9%), and hypernatremia (7.7%). Strikingly, none of the patients in this study suffered hypoglycemia. On the contrary, 13.6% of the patients were slightly hyperglycemic. Mild acidosis, both metabolic and respiratory, was observed among 28.8% of the patients, although the metabolic component predominated.

Conclusions

Acute medical complications because of alcohol intoxication appeared to be mild, and most remarkably none of the patients experienced hypoglycemia.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^3f1e9946]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Since indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics, including this product, may each be associated with increased serum potassium levels, the potential effects on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.

Amiloride HCl

When amiloride HCl is administered concomitantly with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cyclosporine or tacrolimus, the risk of hyperkalemia may be increased. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium (see WARNINGS).

Hydrochlorothiazide

When given concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics.

Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics

Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

Antidiabetic Drugs (Oral Agents and Insulin)

Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.

Other Antihypertensive Drugs

Additive effect or potentiation.

Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins

Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of cholestyramine and colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.

Corticosteroids, ACTH

Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.

Pressor Amines (e.g., norepinephrine)

Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use.

Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine)

Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.

Lithium

Generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with this combination product.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis: etiologies, evaluation, and management [^bd48e7e6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is defined by metabolic acidosis and ketosis in a patient with alcohol use. This is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED) and requires targeted therapies.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of AKA for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

AKA is frequently evaluated and managed in the ED. The underlying pathophysiology is related to poor glycogen stores and elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and hydrogen. This results in metabolic acidosis with elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. Patients with AKA most commonly present with a history of alcohol use (acute or chronic), poor oral intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, and ketoacidosis on laboratory assessment. Patients are generally dehydrated, and serum glucose can be low, normal, or mildly elevated. An anion gap metabolic acidosis with ketosis and electrolyte abnormalities are usually present on laboratory evaluation. Management includes fluid resuscitation, glucose and vitamin supplementation, electrolyte repletion, and evaluation for other conditions.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of AKA is essential in caring for these patients.

### Metolazone [^d3af7934]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Diuretics

Furosemide and probably other loop diuretics given concomitantly with metolazone can cause unusually large or prolonged losses of fluid and electrolytes (see WARNINGS).

Other Antihypertensives

When metolazone tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, care must be taken, especially during initial therapy. Dosage adjustments of other antihypertensives may be necessary.

Alcohol, Barbiturates, And Narcotics

The hypotensive effects of these drugs may be potentiated by the volume contraction that may be associated with metolazone therapy.

Digitalis Glycosides

Diuretic-induced hypokalemia can increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to digitalis. Serious arrhythmias can result.

Corticosteroids Or ACTH

May increase the risk of hypokalemia and increase salt and water retention.

Lithium

Serum lithium levels may increase (see WARNINGS).

Curariform Drugs

Diuretic-induced hypokalemia may enhance neuromuscular blocking effects of curariform drugs (such as tubocurarine) – the most serious effect would be respiratory depression which could proceed to apnea. Accordingly, it may be advisable to discontinue metolazone three days before elective surgery.

Salicylates And Other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

### A life-threatening case of pseudo-aldosteronism secondary to excessive liquorice ingestion [^41e47829]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

The mineralocorticoid receptor is present within various tissues throughout the body. In the kidneys, it acts in the distal convoluted tubule. Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptors leads to the expression of epithelial sodium channels, regulating intravascular volume via retention of sodium and water with the excretion of potassium. In vitro, mineralocorticoid receptors will bind cortisol and aldosterone with equal affinity. Cortisol is present in the serum at substantially higher concentrations. 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2) is an enzyme expressed by aldosterone-specific tissue and leads to the conversion of active cortisol to inactive cortisone. This prevents the inappropriate activation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol, conferring ligand specificity to the mineralocorticoid receptor.

Liquorice contains the compound glycyrrhetinic acid which inhibits 11βHSD2 by competitive inhibition and reduction in gene expression. This allows the unopposed activation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol, leading to an apparent mineralocorticoid excess in the setting of a normal or suppressed serum aldosterone.

Pulmonary oedema as a consequence of liquorice ingestion is rarely described. A PUBMED search of the terms "Liquorice" + "Pulmonary oedema" revealed two previously reported cases of pulmonary oedema associated with liquorice ingestion. The first case described a 64-year-old male in 1997 who presented with acute pulmonary oedema following a liquorice binge (3.6gm glycyrrhetinic acid). He was treated acutely with diuresis and recovered within two days. He was found to have no cardiac abnormality and recovered without relapse following avoidance of liquorice. A second case, reported in 2010, involved a 66-year-old male ex-alcoholic who was managing his alcohol cravings with liquorice beverages(1.6gm glycyrrhetinic acid daily). He presented with typical findings of muscle weakness, hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, clinical exam on admission noted euvolemia. Similar to our case, he was treated with aggressive i.v. saline 0.9% containing K + 54 mmol/L. Twenty hours into his admission he developed acute pulmonary oedema requiring ICU admission and management with i.v. diuresis and nitrates. He made a good recovery and remained well following abstinence from liquorice containing products. These cases mirror the clinical course of our patient where liquorice appears to be the primary precipitating factor for acute life-threatening pulmonary oedema (Table 1).

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^e4a0a390]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Although not statistically significant, a trend in the elevation of cSBP at 6 hours post energy drink consumption was evident. Central BP indices are emerging as superior predictors of cardiovascular risk over peripheral BPs as they better reflect vascular compliance and should be further investigated in future studies. 37 The trend towards a higher HR at 2 hours and the lower AI at 6 hours in the energy drink arm are clinically not critical in this acute setting.

Certain populations may consider exercising caution when consuming energy drinks. Those with congenital long QT syndrome are at a predisposed risk for arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes. 38 More commonly, those with acquired long QT syndrome induced by concomitant use of QT/QTc‐prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesaemia are at a similar risk. 39 Obesity has also been associated with prolongation of the QT interval. 40, 41 Interestingly, in one noncontrolled study, the cohort with overweight/obese participants (n = 18) showed significant QT prolongation from baseline after consuming 5 mL/kg of an energy drink (340 ± 57 ms versus 357 ± 54 ms, P = 0.006). 24 The consumption of energy drinks with alcohol is another practice common in some social settings. 42 Caution should be exercised as combining alcohol or illicit substances with energy drinks may trigger or exacerbate untoward cardiovascular events. 43, 44

### Potassium homeostasis [^3d9f68ae]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Potassium homeostasis is essential for maintaining the normal resting membrane potential of excitable cells. Yet daily dietary potassium typically far exceeds total extracellular potassium, thus the body has elegant strategies to shift potassium into cells promptly after a meal and then the kidneys efficiently excrete potassium. Potassium excretion depends on adequate kidney perfusion and filtration, sodium delivery to the distal nephron and aldosterone action on the distal nephron. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia have been associated with an increase in mortality. In this piece, we share 5 challenging cases to explore normal potassium homeostasis and disorders that can lead to derangements in potassium balance or excretion.

### Hypophosphatemia as a predictor of pancreatic necrosis in acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis [^40582d1a]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

There are, however, several limitations to our study. Since this study was conducted in a single-center community-based academic setting, it limits the generalizability of our findings. In addition, in our hospital, phosphate levels are not routinely reported on basic or comprehensive metabolic panels and must be ordered separately, so our findings are likely impacted by selection bias. Our sample size was impacted by our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria which were put into place to minimize confounding. We excluded patients who did not have phosphate levels collected within the first 48 hours of their admission, thereby narrowing our pool of patients with necrosis. This is because, in our hospital, phosphate levels are not routinely trended to assess for adequate repletion, unlike some other electrolytes such as potassium, magnesium, and sodium. This, therefore, generates data that is sporadic and cannot be used reliably for establishing associations. We also excluded patients who did not receive any imaging during their hospitalization and were given the diagnosis exclusively on clinical and laboratory findings, as without imaging, we could not objectively determine the presence of necrosis. We also excluded patients who had their hospital course complicated by problems not associated with the pancreas, such as alcohol withdrawal, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hospital-acquired infections, again to minimize confounding. Furthermore, we also did not evaluate for correction/repletion of phosphate levels which could have impacted the development of necrosis during the hospital stay. Despite the limitations, we were able to observe an association between hypophosphatemia within 48 hours of admission and pancreatic necrosis, which leads us to suggest that further prospective studies may be warranted to evaluate this relationship in more detail. Our study is also consistent with the data available in the literature, which also suggests a role of phosphate in determining the severity of pancreatitis, and hence, we recommend the need for further randomized controlled studies with phosphate repletion to assess the development of necrosis.

In conclusion, our study highlights a significant association between low serum phosphate levels within the first 48 hours of admission and the development of pancreatic necrosis in patients with acute alcoholic pancreatitis. This relationship, while statistically significant, does not confirm causality but suggests that hypophosphatemia could serve as a useful marker for identifying patients at risk. The observation that some patients developed necrosis despite initially normal phosphate levels further complicates this relationship, indicating that phosphate dynamics may vary during the progression of the disease. Consequently, proactive monitoring and management of phosphate levels could potentially play a role in preventing severe outcomes in acute pancreatitis.

### Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis secondary to subclinical hyperthyroidism: an uncommon cause of acute muscle paralysis [^dc875ded]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

In general, hypokalaemia can be caused by reduced intake, increased transcellular shift, and increased losses via the urinary or gastrointestinal tract, or through excessive sweating. In this case, the patient did not have any diarrhoea, no profuse sweating and was not taking any medicine that can increase potassium excretion. The hypokalaemia episode was persistent below 3.0 mmol/L despite rapid potassium replacement therapy via intravenous infusion, and followed by oral replacement. His 24-hour urinary potassium was within normal range, which excluded renal losses. Therefore, rapid intracellular shift of potassium causing hypokalaemia was suspected. He was not on any medication such as beta-agonist or insulin that increases the potassium transcellular shift. He has no preceding history of taking high amount of carbohydrate-contained diet nor drinks alcohol-contained beverages. Therefore, although he was clinically euthyroid and his thyroid level was normal, there is a possibility that the transcellular shift of potassium leading to hypokalaemia was due to subclinical hyperthyroidism. He responded to the anti-thyroid medication and non-selective beta-blockers, and managed to maintain the potassium within normal range without any further episode of lower limb weakness.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: a focussed literature review [^a0f0ede2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Magnesium

Magnesium acts as an NMDA receptor pore blocker, reducing inward currents in a voltage sensitive manner. The association between low magnesium concentrations and alcohol dependence has been explored in pre-clinical models and clinical populations. Indeed, the link between alcohol consumption, low serum magnesium concentrations and neuronal damage or pathological neurobiological changes have previously been reported. Patients with alcohol dependence are often magnesium depleted and an association between hypomagnesaemia and clinical outcomes including duration of most recent alcohol binge episodes, quality of life scores and impulsivity measures has also been demonstrated in alcohol-dependent groups. The potential neuroprotective role that magnesium may play in NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, and alcohol-related cerebrovascular damage, hypertension and oxidative stress is increasingly recognised.

In 2013, a Cochrane review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to promote or dissuade the use of magnesium in the management of alcohol withdrawal; to date a clinical consensus in relating to the provision of magnesium has not been reached. However, since publication of the Cochrane review, several reports have further explored the relationship between low serum magnesium concentrations and alcohol dependence-related outcomes.demonstrate that alcohol withdrawal intensity is correlated with reduction in serum magnesium concentration. Furthermore, an inverse relationship has been observed in alcohol-dependent females between serum magnesium concentration and number of heavy drinking days and pro-inflammatory serum markers.) demonstrate that individuals presenting with alcohol withdrawal to an emergency department with serum magnesium of < 0.75 mmol/L were associated with higher 1-year mortality rates. Disappointingly, at follow-up (median 126 days later), 76% still had a serum magnesium of < 0.75 mmol/L and magnesium was prescribed in only 7% of these presentations. In contrast though the majority of patients had whole blood thiamine diphosphate concentrations (indicative of thiamine reserve) within the reference ranges and thiamine was routinely prescribed. Moreover, low whole blood thiamine diphosphate was not associated with reduced 1-year survival.suggests that the paucity of magnesium supplementation observed may relate to a lack of clinician awareness and evidence surrounding hypomagnesia in AUD.

### Refeeding syndrome in pediatric age, an unknown disease: a narrative review [^54244661]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Magnesium and Potassium

In addition to phosphorus, deficiencies in other minerals such as magnesium and potassium can also contribute to the development of RS. Magnesium is an intracellular cation and a cofactor in most enzymatic systems (eg, oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production). Its deficiency can lead to changes in neuromuscular excitability and heart disease. In addition to RS, other causes of acute hypomagnesemia can also be diarrhea, pancreatitis, malnutrition, alcoholism, metabolic acidosis, or specific therapies (eg, amphotericin B, furosemide, aminoglycosides, cisplatin, cyclosporin). Magnesium is required for enzymatic reactions involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis. Hypomagnesemia is typically associated with hypocalcemia and hypokalemia because it activates the Na + /K + -ATPase pump and alters parathyroid hormone release. Potassium is needed for normal cell function and is an important electrolyte involved in muscle and nerve function. The onset of anabolic processes leads to potassium uptake into the insulin-stimulated cell, resulting in severe hypophosphatemia, changes in the electrochemical potential of the membrane, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Other contributory causes of hypokalemia, in addition to post-nutrition, can be diarrhea, increased urine leakage, metabolic alkalosis, or medication (eg, diuretics, adrenergic agents, glucocorticoids, insulin).

Thiamine

Thiamine deficiency is the most common vitamin deficiency that occurs as a complication of RS. Thiamine is an essential cofactor of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and ATP synthesis. Its deficiency is typically known in Wernicke encephalopathy (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, confusion, hypothermia, coma) and Korsakoff syndrome (amnesia, confabulation). Thiamine deficiency is the most common vitamin deficiency that occurs as a complication of RS. Thiamine is an essential cofactor of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and ATP synthesis. Its deficiency is typically known in Wernicke encephalopathy (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, confusion, hypothermia, coma) and Korsakoff syndrome (amnesia, confabulation). Although all vitamin deficiencies can occur to varying degrees with inadequate intake, thiamine is of paramount importance when post-meal complications are considered. Thiamine is an essential coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism and acts as the main cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenases in glycolysis. Thiamine deficiency can lead to encephalopathy-like symptoms such as ataxia, eye disorders, amnesia, and coma in these patients.

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^93851922]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Indications and Usage

For therapeutic use in patients with hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis; in chronic digitalis intoxication; and in patients with hypokalemic familial periodic paralysis.
For prevention of potassium depletion when the dietary intake of potassium ion is inadequate in the following conditions; patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure; hepatic cirrhosis with ascites; states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function; potassiumlosing nephropathy, and certain diarrheal states; long-term corticosteroid therapy.
The use of potassium salts in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension or receiving certain antibiotics is often unnecessary when such patients have a normal dietary pattern. Serum potassium should be checked periodically, however, and, if hypokalemia occurs, dietary supplementation with potassium-containing foods may be adequate to control milder cases. In more severe cases supplementation with potassium salts may be indicated.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^bff37ea2]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

### Hypophosphatemia, hypokalaemia and rhabdomyolysis associated with a panic attack [^0c5d9029]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

With regards to his presenting symptoms, a diagnosis of panic attack was made based on The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria: he experienced a discrete transient period of intense discomfort with palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness and fear of dying.

Regarding the observed hypophosphatemia and hypokalaemia, we considered the possibility of acute volume loss via vomiting or diarrhoea; however, the patient denied both of these. We also considered the possibility of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, which can present with potassium depletion and normoglycemia, however, he had no known risk factors and serum beta-hydroxybutyrate was undetectable. Acute intoxications were also investigated, such as salicylate poisoning which can cause rhabdomyolysis; blood tests were negative for salicylates and ethanol, and urine toxicology was negative for opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine and cocaine, and positive only for THC. Acute hypokalaemia and hypophosphatemia can also result from refeeding syndrome, though he had no prolonged period of fasting and malnutrition and his metabolic derangements resolved with minimal repletion as noted below.

Regarding the rhabdomyolysis, possible aetiologies included physical exertion, seizure, toxins, infection and the observed metabolic derangements. After review of laboratory tests and extensive discussions with the patient and his family, there were no environmental exposures, ingestions, clinical signs or sufficiently strenuous activities to support the former hypotheses, leaving his observed metabolic derangements (hypophosphatemia and hypokalaemia) as the likely cause of his rhabdomyolysis.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^d6f4f757]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride-unflavored [^24515ac2]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities

Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution. Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before treatment with polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution.

In addition, use caution when prescribing polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients who have conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias

There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.

5.3 Seizures

There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.

Use caution when prescribing polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^a7d9f186]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — At-risk pediatric patients with refeeding syndrome (RS): Initiate nutrition at a maximum of 40%–50% goal, usually starting the glucose infusion rate around 4–6 mg/kg/min and advancing by 1–2 mg/kg/min as blood glucose levels allow until you reach a max of 14–18 mg/kg/min; this includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose. Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications in dextrose should be considered within these limits and/or initiated with caution in moderate to severe risk; if already receiving IV dextrose for several days with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than above. Fluid restriction — No recommendation; Sodium restriction — No recommendation; Protein restriction — No recommendation. For electrolytes, check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition, and monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients; replete low electrolytes per established standards of care, and no recommendation can be made for prophylactic dosing if prefeeding levels are normal. If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during initiation, decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation; recommendations may be changed based on practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. Thiamin 2 mg/kg to a max of 100–200 mg/d is advised before feeding commences or before initiating IV fluids containing dextrose in high-risk patients, and continue thiamin supplementation for 5–7 days or longer in severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk conditions. Multivitamins: MVI is added to PN daily unless contraindicated, and for oral/enteral nourishment add a complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 days or greater based on clinical status and mode of therapy. Monitoring and long-term care include vital signs every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after initiation in those at risk, cardiorespiratory monitoring for unstable patients or those with severe deficiencies, daily weights with monitored intake and output, estimation of energy requirements as needed for oral feeding patients, and evaluation of short- and long-term goals daily during the first several days until stabilized (eg, no requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 days) and then per institutional standards; once within adult weight ranges, refer to adult multivitamin recommendations.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

For the treatment of patients with hypokalemia, with or without metabolic alkalosis; in digitalis intoxication; and in patients with hypokalemic familial periodic paralysis. If hypokalemia is the result of diuretic therapy, consideration should be given to the use of a lower dose of diuretic, which may be sufficient without leading to hypokalemia.
For the prevention of hypokalemia in patients who would be at particular risk if hypokalemia were to develop (e.g., digitalized patients or patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias).

The use of potassium salts in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension is often unnecessary when such patients have a normal dietary pattern and when low doses of the diuretic are used. Serum potassium should be checked periodically, however, and if hypokalemia occurs, dietary supplementation with potassium-containing foods may be adequate to control milder cases. In more severe cases, and if dose adjustment of the diuretic is ineffective or unwarranted, supplementation with potassium salts may be indicated.

### Derangements of potassium [^b99fa130]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and GI systems, and shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague, but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium, insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexelate are recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of PO or IV repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.
