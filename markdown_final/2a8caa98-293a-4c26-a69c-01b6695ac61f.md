## Question

is splenomegaly permanent after ebv

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether splenomegaly caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection remains after the acute illness has resolved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history of EBV-associated splenomegaly in immunocompetent hosts with infectious mononucleosis. Then, I should verify what constitutes "permanent" splenomegaly and which EBV-related entities cause it. Next, I will review evidence on resolution versus persistence in typical cases, followed by exceptions such as chronic active EBV, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and immunocompromised states. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer and outline follow-up and imaging considerations.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: in immunocompetent adolescents and young adults with infectious mononucleosis, splenomegaly is common during the acute phase, but the illness is self-limited and supportive care is the mainstay, with no established role for antivirals or routine corticosteroids in uncomplicated cases, which already hints that organ enlargement tends to regress with convalescence [^114sMgCX].

> Wait, let me verify the time course of splenic risk and the rationale for activity restriction, because that informs how long splenomegaly might persist. Splenic rupture risk is highest in the first 3–4 weeks and can extend up to about 8 weeks, which aligns with the period of maximal splenic enlargement and vulnerability, and sports medicine guidance commonly restricts contact activity for roughly 3–4 weeks minimum, extending to 6–8 weeks in many programs, reflecting the need to avoid exertion until the spleen has returned toward baseline size [^1159xfv9] [^1122Ejff] [^113FCuAK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether "permanent" splenomegaly occurs in typical EBV mononucleosis. I need to check for evidence of resolution: case series and reports document substantial or complete regression of splenomegaly after acute EBV infection, including patients with initially marked enlargement, and even in coinfection scenarios such as EBV plus CMV, splenic size normalized over weeks to months with supportive care, supporting that persistence is not the expected outcome in otherwise healthy hosts [^1124eKu7].

> But wait, what if the patient has an atypical or severe EBV syndrome? I should double-check the exceptions. Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) is defined by persistent or recurrent IM-like symptoms beyond 3–6 months, high EBV loads, and organ involvement including splenomegaly, and it carries significant morbidity and mortality; in these cases, splenomegaly can be chronic and may only regress with definitive therapies such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, underscoring that persistence here reflects a distinct pathobiology rather than ordinary mononucleosis [^114a7hR5] [^113kiBFU] [^117NhSZQ].

> I will now examine hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which EBV can trigger. HLH features hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and coagulopathy, and although splenomegaly may improve with immunochemotherapy, the course can be fulminant and relapsing, and EBV-associated HLH in particular has a worse prognosis, so persistent or recurrent splenomegaly can occur in the context of ongoing immune dysregulation rather than simple mononucleosis [^112X7wcv] [^117DWVMd] [^111uafhN].

> Let me consider immunocompromised hosts and primary immunodeficiencies. In settings like HIV, transplant, or inborn errors of immunity, EBV can drive lymphoproliferation and splenomegaly that persist until the underlying immune defect is addressed, and in disorders such as XMEN or XLP, chronic or recurrent EBV viremia with splenomegaly is part of the phenotype, again indicating that persistence reflects impaired viral control rather than typical mononucleosis [^117YHmor] [^116YZZK3] [^115RT1Wa].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought splenomegaly might be "nearly universal" in infectious mononucleosis. Let me reconsider and verify the prevalence. The sports medicine position statement emphasizes that splenomegaly is common and complicates return-to-play decisions, but estimates vary across cohorts, with some pediatric series citing around 50–60% and others higher, so I should qualify that while frequent, it is not literally universal, and the key point remains that in typical cases it resolves with convalescence [^notfound] [^117Dk8m9] [^1161KCFn].

> Next, I should review practical follow-up and imaging. Physical examination is unreliable for spleen size, so if there is concern for persistent splenomegaly or high-risk activity, abdominal ultrasound is the first-line modality to confirm size and track resolution, and serial imaging can be used to document return to baseline before clearing an athlete, though many decisions are ultimately clinical in the absence of standardized imaging thresholds [^11195uWp] [^113Y9q3s] [^112K9QMy].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: for immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated EBV mononucleosis, splenomegaly is typically transient and resolves within weeks to a few months as the acute inflammatory response abates. Persistent or permanent splenomegaly after EBV is uncommon and should prompt evaluation for alternative or additional etiologies such as CAEBV, HLH, chronic liver disease, lymphoproliferative disorders, or other infections, with targeted workup including EBV PCR, comprehensive metabolic panel, CBC with differential, and imaging as indicated [^113kiBFU] [^112aJCxr] [^113aDEWh].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical advice is actionable: counsel patients that splenic enlargement usually returns to normal after recovery, maintain activity restrictions for at least 3–4 weeks and up to 6–8 weeks depending on symptoms and risk tolerance, and arrange follow-up if splenomegaly persists beyond about 3 months or if there are red flags such as cytopenias, fever, weight loss, or lymphadenopathy, which would warrant reassessment for atypical EBV syndromes or other diagnoses [^113FCuAK] [^1122Ejff] [^116Wcq85].

---

In most immunocompetent patients, EBV-associated splenomegaly **resolves within 4–6 weeks** [^115fmDqX] and is not permanent [^111GGz7U]. Persistence beyond 3 months is uncommon and should prompt evaluation for chronic active EBV [^113kiBFU], lymphoproliferative disorders, or other causes [^113aDEWh]. Permanent splenomegaly is rare and typically reflects **underlying disease** or **chronic EBV-related pathology** [^113kiBFU], not uncomplicated acute EBV infection [^111GGz7U].

---

## Typical course of splenomegaly in acute EBV infection

- **Incidence**: Splenomegaly occurs in ~50–60% of acute EBV cases [^1161KCFn].
- **Resolution**: Most cases resolve within 4–6 weeks after symptom onset [^notfound].
- **Clinical course**: Acute EBV is self-limited; splenomegaly typically regresses as the immune response clears the infection [^116vVKbN].

---

## Factors influencing persistence of splenomegaly

Several factors influence **persistent splenomegaly** after EBV infection:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Immune status | Immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV, transplant, primary immunodeficiencies) are at higher risk of persistent splenomegaly [^115RT1Wa] [^116en7tP]. |
| Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) | Persistent or recurrent IM-like symptoms with high EBV loads can cause chronic splenomegaly [^114a7hR5] [^113kiBFU]. |
| Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) | EBV-triggered HLH can cause prolonged splenomegaly [^notfound]. |
| Lymphoproliferative disorders | EBV-associated lymphomas (e.g. Hodgkin, DLBCL, Burkitt) may present with persistent splenomegaly [^113VaMNy] [^111F4RGR]. |
| Autoimmune complications | Autoimmune hemolytic anemia or ITP can prolong splenomegaly [^notfound]. |

---

## Clinical evidence on persistence of splenomegaly

- **Typical cases**: Most immunocompetent patients experience complete resolution of splenomegaly within weeks to a few months [^notfound].
- **Persistent cases**: A minority have splenomegaly lasting > 3 months; these often have underlying immunological or hematological disorders [^116Egf9R] [^114a7hR5].
- **Permanent splenomegaly**: Rare and usually due to chronic EBV-related diseases (e.g. CAEBV, lymphoproliferative disorders) or other chronic conditions [^113kiBFU] [^114rnkcX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **routine resolution** of splenomegaly in acute EBV infection and recommend further evaluation if it persists beyond 3 months [^notfound]. Key recommendations include:

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound is first-line to confirm splenomegaly and monitor resolution [^11195uWp] [^113Y9q3s].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, liver function tests, EBV serology, and PCR to assess ongoing viral activity [^112dXQs2] [^1121E4yU] [^115K2txq].
- **Specialist referral**: Hematology or infectious disease referral if splenomegaly persists > 3 months or if complications arise [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications of persistent splenomegaly

Persistent splenomegaly can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Splenic rupture**: Rare but life-threatening; risk is highest in the first 3–4 weeks after symptom onset [^1159xfv9] [^1122Ejff].
- **Hypersplenism**: Sequestration and destruction of blood cells causing anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia [^116Egf9R] [^116XcTcs].
- **Increased infection risk**: Functional hyposplenism or asplenia increases susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies for persistent splenomegaly

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Supportive care**: Rest, analgesics, and activity restriction until splenomegaly resolves [^115fmDqX] [^114sMgCX].
- **Antiviral therapy**: Limited efficacy in acute EBV; considered in severe cases or immunocompromised patients [^114sMgCX].
- **Immunosuppressive therapy**: Used in autoimmune complications or HLH [^112X7wcv] [^113uwdWy].
- **Surgical intervention**: Splenectomy reserved for refractory hypersplenism or recurrent splenic rupture [^1122Ejff].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

In immunocompetent patients, the prognosis is **excellent**, with complete resolution of splenomegaly in most cases [^115fmDqX] [^114sMgCX]. In immunocompromised patients or those with chronic EBV-related diseases, prognosis varies and may require long-term management and monitoring [^113kiBFU] [^116vVKbN].

---

Splenomegaly from acute EBV infection is **usually transient**, resolving within weeks to a few months [^115fmDqX]; persistence beyond 3 months is uncommon and should prompt evaluation for chronic EBV infection, lymphoproliferative disorders, or other causes [^113kiBFU]. Permanent splenomegaly is rare and typically reflects underlying chronic disease or EBV-related pathology [^113kiBFU].

Background

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a γ-human herpesvirus, is one of the most common pathogens, with seropositivity rates approaching 90%. Primary EBV infections primarily occur in childhood, manifesting as infectious mononucleosis with fever, angina, lymphadenectasis, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. After primary infections, EBV may latent in B cells. Reduplication of these latent viruses occur when immune function decreased or impaired.

Studies on EBV have focused on patients with neoplastic disease and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A limited number of studies have involved immunocompetent patients who were not severely immunocompromised.

EBV is a non-eosinophilic virus, but it is also a pathogen that causes liver injury, and even liver failure. Autoimmune liver diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, have a potential causative link with EBV. Vine et al. reported that in patients presenting with jaundice/hepatitis, EBV hepatitis is an uncommon diagnosis and causes a self-limiting hepatitis. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of a lymphocytosis and/or splenomegaly. The majority of patients do not have infectious mononucleosis. Ulug et al. have reported a case of acute hepatitis associated with acute EBV infection. Also, Gupta et al. have described two cases of acute hepatitis after EBV infection.

Liver cirrhosis is the final stage of chronic liver disease from any cause, and is associated with immune dysfunction, which is referred to as cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction syndrome; however, the primary infection or an EBV infection is unknown in the case of mild immune dysfunction that occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis.

Ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatorenal syndrome are the main complications of cirrhosis and the most common cause of death. It is well-known that the Child-Pugh score and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score can be used to accurately assess liver function and prognoses of patients with liver cirrhosis. Other studies have reported that hepatocellular carcinoma, hypoalbuminemia, bacterial infections, and secondary infections may predict a worse prognosis in liver cirrhosis; however, the above studies were based on univariate analyses. In addition, apart from the above risk factors, it is unclear whether or not EBV infection influences prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis. In this study, we aim to retrospective analyze the EBV infection rate and the influence on liver function, and also analyze the risk factors for mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis.

### Epstein-Barr virus-recent advances [^111agRbr]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2003). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus is a tumorigenic herpes virus that is ubiquitous in the adult population. The virus is generally spread to and between young children through salivary contact, and only causes clinical illness where primary infection is delayed until adolescence or beyond, when an intense immunopathological reaction leads to the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis in roughly 50% of cases. More than 90% of the world's population carry Epstein-Barr virus as a life-long, latent infection of B lymphocytes. Recent data show that by mimicking B-cell antigen-activation pathways the virus enters the long-lived memory B lymphocyte pool where it evades immune elimination by severely restricting its own gene expression. By influencing B-cell survival mechanisms Epstein-Barr virus may induce tumours such as B lymphoproliferative disease and Hodgkin's disease. Vaccines are being developed to prevent and/or treat these conditions, but an animal model is required to study pathogenesis before a rational vaccine strategy can be formulated.

### B-lymphotropic viruses in a novel tropical splenic lymphoma [^1158aW9M]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Peripheral blood from patients with a novel tropical splenic lymphoma, characterized by splenomegaly and circulating naïve CD5-negative villous B lymphocytes, has been screened for evidence of an association with the B-lymphotropic viruses, Epstein — Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). No increased prevalence of EBV, HCV and HHV8 was demonstrated using serological and molecular techniques, compared with a geographical, age-matched control group. However, lymphoma patients had markedly raised EBV antibody levels without a concomitant increase in the rate of detection of viral genomes in the peripheral blood. This phenomenon also occurred in patients with hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly, a condition that occurs in the same geographical area and that is clinically indistinguishable from tropical splenic lymphoma, adding further weight to the suggestion that there may be an aetiological association between these two disorders.

### Epstein-Barr virus associated multicentric Castleman's disease disguised as infectious mononucleosis [^113XNEJq]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Castleman's disease (CD), also called angiofollicular lymphoid hyperplasia, is a rare lymphoproliferative illness with two unique variants: unicentric disease and multicentric disease (MCD). The multicentric variant is rare and presents as a systemic illness with symptoms like peripheral lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, anaemia and systemic inflammatory symptoms. Given the vague and systemic presentation, this variant can be difficult to differentiate from infection and other autoimmune diseases. Here, we discuss the case of a middle-aged female who presented to the hospital with a 2week history of systemic symptoms, including cough, fever, weight loss and painful lymphadenopathy at the neck and posterior auricular region. Initially, the patient was treated for presumed upper respiratory infection in the setting of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); however, an excisional biopsy of the cervical lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of MCD. In this case, we highlight the diagnostic dilemma of MCD, especially in association with EBV.

Clinical manifestations of HHV-8 and KS — Primary infection in young, immunocompetent children may be asymptomatic or present as a self-limited mononucleosis-like illness with fever, mild upper respiratory symptoms, and a maculopapular rash, with a similar presentation in immunocompetent adults; immunocompromised patients may have more severe disseminated infection with fever, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia, and reactivation has been associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in HIV-infected adults; KS presentation varies widely with cutaneous, oral, lymphatic, or visceral involvement, alone or in combination, and pediatric presentations differ from adults, being best described in retrospective cohort studies from sub-Saharan Africa.

### Massive splenomegaly due to concurrent primary Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infection in a patient on adalimumab [^1124eKu7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old man who was receiving adalimumab for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis presented with a 4-week history of fever, night sweats, fatigue, myalgias and diarrhoea. On examination, he had obvious splenomegaly but no lymphadenopathy or pharyngitis. Full blood count revealed mild neutropenia and significant lymphocytosis, with a blood film showing atypical lymphocytes. Liver function tests were mildly deranged with a mixed hepatitic and obstructive pattern. Ultrasound confirmed massive splenomegaly with a span of 21 cm in the long axis. Serological tests confirmed the presence of both primary Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infections. The patient had his adalimumab withheld, was treated with supportive measures and improved over a period of 8weeks. He remained well 5months after the onset of illness with complete normalisation of blood count and a resolution of the splenomegaly.

### How I diagnose and treat splenic lymphomas [^113Xhiaj]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

The incidental finding of an isolated splenomegaly during clinical assessment of patients evaluated for unrelated causes has become increasingly frequent because of the widespread use of imaging. Therefore, the challenging approach to the differential diagnosis of spleen disorders has emerged as a rather common issue of clinical practice. A true diagnostic dilemma hides in distinguishing pathologic conditions primarily involving the spleen from those in which splenomegaly presents as an epiphenomenon of hepatic or systemic diseases. Among the causes of isolated splenomegaly, lymphoid malignancies account for a relevant, yet probably underestimated, number of cases. Splenic lymphomas constitute a wide and heterogeneous array of diseases, whose clinical behavior spans from indolent to highly aggressive. Such a clinical heterogeneity is paralleled by the high degree of biologic variation in the lymphoid populations from which they originate. Nevertheless, the presenting clinical, laboratory, and pathologic features of these diseases often display significant overlaps. In this manuscript, we present our approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these rare lymphomas, whose complexity has been so far determined by the lack of prospectively validated prognostic systems, treatment strategies, and response criteria.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^117YHmor]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in liver transplant (LT) recipients — AASLD/AST practice guideline — states that PTLD should be considered in LT recipients (especially high-risk individuals) who present with unexplained fever, lymphadenopathy, or cytopenias (grade 1, level A). Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated PTLD is described as an uncommon but serious complication of LT with an incidence in adults of 0.9% to 2.9%. Reported risk factors include a primary EBV infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) donor-recipient mismatch or CMV disease, and augmented immunosuppression, especially with anti-lymphocyte antibodies; later onset PTLD is less likely to be EBV-associated. Clinical manifestations include lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, unexplained fever, and disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^113Y9q3s]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) splenomegaly assessment and RTP decision-making — Physical examination is unreliable and advanced imaging lacks normal-reference data; given variable spleen size, imaging for RTP should be used as individually indicated with consideration of serial studies, yet without baseline and serial examinations determining when the spleen has stopped enlarging and is decreasing back to normal cannot be accurately made; for athletes with laboratory abnormalities there are no IM-specific return-to-play guidelines, so clinical judgment and resolution of the individual complication dictate resumption, and most RTP decisions must be based on clinical and functional measures and usually will not involve imaging.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of infectious mononucleosis by Epstein-Barr virus in Mexican children [^116JGzpu]. BMC Research Notes (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious mononucleosis:

- **Definition**: IM, also known as mono or "kissing disease", is an acute infection characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis.
- **Pathophysiology**: IM is most frequently caused by the EBV transmitted through infected saliva during kissing.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of IM in the US is estimated at 500 cases per 100,000 population per year, with the peak incidence between ages 15–24 years. However, over 90% of adults globally are EBV seropositive.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for EBV infection include age, specifically adolescents and young adults, intimate oral contact, transfusion of infected blood, solid organ transplantation, and hematopoietic cell transplantation.
- **Disease course**: Young children are often asymptomatic, and symptoms frequently occur in adolescents and young adults. Clinical manifestations include pharyngitis, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, generalized muscle aches, hepatosplenomegaly, maculopapular rash, jaundice, arthritis, conjunctivitis, and edema. Complications include hematological complications (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, TTP, HUS, and DIC), neurologic complications (Guillain-Barre syndrome, facial paralysis, meningoencephalitis, aseptic meningitis, transversal myelitis, peripheral neuritis, cerebellitis, and optical neuritis), splenic rupture, airway obstruction, pneumonia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (prolonged fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, exanthem, hepatic dysfunction, and cytopenia).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most patients achieve complete resolution within weeks, and mortality rates are low (5.3%). EBV remains dormant post-recovery, but symptomatic reactivation is rare. Primary EBV infection may result in chronic multisystem disease, presenting as either recurrent symptoms emerging months to years after the initial illness or as persistent IM syndrome, involving proliferation of B cells, NK cells, and T cells. Chronic active EBV infection is a rare but severe complication characterized by a disease course lasting > 6 months, histologic evidence of major organ involvement (such as interstitial pneumonia, hemophagocytosis, uveitis, lymphadenitis, or persistent hepatitis), and the detection of EBV DNA, RNA, or proteins in affected tissues. Prognosis is poor, with most patients dying within a few years due to complications such as progressive pancytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, or NK/T-cell nasal lymphoma. Chronic active EBV infection is more prevalent in Asia and South America.

### Splenic infarction caused by a rare coinfection of Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [^11252fY1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are common pathogens of respiratory infection among children and young adults. Although single infection of 1 of these pathogens is common enough, their coinfection has been rarely reported. A 19-year-old woman presented with severe upper abdominal pain for 5 hours as well as flu-like symptoms and jaundice for 2 to 3 weeks. Initial tests found pancytopenia, abnormal liver functions, and presence of atypical lymphocytes in blood smear; the computed tomography of the abdomen revealed para-aortic lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and a wedge-shaped focal hypodensity lesion at the periphery of the spleen that was later diagnosed as splenic infarction. Her presentation raised suspicion of infectious mononucleosis. Nevertheless, monospot test, human immunodeficiency virus screening, and hepatitis viral serology were all negative, except that her M pneumoniae immunoglobulin M was found positive. Azithromycin was promptly given, but her fever and abdominal pain persisted. A strong suspicion of mononucleosis led to serological tests for EBV and CMV, which confirmed coinfection of EBV and CMV. By hospital day 7, her fever and abdominal pain had subsided and her liver function became normal. This case exemplifies the challenges in the diagnosis of coinfection of multiple respiratory pathogens and its associated complications. Greater awareness among clinicians would ensure an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of coinfection of EBV/CMV with other respiratory pathogen(s).

### Development of EBV related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 with uncontrolled EBV infection [^113VaMNy]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

After 6 years of Ig replacement monotherapy with successful control of sinopulmonary bacterial infections, the patient presented in March 2021 with more prominent features of immune dysregulation including small joint arthropathy and alopecia without fevers. Screening for potential causes detected EBV viraemia 1103 copies/mL (reference range: < 50). She was treated with a short course of oral prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine for these symptoms. EBV had not been monitored prior to this presentation and remained elevated (255–1728 copies/mL) over the next 2 months. During this period the patient's symptoms resolved, and she subsequently self-ceased immune suppression and was lost to follow up.

She represented in September 2021 with a reported 4-month history of recurrent fevers, 11 kg weight loss and progressive lymphadenopathy. Tri-lineage cytopenia was recognised with reductions in haemoglobin (94 g/L, range: 115–160), neutrophils (1.6 × 10 9 /L, range: 2–8), lymphocytes (0.3 × 10 9 /L, range: 1–4) and platelets (109 × 10 9 /L, range: 150–400). Persistent EBV viraemia was identified with a peak viral load of 127,500 copies/mL. CMV was not detected. Other significant pathology included elevated levels of CRP (50 mg/L; reference range: < 5), ESR (36 mm/hr; reference range: < 25), LDH (370 U/L; reference range: < 250), soluble CD25 (15,096 pg/mL; reference range: < 2678) and ferritin (1355 ug/L; reference range: < 150). No evidence of a B cell lymphoproliferative disorder was identified by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood. The duration of symptoms was not consistent with previous episodes of immune dysregulation. During the diagnostic phase the patient was treated with oral valaciclovir 1 g twice daily initially without other immunomodulatory therapy and a progressive reduction in EBV viral load to < 150 copies/mL was noted. CT imaging demonstrated a significant progression of previously identified granulomatous lesions and development of new lesions affecting the lung, liver and spleen (Fig. 1 a and b). PET CT demonstrated multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the liver and spleen with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm (Fig. 1 c). Core biopsy of the liver demonstrated necrotising granulomatous inflammation with a small rim of atypical lymphoid cells. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated mildly hypercellular marrow with myeloid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia and reactive lymphoid nodules in keeping with reactive marrow. There was no evidence of haemophagocytosis or lymphoma involvement in the bone marrow sample. Sequential assessment of a type I Interferon gene signature (IFN-stimulated genes; ISG) was performed prior to the development of lymphoma. The ISG score, EBV viral load and timing of key clinical events are presented in Fig. 2. The ISG score represents the median fold change in mRNA expression of six type I ISGs (IFI27, IFI44L, ISG15, IFIT1, RSAD2, SIGLEC1) relative to healthy controls as described by Rice et al.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^111hyMyU]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) conjunctivitis presents with follicular conjunctivitis that is typically unilateral with ipsilateral lymphadenopathy; it can have hemorrhagic conjunctivitis with subconjunctival hemorrhage and periorbital edema, a conjunctival nodule is an uncommon finding, and systemic signs include generalized fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Follicular conjunctivitis is the most common ocular disease during acute EBV infection, and other major causes of nonadenoviral acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis are enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24. The natural history is often self-limiting and can present as oculoglandular syndrome. Potential sequelae include dry eye syndrome, dacryoadenitis, episcleritis, keratitis, uveitis, choroiditis, retinitis, retinal vasculitis, papillitis, and ophthalmoplegia.

### Severe ulcerative oesophagitis caused by primary Epstein-Barr virus infection in an immunocompetent individual [^117XF3kN]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects > 90% of the human population worldwide and with a variety of manifestations, notably infectious mononucleosis characterised by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatomegaly, and/or splenomegaly. After the primary infection, EBV is present lifelong as latent infection in B lymphocytes, but reactivation is rare — and if so typically due to immune impairment. Reactivation of EBV is a known, but rare, cause of infectious oesophagitis in immunosuppressed patients. In immunocompetent patients, however, primary EBV oesophagitis has only anecdotally been described.

### Familial persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis [^116nAbvN]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2001). Low credibility.

We report the occurrence of the syndrome of persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in a brother and a sister. Both showed the morphological and immunophenotypic features of this rare disorder. In addition both had mild splenomegaly, increase of serum IgM and serological evidence of previous EBV infection. Of interest, two additional brothers had no evidence of PPBL but were indistinguishable in terms of HLA haplotype (HLA-DR7), smoking habits or evidence of EBV infection. These observations provide additional support for a genetic basis of the syndrome but suggest that pathogenic factors other than those known so far may be required for its full expression.

### Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection with cutaneous and sinus lymphoproliferation in a white female patient with 25 years' follow-up: an original case report [^114gggWj]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is characterized by chronic infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms associated with very high viral load, as assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We present an unusual case in a French woman who was followed up over 25 years with cutaneous and sinus lymphoproliferation. This white woman presented with a long history of recurrent cutaneous necrotic papules of the skin, which started during childhood and healed spontaneously with depressed scars. The lesions spread to the left maxillary sinus and were associated with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with no other visceral locations. Pathological examination of the skin and sinus revealed a dermal monoclonal T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, CD7(+) and CD20(-), with no epidermotropism. T-cell receptor rearrangement was positive, showing the monoclonality from the first biopsy. This T-cell proliferation was positive for EBV-encoded small RNA and was associated with a high EBV viral load. Since then, the patient has been in good health, despite a permanently high EBV viral load. Hydroa vacciniforme (HV)-like lymphoma and natural killer/T-cell lymphoma were discussed, but none really fit our case. Natural killer cell lymphoma was ruled out because of the indolent course, but sinus lesions do not exist in HV-like lymphoma. A therapeutic approach is difficult because of the coexistence of viral infection and monoclonal T-cell proliferation. Chemotherapy is not efficient and induces immunosuppression, which may worsen the prognosis. Although rituximab may have an immunomodulatory function, it was not effective in our case.

### Clinical spectrum and features of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ syndrome: a large patient cohort study [^115pKDPE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Nonneoplastic lymphoproliferation

Chronic lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and/or hepatomegaly were observed in 75% of patients (Table I). Lymphadenopathy typically began in childhood, was persistent or recurrent, and was often localized to sites of infection. There were 14 cases of cervical lymphadenopathy; 8 of 10 patients with persistent intrathoracic lymphadenopathy had bronchiectasis and recurrent consolidation. Seven patients had diffuse lymphadenopathy, and EBV, CMV, or dual viremia was diagnosed in all 6 of these patients in whom viral PCR was performed. Lymphadenopathy was significantly associated with mucosal lymphoid hyperplasia (OR, 16; 95% CI, 1.9–133.8; p = 0.002), splenomegaly (OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 2.5–33.2; p = 0.0005), and herpesvirus infection (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.9–25.2; p = 0.004).

Histologically (Fig 2), lymph nodes showed atypical follicular hyperplasia with absent or attenuated follicular mantle zones. Germinal centers were frequently disrupted and partially effaced by numerous T cells, many of which were programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) +, CD57 +, or both, which is consistent with follicular T H cells. Parasinusoidal aggregates of monocytoid B cells were a recurrent feature. IgG + plasma cells were reduced in number. One lymph node showed features analogous to those of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, which is characterized by a polymorphic infiltrate of B cells, T cells, epithelioid macrophages, and light chain–restricted plasma cells; monocytoid B-cell hyperplasia; and equivocal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement assays. There was no progression to lymphoma on prolonged follow-up. Scattered EBV-positive cells, CMV-positive cells, or both were present in several lymph nodes, but florid infectious mononucleosis-like pathology was not encountered. Mucosal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia was visualized as cobblestone-like plaques or polyps in 17 (32%) patients. In the gastrointestinal tract mucosal lymphoid hyperplasia was identified endoscopically anywhere from the epiglottis to the rectum in 14 (26%) subjects and associated with diarrhea, bleeding, and rectal prolapse. Five patients had respiratory mucosal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia identified bronchoscopically (Fig 2). Biopsy specimens from mucosal lymphoid lesions showed follicular hyperplasia, often with features similar to those seen in lymph nodes (Fig 2), and were occasionally PCR positive for herpes viruses (EBV, n = 1; HSV, n = 1).

### Genetic susceptibility to EBV infection: insights from inborn errors of immunity [^1168CEHE]. Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen, infecting > 90% of the adult population. In the vast majority of healthy individuals, infection with EBV runs a relatively benign course. However, EBV is by no means a benign pathogen. Indeed, apart from being associated with at least seven different types of malignancies, EBV infection can cause severe and often fatal diseases-hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, lymphoproliferative disease, B-cell lymphoma-in rare individuals with specific monogenic inborn errors of immunity. The discovery and detailed investigation of inborn errors of immunity characterized by heightened susceptibility to, or increased frequency of, EBV-induced disease have elegantly revealed cell types and signaling pathways that play critical and non-redundant roles in host-defense against EBV. These analyses have revealed not only mechanisms underlying EBV-induced disease in rare genetic conditions, but also identified molecules and pathways that could be targeted to treat severe EBV infection and pathological consequences in immunodeficient hosts, or even potentially enhance the efficacy of an EBV-specific vaccine.

### Epstein-Barr virus in multiple sclerosis: past, present, and future [^117Frv53]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary EBV Infection and the Acute Immune Response

During acute infection, the virus undergoes active replication and produces new viral progeny. Most of the primary EBV infections that occur in childhood are asymptomatic. Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a syndrome that is characterized by severe pharyngitis, cervical lymph node enlargement, fever, fatigue, and possible splenomegaly and hepatomegaly and occurs most commonly in adolescents and young adults. IM is triggered by high EBV viral loads in the oral cavity and blood, with up to 50% of memory B cells infected at peak.EBV is cleared rapidly from the blood but can persist in saliva at high viral loads with retained infectivity for at least 6 months.

In asymptomatic EBV infection in children, age does not seem to influence antiviral antibody titers. IM-associated acute EBV infection coincides with an overactive immune response manifesting in the generation of IgM antibodies against EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) as well as a significant expansion of NK cells and CD8 + T cells. Shortly after the development of early antibodies against EBV VCA, IgG antibodies develop against EBV early antigen (EA) and EBNA2 and then gradually decline. e1 EBNA1-specific IgG antibodies develop around 3–6 months after infection in parallel with EBNA1-specific CD4 + T cells, which persist long term in healthy carriers. e1-e3

### Acute splenomegaly, haemolysis, and thrombocytopenia following luspatercept initiation in a patient with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia: a case report [^112PDXcs]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Selected laboratory parameters with luspatercept treatment over time. LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; RBC, red blood cell.

The patient was transfused 4 units of RBCs for symptomatic anaemia. Luspatercept was discontinued following the fourth dose. The patient's symptoms, haemolytic parameters and transfusion requirements were closely monitored. As highlighted in Table 1, during the 12‐week luspatercept trial, the patient's average RBC transfusion requirement initially increased but then decreased to pretreatment baseline following treatment cessation. Additionally, the patient developed increasing reticulocytes and new thrombocytopenia with a nadir 5 days after the final luspatercept dose, which also improved after treatment discontinuation.

Similarly, subsequent monitoring ultrasounds demonstrated decreasing splenic size with luspatercept discontinuation: an ultrasound assessment completed 15 weeks after the final dose of luspatercept reported a long axis of 18.6 cm and an estimated volume of 328 cc, and repeat imaging 11 months post‐luspatercept initiation demonstrated stable splenic size, reporting a 17.9 cm long axis and estimated volume of 353 cc.

The patient's worsening anaemia and new thrombocytopenia were attributed to increased haemolysis and splenic sequestration, as supported by imaging and laboratory results. The temporal association with luspatercept initiation and the resolution of symptoms, decreased spleen volume and return to baseline laboratory values following treatment cessation raised strong suspicion of luspatercept as the cause. While the patient did report a history of a coincident upper respiratory tract infection, investigations showed no evidence of HIV, EBV or parvovirus B19 infection, nor any changes on peripheral blood film to support this as an alternate aetiology for the patient's splenomegaly and bicytopenia. However, the aetiological possibility of an infection with a virus not tested for cannot be ruled out. Inflammatory markers were not measured but could have been useful to support or refute an infectious aetiology.

### A distinct subtype of Epstein-Barr virus-positive T / NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder: adult patients with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection-like features [^1136C79q]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) generally infects almost all people by early adulthood. Although EBV infection in childhood is asymptomatic in most people, some develop infectious mononucleosis (the so-called "kissing disease"). Almost all of them recover spontaneously after EBV-specific immunity is established.

In addition, EBV has been reported to be involved in transformation from reactive to neoplastic or abnormal proliferation in some immunocompetent hosts after it infects B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. This results in a wide range of conditions known as EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases (EBV-LPD), including chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV), which produces infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms such as chronic persistent or recurrent fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, liver dysfunction, and hepatosplenomegaly, and has been reported to have a high mortality rate. – In CAEBV, EBV-infected T cells and NK cells play important roles. Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites, the presence of hydroa vacciniforme (HV), high EBV-related antibody titers, and a high EBV-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy number in peripheral blood have been reported to be characteristic of CAEBV; however, there is often no discernable immunological abnormality, or history thereof until the patient has been diagnosed, at which point symptoms have rapidly progressed. – Although the mechanism of onset is still unknown, CAEBV is thought to progress to an EBV-associated T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder by clonal expansion of T cells or NK cells infected with EBV. In addition, CAEBV can have potentially fatal complications such as hemophagocytic syndrome, interstitial pneumonia, malignant lymphoma, myocarditis, and central nervous system infiltration. This entity is currently defined as systemic EBV-positive T-LPD of childhood because almost all diagnoses are made in pediatric patients. However, similar clinical conditions have also been reported in adults (EBV-T/NK-LPD with CAEBV-like features in adult; adult-onset CAEBV).

### Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection in a teenage girl with suspect autoimmune hepatitis [^115qNdfk]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Computed tomography showed diffuse hypodense infiltration (asterisk) with marked enlargement of the liver, associated with splenomegaly, a prominent portal vein, peri-splenic/peri-gastric collaterals, and ascites, which correlated with portal hypertension and hepatic steatosis

About 1 year after her first hospitalization, the patient was admitted for sudden-onset involuntary movement of the extremities with recent tongue ulceration and non-blanchable, non-pruritic macules on both ankles and ascending to her thighs. She had experienced progressive hair loss in the prior few months. Electroencephalography revealed no relevant finding. Five months later, the patient suffered from bilateral lower leg swelling, chest pain, and dyspnea for several weeks. She had recently complained of vertigo, poor appetite, sleepiness, headache, and bilateral periocular edema. The evaluation for SLE was repeated; the patient's C3, C4, and anti-dsDNA levels were within the normal ranges. Cardiac sonography revealed minimal pericardial effusion. Renal sonography demonstrated a hyperechoic change with enlargement of both kidneys, suggesting renal parenchyma disease with massive ascites. A renal biopsy showed moderate-to-marked tubulitis accompanied by marked mononuclear cell infiltration in the interstitium, suggesting tubulointerstitial nephritis. The patient did not meet the criteria for SLE.

### Epstein-Barr virus induced haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^112X7wcv]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare condition of uncontrolled immune activation as a result of an inherited genetic defect or in response to malignancy, autoimmune disease, rheumatological disease, AIDS infection or post-transplant immunosuppression. Described here is the case of a 19-year-old Caucasian man who presented with complaints of worsening fever, new-onset jaundice and lethargy after failing treatment for suspected infectious mononucleosis. Physical examination was significant for fever and splenomegaly while laboratory results revealed transaminitis, cytopaenia, indirect hyperbilirubinaemia and elevated ferritin, raising the likelihood of both autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and HLH. He tested positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow with haemophagocytosis and no evidence of malignancy. High dose steroids were initiated with significant improvement in haemoglobin, resulting in a final diagnosis of HLH secondary to acute EBV infection. The patient was discharged on continued high-dose prednisone with planned taper and consideration of outpatient rituximab therapy for 4 weeks. High clinical suspicion and prompt evaluation were critical to early treatment and decreased morbidity.

### Autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T cells for the treatment of persistent active EBV infection [^116C92fp]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) infection syndrome is a heterogeneous EBV-related disorder characterized by chronic fatigue, fever, lymphadenopathy, and/or hepatosplenomegaly, associated with abnormal patterns of antibody to EBV. CAEBV can range from disabling mild/moderate forms to rapidly lethal disorders. Even patients with mild/moderate disease frequently suffer adverse effects from long-term anti-inflammatory agents and have a quality of life that progressively deteriorates. It is still unknown why these individuals are unable to produce an effective immune response to control EBV, and no effective treatment is currently available. Since ex vivo-expanded EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs) can safely restore EBV-specific cellular immune responses in immunodeficient patients, we assessed the possibility that adoptive immunotherapy might also effectively treat CAEBV infection. Following stimulation with irradiated EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), EBV-CTLs were successfully generated from 8 of 8 patients with the mild/moderate form of CAEBV infection. These CTLs were predominantly CD3(+) CD8(+) cells and produced specific killing of the autologous LCLs. There were 5 patients with 1- to 12-year histories of disease who were treated with 1 to 4 injections of EBV-CTLs. Following infusion, there was resolution of fatigue and malaise, disappearance of fever, and regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The pattern and titers of anti-EBV antibodies also normalized. No toxicity was observed. There were 4 patients who did not show any relapse of disease within 6 to 36 months follow-up; one patient had recurrence of fatigue and myalgia one year after CTL infusion. We suggest that adoptive immunotherapy with autologous EBV-CTLs may represent a safe and feasible alternative treatment for patients affected with mild/moderate CAEBV infection and that this approach should be evaluated in the more severe forms of the disease.

### Steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis [^115uuHtF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever or the kissing disease, is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. It is a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous herpes virus that is found in all human societies and cultures. Epidemiological studies show that over 95% of adults worldwide have been infected with EBV. Most cases of symptomatic infectious mononucleosis occur between the ages of 15 and 24 years. It is transmitted through close contact with an EBV shedder, contact with infected saliva or, less commonly, through sexual contact, blood transfusions or by sharing utensils; however, transmission actually occurs less than 10% of the time. Precautions are not needed to prevent transmission because of the high percentage of seropositivity for EBV. Infectious mononucleosis is self-limiting and typically lasts for two to three weeks. Nevertheless, symptoms can last for weeks and occasionally months. Symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly and fatigue. Symptom relief and rest are commonly recommended treatments. Steroids have been used for their anti-inflammatory effects, but there are no universal criteria for their use.

Objectives

The objectives of the review were to determine the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy versus placebo, usual care or different drug therapies for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis.

Search Methods

For this 2015 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2015) and EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2015). We also searched trials registries, however we did not identify any new relevant completed or ongoing trials for inclusion. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We adapted the search terms when searching EMBASE.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing the effectiveness of steroids with placebo, usual care, or other interventions for symptom control for people with documented infectious mononucleosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

For this 2015 update, we did not identify any new RCTs for inclusion. The previous version of the review included seven trials with a total of 362 participants. Four trials compared the effectiveness of a steroid to placebo for short-term symptom control in glandular fever, one to aspirin, and two trials explored the effects of steroids in conjunction with an antiviral. Heterogeneity between trials prevented a combined analysis. Trials under-reported methodological design features. Three trials did not adequately describe sequence generation for randomisation. Four trials provided adequate details of allocation concealment. All trials were double-blind but four were not specific as to who was blinded. Loss to follow-up was under-reported in four trials, making it difficult to exclude attrition bias. The risk of selective reporting in the included trials was unclear. Across the trials, no benefit was found in 8/10 assessments of health improvement. Two trials found benefit of steroid therapy over placebo in reducing sore throat at 12 hours (eight-day course odds ratio (OR) 21.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94 to 227.20; one-dose OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 16.32), but the benefit was not maintained. In combination with an antiviral drug, participants in the steroid group had less pharyngeal discomfort between days two to four (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.08) compared to placebo. Across the trials the effects on other common symptoms were less clear. Two trials set out to measure safety; they documented no major adverse effects. In two other trials adverse events were reported, including respiratory distress and acute onset of diabetes. However, the association of the events with the steroid is not definite.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to the efficacy of steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis. There is a lack of research on the side effects and long-term complications.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^112ysxVt]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) research priorities in athletes — IM commonly affects young athletes with varied presentations and early features of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy, and the article identifies needs for studies on oral steroids, antiviral therapies, or vaccines; because splenic rupture is extremely rare and risk studies across splenomegaly degrees and return-to-activity timetables are not feasible, the authors propose defining the natural history of splenic size with baseline and follow-up measurements, correlating with symptoms, examination, and laboratory findings, and exploring the role of exercise, noting that many athletes participate without complication and better natural-history data may prevent unnecessary activity restrictions.

### Common questions about infectious mononucleosis [^114sMgCX]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr is a ubiquitous virus that infects 95% of the world population at some point in life. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections are often asymptomatic, some patients present with the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis (IM). The syndrome most commonly occurs between 15 and 24 years of age. It should be suspected in patients presenting with sore throat, fever, tonsillar enlargement, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal inflammation, and palatal petechiae. A heterophile antibody test is the best initial test for diagnosis of EBV infection, with 71% to 90% accuracy for diagnosing IM. However, the test has a 25% false-negative rate in the first week of illness. IM is unlikely if the lymphocyte count is less than 4,000 mm3. The presence of EBV-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies confirms infection, but the test is more costly and results take longer than the heterophile antibody test. Symptomatic relief is the mainstay of treatment. Glucocorticoids and antivirals do not reduce the length or severity of illness. Splenic rupture is an uncommon complication of IM. Because physical activity within the first three weeks of illness may increase the risk of splenic rupture, athletic participation is not recommended during this time. Children are at the highest risk of airway obstruction, which is the most common cause of hospitalization from IM. Patients with immunosuppression are more likely to have fulminant EBV infection.

We report a case of hydroa vacciniforme-like skin eruptions with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection in a 16-year-old boy. The patient had repeated episodes of vesiculo-necrotic eruptions on the face, trunk, and extremities for 13 years. General symptoms included fever, splenomegaly, and abnormal liver function. Histopathological examination of skin biopsy specimen demonstrated dense infiltration of lymphocytes, histocytes, and some neutrophils and plasma cells in the dermis. Immunohistochemical stain revealed that the lymphocytes were positive for T cell and B cell markers. Epstein-Barr virus infection studies and systemic presentation confirmed the diagnosis.

Mild splenomegaly is common in patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis. Massive splenomegaly, however, is rare and requires further evaluation to exclude other causes. We report an adolescent girl with previously undiagnosed type 1 Gaucher disease who presented with massive splenomegaly. The diagnosis of her underlying condition was hampered by the presence of a positive heterophile antibody test for infectious mononucleosis.

### Hodgkin's lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus reactivation and fatal haemophagocytic syndrome [^115YCH5H]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Haemophagocytic syndrome is a serious disorder, often related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or other infectious agents. Frequently an underlying immune abnormality or a T-cell lymphoma is present. The combination of haemophagocytosis and Hodgkin's lymphoma seems to be rare. A 70-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted with constitutional symptoms, persistent fever, pancytopenia, deranged liver enzymes, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A fatal coagulopathy supervened. The clinical picture and the bone marrow findings indicated a haemophagocytic syndrome and a lymph node biopsy disclosed an EBV-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma. EBV serology pointed at viral reactivation and a high EBV DNA content was detected in serum by real-time quantitative PCR analysis (5.5 x 10(6) copies per mL). The case history is presented and the literature is reviewed.

### Infectious mononucleosis progressing to fatal malignant lymphoma: a case report and review of the literature [^111SRX35]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2003). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is nearly ubiquitous. While most primary EBV infections aremild and self-limited, occasional patients will develop severe complications of infectious mononucleosis (IM). Potentially fatal complications include fulminant hepatic failure, virus associated hemophagocytic syndrome and lymphoproliferative disorders. We report the case of an apparently immunocompetent 21-year-old woman with IM that progressed within weeks from a polyclonal B cell proliferation to a fatal B cell lymphoma.

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^113uwdWy]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Primary EBV infection in the patient on immunosuppressive therapy — management in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) focuses on holding therapy during acute infectious mononucleosis with close monitoring and serologies. Once acute infectious mononucleosis is diagnosed, one strategy is to hold immunosuppressive therapy and follow for cytopenia and hyperferritinemia at least weekly, and physicians may choose to check antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) to VCA typically disappears within 4 to 6 weeks, IgG to VCA develops in the first few weeks and persists for life, and IgG to EBNA develops within 2 to 4 months and also persists for life; ideally, immunosuppression should be held until IgG VCA/EBNA is positive and the IgM to VCA is undetectable. Patients who develop cytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia should be referred immediately for hospitalization and urgent evaluation for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), with present strategies including plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, etoposide, or calcineurin inhibitors; alternatively, if clinically recovered and IBD symptoms recur, EBV polymerase chain reaction can be checked and, if the copy number is low, it is reasonable to resume IBD therapy.

### Clinical features and prognostic factors of children with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection: a retrospective analysis of a single center [^117NhSZQ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the clinical characteristics, prognosis factors and risk factors of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection in children.

Study Design

Observational analysis of baseline data and follow-up evaluation data of children with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection in our center between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019; they were followed through June 30, 2020.

Results

There were 96 children with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (50 male and 46 female children), with the median age of 6.7 years (range from 0.6 to 17.6 years) at diagnosis. The median follow-up time was 16.5 months. The 3 most common clinical manifestations were fever, lymph node enlargement, and hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Thirty-three patients (36.3%) also had a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Epstein-Barr virus infected only T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, or both T- and natural killer-cell types in 15 (33.3%), 17 (37.8%), and 13 (28.9%), respectively. At the end of follow-up, 26 children had died, 60 survived, and 10 were lost to follow-up. Generally, progression-free survival was 69.8% ± 2.4%. The level of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 and the combination of younger age and lower pathologic grade at diagnosis were independent prognostic factors by Cox regression analysis (P = 0.009 and .018, respectively).

Conclusions

Children with lower levels of IL-6 and IL-10, or with younger age and lower pathologic grades, generally had favorable outcomes at the terminal point of follow-up, indicating better prognostic signs.

### A distinct subtype of Epstein-Barr virus-positive T / NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder: adult patients with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection-like features [^114jXUvH]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The reasons why adult-onset CAEBV has a poor prognosis may be as follows: (i) recognition of adult-onset CAEBV by physicians is poor, so the condition is often regarded as an unknown fever; (ii) remissions and exacerbations recur for a long period; (iii) treatments are performed after systemic conditions worsen and/or life-threatening complications develop, including hemophagocytic syndrome; (iv) not much is known about the pathobiology; and (v) there is no fundamental treatment.

The accumulation of more cases may help in the recognition of adult-onset CAEBV by revealing the clinical features and elucidating the mechanisms of the molecular pathogenesis.

The following proposed diagnostic criteria for adult-onset CAEBV are very simple and are based on the pediatric-onset disease: (i) several symptoms of infectious mononucleosis are present, such as fever, lymphadenopathies, and hepatosplenomegaly; (ii) exacerbation and remission of symptoms repeat within a certain period; (iii) proven EBV infection in T cells or NK cells in the affected lesions. Hydroa vacciniforme or hypersensitivity to mosquito bites are not essential for the diagnosis, as these symptoms are present in only approximately 30% of cases, even in pediatric-onset CAEBV. The foregoing criteria may help the timely diagnosis of adult-onset CAEBV.

Although there were clinical differences between adult-and pediatric-onset CAEBV, we confirmed that CAEBV is a disease with a varying age of onset. In addition, the prognosis of adult-onset CAEBV appears to be very poor. Therefore, a prescise, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment strategies are critical for adult patients.

Table 2
Results of laboratory screening for potential etiologies among Congolese refugees diagnosed with splenomegaly before or after U.S. resettlement compared with matched controls

Figure 2.
The proportion of Congolese refugees with splenomegaly with malaria attributable to any malaria species (black), Plasmodium falciparum (Pf, purple), Plasmodium vivax (Pv, blue), Plasmodium ovale (Po, red), Plasmodium malariae (Pm, gold), and coinfection with P. falciparum and another Plasmodium species (green) are shown, along with the proportion of those patients who received primaquine after arrival (gray). Malaria speciation was resolved through polymerase chain reaction among patients enrolled for enhanced screening by the International Organization for Migration at enrollment.

Schistosoma IgG ELISA results were available for 30 (23.1%) of 130 cases and 12 (11.8%) of 102 controls. Among the 17 case patients with persistent splenomegaly who had available Schistosoma IgG ELISA results, 11 (64.7%) were positive, and six (60.0%) of 10 patients with available paired absolute eosinophil counts had absolute eosinophilia (≥ 500 eosinophils/µL), possibly indicating ongoing schistosome infection. All patients in the original cohort received a stool ova and parasite examination, and one case patient included in this follow-up investigation tested positive for S. mansoni ova in addition to a second patient who was diagnosed with splenomegaly after U.S. arrival, although all patients (regardless of splenomegaly diagnosis) received preemptive treatment with praziquantel before departure for the United States. No additional O/P examinations were documented after U.S. arrival. Both patients had splenomegaly on arrival, although one patient was lost to follow-up 2 ½ months after arrival, and the condition resolved after 2 months in the other patient, who had 16 months of follow-up after arrival. Positive screening results for hepatitis A (IgG), hepatitis B (sAg), and HCV (IgG) had roughly equivalent proportions for both case patients and controls (Table 2). Of note, HCV serologies were unexpectedly high in both case patients and controls (14.7% and 13.7%, respectively). Sickle cell anemia was not detected in the 50 persons tested before departure. No patients were tested for Epstein–Barr virus infection (IgM or PCR), and only two patients were screened by serology for brucellosis, neither of whom were positive. No evidence of other autoimmune disorders, hemoglobinopathies, or cancers was documented in patients' medical records.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^115fmDqX]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society of Sports Medicine position statement — infectious mononucleosis (IM) in athletes — states that IM is caused primarily by the Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV), presents with fever, pharyngitis, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, and can be confirmed by a positive heterophile antibody ("Monospot"), polymerase chain reaction, or antibodies specific to EBV. Individuals with acute IM may be quite asymptomatic and feel well enough to participate in sports, but splenic enlargement is common and rupture is a relatively rare occurrence typically occurring within a month of symptom onset, complicating sports participation and often prompting activity restriction; management is primarily supportive with no role for antivirals or corticosteroids, and variability in presentation with splenic rupture risk makes return to play/return to sport decisions challenging.

### Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with a higher Child-Pugh score and may predict poor prognoses for patients with liver cirrhosis [^113XGJHv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EBV is an opportunistic infectious virus that is tumorigenic. Indeed, most research has focused on opportunistic infection after transplantation or neoplasia; however, there are no reports involving EBV infections in patients with liver cirrhosis. EBV seropositive rates are as high as 90%. Herein we report that EBV infections in patients with liver cirrhosis reached 37.1%, which is slightly lower than the post-transplantation infection rate.

Primary infections with EBV usually occurs during the first few years of life and is often asymptomatic. It is reported that 75% of young adults have typical infectious mononucleosis after primary EBV infections. After primary infections, EBV may latent in B cells. Reduplication of these latent viruses occur when immune function decreased.

By reviewing the medical records and laboratory data, we found that 68 patients had EB viral capsid antigen (EB-VCA) IgG, all of whom were EB-VCA IgG-positive. Although 29 patients did not have EB-VCA IgG, 100% of the patients with detectable EB-VCA IgG were seropositive. Primary EBV infections mostly occur in childhood. Thus, in this study, it is likely that EBV infection was a reactivation rather than a primary infections. Here 36 patients were EBV reactivation with lower level of reduplication (9573.4 copies/mL mean). And there was no obvious clinical symptoms. And there was no difference in liver and spleen size between EBV infected and uninfected patients. Vine et al. reported that EBV hepatitis is an uncommon diagnosis and causes a self-limiting hepatitis. The majority of patients do not have infectious mononucleosis.

### Epstein-Barr virus-induced sickle hepatopathy [^113w4SVt]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Sickle hepatopathy comprises a spectrum of disorders that vary in severity. Intravascular sickling and sinusoidal occlusion are the principal drivers of sickle hepatopathy, but infection or autoimmunity can act as triggers. We describe two cases of acute sickle hepatopathy initiated by primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, a previously unreported association. The first case entailed a 14-year-old girl with hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease who developed hepatic sequestration crisis that responded to a simple transfusion of erythrocytes. The second case was that of a 16-year-old boy with HbSC disease who experienced life-threatening intrahepatic cholestasis with multiorgan failure.

### Multiple splenic infarcts: unusual presentation of hereditary spherocytosis associated with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection [^117RvEDo]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 19-year-old African American woman presented to the emergency department with a history of left upper quadrant pain for a week, associated with nausea, malaise, loss of appetite, subjective fevers and chills. Her family history is significant for thalassemia in her maternal aunt, and hereditary spherocytosis in her brother, sister and cousin. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed massive splenomegaly and multiple splenic infarcts. On the second day of admission, she developed a fever of 103°F. Further evaluation revealed acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and hereditary spherocytosis. Her condition improved after 4 days on piperacillin/tazobactam, intravenous fluids, analgesics and antipyretics. Our case report describes a thorough clinical evaluation of a patient with fever, anaemia, massive splenomegaly and multiple splenic infarcts. It highlights the need for careful interpretation of multiple positive IgM results on viral serological testing that often accompanies acute EBV infections.

### Life-threatening hypersplenism due to idiopathic portal hypertension in early childhood: case report and review of the literature [^116XcTcs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

Clinical Presentation

A progressive splenomegaly was observed in an otherwise healthy 8 months-old Turkish infant during a pediatric routine examination. The boy's parents are non-consanguineous and healthy, as is his 6-year old brother. The patient's perinatal and neonatal history was unremarkable. An acute infection was initially suspected due to elevated EBV and CMV antibody titers, but a worsening clinical condition with progressive pancytopenia and fever prompted re-evaluation at the age of 13 months. An open liver biopsy, standard bone marrow smear and trephine biopsy demonstrated no features of a metabolic disorder, hematological or immunological disease, infection, hepatic disorder (except for a mild secondary hepatitis) or malignancy.

Over the following 5 months, the boy was not thriving and progression of splenomegaly was obvious by palpation and increasing abdominal girth. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed these findings: the liver size was 13.7 cm and the spleen measured 19.1 cm without any findings of abnormal vessel variations and patent hepatic veins. The portal vein was relatively prominent with a width of 1 cm, which in combination with markedly increased blood flow indicates a hyperdynamic situation (Figure 1C). We concluded that these signs were consistent with increased portal pressure. Gastroscopy confirmed congestive gastropathy grade I. The combination of findings led to the diagnosis of idiopathic portal hypertension. We decided against measuring of portal wedge pressure or partial splenic embolization due to the significant procedure associated risks in this critically ill child. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen showed a dramatic enlargement of the spleen with compression of the neighboring organs (Figure 1A, B). On scintigraphic imaging with In-111-oxinate tagged platelets, liver and spleen exhibited significant pooling indicating severe sequestration in these organs. The boy received prophylactic immunization for suspected splenic dysfunction.

### EBV associated epiglottitis in an immunocompetent child [^1161KCFn]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary EBV infections are common in young infants and children, often occurring without symptoms. When symptoms do present, they can include otitis media, diarrhea, abdominal issues, upper respiratory infections, and infectious mononucleosis (IM). In our patient, the primary EBV infection manifested as subacute epiglottitis, an upper respiratory infection, but also shared similarities with IM, which typically presents as a generalized systemic illness.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a well-known acute manifestation of Epstein-Barr virus infection, typically starting with fever, fatigue, and pharyngitis, often accompanied by tonsillar exudate. Common physical exam findings include generalized lymphadenopathy (90% of cases), splenomegaly (50%), and hepatomegaly (10%). Lymphadenopathy frequently affects the anterior and posterior cervical nodes and submandibular nodes, and less often the axillary and inguinal nodes. Most patients (> 90%) have leukocytosis ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 cells/µL, with at least two-thirds being lymphocytes, and atypical lymphocytes making up 20–40% of the total. Mild thrombocytopenia (50,000–200,000 platelets/µL) occurs in over half of the patients. Hepatic transaminase levels are mildly elevated in about 75% of uncomplicated cases, usually without symptoms or jaundice. A rare but serious complication is upper airway obstruction due to massive tonsillar enlargement and mucosal edema. Our patient had fever, bilateral anterior cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy, atypical lymphocytes, and mild thrombocytopenia. However, due to the avoidance of direct inspection of the oral cavity, we did not observe any tonsillar exudates. The patient did not have hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis, or elevated transaminases. Unlike infectious mononucleosis (IM), the epiglottis was the primary site of airway compromise.

### Outcome of primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: a report on 143 patients from the Italian registry [^111uafhN]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Ninety-two patients (64%) fulfilled the HLH-2004 criteria at diagnosis. A hundred and twenty-eight patients (90%) had fever, 120 (84%) splenomegaly, and 84 (59%) hepatomegaly. CNS involvement (defined as neurological impairment and/ or abnormalities at magnetic resonance imaging or cere-brospinal fluid analysis) was reported in 49 patients (34%). At least bilinear cytopenia was found in 97 patients (68%): the median hemoglobin level was 8 g/dL (IQR, 7.7–10), the median neutrophil count 7.6x10 9 /L (IQR, 0.33–1.72), and the median platelet count 48x10 9 /L (IQR, 24–100). Seventy-two patients (50%) had liver enzyme abnormalities: the median aspartate and alanine aminotransferase values were 164 and 132 U/L (IQR, 66–386 and 56–279, respectively), and the median value of total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL (IQR, 0.5–2.9). The median values of ferritin, triglycerides, and fibrinogen were 2,538 ng/mL (IQR, 1,061–11,550), 278 mg/dL (IQR, 185–428), and 121 mg/dL (IQR, 80–228), respectively. Infectious triggers were detected in 42 patients (29%) and mostly consisted of EBV (N = 21, 50%) and cytomegalovirus (N = 4, 10%). Four patients were asymptomatic and were diagnosed based on familial screening.

### Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection in a teenage girl with suspect autoimmune hepatitis [^113kiBFU]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Characteristics, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment

Because of its rarity, the incidence of CAEBV is unknown. A Japanese study group estimated an annual incidence of 23.8 cases/year in Japan. Notably, T- and NK-cell CAEBV are common in Native Americans and East Asians; B-cell CAEBV was found in 73% of the available tissues in one study in America.

CAEBV is considered to be a disease of childhood. The age of onset is younger in Asia than in the United States (mean 11.3 and 19.0 years, respectively). Fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and hepatitis are the typical symptoms of CAEBV in Asia, whereas lymphadenopathy is the most common symptom in the United States. Hypogammaglobulinemia and pancytopenia have not been reported in Asian CAEBV cases but are present in > 40% of those in the United States.

Several definitions and criteria for CAEBV have been suggested. CAEBV is defined as sustained or recurrent IM-like symptoms for > 3 months, an increased EBV load in peripheral blood or tissue lesions, EBV infection of T or NK cells in peripheral blood or affected tissues, and the exclusion of an underlying immunodeficiency. Early diagnosis of CAEBV is crucial to prevent life-threatening events like sepsis, HLH, systemic lymphoma, and organ failure.

Treatment of CAEBV is problematic because it is both an inflammatory disease and a neoplasm. Immunosuppressive agents, interferon, intravenous immunoglobulins, antiviral therapy, and conventional chemotherapy have merely a transient or poor effect. Only allogeneic HSCT has a measurable effect on the survival rate (15-year survival rate of 60.6% compared to 25.7% without HSCT), although there is a high risk of transplantation-related complications.

### Unresolved splenomegaly in recently resettled Congolese refugees-multiple States, 2015–2018 [^114bfy2M]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Few data, beyond anecdotal clinician reports, exist on tropical splenomegaly, and patients' anticipated clinical course is still largely unknown, particularly after relocation to nontropical environments. In contrast to what has been reported previously, many of the patients in this report had persistent splenomegaly long after arrival, despite receipt of a short course of malaria treatment and removal from an area with endemic malaria, indicating that the clinical course of tropical splenomegaly is still poorly understood. Malaria might still be the predominant underlying etiology, particularly given the presence of species including P. vivax and P. ovale, which can cause relapsing disease, in some refugees. The original recommendation remains unchanged: all refugees of Congolese origin with splenomegaly should receive presumptive treatment with primaquine after arrival in the United States. Despite this recommendation, two thirds of refugees identified with splenomegaly in this investigation did not receive primaquine. Lack of awareness among domestic physicians, need for repeated visits for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing, a long (14-day) course, safety concerns, and availability of primaquine might have contributed to inconsistent administration.

The majority of patients with persistent splenomegaly had some combination of hematologic abnormalities, potentially caused by splenic sequestration. Many patients also had elevated liver transaminases, suggesting a need to monitor hepatic complications in this population. In light of the high proportion of patients with evidence of prior Schistosoma infection (47%) or eosinophilia (22%), it is important for physicians to consider further screening and diagnostic evaluation through stool and urine examination for ova or urinalysis for red blood cells. Among patients with persistent splenomegaly and clinical indicators of Schistosoma infection, such as eosinophilia without any other known cause, clinicians should consider repeating antischistosomal therapy with praziquantel. In addition, because etiology might be multifactorial or patient-specific, clinicians also need to consider further diagnostic testing in cases of persistent splenomegaly for Epstein-Barr virus, autoimmune disorders, or oncologic/hematologic etiologies.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deletions as biomarkers of response to treatment of chronic active EBV [^112D8Lk7]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infects > 95% of the population worldwide. A small number of patients develop life‐threatening persistence of high‐level EBV replication following an infectious mononucleosis syndrome, often associated with splenomegaly and hepatitis. Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease is characterised by infiltration of tissues by EBV + T, natural killer (NK) or less frequently B cells and can progress into lymphoproliferative disease. Clonal expansion of EBV‐infected T or NK cells is well described.

To date, CAEBV has been mostly described in Asian or South/Central American patients. Frequent deletions in the EBV genome have been found in samples from Japanese CAEBV patients (35%) and other EBV‐driven neoplasms. However, it is unclear if these deletions are specific for Asian EBV strains, whether they are present in viral genomes in different sites and how they evolve overtime.

In the present study, we sequenced EBV from serial blood samples obtained from three UK patients with CAEBV disease. The results were compared with sequences from saliva of patients with CAEBV and blood and tissue from other benign and malignant EBV‐related conditions.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1117VWXr]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Lymphopenia — workup and management for patients on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy include structured evaluation and targeted prophylaxis. Workup should include history with special attention to nutritional status and exposures to lymphocyte depleting therapy, physical examination with special attention to spleen size, complete blood count with differential, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, chest X‑ray to evaluate for thymoma, and assessment for infections including bacterial, fungal, and viral causes (specifically CMV or HIV). Management states that no specific action is required for lymphopenia G1–G3 and ICPI therapy should be continued; for G4, continue ICPI therapy and initiate Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with CMV screening, perform HIV or hepatitis screening if not already done, and consider EBV testing if there is evidence of lymphadenopathy or hepatitis, fevers, and hemolysis concerning for lymphoproliferative disease.

### Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors for non-malignancy associated secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in children [^117DWVMd]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study analyzed clinical symptoms, treatment response and prognostic factors in pediatric patients with secondary HLH after excluding MA-HLH. Consistent with a previous report, hepatomegaly (73.9%) was more prevalent than splenomegaly (55.7%) in our patient population, although hepatomegaly was not part of the diagnostic criteria included in the HLH-04 clinical trial.

EBV infection is a common cause of HLH. Evidence suggests that the presence of VCA IgG and VCA IgM in the absence of EBNA IgG is indicative of an acute EBV infection and the presence of VCA IgG and EBNA IgG in the absence of VCA IgM shows a previous infection. In the present study, evaluation of EBV-specific antibodies (EBV VCA IgM, IgG and EBNA-1 IgG) and serous EB DNA virus load (> 10 5 /copies) was used to confirm an EBV diagnosis. In our pediatric population, patients with EBV-HLH showed a worse treatment response and progressive OS (33.3%) than patients with secondary HLH due to other causes, except immunodeficiency, and patients with HLH caused by EBV infection had a very poor prognosis. Consistent with this, a study in adult patients with HLH reported that EBV was associated with poor survival outcomes, and the overall response to treatment at 4 weeks was similar in patients with HLH caused by EBV, autoimmune disease, other infections, or unknown causes, but decreased in the EBV group at 8 weeks. Similarly, survival in pediatric patients with EBV-induced secondary HLH/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) associated with rheumatic and nonrheumatic conditions was 50%.

A 51-year-old female patient in the first chronic phase of CML received an allogeneic PBSCT from a matched unrelated donor. The transplant was manipulated by CD34+ cell selection. On day +193 after transplantation the patient was readmitted to the hospital with recurrent fever of unknown origin and cough. Clinical, radiographic and sonographic evaluation revealed no characteristic findings besides a mild splenomegaly. Screening for EBV, CMV, RSV and HSV did not indicate an active infection. On day +203 the patient developed generalized seizures, respiratory failure and died within 24 h in multiorgan failure. The macroscopic postmortem was still not enlightening; the histological examination however, demonstrated diffuse organ infiltration by monoclonal lymphoblastoid cells due to EBV-LPD.

### A heart breaking case of rapidly developing severe hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to chronic active EBV infection; a case report and review of the literature [^11772zk2]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, HHV-4) is a gamma Herpesvirus with a 90% > seroprevalence in adults. Reactivations in non-immuno compromised individuals usually cause mild or no symptoms at all. Rarely, host immunity-virus balance is interrupted, resulting in a chronic active EBV infection. The following case illustrates the rapid development of severe hemophagocytic syndrome during chronic active EBV infection in a 73 year old woman who presented with lower extremity pain and edema, splenomegaly and abnormal liver enzymes. A diagnosis of chronic active EBV infection was made following an extensive investigation and the patient died secondary to rapidly progressive hemophagocytic syndrome.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-Multiple States, 2015–2018 [^116Egf9R]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Refugees with splenomegaly on arrival were significantly more likely than matched controls to have a hematologic abnormality at some point during the follow-up, and the association was strengthened further when considering only case patients with persistent splenomegaly. Case patients appeared especially more likely to exhibit anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to splenic sequestration of blood cells and immune-mediated destruction of platelets through opsonization. Case patients were also significantly more likely to have elevated levels of ALP, which in this population, without associated other liver pathology described, likely represents a marker of poor nutritional status. These results, however, could be affected by the longer follow-up time and increased frequency of testing for case patients.

Although malaria-associated splenomegaly is a likely cause of splenomegaly in many of these patients, nearly 40% of patients without evidence of malaria infection had persistent splenomegaly). Future investigations should systematically collect detailed laboratory information to elucidate both infectious and noninfectious etiologies of splenomegaly in this population. Sickle cell anemia did not appear to contribute to splenomegaly in the group we assessed. Splenomegaly in this population may be multifactorial, and etiologies may have differed between patients. Evidence suggests that schistosomiasis may have contributed to persistent splenomegaly, as among patients with both available Schistosoma IgG ELISA and eosinophilia results, 60% tested positive for both; however, other etiologies for persistent eosinophilia exist and are common in this population, such as Strongyloides, filariasis (including Loa loa), and other parasitic infections (e.g. hookworm, trichuris, or tapeworm), which may not have responded completely to predeparture presumptive treatment. Only two refugees were tested for brucellosis, and none were tested for Epstein–Barr virus infection, which may both be associated with splenomegaly; future investigations should include testing for these two infections. In addition, further elucidation of the contribution and role of known chronic infections (e.g. viral hepatitis and schistosomiasis) and other hematologic and oncologic conditions, alone and in combination, should be further investigated. Of note, seroprevalence of anti-HCV IgG was unexpectedly high in case patients and controls, and although its contribution to splenomegaly is unknown, HCV seroprevalence was much higher than typically reported in other refugee populations. Although high seroprevalence of anti-HCV IgG has been reported in Congolese military members (13.7%), a population that would be expected to have higher risk, further investigation of HCV prevalence in Congolese refugees is encouraged.

### Mosunetuzumab (Lunsumio) [^112MoQVb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3	Infections

LUNSUMIO can cause serious or fatal infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Among patients who received LUNSUMIO at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, serious infections, including opportunistic infections, occurred in 17%, with Grade 3 or 4 infections in 14%, and fatal infections in 0.9% of patients. The most common Grade 3 or greater infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with LUNSUMIO and treat appropriately. LUNSUMIO should not be administered in the presence of active infection. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LUNSUMIO in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections (e.g., chronic, active Epstein-Barr Virus), with underlying conditions that may predispose to infections or who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to guidelines.

Withhold LUNSUMIO or consider permanent discontinuation of LUNSUMIO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.4	Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

LUNSUMIO can cause fatal or serious hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is a potentially life-threatening, hyperinflammatory syndrome that is independent of CRS. Common manifestations include fever, elevated ferritin, hemophagocytosis, cytopenias, coagulopathy, hepatitis, and splenomegaly.

Across a broader clinical trial population, HLH occurred in 0.5% (7/1536) of patients. Most cases (5/7) were identified within the first 28 days following initiation of LUNSUMIO, with 3 cases preceded by diagnosed or suspected CRS. Of the 7 cases of HLH, 6 had fatal outcomes, with 2 deaths from HLH alone and 4 deaths with concurrent unresolved HLH. Of the 7 cases of HLH, 4 occurred in the context of concurrent EBV and/or CMV infection.

Monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of HLH. Consider HLH when the presentation of CRS is atypical or prolonged, or when there are features of macrophage activation. For suspected HLH, interrupt LUNSUMIO and evaluate and treat promptly for HLH per current practice guidelines.

### Agranulocytosis occurrence following recent acute infectious mononucleosis [^1128JCxp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis secondary to Epstein-Barr virus typically follows a relatively benign and self-limited course. A small subset of individuals may develop further progression of disease including hematologic, neurologic, and cardiac abnormalities. A mild transient neutropenia occurring during the first weeks of acute infection is a common finding however in rare cases a more profound neutropenia and agranulocytosis may occur up to 6weeks following the onset of initial symptoms. We describe the case of an 18-year-old woman who presented 26days following an acute infectious mononucleosis diagnosis with agranulocytosis and fever. No source of infection was identified and the patient had rapid improvement in her symptoms and resolution of her neutropenia. The presence of fever recurrence and other non-specific symptoms in individuals 2–6weeks following acute infectious mononucleosis symptom onset may warrant further assessment for this uncommon event.

### A new animal model for primary and persistent Epstein-Barr virus infection: human EBV-infected rabbit characteristics determined using sequential imaging and pathological analysis [^117VQhSa]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Most adults have persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infection. Adolescents and young adults with primary EBV-infection frequently develop infectious mononucleosis. Latent EBV-infection is associated with various diseases, neoplasms, and hematological disorders. In vivo animal models of human EBV infection, such as non-human primates, have had limited success. A new rabbit model for primary human EBV-infection is described in this study. Seven male rabbits inoculated intravenously with EBV were sequentially imaged by ultrasonography and computed tomography, and examined for anti-EBV-VCA titer and EBV-DNA levels in blood. Six rabbits demonstrated transient splenomegaly, increased anti-EBV-VCA titers and/or EBV-DNA in blood. Transient infiltration of some EBER1-positive lymphocytes was observed in biopsied liver tissues. After splenomegaly, two rabbits tested continuously negative, two alternatively positive and negative, and one consistently positive EBV detection in blood for 470 days. One tested negative for both EBV DNA and splenomegaly. On the 14th day, mild to moderate numbers of EBER1-positive lymphocytes expressing LMP1, EBNA2, or ZEBRA infiltrated mainly in enlarged white pulps of two splenectomized materials. These cells included both B and T cells. EBV clonality analysis revealed an oligoclonal pattern. These indicate that EBV-inoculated rabbits exhibiting heterogenous host reactions are a good model for primary and persistent human EBV infection.

### Clinical similarities and differences of patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 1 (XLP-1 / SAP deficiency) versus type 2 (XLP-2 / XIAP deficiency) [^115RT1Wa]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

X-linked lymphoproliferative syndromes (XLP) are primary immunodeficiencies characterized by a particular vulnerability toward Epstein-Barr virus infection, frequently resulting in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). XLP type 1 (XLP-1) is caused by mutations in the gene SH2D1A (also named SAP), whereas mutations in the gene XIAP underlie XLP type 2 (XLP-2). Here, a comparison of the clinical phenotypes associated with XLP-1 and XLP-2 was performed in cohorts of 33 and 30 patients, respectively. HLH (XLP-1, 55%; XLP-2, 76%) and hypogammaglobulinemia (XLP-1, 67%; XLP-2, 33%) occurred in both groups. Epstein-Barr virus infection in XLP-1 and XLP-2 was the common trigger of HLH (XLP-1, 92%; XLP-2, 83%). Survival rates and mean ages at the first HLH episode did not differ for both groups, but HLH was more severe with lethal outcome in XLP-1 (XLP-1, 61%; XLP-2, 23%). Although only XLP-1 patients developed lymphomas (30%), XLP-2 patients (17%) had chronic hemorrhagic colitis as documented by histopathology. Recurrent splenomegaly often associated with cytopenia and fever was preferentially observed in XLP-2 (XLP-1, 7%; XLP-2, 87%) and probably represents minimal forms of HLH as documented by histopathology. This first phenotypic comparison of XLP subtypes should help to improve the diagnosis and the care of patients with XLP conditions.

### Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection in a teenage girl with suspect autoimmune hepatitis [^115f7Vp8]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), a double-stranded DNA virus also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a member of the human herpes virus family. Because HBV establishes a latent infection in B cells, patients remain infected for life. EBV infections in children and young adults can lead to infectious mononucleosis, with symptoms of fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, and liver dysfunction. EBV reactivates in some patients, who develop a disease that does not resolve and has a chronic course and infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms. Kimura et al. proposed several subtypes of EBV-T/NK-lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) in 2012 by analyzing 108 patients with hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoproliferative disorder, severe mosquito bite allergy, EBV-hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), or chronic active EBV disease (CAEBV). The last was also associated with systemic inflammation. The diagnosis of CAEBV is hampered by its rarity. Management is challenging because of delayed diagnosis and the lack of treatment guidelines. We present a rare case of a teenage girl with CAEBV that initially mimicked autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

### Alexander the great and west nile virus encephalitis [^113hA4K2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Marr and Calisher suggest the cause of Alexander the Great's death in Babylon in 323 B.C. was West Nile encephalitis. They were intrigued by the fact that as Alexander entered Babylon, ravens fell dead from the sky. The authors postulated the ravens might have had West Nile encephalitis, and because of the endemicity of mosquitoes in ancient Babylon, Alexander could have died of West Nile encephalitis. The authors are to be complimented on coming up with a novel explanation for his death, but this explanation has several problems.

Determining the exact cause of Alexander's death is impossible. Classical scholars are hampered by difficulties with translations from ancient Greek texts as well as differences in terms used by Plutarch in his description of Alexander's demise. We are left with a description that is incomplete, but nevertheless contains cardinal features of his terminal illness. In infectious disease practice, a syndromic diagnosis is the basis of the clinical approach. Astute infectious disease clinicians must discern between consistent and characteristic features in syndromic diagnosis. In addition to characteristic clinical features, syndromic diagnosis also depends on time relationships of clinical features. That splenomegaly is a feature of Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis is important, but equally as important is the late rather than early appearance of splenomegaly in the illness. A laundry list of features associated with various infectious diseases tells only part of the story and is diagnostically unhelpful unless placed in the proper time sequence.

### A rare presentation of Epstein-Barr virus infection [^111fzP2H]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus spread by intimate contact. It is known to cause infectious mononucleosis. Complications, including hematologic pathology and splenic rupture, are uncommon. This report is a case of EBV-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia and biliary stasis.

Case Report

An 18-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. He did not have risk factors for liver injury or hepatitis. His vital signs were notable for a fever. On examination, he was obviously jaundiced, but not in distress. Laboratory evaluation showed hemolytic anemia and biliary stasis. Ultimately, his inpatient workup yielded positive EBV serology and a positive direct agglutinin test with cold agglutinins. He made a full recovery with supportive care. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? EBV is a widely disseminated herpesvirus. Infectious mononucleosis is a common presentation of acute infection, and treatment of EBV-related diseases are largely supportive. Complications, such as splenic rupture and hematologic pathology, are uncommon. Biliary stasis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the form of cold agglutinin disease secondary to EBV is rare, and typically resolves with supportive care and cold avoidance. More advanced treatment methods are available in the setting of severe hemolysis. Elevated transaminases, direct hyperbilirubinemia, or evidence of hemolytic anemia in the setting of a nonspecific viral syndrome should raise suspicion for EBV infection. Rapid recognition can lead to more prompt prevention and treatment of other EBV-related complications.

### Splenic rupture in infectious mononucleosis: a systematic review of published case reports [^1122Ejff]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a common viral illness that predominantly causes sore throat, fever and cervical lymphadenopathy in adolescents and young adults. Although usually a benign, self-limiting disease, it is associated with a small risk of splenic rupture, which can be life-threatening. It is common practice therefore to advise avoiding vigorous physical activity for at least 4–6 weeks, however this is not based on controlled trials or national guidelines. We reviewed published case reports of splenic rupture occurring in the context of IM in an attempt to ascertain common factors that may predict who is at risk.

Method

A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed for case reports or series published between 1984 and 2014. In total, 52 articles or abstracts reported 85 cases. Data was extracted and compiled into a Microsoft Excel(®) spreadsheet.

Results

The average patient age was 22 years, the majority (70%) being male. The average time between onset of IM symptoms and splenic rupture was 14 days, with a range up to 8 weeks. There was a preceding history of trauma reported in only 14%. Abdominal pain was the commonest presenting complaint of splenic rupture, being present in 88%. 32% were successfully managed non-operatively, whereas 67% underwent splenectomy. Overall mortality was 9%.

Conclusions and Recommendations

From our data, it appears that men under 30 within 4 weeks of symptom onset are at highest risk of splenic rupture, therefore particular vigilance in this group is required. As cases have occurred up to 8 weeks after the onset of illness, we would recommend avoidance of sports, heavy lifting and vigorous activity for 8 weeks. Should the patient wish to return to high risk activities prior to this, an USS should be performed to ensure resolution of splenomegaly. The majority of cases reviewed had no preceding trauma, although previous studies have suggested this may be so minor as to go unnoticed by the patient. It is therefore prudent to warn patients about the symptoms of splenic rupture to ensure prompt presentation and minimise treatment delay rather than focusing purely on activity limitation.

### The diagnostic value of peripheral blood lymphocyte testing in children with infectious mononucleosis [^112dXQs2]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a contagious disease primarily associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, commonly occurring in asymptomatic young children at age of 2–5 years old. The primary clinical manifestations of IM encompass enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and pharyngitis. It can lead to tonsillar enlargement, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, along with an elevated lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood of patients. Although acute symptoms of IM are often self-limiting, serious complications such as airway obstruction and splenic rupture may occur if not treated promptly. Early and accurate diagnosis of IM is in great need to reduce the incidence of severe cases.

The peripheral blood routine test has been widely used to diagnose IM in children. The clinical positive diagnosis includes lymphocyte number in peripheral blood more than 50% of the total white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte count > 5 × 10 9 /L, or atypical lymphocytes over10%. The serum EBV test is another common diagnostic tool including Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgM, VCA-IgG, early antigen (EA)-IgG and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA)-IgG test and quantitative PCR-based detection of EBV-DNA load. Because of the immature immunity of children and the presence of maternal antibodies in infants, false negative and false positive results are prone to occur, leading to inaccurate results. Therefore, more reliable tests will be required to confirm IM with the accurate clinical signs and symptoms.

Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets fluctuate in response to EBV in the development of IM. EBV primarily targets B cells leading to their necrosis or apoptosis. CD8 + T cells are activated to eliminate virus-infected cells, resulting in a decrease of the CD4+/CD8 + ratio. Both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells play a pivotal role in preventing the reactivation of the virus from latency although the mechanism remains unclear.

At the present, diagnosing IM requires a combination of clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnostic criteria. A great percentage of children with IM initially present with nonspecific symptoms, which can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of lymphocyte subset classification by comparing the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets between IM children and healthy ones, in order to develop an accurate method for early diagnosis of IM.

### Overwhelming primary Epstein-Barr virus infection requiring corticosteroid treatment [^111ug2nc]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 20-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of fever and malaise. Physical examination was unremarkable. Viral infection was suspected and Epstein-Barr virus serology confirmed acute infectious mononucleosis. During admission, she gradually developed pancytopenia and liver enzyme abnormalities. The patient clinically deteriorated with persisting fever, orthostatic hypotension and hepatosplenomegaly. Bone marrow examination showed haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was started and patient recovered quickly. Ferritin decreased immediately, fever resolved within 3 days, viral clearance was reached within 3 weeks. Steroid therapy was gradually tapered off in three months. The Histiocyte Society recommends immunochemotherapy with steroids, etoposide and cyclosporine. Potential side effects of etoposide are severe bone marrow depression and leukaemia. Our patient survived on corticosteroids alone. Early recognition of HLH and prompt treatment are of utmost importance for survival. Treatment with steroids alone can be life-saving.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^1159xfv9]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis splenic rupture risk is low but clinically important; splenomegaly in IM is nearly universal, but splenic rupture is rare, and the true incidence is cited to occur in 0.1% to 0.2% in most reviews; the spleen appears most vulnerable in the first 3–4 weeks of illness, and in a review of 55 cases almost all occurred in the first 3 weeks with half not traumatic, with rupture occurring spontaneously or from trauma related to altered splenic architecture.

### Severe Epstein-Barr virus infection in primary immunodeficiency and the normal host [^116vVKbN]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is ubiquitous in humans, but the majority of infections have an asymptomatic or self-limiting clinical course. Rarely, individuals may develop a pathological EBV infection with a variety of life threatening complications (including haemophagocytosis and malignancy) and others develop asymptomatic chronic EBV viraemia. Although an impaired ability to control EBV infection has long been recognised as a hallmark of severe T-cell immunodeficiency, the advent of next generation sequencing has identified a series of Primary Immunodeficiencies in which EBV-related pathology is the dominant feature. Chronic active EBV infection is defined as chronic EBV viraemia associated with systemic lymphoproliferative disease, in the absence of immunodeficiency. Descriptions of larger cohorts of patients with chronic active EBV in recent years have significantly advanced our understanding of this clinical syndrome. In this review we summarise the current understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of these diseases and clinical syndromes, and discuss approaches to the investigation and treatment of severe or atypical EBV infection.

### NF-κ B1 haploinsufficiency causing immunodeficiency and EBV-driven lymphoproliferation [^113WnB2G]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

a Post four cycles of rituximab

In the following years, the patient had three to four uncomplicated infections per year (sinusitis, pharyngitis, urinary tract infection). She complained of intermittent arthralgia; autoantibodies were repeatedly negative (rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)). At the age of 18 years, splenomegaly (21 cm) with multiple hypodense changes, hepatomegaly (20 cm), and generalized lymphadenopathy occurred (not shown). Blood results showed reactivation of Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) with 1.2 × 10E3 copies/ml. Within a short time, the patient deteriorated with high fever, elevated CRP (50 mg/l), and increasing hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy (liver 22 cm, spleen 26 cm; Fig. 1d). Further investigations were not suspicious for macrophage-activating syndrome. With rising EBV load (maximum 3.1 × 10E3 copies/ml), EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD) was suspected. The patient was started on corticosteroid treatment (1 mg/kg) and weekly rituximab (375 mg/m 2) was administered four times. Prompt clinical improvement was noted, EBV load turned negative, and CD19 + B cells were not detectable for 8 months (Fig. 2a). However with reemergence of peripheral blood B cells, a similar clinical picture with fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatoslenomegaly reoccured and reactivation of EBV (maximal load 1.2 × 10E2 copies/ml) was detected. The patient was started on cortisone and four courses rituximab, which has led to remission of the disease again. In view of the relatively severe disease course, HLA typing of the patient and family has been initiated to prepare for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. On inquiry of the patient's family, the patient's father declared he had been suffering from frequent non-severe respiratory tract infections but not requiring regular medical attention.

### A case of periodic fever and persistent splenomegaly in a 2-year-old boy [^112uRgH1]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

We report an unusual case of periodic fever associated with persistent splenomegaly in a 2-year-old boy. Febrile episodes occurred at regular 2 weekly intervals and each lasted for 1–2 days. Following resolution of the fever on each occasion, the patient developed neck stiffness of 1–2 days duration. The periodic febrile episodes, as well as the splenomegaly, spontaneously resolved 9 months after the onset of disease. Infectious and malignant causes were ruled out as far as possible. This patient's clinical features are unusual and do not match any known category of periodic fevers in childhood. We believe this case highlights the diagnostic challenges periodic fevers commonly represent.

### Pathogenesis of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection: is this an infectious disease, lymphoproliferative disorder, or immunodeficiency? [^114rnkcX]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is characterised by chronic or recurrent infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms, such as fever, hepatosplenomegaly, persistent hepatitis and extensive lymphadenopathy. Patients with CAEBV have high viral loads in their peripheral blood and/or an unusual pattern of EBV-related antibodies. This disease is rare but severe with high morbidity and mortality. Nearly three decades have passed since this disease was first identified, and recent advances in technology have increased our understanding of CAEBV pathophysiology. There is accumulating evidence that the clonal expansion of EBV-infected T or natural killer (NK) cells plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CAEBV. However, it remains unclear whether CAEBV is truly a monoclonal lymphoproliferative disorder. EBV-infected T or NK cells are able to evade the host cellular immune system due to the limited expression of viral proteins of reduced antigenicity. Recent studies suggest that infection of T or NK cells is a common event during primary EBV infection. A defect or single nucleotide polymorphism in host immune-modulating genes may allow for the expansion of virus infected cells giving rise to CAEBV. In this review, I summarise our current understanding of the pathogenesis of CAEBV and propose a model of CAEBV pathogenicity.

### Fatal liver failure: molecular evidence for chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection [^113CkEL9]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a benign disease, which may occasionally be fatal, particularly in children and immunocompromised patients. Epstein-Barr virus infection is rare in elderly subjects and seems to have a self-limited course. A case of fatal liver failure due to chronic active EBV infection in a 75-year-old man is described. The etiology was established postmortem by cellular expression of EBV-DNA in liver and lymphatic tissue. This patient meets the diagnostic criteria of a case definition for a highly probable "severe chronic active EBV syndrome". Either suspected or unsuspected, the long-term prognosis of this syndrome is poor and its mortality high.

### Real-time polymerase chain reaction for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis in pediatric patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115K2txq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the diagnostic role of Epstein-Barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid detection and quantitation in the serum of pediatric and young adult patients with infectious mononucleosis. The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was the sensitivity and specificity of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection and quantitation using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching for articles that were published through September 24, 2014 in the following databases: Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The following keywords were used for the search: "Epstein-Barr virus", "infectious mononucleosis", "children/young adults/infant/pediatric", and "polymerase chain reaction or PCR". Three were included in this analysis. We found that for detection by PCR, the pooled sensitivity for detecting EBV DNA was 77% (95%CI, 66–86%) and the pooled specificity for was 98% (95%CI, 93–100%). Our findings indicate that this PCR-based assay has high specificity and good sensitivity for detecting of EBV DNA, indicating it may useful for identifying patients with infectious mononucleosis. This assay may also be helpful to identify young athletic patients or highly physically active pediatric patients who are at risk for a splenic rupture due to acute infectious mononucleosis.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^113aDEWh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Treatment of EBV driven lymphoproliferation with erythrophagocytosis: 12 year follow up [^116PHsZP]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

This is a report of a case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated haemophagocytic syndrome in a 17 year old woman with antibody deficiency. For two years before this presentation, serology showed abnormally high titres to EBV early antigen, suggestive of persistent infection with EBV. She became acutely unwell with clinical features consistent with virus associated haemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS). Histology showed lymphoproliferation with erythrophagocytosis and evidence of EBV encoded RNAs in liver, spleen, and lymph node. VAHS is often fatal, particularly when it occurs in patients with underlying immunodeficiencies. In this case, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, aciclovir, and alpha interferon was followed by a dramatic recovery. Twelve years later the patient remains relatively well on regular intravenous immunoglobulin.

### An update on XMEN disease [^116YZZK3]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation

XMEN disease is a CID characterized by increased susceptibility to chronic EBV infection and EBV-associated lymphoproliferation, sinopulmonary and ear infections, lymphadenopathy (LAD), dysgammaglobulinemia, and autoimmune cytopenias. XMEN may have a more indolent course than other combined immunodeficiencies (CID) with some patients not receiving a diagnosis until adulthood. EBV is a widely disseminated oncogenic B cell-tropic γ−herpesvirus that infects some children and the majority of adults worldwide. The identification of EBV-naïve patients revealed that the immune phenotype of EBV-naïve and EBV-infected patients is very similar. Invariably, all patients have decreased NKG2D expression on both natural killer (NK) and CD8 + T cells, making it the best biomarker and a hallmark of the disease. Most patients have decreased serum IgG and IgA with impaired response to polysaccharide antigens, and frequent ear and sinopulmonary infections, sometimes associated with bronchiectasis. Similar to Magt1 -knockout mice, XMEN patients often have elevated B cells with a significant expansion of the naïve subset. Low CD4/CD8 ratio and elevated CD4 − CD8 − TCRαβ + T (αβDNT) cells are commonly observed, while recent thymic emigrants, NK and natural killer T (NKT) cell counts are usually normal. Almost half of the patients have CD4 T cell lymphopenia, but life-threatening opportunistic infections are rare in the absence of concomitant immunosuppressive treatment. An infant with severe pneumonia had Pneumocystis jirovecii and cytomegalovirus in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was reported in one XMEN patient during chemotherapy for an underlying lymphoma. Severe molluscum contagiosum occurs in about one-third of the patients, while skin warts are less frequently observed. Condyloma accuminatum requiring surgical excision was reported in one young adult. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections have also been reported. Mild, sometimes transient, thrombocytopenia is a common hematological abnormality, even in patients with no splenomegaly and no history of autoimmune (AI) cytopenias. Transient neutropenia with or without associated mouth sores is present in more than half of the patients. A leukemoid reaction was reported in an EBV-naïve infant with no clonal lymphoproliferative disorder. A significant hemorrhagic risk, usually disproportionate for the degree of thrombocytopenia and involving mucosal sites, has been identified in some patients. This bleeding risk appears to be a relatively common and severe complication after allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in XMEN, for which a precise mechanism has not been identified. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and/or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occur in about one third of the patients and have been the presenting symptom in some EBV-naïve patients. Lymphocytes from XMEN patients have decreased calcium flux and phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLCγ1) activation, and impaired re-stimulation induced cell death upon TCR crosslinking, likely due to impaired signaling through the hypoglycosylated TCR and CD28. Interestingly, Magt1 -knockout mice show no defects in their T cell activation, but have hyper-activation of their B cells. Unlike humans, mice express TUSC3 in their immune cells, which may account for some of these differences. Both CD8 + T cells and NK cells of XMEN patients have impaired EBV-specific cytotoxic function in vitro, consistent with the persistent EBV viremia in most patients and decreased glycosylation of NKG2D and CD70 (Figure 2).

virus

Epstein‐Barr virus, in common with most herpesviridae, can cause mild, self‐limiting illness or asymptomatic infection. The most common symptomatic presentation is with infectious mononucleosis, characterised by fever, lassitude, lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis, with a concurrent peripheral blood lymphocytosis. Cytomegalovirus may also cause an illness to be hard to distinguish from EBV infection clinically. Primary EBV infection can be associated with splenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests and occasional splenic rupture. Epstein‐Barr virus, in common with a number of other viruses, can trigger haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH, see below). Epstein‐Barr virus is associated with a range of malignancies, notably Burkitt's lymphoma and post‐transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

### Clinical characteristics of primary and reactivated Epstein-Barr virus infection in children [^117Dk8m9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection occurs commonly in children and presents as a primary or reactivated infection, which are difficult for clinicians to distinguish. This study investigated the clinical characteristics of the two types of infections. Children with detectable plasma EBV-DNA were retrospectively enrolled and divided into primary and reactivated infection group by EBV-specific antibody. We analyzed the patients' characteristics, clinical manifestations, complications, inflammatory biomarkers, and viral load. A total of 9.3% of children with reactivation were immunocompromised over the long-term. The primary infection mostly appeared as infectious mononucleosis (99.8%), while reactivation occurred as an infectious mononucleosis-like disease (65.0%), hemophagocytic syndrome (22.6%), chronic active EBV infection (5.3%) and lymphoma (3.5%). The incidence of fevers, cervical lymphoditis, periorbital edema, pharyngotonsillitis, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in primary infection were 93.3%, 93.0%, 51.5%, 66.0%, 76.2% and 63.9%, respectively; the incidence of those symptoms in reactivation was 84.0%, 46.9%, 15.4%, 18.5%, 18.5%, and 43.3%, respectively. The incidence of digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, hematological, genitourinary complications and multiple serous effusion in primary infection was 68.8%, 18.1%, 8.0%, 0.8%, 2.9%, 0.0% and 2.3%; whereas the incidence of these complications in reactivation was 56.2%, 22.5%, 14.1%, 8.0%, 38.9%, 0.3% and 19.0%. Patients with reactivation were more prone to multi-systemic damage. B-cells were lower, and CD8+ T-cells were higher in primary infection. Viral load was correlated with the level of different cytokines in primary and reactivated infection. EBV primary infection often presents as infectious mononucleosis. The reactivated infection affects more immunocompromised subjects with diverse and complex manifestations. Various complications are more commonly associated with reactivation as a result of different inflammatory responses to different types of infection.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a DNA virus from the herpes virus group affecting only humans. More than 90% adults are infected by the virus, but very few ever have symptoms. Within the abdomen, both solid and hollow viscera can be involved in symptomatic disease. Awareness of the spectrum of imaging findings, high index of suspicion, and appropriate clinical and laboratory information can help in the early and accurate diagnosis in these cases.

### Poor outcomes of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in non-Japanese adult patients [^116rpsz3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection manifests as a combination of persistent infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms and high viral load in apparently immunocompetent patients. It is closely related to Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. These 2 abnormal Epstein-Barr virus-associated diseases are seldom reported in individuals other than Japanese children and adolescents. We report a series of 2 adult non-Japanese patients with fatal chronic active Epstein-Barr virus and 1 adult non-Japanese patient with Epstein-Barr virus hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and discuss its pathogenesis and treatment options.

Benign disorders

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) lymphadenitis

IM lymphadenitis is an acute, self-limited lymphadenitis caused by EBV infection. In the United States, most young adults are exposed to EBV, and about half of them acquire IM. Patients generally have fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Complications are rare, but splenic rupture, upper airway obstruction, severe hematologic cytopenia or hepatitis can occur. Although complications happen, these symptoms can be resolved without sequelae. Results for the agglutination-based monospot test using horse erythrocytes are positive. EBV-specific antibodies such as IgM and IgG anti-viral capsid antigen antibodies or anti-EA antibodies appear, and circulating lymphocytes with abundant pale blue cytoplasm and large nucleus are increased. The lymph node architecture is partially effaced by paracortical hyperplasia, follicular hyperplasia or sinus histiocytosis. Paracortical expansion is the most common pattern, usually composed of a mixture of small lymphocytes, immunoblasts, plasma cells and histiocytes. Immunoblasts can form a sheet, mimicking diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Figure 2). By immunohistochemistry, CD20 highlights B-cell-rich follicles and B-immunoblasts in the paracortex. CD3 shows T-cells, mature lymphocytes and T-immunoblasts in the paracortex. In situ hybridization for EBER shows numerous EBV-infected cells. Ig genes and/or T-cell receptor genes show a polyclonal pattern.

### A case of infectious mononucleosis complicated with spontaneous atraumatic splenic rapture caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection [^114bQZHY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Splenic rupture is the most serious complication of infectious mononucleosis (IM) caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, with a mortality rate of over 1 in 10. We reported a case of spontaneous atraumatic splenic rupture secondary to IM in a young man. The patient presented with abdominal pain caused by splenic rupture as the initial symptom. The diagnosis and treatment process went through a series of twists and turns, including the emergency department, general surgery department, and infection department. This case suggests that clinicians should consider the possibility of EBV infection in young patients with spleen rupture without obvious cause to avoid misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.

### Splenomegaly: diagnosis and management in adults [^116Wcq85]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Splenomegaly can be due to several mechanisms but is almost always a sign of a systemic condition. Patient habits, travel, and medical conditions can increase risk of splenomegaly and suggest etiology. Symptoms can suggest infectious, malignant, hepatic, or hematologic causes. Physical examination will typically reveal splenomegaly, but abdominal ultrasonography is recommended for confirmation. Physical examination should also assess for signs of systemic illness, liver disease, and anemia or other hematologic issues. The most common causes of splenomegaly in the United States are liver disease, malignancy, and infection. Except for apparent causes such as infectious mononucleosis, basic laboratory analysis and ultrasonography are the first-line steps in determining etiology. Malaria and schistosomiasis are common in tropical regions, where as many as 80% of people may have splenomegaly. Management of splenomegaly involves treating the underlying disease process. Splenectomies and spleen reduction therapies are sometimes performed. Any patient with limited splenic function requires increased vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics for procedures involving the respiratory tract. Acute infections, anemia, and splenic rupture are the most common complications of splenomegaly, and people with splenomegaly should refrain from participating in contact sports to decrease risk of rupture.

Systemic EBV-positive T-cell LPD of childhood

Most patients present with symptoms of a systemic hyper-inflammatory response with disease mimicking the presentation of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Acute onset of fever and malaise often precedes the eventual development of hepatosplenomegaly and liver failure, with or without lymphadenopathy. This disease has rapid progression to multi-organ failure, hemophagocytic syndrome and death. Chronic active EBV infection has been documented in some patients before developing EBV + T-cell LPD, but most cases are fulminant and arise with acute primary EBV infection. Fulminant cases are CD8 +, whereas chronic active EBV-associated cases are CD4 +. EBV-encoded RNA-1 is positive in neoplastic T cells that exhibit clonal TCR gene rearrangement and harbor EBV in a clonal episomal form. This severe illness is characterized by clonal proliferation of EBV-infected T cells with an activated cytotoxic phenotype. All cases are type A EBV, with either the wild type or a specific 30 base pair-deletion of the viral LMP1 gene. Frequent sites of involvement include liver, spleen, nodes, and marrow. The typical immunophenotype of tumor cells is CD2 + CD3 + CD56 −. Transient chemotherapy responses are reported, but almost all cases have rapid disease progression ending in death.

Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma

Hydroa vacciniforme-like T-cell lymphoma is an EBV + cutaneous malignancy occurring mostly in children. Linked to sun sensitivity, this condition primarily affects sun-exposed skin, and the face in particular. Papulovesicular eruptions precede ulceration and scarring. The clinical course is variable and skin lesions may be recurrent. Late in the disease, systemic symptoms develop such as fever, wasting, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Similar to EBV + T-cell LPD, neoplastic cells have clonal TCR rearrangements and harbor EBV in a clonal episomal form. It is not clear whether the severe mosquito-bite allergy seen in chronic active EBV infection, which has similar cutaneous lesions of NK-cell derivation, is related to the hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma or a distinct entity in the spectrum of EBV-associated disorders. Both diseases are considered part of the spectrum of severe chronic active EBV, demonstrating a broad variation in clinical aggressiveness. Allo-SCT provides the only curative option for patients, but it remains to be seen whether novel EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immunotherapies have a role in this unique disorder.

Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, B-cell type

CAEBV disease is an uncommon EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder affecting B-cells, T-cells or NK cells. It is currently defined as a severe progressive illness of > 6 months that begins as a primary EBV infection or is associated with heavily elevated anti-EBV viral capsid antigen IgG ⩾1:5120 or anti-EBV early antigen IgG ⩾1:640 or markedly elevated EBV DNA in the peripheral blood with histological evidence (lymphocytic infiltration) of major organ involvement and increased EBER or proteins in the affected tissues in patients without an immunosuppressive condition. It was first described by Straus as 'the chronic mononucleosis syndrome' to differentiate this disease from chronic fatigue syndrome. The major organ involvement denotes lymphadenitis, persistent hepatitis, splenomegaly, interstitial pneumonia, hypoplasia of the bone marrow or uveitis. The etiology of CAEBV is uncertain.EBV stimulates secretion of a variety of cytokines and chemokines in both EBV-infected cells and non-infected cells. The current recommendation is to specify the nature of the EBV-infected cells as being B-cells, T-cells or NK cells. In this review, we focus only on CAEBV, B-cell type. For T-cell or NK cell types, please consult the article by Kimura et al.

Introduction: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in young children is usually a self-limiting condition, but in adolescents, it can cause clinical symptoms typical of infectious mononucleosis (IM) with fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and fatigue. Nodular changes in the lungs are rare and raise suspicion of other conditions, including autoimmune diseases.

Objectives: We present a case of a patient with EBV infection and nodular changes in the lungs, the differential diagnosis, and the outcome.

Methods: A 13-year-old boy was admitted to the Clinical Hospital Center Sestre Milosrdnice, Department of Pediatrics with a cough, sore throat, and fatigue without fever. Anemia, lymphocytosis with reactive lymphocytes, slightly elevated inflammatory parameters, and elevated liver enzymes were observed. Clinical findings included a hyperemic pharynx, tonsils covered with fibrin, normal auscultation, and palpatory mild spleen enlargement. A chest radiogram showed two lung nodules in the right lung, and azithromycin was introduced. Despite antimicrobial therapy, repeated laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory parameters, transaminases, and lymphocytosis. Due to persistent changes in the lungs, a CT scan of the chest was performed, which showed 5 nodular lesions in addition to mild splenomegaly.

Results: Differential diagnoses of our patient with nonspecific symptoms and nodular changes in the lungs included various infections and other conditions like neoplasms and autoimmune diseases. Malignant disease was ruled out by a hematological workup. Due to the positive finding of extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) patient was screened for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, SLE and Sjögren syndrome and all results came up negative. In the meantime. An acute EBV infection was confirmed by a serological test, and in consultation with an infectious disease specialist, symptomatic treatment and regular follow-up by a hemato-oncologist and a rheumatologist were agreed. CT performed after 6 months showed complete regression of the changes with normal laboratory findings including immunological panel and clinical status.

Conclusion: Multiple pulmonary lung lesions as part of EBV infection in immunocompetent patients are extremely rare. The probable pathophysiological mechanism is an immune-mediated reaction, the therapeutic approach is conservative, but monitoring is necessary due to the documented link between EBV infection and autoimmune disease development, SLE being one of them.

### Acute Epstein-Barr virus infection in two elderly individuals [^113yVqcy]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Most individuals acquire Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in young age. Because of uncommon presentation and misdiagnosis, clinical manifestations are less well described in older age. We present two cases of elderly patients with predominant symptoms attributed to cold agglutinin haemolytic anaemia due to acute EBV infection without fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis or splenomegaly. We conclude that misleading clinical manifestations are frequent in older individuals and may lead to inappropriate diagnostic invasive procedures.

Chronic Epstein–Barr virus infection of T and NK cells

EBV is primarily B lymphotropic, but in the context of immune suppression or genetic susceptibility, infection of T and NK cells may occur. One such condition is CAEBV. When primary EBV infection symptoms do not spontaneously resolve in otherwise immunocompetent individuals, with infection of T and NK cells, recurrent or chronic bouts of IM-like illness result in abnormal patterns of EBV antibodies. CAEBV patients have very high blood EBV loads. CAEBV is more prevalent in south Asia, and particularly Japan, suggesting a particular host genetic background common in this region may also be a risk factor for CAEBV development. Mutations in the PRF1 gene were found in one patient who died following the onset of CAEBV, and this disorder is increasingly treated by HCST.

PRF1 mutations are also a feature of HLH, a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting between 0.12 per 100,000 children in Sweden and 0.342 per 100,000 children in Japan. Macrophages and CTL are hyperactivated in HLH, leading to an inflammatory response extreme enough to cause multiple organ failure. Primary HLH is typically diagnosed in early childhood but can develop later in life as secondary HLH, which may be triggered by infection. EBV is the most common viral trigger of primary and secondary HLH, infecting T and NK cells leading to clonal lymphoproliferation. Genetic studies are blurring the distinctions between primary and secondary HLH, as a number of previously healthy adults (some aged over 50) initially diagnosed with secondary HLH have been found to carry mutations in the same genes that cause primary HLH in infants.

Figure 1
An illustrative model of the life cycle of the Epstein‐Barr Virus. The virus infects and undergoes lytic replication in the oral epithelium and resident B‐cells. B lymphocytes serve as the primary reservoir of the virus, with various stages of B‐cell maturation corresponding to different latency programs. The virus can reactivate and re‐enter lytic phase in plasma cells, thus releasing progeny virions which can be excreted in the saliva. This figure was created on Adobe Illustrator with icons sourced from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health Bioart Source.

Despite a high prevalence, most EBV infections remain asymptomatic or cause mild illness. In adolescents and young adults, primary infection is usually asymptomatic or sub‐clinical, or presents as IM, an inflammatory condition characterized by lymphadenopathy, sore throat, fatigue, and lymphocytosis. The incubation period typically spans several weeks, during which the host mounts a dynamic and evolving immune response with a gradual switch from "early antibodies" against IE and other lytic proteins to "late antibodies" against latency‐related proteins, reflecting the transition from a primary to a chronic phase of infection. Notably, during acute infection, the host develops IgM and IgG antibodies against viral capsid antigens (VCA), peaking within 6 weeks. In contrast, antibodies against Epstein‐Barr nuclear antigens (EBNAs), which mark the shift to viral latency and persistent infection, emerge later. We further discuss the immune response against EBV infections in a later section.

### Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus-associated secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in pregnancy: a case report [^115XNF41]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding lymphoma, it is important to be conscious of its transmission. Two cases of fetal transmission of maternally-derived lymphoma have been previously reported, with the infants presenting with symptoms similar to sHLH, including fever, tachycardia, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, within the first year of life. As the direct invasion of activated T cells to the placenta was not observed in the present case, we believe that no transmission to the fetus occurred. Hence, the close monitoring of newborn babies born to mothers with hematological malignancies is vital, particularly within the first year of life.

The etiology of lymphoma-related sHLH is another factor that should be considered. In the current case, sHLH symptoms appeared as a consequence of EBV reactivation that occurred during pregnancy. Haeri et al. who investigated the prevalence of EBV seropositivity in 64 healthy pregnant women, demonstrated that 22 (35%) women showed EBV reactivation during pregnancy, regardless of maternal age, race, parity, or insurance type. Moreover, previous reports have clarified that EBV reactivation during pregnancy lead to poor obstetrical outcomes, such as fetal growth restriction, shorter pregnancy duration, and lower birth weight, despite not showing any symptoms. Thus, we recommend transabdominal ultrasound and/or nonstress tests to determine the presence of these complications.

As mentioned above, sHLH can occur even during pregnancy; thus, obstetricians could contribute to the early diagnosis of sHLH, provided that they have knowledge regarding its clinical features. Iron-deficiency anemia or gestational thrombocytopenia may progress with gestational age, the laboratory findings of which sometimes present simultaneously with bicytopenia, thereby satisfying the diagnostic criteria of sHLH. Moreover, a progressive increase in serum triglyceride levels, one of the criteria of sHLH, has been observed during pregnancy. However, it might be confusing to discriminate between normal pregnancy status and sHLH only by these laboratory findings. Although some similarities exist between sHLH and pregnancy-related findings, the typical laboratory findings of sHLH, including neutropenia, low fibrinogen levels, and hyperferritinemia, are uncommon during pregnancy. Thus, in critically ill pregnant women with unremitting fever and bi- or pancytopenia (particularly neutropenia), sHLH should be considered. It is necessary to rapidly assess for splenomegaly and ferritin, fibrinogen, and soluble IL-2 receptor levels as well as determine whether the clinical features and laboratory findings satisfy the sHLH criteria and HScore.
