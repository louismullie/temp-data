## Question

Topical products for dry newborn acne

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about topical products for "dry newborn acne". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "newborn acne" means clinically and how it differs from other neonatal eruptions. Then, I should verify the evidence base for topical treatments in neonates, including safety, tolerability, and any age-specific labeling. Next, I will consider practical, low-irritancy options and what to avoid. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and follow-up advice, making sure I flag any uncertainties and correct myself if I overstate the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. "Newborn acne" typically refers to neonatal acne (neonatal cephalic pustulosis), a benign, self-limited eruption in the first weeks of life, often attributed to maternal androgens and C. acnes colonization; it is distinct from infantile acne, which is less common and may warrant different management, so I need to ensure we are not conflating the two [^3d34e268] [^570d4dcf].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for topical therapy in neonates. Most high-quality acne guidelines and trials exclude neonates, and pediatric acne guidance focuses on older infants and children; thus, there is a lack of direct RCT evidence for topical drugs in neonatal acne, and any recommendation here must be extrapolated cautiously and anchored in safety considerations and expert consensus for pediatric skin care rather than acne-specific pharmacotherapy [^d74e2f75] [^570d4dcf] [^384b8991].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using standard acne topicals. I initially thought benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids might be reasonable because they are first-line in older pediatric acne, but I should double-check labeling and safety in neonates. FDA labeling for adapalene, tretinoin, and tazarotene establishes safety and effectiveness only down to age 12 or older, with some fixed combinations down to 9, and there are no neonatal data; similarly, benzoyl peroxide labeling does not establish safety under 12, and neonatal skin is uniquely thin and permeable, so systemic absorption and irritation risks are higher in newborns [^0e30591a] [^b3d82c5e] [^6a59a18a] [^2f6d41ee].

> I need to ensure I consider the "dry" aspect. Neonatal skin has a higher pH and immature barrier, making it prone to dryness and irritation; emollients are often helpful for barrier support, but wait, I should verify whether emollients are advised on acne-prone neonatal skin. A European infant skin-care roundtable advises avoiding application of emollients directly to neonatal or infantile acne lesions to prevent follicular occlusion and worsening, so moisturizers should be used selectively and not on active acne areas in this age group [^91a8962e].

> Let me think about practical, low-risk measures. Given the self-limited nature of neonatal acne and the absence of neonatal-specific topical drug data, conservative care is appropriate: gentle cleansing with water or a mild, pH-balanced cleanser and observation are reasonable; if lesions are inflamed or persistent, a pediatrician may consider a short, closely supervised trial of a low-concentration topical antibiotic such as erythromycin 2% for a limited duration, recognizing that evidence is limited and that monotherapy should be avoided to mitigate resistance risk; benzoyl peroxide and retinoids should generally be avoided in neonates due to irritation and lack of safety data [^570d4dcf] [^331e7000] [^2f6d41ee].

> But wait, what if the eruption is not neonatal acne. I should confirm the differential: milia, miliaria, seborrheic dermatitis, herpes simplex, and bacterial folliculitis can mimic acne in neonates; if the morphology is atypical, rapidly progressive, or accompanied by systemic signs, I need to reconsider the diagnosis and consider evaluation for alternative conditions or infection before attributing it to benign neonatal acne [^notfound].

> Next, I should review follow-up and escalation. If lesions persist beyond about 3 months, worsen, become nodulocystic, or fail to respond to conservative measures, referral to pediatric dermatology is prudent; in older infants with confirmed infantile acne, evidence-based pediatric algorithms support topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids with careful monitoring, but that threshold is generally after 8 weeks of age and with established pediatric safety protocols, not in the newborn period [^570d4dcf] [^384b8991].

> In summary, I should emphasize that for "dry newborn acne", the balance of evidence and safety favors minimal intervention: gentle cleansing, avoidance of emollients on active lesions, and observation; if treatment is deemed necessary, a short, supervised course of a low-potency topical antibiotic may be considered, while benzoyl peroxide and retinoids should be avoided in neonates due to irritation and lack of neonatal safety data; any atypical or persistent cases warrant reassessment of the diagnosis and specialist input [^91a8962e] [^570d4dcf] [^2f6d41ee] [^0e30591a].

---

For dry newborn acne, **gentle cleansing with water** and **avoidance of emollients on affected areas** are the primary recommendations [^91a8962e]. If lesions persist or worsen, a **low-potency topical antibiotic** (such as erythromycin 2%) may be used short-term under pediatric guidance, but avoid benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and salicylic acid due to irritation and lack of neonatal safety data [^331e7000] [^2f6d41ee] [^0e30591a] [^5e0315da]. Most cases resolve spontaneously within weeks to months; escalate care if severe, persistent, or atypical features arise [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Neonatal acne typically presents within the first few weeks of life, characterized by **papules and pustules** on the face, particularly the cheeks, forehead, and chin. It is generally benign and self-limiting, resolving spontaneously within weeks to months. Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on characteristic lesions and the absence of systemic symptoms.

---

## General principles of management

The cornerstone of managing dry newborn acne is **gentle skin care** and avoidance of irritants. The following principles are recommended:

- **Gentle cleansing**: Use plain water or a mild, fragrance-free cleanser. Avoid soaps, detergents, or alcohol-based products that can exacerbate dryness and irritation [^1c56ddc1].

- **Avoidance of emollients**: Emollients should be avoided on affected areas, as they may cause follicular occlusion and worsen acne lesions [^91a8962e].

- **Minimal intervention**: Most cases resolve spontaneously, and aggressive topical treatments are generally unnecessary.

---

## Topical treatments

While most cases resolve without pharmacologic intervention, persistent or moderate cases may benefit from **topical antibiotics**. The following topical treatments are considered:

| **Topical treatment** | **Indication** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Erythromycin 2% | Mild inflammatory lesions | - Safe for short-term use in neonates <br/> - Minimal systemic absorption <br/> - Avoid prolonged use |
| Clindamycin 1% | Mild inflammatory lesions | - Limited neonatal data <br/> - Use with caution <br/> - Avoid prolonged use |
| Benzoyl peroxide | Not recommended | - Potential irritation <br/> - Lack of neonatal safety data |
| Topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene) | Not recommended | - Potential irritation <br/> - Lack of neonatal safety data |
| Salicylic acid | Not recommended | - Potential irritation <br/> - Risk of salicylate toxicity with excessive use |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting topical treatments

Evidence supporting topical treatments in neonates is **limited**, with most data extrapolated from pediatric and adult populations. Erythromycin 2% is generally considered safe for short-term use in neonates, with minimal systemic absorption and low risk of adverse effects [^notfound]. Clindamycin 1% may be considered in select cases, but data in neonates are limited, and caution is advised [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Topical treatments in neonates carry potential risks, including:

- **Skin irritation**: Erythema, dryness, and peeling are common with topical antibiotics and retinoids.

- **Systemic absorption**: Although minimal, systemic absorption of topical antibiotics can occur, particularly with prolonged use or application to large areas.

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Prolonged use of topical antibiotics may promote bacterial resistance.

---

## Duration of treatment

Treatment duration should be **short-term**, typically limited to a few weeks. If no improvement is observed within 2–4 weeks, reassess the diagnosis and consider alternative explanations or referral to a pediatric dermatologist.

---

## When to escalate care

Escalation of care is indicated if:

- **Severe or persistent lesions**: Nodulocystic lesions, significant scarring, or lesions persisting beyond 6 months.

- **Atypical features**: Unusual distribution, morphology, or associated systemic symptoms.

- **Failure of conservative management**: No improvement with gentle cleansing and short-term topical antibiotics.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dry newborn acne is a common, benign condition that typically resolves spontaneously. Gentle cleansing and avoidance of irritants are the **cornerstones of management**. Short-term use of topical antibiotics, such as erythromycin 2%, may be considered for persistent or moderate cases, but benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and salicylic acid should be avoided due to potential irritation and lack of neonatal safety data. Persistent or severe cases warrant further evaluation and possible referral to a pediatric dermatologist.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^d74e2f75]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The analyses presented here informed national guidance for the management of acne vulgaris in England, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who worked with the British Association of Dermatologists for this purpose. The guideline was developed by a committee of academics, health professionals and service users with expertise and experience in acne vulgaris.

Search strategy

Searches for RCTs of treatments for acne vulgaris were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from inception, using relevant medical subject headings, free‐text terms and study‐type filters where appropriate. The search was undertaken in August 2019 and reruns were performed in May 2020 (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).

Selection criteria for the systematic review and the network meta‐analysis

A systematic review of RCTs of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne vulgaris was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020154100) and is provided in full in Appendix S2 (see Supporting Information).

The review included people with acne vulgaris of all ages (except neonatal acne) and severity levels. Populations with postinflammatory dyspigmentation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), refractory acne or receiving maintenance treatment were excluded. Separate analyses were conducted for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne. Reported severity levels in each study were used for study categorization into mild‐to‐moderate or moderate‐to‐severe acne. Based on the committee's expert advice, if severity was unclear or reported as 'moderate', the study was categorized as mild‐to‐moderate acne if each participant had only noninflammatory lesions, or < 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≤ 30, whereas the study was categorized as moderate‐to‐severe acne if each participant had ≥ 3 nodules (regardless of the number of other inflammatory lesions), or ≥ 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≥ 40. If this information could not be obtained or the mean number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was 31–39, the study was excluded from the review.

### Topical antibiotics in the dermatological clinical practice: indications, efficacy, and adverse effects [^04cbcddb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical antibiotic therapy is a central component of patient management for several skin conditions, including acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, rosacea, impetigo or other superinfected dermatitis, and prevention of wound infections. Moreover, particular situations, such as skin diseases of bacterial origin in pregnancy and infants often warrant topical therapy. However, the occurrence of local delayed hypersensitivity reactions and the rising rate of antibiotic resistance are becoming great challenges faced by many dermatologists today. This narrative review provides an overview of the main topical antibiotics used in dermatology, focusing on their clinical role in the most common dermatological indications. For this purpose, a review of MEDLINE and PubMed for pertinent, scientific, and clinical publications until March 2020 was performed. Only articles published in the English language were included.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^91a8962e]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Use of Emollients

Clinical evidence derived from controlled studies of healthy infants 19, 49, 50 combined with evidence from studies demonstrating the positive effect of emollients in patients with AD (or at high risk of AD) and impaired barrier function 51, 52, 53, 54 supports the theoretical rationale for the use of emollients 55. Appropriately formulated emollients can be used to maintain or enhance skin barrier function after bathing and at least twice‐weekly application of emollients, as in the Garcia Bartels et al study 19, should be considered (Table 8). Longer‐term studies designed to evaluate the clinical benefits of emollients in healthy infants — potentially to prevent the onset of the typical progression of allergic diseases that often begins early in life — are warranted 56 and would strengthen the evidence for these recommendations.

Table 8
New Recommendations on Topical Use of Emollients and Oils

Given that environmental factors such as humidity and temperature can affect the skin, it was strongly recommended that the choice of emollient be adapted to geographic location and season 57, 58. Richer (higher proportion of emollient than water) emollients may be required in cold climates and less rich emollients in warmer climates or times of the year.

Emollients should be applied in a thin layer to avoid occlusive effects, and care should be taken to avoid the trapping of emollients in folds, which may lead to dysregulation of evaporation or heat dysregulation and bacterial colonization 59, 60. Special attention should be paid to the perioral area to protect infants from the irritating effects of saliva, particularly during periods of teething. If neonatal or infantile acne is present, application of emollients to the affected area should be avoided to prevent follicular occlusion, which could exacerbate the condition.

Highlighting the importance of design, certain emollients containing SLS and no humectants may contribute to skin barrier breakdown (SLS solubilizes SC lipids, denatures keratin, and raises skin surface pH 32), so health care professionals should be aware of the suitability of emollients, and those containing SLS should be avoided.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 29 new acne susceptibility loci [^6a460fe7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Despite considerable recent advances in new treatments for other inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, there is a substantial unmet medical need in the treatment of acne. Early and effective intervention strategies are often necessary to avoid irreversible scarring in severe acne. Treatment typically consists of topical and systemic agents that suppress the microbiome repertoire or the activity of sebaceous glands, while other treatments include hormonal treatment and phototherapy. The most effective agent to treat acne is isotretinoin, which may induce remission through its effect on epidermal differentiation, but its side effect profile, which includes dry skin, lips (cheilitis) and mucous membranes, muscle aches, itching of the skin and headaches, restricts use to only those with severe disease. Isotretinoin is also a powerful teratogen whose use during pregnancy is restricted due to its association with severe and life-threatening birth defects. Better-tolerated acne treatments are required and there is a particular need for effective options without the risk of teratogenicity.

The genetic contribution to acne susceptibility has been demonstrated in several twin studies, with heritability consistently estimated around 80% –. Recent molecular genetic studies identified 17 genomic loci harbouring alleles associated with the disease — 15 loci with a reported effect in European populations, and two in a Han Chinese population. Functional characterisation of these genetic association signals has implicated a series of causal genes whose genetic perturbation impacts the development and maintenance of the hair follicle and wound healing.

To further characterise the genetic architecture of acne vulgaris and identify additional genomic loci contributing to the disease susceptibility, we have performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of acne undertaken in nine independent cohorts that in total comprise 615,396 study participants (20,165 cases and 595,231 controls). Next, we combine fine-mapping and genome-wide analytical approaches to gain insights into the underlying genes and pathways through which the associated loci contribute to disease susceptibility, and the relationship between the genetic architecture of acne and other traits.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^0e30591a]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Adapalene prescribing information — topical treatment of acne vulgaris is indicated in patients ≥ 12 years of age. Apply a thin film of adapalene to the entire face and any other affected areas of the skin once daily in the evening, after washing gently with a nonmedicated soap. Should not be administered to individuals who are hypersensitive to adapalene or any of the components in the vehicle. Clinical studies show that 16% of patients applying 0.1% topical adapalene and 21% of patients applying 0.3% topical adapalene had successful treatments after 12 weeks (using Investigator's Global Assessment). Reported adverse effects/toxicities include erythema, scaling, dry skin, burning/stinging, skin discomfort, pruritus, desquamation, sunburn, allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, face/eyelid edema, lip swelling, and angioedema. Has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients; concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products should be approached with caution, and use with caution is advised especially when using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use, and weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating. Pregnancy category is C; it is not known whether adapalene is excreted in human milk, and safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients < 12 years of age.

### A new approach to comparing efficacy results from clinical trials of topical acne vulgaris treatments [^a14315be]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Clinicians must evaluate a voluminous amount of information from clinical trials when choosing among the growing number of topical acne treatments. This article describes a simple way to evaluate and broadly compare the efficacy results of well-controlled phase III clinical trials of topical acne treatments by taking into account the placebo effect (or active control effect). Key efficacy results are drawn from the package inserts of 7 primary topical acne treatments. To account for placebo effect, the mean percent reduction with placebo was subtracted from that of the active treatment for each type of lesion and also calculated as an average of these differences for all lesions. Based upon the principles of research, this method accounts for within study variances and offers a quick assessment of product efficacy. Clinicians should be cautioned that this method only allows for broad comparisons and does not establish definitive differences between treatments.

### Topical treatments in acne vulgaris: guidance for the busy dermatologist [^f066628a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Acne is a very common skin disease; frequently seen in adolescents and often persisting or occurring into adulthood. Topical therapy is very effective in mild to moderate disease, and is used as maintenance therapy. Fixed combination products have been studied in moderately severe disease. Combinations of benzoyl peroxide and either clindamycin or adapalene appear very effective. When utilizing a topical retinoid alone or in combination, it is essential to incorporate an appropriate skin care regimen to minimize local irritation. In the absence of direct comparative clinical trials, this review provides timely guidance for clinicians on the use of these agents, and their benefits in special populations.

### The role of zinc in the treatment of acne: a review of the literature [^7909d3ec]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a chronic disease of the pilosebaceous units presenting as inflammatory or noninflammatory lesions in individuals of all ages. The current standard of treatment includes topical formulations in the forms of washes, gels, lotions, and creams such as antibiotics, antibacterial agents, retinoids, and comedolytics. Additionally, systemic treatments are available for more severe or resistant forms of acne. Nevertheless, these treatments have shown to induce a wide array of adverse effects, including dryness, peeling, erythema, and even fetal defects and embolic events. Zinc is a promising alternative to other acne treatments owing to its low cost, efficacy, and lack of systemic side effects. In this literature review, we evaluate the effectiveness and side-effect profiles of various formulations of zinc used to treat acne.

### The management of acne vulgaris in pregnancy [^4f081a53]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common condition in adolescence and also for many women of childbearing age. The management of acne in pregnancy is complicated by the lack of clinical studies and pharmacokinetic data in this patient population and safety concerns regarding retinoid use in pregnancy. Of primary concern to both patients and clinicians is the safety profile of medications used during pregnancy. This review seeks to clarify what management options are available to treat acne during pregnancy and what data are available to guide decision making. Topical treatments are considered the safest option during pregnancy. They have the best safety profile and minimize the levels of systemic absorption, and therefore the least risk of fetal exposure. If these are applied properly with a strong emphasis on adherence, excellent results can be achieved.

Supplemental Table VIII — prescribing information for combination clindamycin and tretinoin indicates topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients ≥ 12 years of age, with dosing to apply a pea-sized amount to the entire face once daily at bedtime. Contraindications include patients with regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, or history of antibiotic-associated colitis. In clinical trials, 21–41% of patients using combined clindamycin and tretinoin topically demonstrated successful treatment (using Evaluator's Global Severity score). Adverse effects/toxicities include erythema, scaling, itching, burning, stinging, nasopharyngitis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, dry skin, cough, and sinusitis. Interactions state that concomitant use of topical medications with a strong drying effect can increase skin irritation. Should not be used in combination with erythromycin-containing products. Should not be used in combination with neuromuscular blocking agents. Other issues advise to avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps, and that weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating. Pregnancy category is C; it is not known whether clindamycin or tretinoin is excreted in human milk; and safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients < 12 years of age.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^bd0aa2a7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Topical retinoids — retinoids are the core of topical therapy for acne because they are comedolytic, resolve the precursor microcomedone lesion, and are antiinflammatory, but use may be limited by dryness, peeling, erythema, and irritation, which can be mitigated by reduced frequency of application; some formulations of tretinoin are not photostable and should be applied in the evening, and tretinoin may be oxidized and inactivated by coadministration of BP, so it is recommended that the 2 agents be applied at different times. Tretinoin and adapalene are pregnancy category C, while tazarotene is category X; data suggest that adapalene is better tolerated than multiple concentrations of tretinoin (based on older formulations), and overall, the limitations of existing studies prohibit direct efficacy comparisons of topical retinoids; topical retinoids have been associated with increased photosensitivity, and concurrent daily sunscreen can be used to reduce the risk of sunburn.

### Young people's perceptions of acne and acne treatments: secondary analysis of qualitative interview data [^74996957]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding of different topical treatments

Frustration with the trial and error process seemed to be influenced by people's perception that they had tried all the topical treatments available. They described their treatment as 'the one from the pharmacy' or 'the one my mum bought me'. With some assuming that branded topical products such as 'Clearasil' were the same as topical treatments prescribed by the GP, possibly leading them to wish to try other medications such as oral antibiotics as a first‐line treatment. Many participants either said they were confused, or appeared to be confused, with regard to the different functions, ingredients and medical names of topical treatments, frequently getting them mixed up with one another.

'I'm not sure, I've had loads, I've had like benzoyl something, I think I've had. [er] I'm not sure what this one was called actually, I've pretty much been on everything so you can factor it was like one of them. [laughs] [er] so I'm, I'm not sure what it was actually called'.
Uncertainty about the effectiveness of topical treatments

Many participants were uncertain whether topicals were effective, as they reported how they were only 'keeping their acne at bay'. In addition, some participants spoke about how discontinuing treatment once their skin was clear, or because of side‐effects, would make their acne worse and therefore perceived treatment as ineffective because they had been hoping for a 'cure'.

'I remember the problem was that it tended to make my skin really dry after a while, so you had to stop the treatment. But that was the best one that was working for me. So it really wasn't, so I did it like for a month or two and then my skin got really dry. Then I stopped for a month and then it like came back. So you're just repeating it over and over and over again. You're not really getting a definite cure. So that's, yeah, that's annoying'.
For some, keeping the acne under control was not enough and they were seeking something that would clear it completely.

'It was kind of just sort of a keeping it at a certain level as opposed to absolutely like clearing your whole skin and making it sort of a lot better'.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne [^570d4dcf]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions in children and adolescents. The presentation, differential diagnosis, and association of acne with systemic pathology differs by age of presentation. Current acknowledged guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pediatric acne are lacking, and there are variations in management across the spectrum of primary and specialty care. The American Acne and Rosacea Society convened a panel of pediatric dermatologists, pediatricians, and dermatologists with expertise in acne to develop recommendations for the management of pediatric acne and evidence-based treatment algorithms.

Methods

Ten major topic areas in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne were identified. A thorough literature search was performed and articles identified, reviewed, and assessed for evidence grading. Each topic area was assigned to 2 expert reviewers who developed and presented summaries and recommendations for critique and editing. Furthermore, the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, including ratings for the strength of recommendation for a body of evidence, was used throughout for the consensus recommendations for the evaluation and management of pediatric acne. Practical evidence-based treatment algorithms also were developed.

Results

Recommendations were put forth regarding the classification, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pediatric acne, based on age and pubertal status. Treatment considerations include the use of over-the-counter products, topical benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin. Simplified treatment algorithms and recommendations are presented in detail for adolescent, preadolescent, infantile, and neonatal acne. Other considerations, including psychosocial effects of acne, adherence to treatment regimens, and the role of diet and acne, also are discussed.

Conclusions

These expert recommendations by the American Acne and Rosacea Society as reviewed and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics constitute the first detailed, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of pediatric acne including issues of special concern when treating pediatric patients.

### The many faces of pediatric acne: a practical algorithm for treatment, maintenance therapy, and skincare recommendations for pediatric acne patients [^abe959e0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric acne is a common, complex, multifactorial inflammatory skin disease with various expressions in childhood that can be categorized by age, severity, and pubertal status.

Methods

The Faces of Pediatric Acne Project (FoPAP) aims to improve patient outcomes. The FoPAP group developed an algorithm that follows a consensus paper and a clinical case series on pediatric acne by applying the selected literature and drawing from the clinical knowledge and experience of each group member.

Results

The algorithm addresses neonatal, infantile, mid-childhood, preadolescent, and adolescent acne and starts with education on acne, general measures for prevention, treatment, maintenance, and ongoing skin care. Evaluation of pediatric acne requires a directed medical history and physical examination. For mid-childhood acne patients, a workup is warranted, and endocrine-associated abnormalities necessitate referral to a pediatric dermatologist. The second section of the algorithm identifies the type of pediatric acne, followed by the third section on acne treatment using a prescription or nonprescription treatment and skincare options. After successfully controlling the disease, maintenance treatment with topical agents and skincare using gentle cleansers and moisturizers containing lipids such as ceramides is important.

Conclusions

The pediatric acne algorithm offers a comprehensive approach to treating and maintaining pediatric acne. In addition, it may support healthcare providers to bring more attention to pediatric acne patients and improve outcomes. Schachner LA, Andriessen A, Latanya Benjamin L, et al.

### Topical retinoids in acne vulgaris: update on efficacy and safety [^8ffba7b0]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids represent a mainstay of acne treatment because they expel mature comedones, reduce microcomedone formation, and exert anti-inflammatory effects. The first-generation retinoid tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) and the synthetic third-generation polyaromatics adapalene and tazarotene are approved for acne treatment by the US FDA, whereas topical tretinoin, isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid), and adapalene are accredited in Canada and Europe. Topical retinoids have a favorable safety profile distinct from the toxicity of their systemic counterparts. Local adverse effects, including erythema, dryness, itching, and stinging, occur frequently during the early treatment phase. Their impact varies with the vehicle formation, skin type, frequency and mode of application, use of moisturizers, and environmental factors such as sun exposure or temperature. The broad anti-acne activity and safety profile of topical retinoids justifies their use as first-line treatment in most types of non-inflammatory and inflammatory acne. They are also suitable as long-term medications, with no risk of inducing bacterial resistance, for maintenance of remission after cessation of initial combination therapy.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^596902f1]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally, affecting over 0·5 billion people. Acne can have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. Acne severity may be determined by clinical presentation (number and type of lesions), secondary sequelae (scarring, pigmentation), and its psychological and social impact on the patient. Uncertainty around acne treatment effectiveness may be a barrier to treatment. Various topical, oral and physical acne treatments are available, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness, especially in relation to acne severity.

Network meta‐analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous estimation of relative effects for any number of treatments, even if some have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), provided that treatments create a 'network of evidence' where every treatment is linked to at least another treatment through direct comparisons.,

Two NMAs assessing the effectiveness of treatments for acne vulgaris have been published to date, both focusing on mild‐to‐moderate acne. Therefore, our study examined the relative effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments separately for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features, to identify suitable first‐line treatments.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTCLE: pathophysiologic targets of acne treatment [^f9de2bcb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extremely common dermatologic condition. Individuals with acne present not only to dermatologists, but also to internists, family medicine physicians, pediatricians, estheticians, and beauty counters alike in search of a treatment. The diagnosis of acne is relatively straightforward, leading many to believe that acne is a simple condition. However, the pathophysiology of acne is anything but simple. Decades of research has ultimately revealed a complex interaction of pathogenic factors that lead to acne. This includes sebum production, C. acnes colonization, inflammation, and follicular hyperkeratinization. Understanding each of these features has been fundamental to the development of anti-acne medications. Topical agents are often used as an initial therapy given their safety and efficacy. While some topical therapies have been used for decades, new creams, gels, and lotions continue to be added to the list of approved acne treatments. Given the number of topical acne products on the market, we present an updated review of the current landscape of topical acne treatments and how each choice functions mechanistically to fight against acne.

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^9ca08cc8]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

### Tretinoin (tretinoin cream) [^d2771095]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication.

Do not use other medications with Tretinoin Cream which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling.

If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of Tretinoin Cream in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication.

AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN CREAM THERAPY

Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse.

Combination clindamycin + benzoyl peroxide — prescribing information for acne vulgaris lists the indication as topical treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris and dosing as apply a thin layer to the face once daily in the evening. Efficacy notes that combined clindamycin plus benzoyl peroxide topically applied once daily for 11 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle, benzoyl peroxide, and clindamycin for inflammatory facial acne in 3 of 5 trials, while it has not been shown to have any additional benefit versus benzoyl peroxide alone for noninflammatory acne. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, any components of the formulation, or lincomycin, and a history of regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, or antibiotic-associated colitis including pseudomembranous colitis. Adverse effects and toxicities include erythema, peeling, dryness, burning, and anaphylaxis. Interactions state it should not be used in combination with erythromycin-containing products, with concomitant topical medications, or with neuromuscular blocking agents. Other issues warn about ultraviolet light and environmental exposure including tanning beds or sun lamps and advise to minimize sun exposure after application. Pregnancy category is C, and for nursing it is not known whether clindamycin or benzoyl peroxide is excreted into human milk after topical application.

### Topical treatments for acne [^6c279827]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Topical drugs have been used successfully to treat acne for decades. This review discusses the use, efficacy, and safety of options available via prescription. Topical antibiotics, dapsone, benzyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and topical retinoids are included. Topical antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy but rather be combined with other agents to avoid resistant Propionibacterium acnes strains. Benzoyl peroxide is effective in preventing bacteria resistance. Topical retinoids address primarily the comedonal but also the inflammatory lesions of acne. Azelaic acid is useful in treating acne lesions and for lightening postinflammatory hyperpigmentation that may accompany inflammatory acne lesions. Combinations of agents that address different aspects of acne pathogenesis may offer higher benefit to acne patients.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^dd69ad7b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sebum Production and Hyperkeratinization

Topical and systemic retinoids are vitamin A derivatives which bind retinoid X and/or retinoic acid (RAR) receptors to suppress sebum production, hyperkeratinization, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This ultimately leads to increased keratinocyte turnover, comedolytic properties, normalization of desquamation at the follicular infundibulum, and decreased inflammation. They also help treat post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), a common sequela of acne in skin of color. The four FDA-approved topical retinoids are adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene, and trifarotene (a new selective RAR-γ topical which is useful in treating facial and truncal acne). Micronized formulations can help reduce cutaneous irritation and erythema resulting from increased transepidermal water loss. Cutaneous irritation and mild photosensitization are common.

Isotretinoin is the only FDA-approved oral retinoid for treating severe, nodulocystic, and/or recalcitrant acne, especially in those with scarring. In addition, isotretinoin is the only acne medication which is thought to target all four major pillars of acne pathogenesis: sebum production, hyperkeratinization, C. acnes concentration, and inflammation. Importantly, it may also induce remission of acne after an appropriate cumulative dose is achieved. Common adverse effects include mucocutaneous dryness and irritation, elevated serum triglycerides and liver enzymes (these should be monitored before treatment initiation and at peak dose), and severe teratogenicity requiring monthly pregnancy testing and extensive counseling about contraception.

Prescribing information for salicylic acid — used alone or in combination with other drugs for the symptomatic treatment of acne — includes topical dosing, safety, interactions, and pediatric cautions. Salicylic acid is used alone or in combination with other drugs for the symptomatic treatment of acne, and dosing is to apply topically using appropriate preparations containing salicylic acid 0.5–2%, with appropriate 0.5–2% salicylic acid preparation applied 1–3 times daily; initially apply once daily then gradually increase to 2 or 3 times daily, and if dryness or peeling occurs reduce application to once daily or every other day. Contraindications are known sensitivity to salicylic acid or any other ingredient in the formulation; adverse effects/toxicity include hypersensitivity reactions, salicylate toxicity, excessive erythema, and scaling; and interactions are listed with acidifying agents, anticoagulants, antidiabetic agents, aspirin, corticosteroids, diuretics, methotrexate, pyrazinamide, sulfur, and uricosuric agents. Other issues note cumulative irritant or drying effect and state that if excessive dryness occurs, use only 1 topical medication unless directed by a clinician; pregnancy category C is stated; and for nursing, discontinue nursing or the drug and, if used by nursing women, avoid applying to the chest area. Pediatric use guidance states that salicylic acid 6% cream, lotion, and gel and 15% plaster are not recommended in children < 2 years of age, there is increased risk of salicylate toxicity with prolonged, excessive use in children < 12 years of age, treatment area should be limited with monitoring for possible signs of salicylate toxicity, and use of salicylates in children with varicella infection or influenza-like illnesses is associated with an increased risk of developing Reye syndrome.

### Topical benzoyl peroxide for acne [^b63bb7f6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is a common, economically burdensome condition that can cause psychological harm and, potentially, scarring. Topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a widely used acne treatment; however, its efficacy and safety have not been clearly evaluated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of BPO for acne.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to February 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared topical BPO used alone (including different formulations and concentrations of BPO) or as part of combination treatment against placebo, no treatment, or other active topical medications for clinically diagnosed acne (used alone or in combination with other topical drugs not containing BPO) on the face or trunk.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were 'participant global self-assessment of acne improvement' and 'withdrawal due to adverse events in the whole course of a trial' 'Percentage of participants experiencing any adverse event in the whole course of a trial' was a key secondary outcome.

Main Results

We included 120 trials (29,592 participants randomised in 116 trials; in four trials the number of randomised participants was unclear). Ninety-one studies included males and females. When reported, 72 trials included participants with mild to moderate acne, 26 included participants with severe acne, and the mean age of participants ranged from 18 to 30 years. Our included trials assessed BPO as monotherapy, as add-on treatment, or combined with other active treatments, as well as BPO of different concentrations and BPO delivered through different vehicles. Comparators included different concentrations or formulations of BPO, placebo, no treatment, or other active treatments given alone or combined. Treatment duration in 80 trials was longer than eight weeks and was only up to 12 weeks in 108 trials. Industry funded 50 trials; 63 trials did not report funding. We commonly found high or unclear risk of performance, detection, or attrition bias. Trial setting was under-reported but included hospitals, medical centres/departments, clinics, general practices, and student health centres. We reported on outcomes assessed at the end of treatment, and we classified treatment periods as short-term (two to four weeks), medium-term (five to eight weeks), or long-term (longer than eight weeks). For 'participant-reported acne improvement', BPO may be more effective than placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.45; 3 RCTs; 2234 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence). Based on low-certainty evidence, there may be little to no difference between BPO and adapalene (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.10; 5 RCTs; 1472 participants; treatment for 11 to 12 weeks) or between BPO and clindamycin (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34; 1 RCT; 240 participants; treatment for 10 weeks) (outcome not reported for BPO versus erythromycin or salicylic acid). For 'withdrawal due to adverse effects', risk of treatment discontinuation may be higher with BPO compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.93; 24 RCTs; 13,744 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence); the most common causes of withdrawal were erythema, pruritus, and skin burning. Only very low-certainty evidence was available for the following comparisons: BPO versus adapalene (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.64; 11 RCTs; 3295 participants; treatment for 11 to 24 weeks; causes of withdrawal not clear), BPO versus clindamycin (RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.90 to 4.11; 8 RCTs; 3330 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; causes of withdrawal included local hypersensitivity, pruritus, erythema, face oedema, rash, and skin burning), erythromycin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.26; 1 RCT; 60 participants; treatment for 8 weeks; withdrawal due to dermatitis), and salicylic acid (no participants had adverse event-related withdrawal; 1 RCT; 59 participants; treatment for 12 weeks). There may be little to no difference between these groups in terms of withdrawal; however, we are unsure of the results because the evidence is of very low certainty. For 'proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event', very low-certainty evidence leaves us uncertain about whether BPO increased adverse events when compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.70; 21 RCTs; 11,028 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks), with adapalene (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.00; 7 RCTs; 2120 participants; treatment for 11 to 24 weeks), with erythromycin (no participants reported any adverse events; 1 RCT; 89 participants; treatment for 10 weeks), or with salicylic acid (RR 4.77, 95% CI 0.24 to 93.67; 1 RCT; 41 participants; treatment for 6 weeks). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that the risk of adverse events may be increased for BPO versus clindamycin (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.58; 6 RCTs; 3018 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks); however, the 95% CI indicates that BPO might make little to no difference. Most reported adverse events were mild to moderate, and local dryness, irritation, dermatitis, erythema, application site pain, and pruritus were the most common.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that BPO as monotherapy or add-on treatment may be more effective than placebo or no treatment for improving acne, and there may be little to no difference between BPO and either adapalene or clindamycin. Our key efficacy evidence is based on participant self-assessment; trials of BPO versus erythromycin or salicylic acid did not report this outcome. For adverse effects, the evidence is very uncertain regarding BPO compared with adapalene, erythromycin, or salicylic acid. However, risk of treatment discontinuation may be higher with BPO compared with placebo or no treatment. Withdrawal may be linked to tolerability rather than to safety. Risk of mild to moderate adverse events may be higher with BPO compared with clindamycin. Further trials should assess the comparative effects of different preparations or concentrations of BPO and combination BPO versus monotherapy. These trials should fully assess and report adverse effects and patient-reported outcomes measured on a standardised scale.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne… [^384b8991]. publications.aap.org (2013). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions in children and adolescents. The presentation, differential diagnosis, and association of acne with systemic pathology differs by age of presentation. Current acknowledged guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pediatric acne are lacking, and there are variations in management across the spectrum of primary and specialty care. The American Acne and Rosacea Society convened a panel of pediatric dermatologists, pediatricians, and dermatologists with expertise in acne to develop recommendations for the management of pediatric acne and evidence-based treatment algorithms. Ten major topic areas in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne were identified. A thorough literature search was performed and articles identified, reviewed, and assessed for evidence grading. Each topic area was assigned to 2 expert reviewers who developed and presented summaries and recommendations for critique and editing.

Furthermore, the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, including ratings for the strength of recommendation for a body of evidence, was used throughout for the consensus recommendations for the evaluation and management of pediatric acne. Practical evidence-based treatment algorithms also were developed. Recommendations were put forth regarding the classification, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pediatric acne, based on age and pubertal status. Treatment considerations include the use of over-the-counter products, topical benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin. Simplified treatment algorithms and recommendations are presented in detail for adolescent, preadolescent, infantile, and neonatal acne. Other considerations, including psychosocial effects of acne, adherence to treatment regimens, and the role of diet and acne, also are discussed.

These expert recommendations by the American Acne and Rosacea Society as reviewed and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics constitute the first detailed, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of pediatric acne including issues of special concern when treating pediatric patients. Comments.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^02ad21cb]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Topical retinoids are routinely used to treat acne; safety and efficacy are well documented in large pivotal trials. With limited FDA‐approved treatment options for preadolescent acne, off‐label prescribing is common. Monotherapy with adapalene gel, tretinoin gel, and tretinoin microsphere gel has been investigated in small open‐label and blinded studies in children under 12 years of age. 7, 8, 9 However, data in preadolescent acne are lacking.

In a 12‐week open‐label study of 40 children (8‐12 years) with mild‐to‐moderate acne, tretinoin microsphere 0.04% gel produced a significant decrease in EGSS from baseline to Week 12 (from 2.6 to 2.1, P < 0.0001). Eight patients (22.2%) were "clear" or "almost clear". Skin irritation occurred in 35% of patients, being generally mild and transient. 8 In a subsequent double‐blind study with tretinoin microsphere 0.04% gel in 110 children (9‐11 years) with moderate acne, there was a significantly greater improvement in noninflammatory lesions (44.0% reduction) compared to vehicle (30.8%, P = 0.04) at Week 12. 9 In a post hoc analysis of two studies comparing tretinoin microsphere 0.1% gel and tretinoin 0.05% gel in young adolescents (10‐14 years) with mild‐to‐moderate acne, comparable lesion reduction and treatment success were noted. Tretinoin 0.05% gel demonstrated better cutaneous tolerability. 10 Fourteen percent of participants reported dry skin, 8% skin burning sensation, 5% erythema, and 5% dermatitis exfoliative compared with 32%, 11%, 23%, and 23%, respectively, with tretinoin gel microsphere 0.1% (all P < 0.001, except skin burning sensation).

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^bd9ef290]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment outcomes

Efficacy of each treatment class relative to placebo is shown in Table 1 for mild‐to‐moderate acne and Table 2 for moderate‐to‐severe acne. In each analysis, treatment classes have been ordered from best to worst using their mean ranking for females. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, bias‐adjusted results are presented, as there was indication of bias owing to small study size in this evidence; base‐case results (before bias adjustment) are shown in Appendix S15 (see Supporting Information). Large uncertainty in the results for most treatments was indicated by wide 95% CrIs around mean effects and rankings.

Table 1
Network meta‐analysis: treatment efficacy (percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline) in mild‐to‐moderate acne: bias‐adjusted treatment class effects vs. placebo and rankings

Table 2
Network meta‐analysis: treatment efficacy (percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline) in moderate‐to‐severe acne: treatment class effects vs. placebo and rankings

No evidence of effect on treatment discontinuation for any reason was found for any treatment class compared with placebo at either acne severity level. In mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical retinoids, BPO and their combination showed higher discontinuation owing to side‐effects compared with placebo; in moderate‐to‐severe acne (bias‐adjusted analysis), topical retinoids alone or combined with an oral tetracycline, oral cocyprindiol alone or combined with an oral tetracycline, and oral tetracycline alone showed higher discontinuation owing to side‐effects compared with placebo (Appendix S15).

Relative effects between all pairs of treatment classes (including results from indirect and available head‐to‐head comparisons) are reported in Appendix S16 (see Supporting Information).

Threshold analysis

After excluding antibiotic monotherapies, physical treatments and oral isotretinoin, which the committee considered unsuitable first‐line treatments owing to associated potential harms or lack of routine availability and use, threshold analysis suggested that conclusions for mild‐to‐moderate acne were fairly robust to changes in the evidence. In moderate‐to‐severe acne, a moderate change in the evidence would lead to BPO entering the top four efficacious treatments that were eligible for a recommendation (Appendix S17; see Supporting Information).

### The many faces of pediatric acne: how to tailor nonprescription acne treatment and skincare using cleansers and moisturizers [^5855f70e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common, complex, multifactorial disorder. Various expressions of acne in childhood can be categorized by age, severity, and pubertal status.

Objective

To improve pediatric acne patients&rsquo; outcomes, various expressions of pediatric acne to educate and tailor nonprescription acne treatment and skincare using cleansers and moisturizers were defined and discussed.

Methods

An expert panel of pediatric dermatologists and dermatologists reviewed and discussed nonprescription acne treatment and skincare literature. The results from the literature searches were used together with the panel&rsquo; s expert opinion and experience to adopt various expressions of pediatric acne and prevention, treatment, and maintenance of the condition using nonprescription acne treatment and skincare.

Results

The panel agreed on sixteen acne patient profiles addressing various age categories of pediatric acne: neonatal acne: birth to &le; 8 weeks; infantile acne: 8 weeks to &le;1 year; mid-childhood acne: 1 year to < 7 years; preadolescent acne: &ge;7 to 12 years; adolescent acne: &ge;12 to 19 years or after menarche for girls. Nonprescription acne treatment and skincare products containing lipids such as ceramides play an important role in monotherapy, adjunctive, and maintenance treatment; however, their role in pediatric acne is not well defined and requires more studies.

Conclusion

Pediatric acne deserves more attention from healthcare providers treating children regarding differential diagnosis, treatment, and maintenance using nonprescription acne treatment and skincare. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(6):602–612. doi:10.36849/JDD.6872.

### Effects of tazarotene 0.1% cream in the treatment of facial acne vulgaris: pooled results from two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group trials [^25c10e14]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Topical retinoids are one of the most effective classes of topical drugs used to treat acne vulgaris. The effects of the gel formulation of the topical retinoid tazarotene have been widely reported, but few data on the cream formulation are available.

Objective

The primary aim of the 2 studies reported in this article was to determine the effects of tazarotene 0.1% cream in patients with facial acne vulgaris.

Methods

Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies were performed. The first was conducted at 14 investigational sites across the United States, and the second took place at 15 sites, with 5 of these providing blood samples for analysis of tazarotenic acid. In both studies, patients aged ≥ 12 years with facial acne vulgaris were randomized to receive tazarotene or vehicle cream QD for 12 weeks. Lesion counts (noninflammatory, inflammatory, and total) and overall clinical and global assessments were made at weeks 0 (baseline), 4, 8, and 12. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study In one of the studies, therapeutic drug monitoring was performed at weeks 4 and 8 in members of the study population who gave consent for blood withdrawal.

Results

Eight hundred forty-seven patients were enrolled in the 2 studies (430 males, 417 females; mean age,19 years; age range, 11–52 years [1 patient was entered into the study at age 11 years, in violation of the protocol]). At 12 weeks, the median percentage changes from baseline in all 3 lesion counts were significantly lower with tazarotene than with vehicle (all, P < 0.001), as were the overall clinical and global responses (both, P < 0.001). Treatment-related AEs whose incidence was higher with tazarotene than with vehicle included desquamation, dry skin, erythema, a burning sensation on the skin, and skin irritation (all, P < 0.001) and pruritus (P < 0.01); most (83%-98%) were mild or moderate. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid was limited (mean, < 0.1 ng/mL) and did not increase with time.

Conclusions

In these 2 studies in adolescent and adult patients with facial acne vulgaris, tazarotene 0.1%cream QD for 12 weeks was effective and well tolerated. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid was limited.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^91609a05]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Various treatments for acne vulgaris exist, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness in relation to acne severity.

Objectives

To identify best treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, published up to May 2020. Outcomes included percentage change in total lesion count from baseline, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool and bias adjustment models. Effects for treatments with ≥ 50 observations each compared with placebo are reported below.

Results

We included 179 RCTs with approximately 35 000 observations across 49 treatment classes. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) [mean difference 26·16%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 16·75–35·36%]; physical – chemical peels, e.g. salicylic or mandelic acid (39·70%, 95% CrI 12·54–66·78%) and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) (35·36%, 95% CrI 17·75–53·08%). Oral pharmacological treatments (e.g. antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives) did not appear to be effective after bias adjustment. BPO and topical retinoids were less well tolerated than placebo. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with lincosamide (clindamycin) (44·43%, 95% CrI 29·20–60·02%); oral pharmacological – isotretinoin of total cumulative dose ≥ 120 mg kg −1 per single course (58·09%, 95% CrI 36·99–79·29%); physical – photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) (40·45%, 95% CrI 26·17–54·11%); combined – BPO with topical retinoid and oral tetracycline (43·53%, 95% CrI 29·49–57·70%). Topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines were less well tolerated than placebo. The quality of included RCTs was moderate to very low, with evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Uncertainty in findings was high, in particular for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence.

Conclusions

Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy were most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy were most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy for which evidence was more limited.

What is already known about this topic?
Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally.
Several topical, oral, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris exist.
Network meta‐analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and allows simultaneous inference for all treatments forming an evidence network.
Previous NMAs have assessed a limited range of treatments for acne vulgaris and have not evaluated effectiveness of treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

What does this study add?
For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light; blue light) are most effective.
For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) are most effective.
Based on these findings, along with further clinical and cost‐effectiveness considerations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations for mild‐to‐moderate acne and fixed topical treatment combinations, or oral tetracyclines combined with topical treatments, for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

### Antibiotic resistance: shifting the paradigm in topical acne treatment [^ff940e54]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Multiple topical therapies are available for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. The role of antibiotics and their resistance in the treatment of acne was reviewed by an expert panel of dermatologists who practice in Canada.

Methods

Prior to the consensus meeting, the panel members filled out a survey on their current practice using topical treatment for acne. A literature review was carried out using information obtained from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, and EMBASE. During a consensus meeting organized at the Spring Dermatology Update on April 27, 2014 in Toronto, ON, the panel had a blind vote on the issues at hand.

Results

The panel reached consensus on: 1) Antibiotics are an integral part of acne treatment not only due to their antibiotic effect but also by their anti-inflammatory action. 2) Oral antibiotics should be used for a short period of time if possible. 3) Topical antibiotics should not be used in monotherapy. 4) Retinoids are effective in reducing antibiotic resistance. 5) A benzoyl peroxide wash is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide in reducing antibiotic resistance. 6) Therapy needs to be re-evaluated in 6–8 weeks versus 12 weeks. The recommendations given by the panel are to be disseminated to both general practitioners and dermatologists.

Conclusion

For mild to moderate acne treatment, topical antibiotics in monotherapy are not to be used but may be combined with a retinoid or BPO to safely achieve more successful outcomes.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^acc15f30]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that may cause psychosocial distress. There is evidence that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying costs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national clinical, public health and social care guidance.

Aim

To assess the cost‐effectiveness of treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne to inform relevant NICE guidance.

Methods

A decision–analytical model compared costs and quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) of effective topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, from the perspective of the National Health Service in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a network meta‐analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion.

Results

All of the assessed treatments were more cost‐effective than treatment with placebo (general practitioner visits without active treatment). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) were most cost‐effective. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin were the most cost‐effective. Results showed uncertainty, as reflected in the wide confidence intervals around mean treatment rankings.

Conclusion

A range of treatments are cost‐effective for the management of acne. Well‐conducted studies are needed to examine the long‐term clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of the full range of acne treatments.

### Management of severe acne vulgaris with topical therapy [^bc7bacc3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (acne) is the most common skin disease we see in dermatology practice. Although rare in childhood, severe acne can affect up to 12% of the adolescent population. A chronic disease, it requires both aggressive management and effective maintenance strategies. Oral antibiotics, in combination with topical agents are recommended for treatment, with topical agents being continued as maintenance therapy to minimize resistance and recurrence. However, concerns with systemic side effects have recently resulted in a greater focus on the potential of fixed combination topical therapies to treat severe acne. Here we review the available clinical evidence. There are no studies investigating the use of fixed combination topical therapy exclusively in severe acne. However, studies assessing the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne include subpopulation data in severe patients. Adapalene 0.3%-benzoyl peroxide (BP) 2.5% was found to be effective in patients with severe acne, whereas the fixed combination with a lower concentration of adapalene (0.1%) was no more effective than vehicle. Clindamycin-BP 1.2%/3.75% gel and clindamycin-BP 1.2%/2.5% gel were both found to be effective in severe acne with an apparent BP-dose response. Clindamycin phosphate 1.2%-tretinoin 0.025% demonstrated similar efficacy in severe acne, but with little benefit over individual monads. Realistic topical treatment options now exist for the management of severe acne where patient and physician preference can impact positive outcomes. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(11):1134–1138. </em>.

### Infant skin-cleansing product versus water: a pilot randomized, assessor-blinded controlled trial [^1c56ddc1]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The main role of the baby's skin is to provide a barrier which prevents infection, the loss of water from the body, and penetration of irritants and allergens. These functions depend on the maintenance of skin integrity and pH balance. Babies are born with a pH of 6.4 which reduces over three to four days to around 4.9. A baby's skin has a less developed epidermal barrier than adults and thus is more prone to damage; recent research suggests that the stratum corneum of infants becomes 'adult-like' only after one year of life. The immaturity of babies' skin creates the potential for a number of skin problems, including atopic eczema, infant Candida, cradle cap, baby acne and napkin dermatitis. These problems emphasize the importance of appropriate skin cleansing routines.

The guidelines, ' Routine postnatal care for women and their babies', in the UK, recommend that cleansing agents added to bathwater should be avoided in the early postnatal period. In contrast, The American Association of Women's Health, Obstetrics and Neonatal Nursing (AWHONN) produced clinical guidelines that recommend the use of warm tap water for routine bathing with the option to use mild cleansers that have a neutral pH (5.5–7.0). However, there is a lack of evidence on which to inform practice for the term newborn baby. A survey of maternity units in the North West of England reported that a wide range of products were used by women. Moreover, a systematic review of skin care regimes, in the well term newborn, revealed no prospective trials that met the authors' inclusion criteria. As such, there are no UK evidence-based guidelines about neonatal skin care.

### How patients experience and manage dryness and irritation from acne treatment [^cb85a7cf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Products that may cause irritation are widely used to treat acne. Irritation has the potential to reduce treatment adherence. How patients manage irritation and dryness is not well characterized.

Objectives

To study self-reported irritation, its impact and coping mechanisms in patients who had been treated for acne with a clindamycin-5% benzoyl peroxide (BPO) product.

Methods

An Internet-based survey of 200 subjects, aged 15–40 years who had used a clindamycin-5% BPO fixed combination product in the last six months on at least 50 percent of their face, at least five days per week.

Results

The majority of subjects (57%) had moderate acne, 28 percent had severe acne. Bothersome side effects of the clindamycin-5% BPO combination included dry skin (55%), flaky/peeling skin (45%), irritated skin (44%), itchy skin (39%) and redness (37%). As a result, subjects used the product only as a spot treatment (33%), only when breakouts seemed worse (28%), or less often than recommended (32%); stopped using from time to time (32%); switched to a different prescription medication and/or an over-the-counter acne product (28%); or stopped using altogether (10%). 41 percent of subjects reported using moisturizers to counteract dryness and redness.

Limitations

We queried patients concerning use of combination clindamycin/BPO products and not other products.

Discussion

Irritation to clindamycin-5% BPO is a common problem that reduces patients' use of the medication. Strategies to improve treatment include communication with patients on possible side effects, providing written instruction on how to manage irritation and dryness and consideration of alternative topical treatments and treatment regimens.

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is not known whether topical administration of tretinoin could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable concentrations in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TWYNEO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TWYNEO or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TWYNEO for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older based on evidence from two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled, 12-week clinical trials and an open-label pharmacokinetic study. A total of 283 pediatric subjects 9 years of age and older received TWYNEO in the clinical studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety and effectiveness of TWYNEO in pediatric patients below 9 years of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of TWYNEO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects.

Conclusion

Early effective treatment for acne improves patient well-being and may prevent permanent scars or pigment changes. Initial management includes a range of topical treatments, with the option of adding oral antibiotics for patients with more severe acne. There are significant opportunities for reducing oral antibiotic prescribing in acne. These include: promoting effective use of topical treatments; avoiding prolonged courses of oral antibiotics; coprescribing topical treatments alongside oral antibiotics; continuing topical treatments as maintenance treatment and considering alternatives, such as the combined contraceptive pill and spironolactone in primary care. When acne is unresponsive to these measures, timely referral for consideration of isotretinoin should be initiated.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^211e9fd7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Various treatments for acne vulgaris exist, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness in relation to acne severity.

Objectives

To identify best treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne, as determined by clinician-assessed morphological features.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne, published up to May 2020. Outcomes included percentage change in total lesion count from baseline, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and discontinuation owing to side-effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and bias adjustment models. Effects for treatments with ≥ 50 observations each compared with placebo are reported below.

Results

We included 179 RCTs with approximately 35000 observations across 49 treatment classes. For mild-to-moderate acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological - combined retinoid with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) [mean difference 26·16%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 16·75–35·36%]; physical - chemical peels, e.g. salicylic or mandelic acid (39·70%, 95% CrI 12·54–66·78%) and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) (35·36%, 95% CrI 17·75–53·08%). Oral pharmacological treatments (e.g. antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives) did not appear to be effective after bias adjustment. BPO and topical retinoids were less well tolerated than placebo. For moderate-to-severe acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological - combined retinoid with lincosamide (clindamycin) (44·43%, 95% CrI 29·20–60·02%); oral pharmacological - isotretinoin of total cumulative dose ≥ 120 mg kg -1 per single course (58·09%, 95% CrI 36·99–79·29%); physical - photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) (40·45%, 95% CrI 26·17–54·11%); combined - BPO with topical retinoid and oral tetracycline (43·53%, 95% CrI 29·49–57·70%). Topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines were less well tolerated than placebo. The quality of included RCTs was moderate to very low, with evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Uncertainty in findings was high, in particular for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence.

Conclusions

Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy were most effective for mild-to-moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy were most effective for moderate-to-severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy for which evidence was more limited. What is already known about this topic? Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally. Several topical, oral, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris exist. Network meta-analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and allows simultaneous inference for all treatments forming an evidence network. Previous NMAs have assessed a limited range of treatments for acne vulgaris and have not evaluated effectiveness of treatments for moderate-to-severe acne. What does this study add? For mild-to-moderate acne, topical treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light; blue light) are most effective. For moderate-to-severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) are most effective. Based on these findings, along with further clinical and cost-effectiveness considerations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends, as first-line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations for mild-to-moderate acne and fixed topical treatment combinations, or oral tetracyclines combined with topical treatments, for moderate-to-severe acne.

Clinical features and diagnosis

The diagnosis of acne is made on the clinical history and examination. There are no diagnostic criteria and the skin lesions seen are open comedones (whiteheads), closed comedones (blackheads), papules/nodules, cysts and scarring. There is no strong evidence base for different treatments for different acne subtypes (comedonal vs inflammatory), and NICE and most other guidelines provide different guidance on the basis of severity rather than acne subtypes. While classifications vary, the majority of acne is mild, with moderate or severe acne combined making up less than 15% of cases of acne. See table 2 for severity classifications and linked treatment choices.

### Optimizing topical combination therapy for the treatment of acne vulgaris [^2cb8b11a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Given the multifactorial and complex contributors to acne development, combination therapy is standard of care. By addressing multiple pathogenic factors, combination therapy provides a quicker and more efficacious treatment outcome than monotherapy. Topical retinoids normalize follicular keratinocyte differentiation and are anti-inflammatory. Their use is limited by the potential for cutaneous irritation. Antimicrobials reduce Propionibacterium acnes colonization on the skin and reduce the bacteria's proinflammatory effects. Topical antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) are commonly employed in fixed-dose combination products or two separate medications. BPO has the added benefit of being comedolytic and can minimize the risk for bacterial antibiotic resistance. Like topical retinoids, BPO may cause skin irritation, burning, erythema, and peeling. Managing cutaneous side effects when using multiple products that cause irritation can be a challenge. Careful product selection, dose titration, and patient-directed regimens can help to optimize outcomes. This review presents the latest data on two topical acne products that have demonstrated excellent efficacy and tolerability profiles. In addition, their in vitro profiles suggest the potential for combination use, affording greater dosing flexibility.

### Optimizing the use of topical retinoids in Asian acne patients [^117ba3a0]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Using Topical Retinoids in Skin of Color

The first step in optimizing retinoid use in patients with skin of color is to assess the patient's skin‐care regimen and recommend a gentle cleanser and moisturizer. 43 We find that being able to discuss skin care helps to impress upon the patient that the clinician has a strong professional interest in optimizing acne management. 44 Callender 43 recommends avoiding irritating products, particularly in individuals with a history of dry/sensitive skin, other dermatological diseases (eczema, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, xerosis) or reactions to previous therapy. Having a staff member available to educate the patient on what practises to avoid – frequent washing, overly aggressive washing with a buff‐puff or loofah scrub – is also useful. 43

### Effects of topical retinoids on acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with skin of color: a clinical review and implications for practice [^e1214a5a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinician Education

Continued educational efforts are needed to address some of the key challenges of assessing hyperpigmentation in patients with SOC, as described below.
Hyperpigmentation versus erythema. Acne sequelae include both hyperpigmentation and erythema. Hyperpigmentation (due to overproduction of melanin) is typically described as being brown or black in color, while erythema (due to capillary damage near the skin surface) is described as being red or purple. The perception of color differences vary across different skin tones, and distinguishing erythema from hyperpigmentation in higher phototypes may pose challenges for some clinicians.
Subclinical inflammation and persistent hyperpigmentation. Conventional models of acne pathogenesis usually describe follicular hyperkeratinization (i.e. microcomedone formation) as the first step in the development of acne lesions, with eventual progression to visible inflammatory lesions. However, a study using biopsied skin samples from acne and non-acne patients showed that inflammatory processes (e.g. increased expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1, upregulation of interleukin-1) are likely involved in the very earliest stages of acne development, prior to the hyperproliferative changes that are seen in visible lesions. This type of inflammation is described as 'subclinical' because it occurs before the appearance of visible acne lesions. Moreover, hyperpigmentation due (at least in part) to subclinical inflammation may be considered 'persistent' rather than post-inflammatory because the underlying inflammatory factors may still be present. Regardless of whether the mechanism is persistent or post-inflammatory, topical retinoids are likely to improve hyperpigmentation, whether administered alone or in combination with other treatments.
Efficacy versus adverse effects. Some retinoid effects can be either beneficial or harmful, depending on each patient's particular circumstance (e.g. skin type sensitivity, history of scarring, treatment goals). For example, transient peeling and scaling are common after retinoid treatment is initiated. In some patients, these effects may be considered a desirable exfoliating property of the retinoid — one that helps make skin color more even. In others, these effects may be too drying or irritating, possibly causing unwanted post-inflammatory responses that make hyperpigmented lesions or patches worse than before treatment. Retinoids can also result in an overall lightening of the skin, which some patients want and others do not. Asking patients specific questions about their skin (e.g. normal, oily, dry, combination), skincare and haircare products (e.g. pomades, cosmetics, moisturizers), cleansing methods, and history of irritation with topical medications can help determine the best approach for retinoid treatment.

### Topical antibacterial treatments for acne vulgaris: comparative review and guide to selection [^0e7cee00]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Topical antibacterial agents are an essential part of the armamentarium for treating acne vulgaris. They are indicated for mild-to-moderate acne, and are a useful alternative for patients who cannot take systemic antibacterials. Topical antibacterials such as clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline are bacteriostatic for Propionibacterium acnes, and have also been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory activities through inhibition of lipase production by P. acnes, as well as inhibition of leukocyte chemotaxis. Benzoyl peroxide is a non-antibiotic antibacterial agent that is bactericidal against P. acnes and has the distinct advantage that thus far, no resistance has been detected against it. Combined agents such as erythromycin/zinc, erythromycin/tretinoin, erythromycin/isotretinoin, erythromycin/benzoyl peroxide, and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide are increasingly being used and have been proven to be effective. They generally demonstrate good overall tolerability and are useful in reducing the development of antibacterial resistance in P. acnes. The selection of a topical antibacterial agent should be tailored for specific patients by choosing an agent that matches the patient's skin characteristics and acne type. Topical antibacterial agents should generally not be used for extended periods beyond 3 months, and topical antibacterials should ideally not be combined with systemic antibacterial therapy for acne; in particular, the use of topical and systemic antibacterials is to be avoided as far as possible.

### Emerging topical antimicrobial options for mild-to-moderate acne: a review of the clinical evidence [^6eb6adf6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical antimicrobial agents are commonly used as first-line agents for the management of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Agents with antibacterial activity (eg, benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin), reduce counts of Propionibacterium acnes, while also decreasing the numbers of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions. In order to optimize efficacy, topical antibiotics are most commonly used in combination with benzoyl peroxide, an approach which also reduces the emergence of strains of P acnes that are less sensitive to antibiotics. Other topical antiacne options include retinoids (with or without an antimicrobial agent), sulfacetamide, sulfacetamide-sulfur, and azelaic acid. Certain formulations of benzoyl peroxide offer improved tolerability, while a new micronized form may enhance efficacy by optimizing follicular penetration. This wide array of options allows dermatologists to tailor topical treatments to the needs of individual patients.

### Tretinoin 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide 3% cream for the treatment of facial acne vulgaris [^585cbf8c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical application of tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris.

Data Sources

A systematic review of the literature was performed using the terms Twyneo OR tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide OR S6G5T-3 in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to obtain completed clinical trial results not published elsewhere.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All human studies published in English prior to November 2022 related to pharmacology, clinical trials, safety, and efficacy were evaluated for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

In two 12-week, phase 3, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream significantly reduced inflammatory and noninflammatory facial acne lesions and significantly improved Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) rating to clear or almost clear. The cream has a suitable safety profile, with application site pain and dryness as the most common adverse events.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice In Comparison To Existing Agents

Tretinoin-BPO had similar IGA success compared to other topical retinoid and retinoid-BPO treatments for acne vulgaris. Compared to individual tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide therapy, the combination product streamlines application, which will improve medication adherence; however, the cost of tretinoin-BPO cream may be prohibitive.

Conclusions

Tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream is safe and effective for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. Long-term trial data on efficacy and tolerability are not yet available.

### Treatment of acne vulgaris in pregnant patients [^4398985a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

The management of acne vulgaris in the setting of pregnancy raises important clinical considerations regarding the efficacy and safety of acne treatments in this special patient population. Particular challenges include the absence of safety data, discrepancy in safety data between different safety rating systems, and lack of evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of acne during pregnancy. Nonetheless, many therapeutic options exist, and the treatment of acne in pregnant women can be safely and often effectively accomplished. For mild or moderate disease, patients can be treated with topical antimicrobial agents, anti-inflammatory agents, as well as glycolic and salicylic acid. Several topical agents, notably benzoyl peroxide, previously viewed as potentially dangerous are cited by many sources as being considered safe. When necessary, systemic therapies that can be safely added include penicillins, amoxicillin, cephalosporins, erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracyclines or sulfonamides, depending on the stage of fetal development. Adjunct therapy may include phototherapy or laser treatments. Physicians should work with this often highly motivated, safety-conscious patient population to tailor an individualized treatment regimen. This treatment regimen will likely shift throughout the different stages of fetal development, as distinct safety considerations are raised prior to conception as well as during each of the trimesters of pregnancy. Important considerations regarding acne management in breast-feeding mothers is also discussed.

### Racial / ethnic variations in acne: implications for treatment and skin care recommendations for acne patients with skin of color [^4a5bd54f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is among the most common dermatologic diagnoses observed, including skin color (SOC) populations. This project sought to help clarify the existing published data and provide consensus statements on acne presentation, prevention, treatment, and maintenance in SOC populations to help improve patient outcomes.

Methods

Six SOC dermatologists convened for a virtual meeting and used a modified Delphi process to address: 1) Are there racial/ethnic differences in the clinical presentation and sequela of acne? 2) Are there racial/ethnic differences in the therapeutic endpoint of acne treatment and patient expectations? 3) Is there a need for specialized approaches to therapeutic options and skincare in acne patients with SOC? The results of a literature review and the outcome of discussions, coupled with the panel's expert opinion and experience, are intended for health care providers caring for acne patients and clinician-researchers.

Results

Racial/ethnic differences in the clinical presentation, sequelae, and desired treatment outcomes for acne have been reported. Notwithstanding limitations in the number, size, and methodologies of studies to date, the available data suggest that strategies that improve outcomes in acne patients with SOC include: Early initiation and maintenance of treatment regimens and careful consideration of tolerability of active ingredients, vehicles, and dosing. Using pH-balanced, non-irritating cleansers and non-comedogenic ceramides containing moisturizers help minimize irritation or dryness.

Conclusions

There a need for specialized approaches to therapeutic options and skincare in acne patients with SOC. OTC skincare products are recommended before and during prescription therapy and as part of a maintenance regimen.

### Choosing the right partner: complementing prescription acne medication with over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers [^724b86e1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is the most common dermatological disorder. An impaired barrier function in acne vulgaris has been reported, as well as decreased amounts of epidermal ceramides. Also, many of the systemic and topical medications prescribed for the treatment of acne exacerbate these skin barrier disruptions and can lead to irritation and dry skin conditions.

Aim

The review explored the importance of maximizing adjunctive skincare, such as over-the-counter products for managing acne and avoiding adverse effects.

Methods

A literature review was conducted and included clinical acne guidelines, clinical studies, and review articles on acne prevention, treatment, and maintenance. Searches were made in PubMed and Google Scholar for English-language literature published between Jan 1, 2010, and Apr 1, 2020. Two clinicians manually reviewed selected publications.

Results

Seventy-four articles were included in the analyses. A variety of specialized cleansers and moisturizers are available as suitable adjunctive therapies for acne-prone skin. Lipid-free cleansers were found to be the most appropriate type of cleanser for acne-prone skin as they were associated with a low risk of skin irritation, and a near-physiological stratum corneum pH. Moisturizers typically included ingredients such as humectants, emollients, oil absorbers, and those with anti-inflammatory and/or barrier replenishing properties. Given the various adjunctive products available, decision frameworks were created for clinicians to use when selecting over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers for acne-prone patients.

Conclusion

Informing clinicians about skin barrier dysfunction in acne and the benefits of adjunctive skincare may help them to choose the right product(s) to complement prescription therapy. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(11): doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.5536.

### Effects of topical retinoids on acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with skin of color: a clinical review and implications for practice [^8bf8e24e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Irritation and Skin Care

The goal of treatment is to maximize efficacy while minimizing irritation and other side effects. Irritation can exacerbate hyperpigmentation in patients with SOC, but measures can be taken to offset this risk. First, newer retinoid formulations (e.g. lower-concentration lotions for tretinoin and tazarotene) may be less irritating than older gel or cream formulations, while offering the same level of efficacy. These newer formulations counter the misconception that irritation is a sign that the retinoid is working. Second, patients should avoid toners and astringents that can overly dry the skin and increase irritation. Patients should also avoid haircare and cosmetic products that contain comedogenic ingredients. Finally, use of a pH-balanced cleanser and non-comedogenic moisturizer can be helpful. Many dermatologists have been trained to recommend that moisturizers be applied after retinoids. However, results from a percutaneous penetration study of azelaic acid using human skin samples and a clinical trial of clindamycin/phosphate and tretinoin 0.05% gel in acne patients suggest that moisturizers that increase hydration and improve barrier function may be applied before topical treatment without affecting absorption. For patients with sensitive skin, applying moisturizer before the retinoid may help reduce irritation.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^8063a720]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globallyand a common presentation to dermatologists. Acne may have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. A network meta‐analysis (NMA), assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments, found that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying treatment costs, including drug acquisition, time of the healthcare professional [HCP; general practitioner (GP) or specialist dermatologist] and special equipment. Evidence on the cost‐effectiveness of acne treatments is currently lacking. Thus, our study objective was to examine the cost‐effectiveness of effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England, using decision–analytical economic modelling.

This economic analysis informed the development of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for the management of acne in England.NICE considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national guidance for health and social care services. The guideline was developed by a committee of clinical academics, HCPs and service users with expertise and experience in acne. The committee contributed to the development of the economic model by providing advice on the natural history of acne and its treatment patterns in England, and on model assumptions where evidence was lacking.

### Preadolescent moderate acne vulgaris: a randomized trial of the efficacy and safety of topical adapalene-benzoyl peroxides [^04c9df91]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of adapalene 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel (adapalene-BPO) in patients 9–11 years old with acne vulgaris. < BR >

Methods

Enrolled subjects were male or female, with a score of 3 (moderate) on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale. Subjects were randomized to receive adapalene-BPO or vehicle once daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated by success rate (percentage of subjects rated "clear" or "almost clear") at each visit, median percentage changes from baseline in total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts at each visit, the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (C DLQI) at baseline and week 12, and the Parent Assessment of Acne at week 12. Safety was assessed through evaluations of adverse events (AEs) and local tolerability [erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning on scales ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe)]. < BR >

Results

A total of 142 subjects were randomized to adapalene-BPO and 143 to vehicle. At study endpoint (week 12), adapalene-BPO was significantly superior to vehicle regarding treatment success (49.3% vs 15.9%, respectively), and regarding percentage reduction in total lesion counts (68.6% vs 19.3%), inflammatory (63.2% vs 14.3%), and non-inflammatory lesion counts (70.7% vs 14.6%) (all P < .001). More subjects using adapalene-BPO reported that their acne had no effect on their quality of life, and parents noted that their child's acne significantly improved. Adapalene-BPO was well tolerated, with mean tolerability scores less than 1 (mild). < BR >

Conclusions

In preadolescents with acne, adapalene-BPO leads to significantly superior treatment success and lesion count reduction compared to vehicle.

### Treatment of acne in pregnancy [^6a70f4a0]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common disease of the pilosebaceous unit and affects adolescents and adults. Because high-quality guidelines regarding treatment of acne in pregnancy are scarce, management of this condition can be challenging. We describe the safety profile of common therapies and outline approaches based on available evidence. Topical azelaic acid or benzoyl peroxide can be recommended as baseline therapy. A combination of topical erythromycin or clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide is recommended for inflammatory acne. Oral erythromycin or cephalexin is generally considered safe for moderate to severe inflammatory acne when used for a few weeks. A short course of oral prednisolone may be useful for treating fulminant nodular cystic acne after the first trimester. In general, topical and oral antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy, but combined with topical benzoyl peroxide to decrease bacterial resistance. Oral retinoids are teratogenic and absolutely contraindicated for women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy. Although some complementary therapies including micronutrients and nonpharmacologic treatments seem to be well tolerated, limited data exist regarding their safety and efficacy, and they are not currently recommended during pregnancy. The risk-to-benefit ratio, efficacy, acceptability, and costs are considerations when choosing a treatment for acne in pregnancy.

### New developments in topical acne therapy [^f5cd03b3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory disease with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Although myriad acne treatments are available, current options may not be sufficient because of a lack of efficacy, limited tolerability, or burden of cost to patients. In this review, we highlight recently approved topical acne treatments, as well as those currently in clinical trials. Novel formulations of tretinoin, tazarotene, and minocycline provide modifications of and improvements to existing products. Trifarotene, a novel fourth-generation retinoid, has demonstrated improved tolerability compared with existing topical retinoids. Clascoterone is a novel first-in-class antiandrogen that topically addresses the hormonal etiology of acne. The late-phase clinical trials pipeline consists of agents with bactericidal and anti-sebum mechanisms. Although it is evident that acne treatments continue to evolve, it is important to recognize the need for further comparative studies among new and existing agents to define optimal treatment algorithms that address not only safety and efficacy but also cost-effective care.
