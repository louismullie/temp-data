## Question

What are the diagnostic criteria for diabetic chronic kidney disease in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for diabetic chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching definition of chronic kidney disease and how it applies in diabetes. Then, I should verify the two core diagnostic markers, albuminuria and reduced eGFR, and the thresholds that matter. Next, I will confirm the chronicity requirement and the need for repeat testing. After that, I should consider how to attribute CKD to diabetes versus other causes, including the role of retinopathy and atypical features. Finally, I will integrate staging, screening cadence, and when to consider kidney biopsy, and I will double-check any numeric thresholds to ensure accuracy before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't jump to conclusions: chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for at least 3 months with implications for health, which in diabetes typically manifests as persistent albuminuria and/or a sustained reduction in eGFR, and this framework underpins both KDIGO and ADA guidance, so I should anchor to that before proceeding.

> I will now examine the first diagnostic pillar, albuminuria, and I need to ensure I get the thresholds right. Moderately increased albuminuria is defined as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30–300 mg/g, and severely increased albuminuria as greater than 300 mg/g, and importantly, these categories replace the older micro- and macroalbuminuria terminology, so I should use A2 and A3 consistently. Wait, let me verify the confirmation strategy: because of substantial biological variability, diagnosis should be based on at least two of three abnormal results over a 3–6 month period, which is standard in contemporary guidelines and reviews [^114vTv3f] [^111G8kXr].

> Next, I should review the second diagnostic pillar, reduced eGFR, and I need to check the threshold. A sustained eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for at least 3 months meets CKD criteria, and I should confirm that this applies regardless of albuminuria status, since a meaningful subset of people with type 2 diabetes have reduced eGFR without albuminuria. Hold on, I should verify that this is indeed recognized in high-quality sources; yes, KDIGO and ADA both acknowledge nonalbuminuric CKD in diabetes, reinforcing the need to consider eGFR independently [^112XjFE7] [^114LsktC].

> Now, I need to ensure the chronicity requirement is explicit and actionable. Both markers must be persistent for at least 3 months to establish CKD, and given intraindividual variability in albumin excretion, repeating testing is essential to avoid misclassification. I should double-check that this repeat-testing principle is emphasized in recent guidance; it is reiterated in KDIGO and in summaries of ADA-aligned practice, so I will keep that confirmation step front and center [^112XjFE7] [^111G8kXr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality; I should confirm how to attribute CKD to diabetes rather than another primary kidney disease. In most patients with diabetes, CKD can be attributed to diabetes when macroalbuminuria is present, or when microalbuminuria coexists with diabetic retinopathy, or in longstanding type 1 diabetes, acknowledging that type 2 diabetes often presents late and the onset is uncertain. But wait, what if features are atypical? I need to check for red flags such as absence of retinopathy, rapid eGFR decline, active urinary sediment, nephrotic-range proteinuria, or systemic clues, which should prompt evaluation for nondiabetic etiologies and, in selected cases, kidney biopsy. I should confirm that biopsy is the gold standard when the diagnostic yield outweighs risks, which KDIGO supports [^113eBjRm] [^111u8JAC] [^111LFm3T].

> Let me consider staging and risk stratification, because diagnosis is not enough; I need to ensure prognosis is captured. CKD is staged by GFR categories G1–G5 and albuminuria categories A1–A3, and the KDIGO heat map integrates both to estimate progression risk, which guides follow-up intensity and referral decisions. I should confirm that this CGA framework is the current standard; yes, KDIGO 2022 and 2024 endorse Cause–GFR–Albuminuria classification and the color-coded risk grid for decision-making [^114vTv3f] [^111bN71G].

> Next, I should review screening cadence and initiation, and I need to be precise. For type 2 diabetes, annual screening with spot UACR and serum creatinine–based eGFR should begin at diagnosis, because CKD is often already present, whereas for type 1 diabetes it begins after 5 years. I initially thought "every 1–4 times per year" applied to all with established DKD, but wait, I should verify the exact wording; ADA 2025 recommends monitoring urinary albumin and eGFR 1–4 times per year in established diabetic kidney disease depending on stage, which aligns with risk-adapted follow-up. KDIGO similarly supports annual screening in diabetes with risk-based adjustments for repeat testing [^115kSSuS] [^113GYKVn] [^115vkPop].

> I should confirm when to escalate to biopsy or specialist referral so I don't miss important exceptions. Indications include atypical features suggesting nondiabetic disease, rapidly declining kidney function, refractory hypertension, or uncertainty in diagnosis, and biopsy is the gold standard when the expected information changes management. Let me reconsider whether any numeric triggers are specified; yes, many guidelines suggest referral thresholds such as eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or severely increased albuminuria, but I should emphasize that these are pragmatic and should be integrated with clinical judgment and patient preferences [^111LFm3T] [^117R5P3C] [^1124oZBQ].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my final synthesis is concise and accurate. Diabetic chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes is diagnosed when there is persistent albuminuria of at least 30 mg/g on at least two of three tests over 3–6 months and/or a sustained eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for at least 3 months, with attribution to diabetes supported by the clinical context and exclusion of atypical features, and disease staged by GFR and albuminuria categories to inform risk and follow-up. I need to ensure the numeric thresholds and confirmation strategy are explicit, which they are per KDIGO and ADA-aligned summaries [^112XjFE7] [^114vTv3f] [^111G8kXr].

The diagnosis of diabetic chronic kidney disease (DCKD) in type 2 diabetes requires **persistent albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g) and/or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for at least 3 months** [^112XjFE7] [^114vTv3f], with confirmation by repeat testing due to variability [^112cYWvN]. Screening should start at T2D diagnosis and be repeated annually [^115kSSuS] [^115vkPop]; if abnormal, confirm with two additional tests over 3–6 months [^111G8kXr]. DCKD is most likely when albuminuria coexists with diabetic retinopathy or long-standing diabetes, whereas atypical features (rapid eGFR decline, active urinary sediment, or absence of retinopathy) warrant evaluation for non-diabetic CKD [^113eBjRm] [^111u8JAC]. Staging uses GFR and albuminuria categories to guide risk and management [^114vTv3f] [^111bN71G].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for DCKD

According to KDIGO and ADA, **DCKD is diagnosed** when the following criteria are met:

- **Albuminuria**: Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) confirmed on at least two occasions over 3–6 months [^112XjFE7] [^111G8kXr].

- **Reduced eGFR**: eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² sustained for ≥ 3 months, irrespective of albuminuria [^112XjFE7] [^114LsktC].

- **Chronicity**: Abnormalities must persist for ≥ 3 months to distinguish chronic disease from acute kidney injury or transient changes [^112XjFE7] [^114vTv3f].

---

## Screening and confirmation

- **Initial screening**: Annual screening with UACR and serum creatinine-based eGFR for all patients with T2D, starting at diagnosis [^115kSSuS] [^115vkPop].

- **Confirmation**: If UACR ≥ 30 mg/g or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², repeat testing within 3–6 months to confirm persistence [^111G8kXr] [^112cYWvN].

- **Frequency**: Increase monitoring to 1–4 times/year in established DCKD based on stage and risk [^113GYKVn] [^111XL8Yu].

---

## Clinical features supporting DCKD diagnosis

Certain clinical features **support attributing CKD to diabetes**:

- **Diabetic retinopathy**: Presence of retinopathy strongly supports DCKD, especially with macroalbuminuria [^113eBjRm] [^114ceKbp].

- **Long-standing diabetes**: Duration of diabetes ≥ 10 years increases likelihood of DCKD [^113eBjRm].

- **Gradual progression**: Typical DCKD shows slowly progressive albuminuria and eGFR decline [^114LsktC].

---

## Differentiating DCKD from non-diabetic CKD

Atypical features should prompt evaluation for **non-diabetic CKD**:

| **Atypical feature** | **Indication for further evaluation** |
|-|-|
| Rapid decline in eGFR (> 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) | Suspect non-diabetic CKD |
| Active urinary sediment (dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts) | Suspect glomerulonephritis |
| Absence of diabetic retinopathy with macroalbuminuria | Suspect non-diabetic CKD |
| Nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria > 3.5 g/day) | Suspect non-diabetic glomerulopathy |
| Hematuria (excluding menstrual contamination) | Suspect non-diabetic CKD |

---

## Staging of DCKD

DCKD is staged using the **KDIGO CGA classification**, incorporating Cause, GFR (G1–G5), and Albuminuria (A1–A3) categories [^114vTv3f]:

| **GFR category** | **eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m²)** | **Albuminuria category** | **UACR (mg/g)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| G1 | ≥ 90 | A1 | < 30 |
| G2 | 60–89 | A2 | 30–300 |
| G3a | 45–59 | A3 | > 300 |
| G3b | 30–44 | ∅ | ∅ |
| G4 | 15–29 | ∅ | ∅ |
| G5 | < 15 | ∅ | ∅ |

---

This classification informs **risk stratification and management decisions** [^111bN71G].

---

## Role of kidney biopsy

Kidney biopsy is **not routine** and is reserved for atypical presentations or when non-diabetic CKD is suspected. Indications include rapid eGFR decline, active urinary sediment, nephrotic syndrome, or suspicion of alternative glomerular disease [^111LFm3T] [^111u8JAC].

---

## Summary of diagnostic algorithm

- **Screen**: Annual UACR and eGFR in all T2D patients [^115kSSuS] [^115vkPop].

- **Confirm**: Repeat abnormal results in 3–6 months to ensure persistence [^111G8kXr] [^112cYWvN].

- **Attribute**: Consider DCKD likely with albuminuria plus retinopathy or long-standing diabetes; evaluate for non-diabetic CKD if atypical features are present [^113eBjRm] [^111u8JAC].

- **Stage**: Use GFR and albuminuria categories to guide risk and management [^114vTv3f] [^111bN71G].

---

The diagnosis of DCKD in T2D relies on **persistent albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR**, confirmed on repeat testing, with clinical features and exclusion of atypical findings guiding attribution to diabetes versus other causes.

Introduction

Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the USA, diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of kidney failure. The presence of concomitant CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with significantly increased risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attacks, and all-cause mortality, when compared with the risk in patients with T2D without CKD. Therapies exist that can slow the progression of CKD in persons with diabetes; therefore, early detection and intervention for CKD is important.

In this review, we assess the burden of CKD in US patients with T2D and describe how clinicians can use early screening and diagnosis, together with guideline-recommended management strategies provided by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), to optimize patient outcomes. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

Additionally, we adhered to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines in conducting this systematic review and meta-analysis (Supplementary File 1).

Inclusion criteria

Studies included in this review focused on adult patients aged 18 years or older with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, conducted within healthcare settings in Ethiopia. The research encompassed cohort studies, either retrospective or prospective, published between 2010 and 2025, including both published and unpublished articles from electronic repositories, with no language restrictions. Eligible studies defined diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by persistent macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/day or > 300 mg/g creatinine), declining kidney function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² sustained for at least 3 months), and/or structural kidney damage due to chronic hyperglycemia and metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, only studies with a low to moderate risk of bias, as assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) criteria, were included.

Exclusion criteria

Studies were excluded if they: (1) employed cross-sectional, case-control, or purely qualitative designs; (2) did not clearly define the diagnostic criteria for diabetic kidney disease; or (3) demonstrated a high risk of bias based on the quality assessment.

Information source

The databases, including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, were searched to identify relevant articles. Additionally, dissertations and university library repositories were included in the search, covering relevant publications from 2010 to March 10, 2025.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are the clinical needs? [^113EWmme]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Renal disease is prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. Aggressive metabolic control and lowering of systemic and/or intraglomerular blood pressure are effective interventions but not without side effects. Thus a better, early identification of patients at risk for incidence or progression to end-stage renal failure by the use of new, validated biomarkers is highly desirable. In the majority of patients, hypertension and hyperglycaemia are pathogenetically important pathways for the progression of renal disease. Nonetheless even aggressive therapy targeting these factors does not eliminate the risk of end-stage renal failure and experimental evidence suggests that many other pathways (e.g. tubulointerstitial hypoxia or inflammation etc.) also contribute. As their individual importance might vary from patient to patient, interventions which interfere are likely not to be therapeutically effective in all subjects. In this situation, an option to preserve the statistical power of clinical trials is to rely on biomarkers that reflect individual pathophysiology. In current clinical practice, albuminuria is the biomarker that has been best evaluated to guide stratified/personalized therapy but there is a clear need to expand our diagnostic abilities.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112cYWvN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes — Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in people with diabetes — clinical features: CKD in people with diabetes is usually a clinical diagnosis made based on the presence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR in the absence of signs or symptoms of other primary causes of kidney damage, with typical presentation including long-standing diabetes, retinopathy, albuminuria without gross hematuria, and gradually progressive loss of eGFR. Reduced eGFR without albuminuria has been frequently reported in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is becoming more common over time.

What is diabetic kidney disease and what do we know so far about its clinical presentation?

Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the USA and worldwide. An estimated 422 million adults are living with diabetes globally, and up to 40% of them may develop CKD during their lifetime. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) does not reflect a specific pathological phenotype. In fact, it can be diagnosed clinically based on the presence of persistent albuminuria, sustained reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or both in patients with diabetes. DKD is usually identified after five years of the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, while it can be recognized at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy typically correlates with ongoing DKD in patients with albuminuria. Even though a kidney biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of DKD, this procedure is usually considered when an alternative diagnosis suspected.

Albuminuria has more recently been classified into moderate (30 to 300 mg/g) or severe (> 300 mg/g). Nonetheless, any degree of albuminuria has been associated with an increased risk for CKD progression, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes, and mortality in patients with diabetes. A reduced eGFR in diabetic patients has been observed in the absence of albuminuria; however, the progression of DKD appears to be slower in these individuals. Furthermore, the combined presence of albuminuria and lower eGFR independently increases the risks for cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals with diabetes. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend that all diabetic patients undergo annual screening by checking serum creatinine-based eGFR and urine tests to evaluate for albuminuria.

Screening Enables Early Diagnosis OF CKD

Chronic kidney disease is asymptomatic in its early stages and is diagnosed via estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which assesses kidney function, and detection of albuminuria, a marker for kidney damage. The ADA 2020 Standards of Care recommend that patients with newly diagnosed T2D should be screened for CKD with urinary albumin (e.g. spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) testing and eGFR. They should then be retested annually thereafter, with the frequency of retesting driven by the level of kidney damage and function (Fig. 1). For patients with a UACR > 30 mg/g albumin/creatinine, and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², monitoring should be performed twice annually to guide therapy. Of note, in 2013 the American College of Physicians made the recommendation that patients with T2D and CKD (stage 1–3) receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) did not need to undergo annual testing for proteinuria. This recommendation has been retired, and therefore it is important that primary care providers (PCPs) take note of this change and adjust their practice accordingly. Based on the ADA guidelines, patients with stage 1–3 CKD should be screened between one and three times annually based on their level of albuminuria (Fig. 1).

The preferred method for assessment of albuminuria is the UACR, measured in a random spot urine collection. This method of assessment is easy to perform compared with a 24-h urine collection, which is inconvenient for patients and subject to incomplete collection. Concurrent measurement of urinary creatinine ensures that variations in albumin concentration due to hydration levels do not confound the result. A positive diagnosis of increased urinary albumin excretion, defined as ≥ 30 mg/g albumin/creatinine, should only be made when two of three samples collected over a 3- to 6-month period exceed that threshold.

### Importance of early screening and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113TnRmD]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

It is estimated that one in ten people in the USA have diabetes. Approximately 40% of those with diabetes also develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), which in turn increases their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and concomitant CKD are provided by several medical societies, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA), but in real life are only carried out in fewer than 50% of individuals for whom they are recommended. Screening for CKD is recommended using the spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate in all patients with T2D at the time of diagnosis, and at least annually thereafter. Screening enables early CKD diagnosis, counseling, pharmacologic intervention and, when appropriate, referral to a nephrologist. The ADA guidelines recommend good glycemic and blood pressure control and the use of medications that are kidney protective. Medications shown to slow progression of CKD include renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and, more recently, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Novel agents with different mechanisms of action are also in development that have the potential to further slow or prevent disease progression when used with currently recommended therapies.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112VFwDP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — diabetic kidney disease (DKD) terminology and clinical characterization — For consistency with chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification, the term DKD is proposed for a presumptive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabetes, and the term "diabetic nephropathy" should be replaced by DKD; the term diabetic glomerulopathy should be reserved for biopsy-proven kidney disease caused by diabetes. DKD is now defined, in part, by increased urinary albumin excretion and is divided into microalbuminuria, a modest elevation associated with stable kidney function but a greater risk of macroalbuminuria and kidney failure, and macroalbuminuria, a higher elevation associated with progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased systemic blood pressure, and a high risk of kidney failure. These generalizations do not apply in all cases because people with normal urinary albumin excretion may have advanced DKD, whereas those with microalbuminuria may have either substantial or no pathological evidence of kidney damage; because diabetes is highly prevalent, some individuals with diabetes may have other types of CKD, although in most cases, clinical measures may be used to diagnose DKD.

Adapted from de Boer et al. under a CC-BY license

Early identification and management of CKD is needed to prevent CKD progression and CV events. CKD treatment guidelines provide recommendations about how and when to screen for CKD as well as test result thresholds for referrals, and the relevance of these recommendations has been reported previously. However, many clinical practices have not incorporated these recommendations. Early detection, usually within the primary care setting, reduces the risk of progression and risk of requiring kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation), which is expensive and can have significant health status and quality-of-life implications for a patient.

Primary care clinicians typically focus on managing modifiable risk factors in patients with T2DM and CKD, including blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and albuminuria, as well as monitoring kidney function and coordinating care. However, it is typically the role of specialists, such as nephrologists, to consider treatment and associated CV risk in patients with advanced CKD. Patient transition from primary to secondary specialist care usually occurs following referral from a primary care clinician; therefore, the latter are often considered gatekeepers to further care. When a patient with T2DM visits their primary care clinician, if all confirmatory kidney screening tests point to CKD, they should be referred to a nephrologist, particularly when the test results show UACR > 300 mg/g and/or eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Although the criteria for when this should happen are included in the ADA-KDIGO 2022 consensus report (Fig. 1), it is important to consider the practitioner's comfort level with the management and treatment of these patients.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in chronic kidney disease [^1139g4rs]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally.DKD is characterized by albuminuria and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which are independent risk factors for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), cardiovascular events, and death. However, some patients with diabetes develop reduced eGFR with minimal or no albuminuria and retain the risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moreover, kidney biopsy data among patients with DKD indicate variability in histopathological findings and overlap with non-diabetic disease processes. With advancements in diabetes care and therapeutics, the prevalence of kidney disease among patients with diabetes has stabilized around 35%, and the incidence of acute cardiovascular events among patients with diabetes has decreased by over 50%. Nevertheless, the absolute number of patients with diabetes is rising, with an anticipated global prevalence of 7.7% by 2030. The impending burden of diabetes, in the context of the obesity epidemic, will likely affect younger patients with more time at risk to develop kidney disease and its complications. In this review, we describe the management of type 2 diabetes in CKD, highlight important aspects of clinical practice guidelines, and discuss the evidence that supports modern practice.

### Making an impact on kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: the importance of screening for albuminuria [^11632b3r]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Albuminuria is useful for early screening and diagnosis of kidney impairment, especially in people with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), associated with increased mortality, poor cardiovascular outcomes, and high economic burden. Identifying patients with CKD who are most likely to progress to ESKD permits timely implementation of appropriate interventions. The early stages of CKD are asymptomatic, which means identification of CKD relies on routine assessment of kidney damage and function. Both albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate are measures of kidney function. This review discusses albuminuria as a marker of kidney damage and cardiorenal risk, highlights the importance of early screening and routine testing for albuminuria in people with T2D, and provides new insights on the optimum management of CKD in T2D using albuminuria as a target in a proposed algorithm. Elevated urine albumin can be used to detect CKD in people with T2D and monitor its progression; however, obstacles preventing early detection exist, including lack of awareness of CKD in the general population, poor adherence to clinical guidelines, and country-level variations in screening and treatment incentives. With albuminuria being used as an entry criterion and a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure in clinical trials, and with novel treatment interventions available to prevent CKD progression, there is an urgent need for early screening and diagnosis of kidney function decline in people with T2D or pre-diabetes.

### Importance of early screening and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112iU9dc]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite guideline recommendations to screen for CKD in patients with T2D, many patients remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Evidence from recently completed clinical trials indicate that progressive kidney disease and cardiovascular outcomes can be slowed or prevented by treatment including ACEis/ARBs, SGLT2-is, GLP-1 RAs, and non-steroidal MRAs. We now have the opportunity to target multiple pathways in the treatment of CKD in patients with T2D, which lends itself to optimizing therapy based on the individual patients' clinical needs. New treatments are currently under investigation and results from large cardiorenal studies, specifically in patients with CKD and T2D, are anticipated in 2021.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115VhQcE]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) detection — prioritized populations and screening intervals: The highest priority conditions for CKD detection are hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart failure, and for diabetes, the ADA and KDIGO recommend annual screening of people with diabetes for CKD. CKD screening should start at diagnosis of T2D, and for T1D, screening is recommended commencing 5 years after diagnosis. A second important group includes people with recent acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute kidney disease (AKD), particularly multiple episodes of AKI, and those who have been "partially diagnosed" with CKD by either eGFR or albuminuria but cannot be fully staged. Other groups who might be considered for CKD testing are shown in Table 5, this list is not exhaustive and may be modified by local epidemiological considerations, and as of 2023 analysis suggests that population screening may be appropriate in some countries depending on the country context and population risk groups.

### Modeling chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic literature review of models, data sources, and derivation cohorts [^113Wy6xN]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinically, CKD is defined as kidney structure or kidney function abnormalities present for more than 3 months and classified using glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria. As part of this classification, GFR is conventionally grouped into five stages that, together with albuminuria, inform patient prognosis. The classical phenotype of CKD, both with and without T2DM, has been a linear decline in estimated GFR (eGFR) in the presence of persistent albuminuria. Alternative disease trajectories have recently been described, including eGFR declines in diabetes in the absence of albuminuria as well as non-linear, non-progressive, and variable eGFR trajectories, with the latter being linked to outcomes such as ESKD, initiation of RRT, and mortality. While CKD remains a progressive disease in most patients, CKD is not irreversible and may regress, to the extent that CKD regression and death are more probable with advancing age than CKD progression and kidney failure.

Diagnosis and Prognosis of Chronic Kidney Disease

The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guideline defines CKD as the presence of either one or both of the following two criteria for at least 3 months: (1) GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; (2) markers of kidney damage (≥ 1), such as albuminuria (albumin: creatinine ratio [ACR] ≥ 30 mg/g), urinary sediment abnormality, electrolyte, or other abnormality due to tubular disorder, abnormalities on histology, structural abnormalities detected by imaging, or history of kidney transplantation. The prognosis of CKD is determined by assessing the GFR category together with the albuminuria category. The color-coding in Fig. 1 explains the level of risk associated with the GFR and albuminuria categories.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

Key Points

Question

What patient-level risk factors are associated with inadequate screening and treatment for chronic kidney disease (CKD) among people with type 2 diabetes (T2D)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 316 234 participants with T2D, fewer than 25% received guideline-recommended CKD screening, and patient-level factors such as Hispanic ethnicity and comorbid cardiovascular disease were associated with concordance with screening recommendations. Treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors occurred among fewer than 5%, and people with peripheral arterial disease or lower kidney function were less likely to receive treatment.

Meaning

These findings may inform strategies to improve CKD screening and treatment in people with T2D.

Importance

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an often-asymptomatic complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D) that requires annual screening to diagnose. Patient-level factors linked to inadequate screening and treatment can inform implementation strategies to facilitate guideline-recommended CKD care.

Objective

To identify risk factors for nonconcordance with guideline-recommended CKD screening and treatment in patients with T2D.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study was performed at 20 health care systems contributing data to the US National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. To evaluate concordance with CKD screening guidelines, adults with an outpatient clinician visit linked to T2D diagnosis between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, and without known CKD were included. A separate analysis reviewed prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in adults with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m² and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] of 200–5000 mg/g) and an outpatient clinician visit for T2D between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from July 8, 2022, through June 22, 2023.

Exposures

Demographics, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Screening required measurement of creatinine levels and UACR within 15 months of the index visit. Treatment reflected prescription of ACEIs or ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors within 12 months before or 6 months following the index visit.

Results

Concordance with CKD screening guidelines was assessed in 316 234 adults (median age, 59 [IQR, 50–67] years), of whom 51.5% were women; 21.7%, Black; 10.3%, Hispanic; and 67.6%, White. Only 24.9% received creatinine and UACR screening, 56.5% received 1 screening measurement, and 18.6% received neither. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with lack of screening (relative risk [RR], 1.16 [95% CI, 1.14–1.18]). In contrast, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and hypertension were associated with a lower risk of nonconcordance. In 4215 patients with CKD and albuminuria, 3288 (78.0%) received an ACEI or ARB; 194 (4.6%), an SGLT2 inhibitor; and 885 (21.0%), neither therapy. Peripheral arterial disease and lower eGFR were associated with lack of CKD treatment, while diuretic or statin prescription and hypertension were associated with treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients with T2D, fewer than one-quarter received recommended CKD screening. In patients with CKD and albuminuria, 21.0% did not receive an SGLT2 inhibitor or an ACEI or an ARB, despite compelling indications. Patient-level factors may inform implementation strategies to improve CKD screening and treatment in people with T2D.

Introduction

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves the gradual loss of kidney function, characterized by a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or the presence of albuminuria for > 3 months. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization provide a classification system for determining CKD risk based on cause, GFR, and albuminuria (Fig. 1). Of the complications that arise from T2DM, CKD is among the most common, affecting approximately 20–40% of people. Within 10 years of T2DM diagnosis, 24.9% of people develop microalbuminuria, 5.3% develop macroalbuminuria, and 0.8% develop advanced CKD that includes persistently elevated plasma creatinine or the need for renal replacement therapy. The progression of CKD can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), increasing the risk of kidney failure with a need for renal replacement therapy involving dialysis or renal transplant. The predominance of CKD accounts for the increased mortality observed in people living with T2DM. Despite advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, and the increased availability of treatment options, the prevalence of ESRD continues to rise in people living with T2DM. With diabetes and CKD projected to be the seventh and fifth leading cause of premature mortality worldwide by 2040, respectively, novel and effective treatment options are critical.

The risk of CKD progression, morbidity, and mortality are depicted by color (green, low risk; yellow, moderately increased risk; orange, high risk; red, very high risk) and include general decision-making recommendations that are based on expert opinion based on GFR and albuminuria. "Monitor" indicates that eGFR and albuminuria be monitored more frequently. "Refer" indicates referral to a nephrologist; "Refer" indicates that clinicians may wish to discuss treatment or referral with their nephrology service.

### Treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in persons with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^115z4tqL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent and progressive condition associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Diabetes is a common cause of CKD, and both diabetes and CKD increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in individuals with CKD. This review will discuss the importance of early detection of CKD and prompt pharmacological intervention to slow CKD progression and delay the development of CVD for improving outcomes. Early CKD is often asymptomatic, and diagnosis usually requires laboratory testing. The combination of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) measurements is used to diagnose and determine CKD severity. Guidelines recommend at least annual screening for CKD in at-risk individuals. While eGFR testing rates are consistently high, rates of UACR testing remain low. This results in underdiagnosis and undertreatment of CKD, leaving many individuals at risk of CKD progression and CVD. UACR testing is an actionable component of the CKD definition. A four-pillar treatment approach for slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease is suggested, comprising a renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitor, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone. The combination of these agents provides a greater cardiorenal risk reduction compared with RAS inhibitors alone. Early detection of CKD and prompt intervention with guideline-directed medical therapy are crucial for reducing CVD risk in individuals with CKD and diabetes. Evidence from ongoing studies will advance our understanding of optimal therapy in this population.

Purpose Of Review

Worldwide, we are facing an increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus, the number one cause of end-stage renal disease. It is imperative that chronic kidney disease among adults with diabetes mellitus be detected early when interventions are most effective in preventing end-stage renal disease.

Recent Findings

Screening tools work best when health care providers have a clear understanding of the natural history of the disease process. The use of urine albumin measurement as a screening tool for diabetic nephropathy is based on the well characterized evolution of nephropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, the evolution of chronic kidney disease among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to be more heterogeneous. In contrast to type 1 diabetes mellitus, a substantial percentage of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus have decreased glomerular filtration rate in the absence of increased urine albumin excretion. Focusing solely on urine albumin excretion to screen for chronic kidney disease may miss a substantial number of cases in adults with diabetes mellitus. In addition, up to one-third of adults with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus already have chronic kidney disease, which may have first developed during the prediabetic state. Screening for chronic kidney disease only after an adult develops diabetes mellitus may miss that 'early' window of opportunity in many patients.

Summary

To maximize the effectiveness of our screening programs, we must not only use tests with adequate sensitivity but also implement screening tests early in the disease process to prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease.

Type 2 diabetes — retinopathy as a discriminator of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in albuminuria states is characterized by predictive values and diagnostic accuracy: In those with macroalbuminuria, the positive predictive value of retinopathy for typical diabetic glomerulopathy ranges from 67% to 100%, with negative predictive value 20% to 84%, yielding sensitivities between 26% and 85% and specificities of 13% to 100%. For microalbuminuria, positive predictive values were around 45% and negative predictive values close to 100%, giving sensitivities of 100% and specificities of 46% to 62%. The presence of retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and macroalbuminuria is strongly suggestive of DKD, while its absence in microalbuminuric patients suggests nondiabetic glomerulopathy.

### The need for screening, early diagnosis, and prediction of chronic kidney disease in people with diabetes in low-and middle-income countries-a review of the current literature [^114GaBVx]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes is becoming an increasing major public health concern, disproportionately burdening low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This rising burden is due to various factors, including the lack of disease awareness that results in late referral and the cost of screening and consequent treatment of the comorbid conditions, as well as other factors endemic to LMICs relating to inadequate management of risk factors. We critically assessed the extant literature, by performing searches of Medline via PubMed, EBSCOhost, Scopus, and Web of Science, for studies pertaining to screening, diagnosis, and prediction of CKD amongst adults with diabetes in LMICs, using relevant key terms. The relevant studies were summarized through key themes derived from the Wilson and Jungner criteria. We found that screening for CKD in people with diabetes is generally infrequent in LMICs. Also, LMICs are ill-equipped to appropriately manage diabetes-associated CKD, especially its late stages, in which supportive care and kidney replacement therapy (KRT) might be required. There are acceptable and relatively simple tools that can aid diabetes-associated CKD screening in these countries; however, these tools come with limitations. Thus, effective implementation of diabetes-associated CKD screening in LMICs remains a challenge, and the cost-effectiveness of such an undertaking largely remains to be explored. In conclusion, for many compelling reasons, screening for CKD in people with diabetes should be a high policy priority in LMICs, as the huge cost associated with higher mortality and morbidity in this group and the cost of KRT offers a compelling economic incentive for improving early detection of diabetes in CKD.

Early detection of CKD and comorbidities: the role of UACR screening and albuminuria

Early detection and timely intervention for CKD are critical for slowing disease progression and preventing comorbidities, including CVD. Early kidney disease is often asymptomatic, with few specific symptoms presenting until kidney failure occurs; therefore, early diagnosis usually requires laboratory testing.

Both eGFR and UACR testing are recommended when screening for CKD in people with T2D (Fig. 3). UACR is a sensitive and early indicator of kidney damage and can be routinely used to accurately assess the severity of CKD and monitor kidney health. UACR values of ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) that persist for 3 months, in the absence of other indicators or markers of kidney damage, are alone sufficient to diagnose CKD and to prescribe therapy for slowing the progression of CKD. These recommendations are based on the findings of clinical trials that demonstrated improved outcomes with these therapies when albuminuria inclusion criteria were applied independently of other laboratory values.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^117R5P3C]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m², persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

Risk factors, prevention, and management of DKD

Definition of DKD and screening

DKD is a clinical diagnosis made based on the presence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR, in a person with an established diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) or T2D. Table 1 outlines the various methods of measuring albuminuria and their normal ranges using the nomenclature recommended by the latest Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines. These refer to normal to mildly increased, moderately increased and severely increased albuminuria to replace normo, micro- and macroalbuminuria, respectively. In clinical practice recommendations by American Diabetes Association (ADA), normal albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) is defined as < 30 mg/g, and high urinary albumin excretion as ⩾ 30 mg/g.

Table 1.
Various urine albumin collections for defining albuminuria.

The most convenient screening method appears to be a single (preferably early morning) urine sent for ACR, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), taken at least annually. If urinary ACR is abnormal, it should be repeated to confirm. Arbitrary cut offs for albuminuria are described, although it is clear that the value is a continuous variable, and may have significant day-to-day differences in an individual person. The presence of mildly elevated ACR, however, does appear to be an early precursor of progression to severely increased albuminuria in many patients, although some may regress to normal albumin excretion due to therapeutic intervention.

A broader term of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes is used to describe people with diabetes who have a reduced eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m², irrespective of cause. If albuminuria is not present is such patients, then DKD may be less likely, and alternative diagnoses should be considered.CKD in the absence of albuminuria in an elderly person with diabetes is less likely to progress to ESRD. Other reasons to consider non-diabetic renal disease in people with diabetes and CKD are the absence of retinopathy, rapid deterioration in renal function, active urinary sediment, nephrotic range albuminuria (ACR > 220 mg/mmol), or symptoms/signs of other systemic disease.

Introduction

In 2021, an estimated 38.4 million (11.6%) Americans were living with either type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with T2DM accounting for 90–95% of cases. The prevalence of adults with a diabetes diagnosis in the United States (US) is projected to increase to 39.7 million (13.9%) by 2030 and 60.6 million (17.9%) by 2060. This does not account for ~ 23% of US adults who have undiagnosed diabetes. One-third of adults diagnosed with diabetes also have chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, 90% of people with CKD are unaware of their diagnosis. Early diagnosis of CKD is critical, as it reduces the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and progression to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or transplant.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people living with T2DM should undergo annual screening of both urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to monitor for CKD and its progression (Fig. 1). CKD is defined as persistently elevated urine albumin excretion (≥ 30 mg/g) and/or persistently reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² for at least 3 months. Despite ADA guideline recommendations, proper CKD screening in people with diabetes remains low in routine clinical care.

Key Points for Practice
- Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes.
- First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression. Diabetes mellitus affects more than 450 million people globally, which could increase to more than 700 million people by 2045. Up to 40% of cases of diabetes are complicated by chronic kidney disease, with persistent abnormalities of kidney function demonstrated by elevated urine albumin excretion or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group, an international organization dedicated to nephrology clinical practice guidelines, has developed a new guideline for management of diabetes with CKD.

Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m² or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. The guidelines recommend treatment with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic goals despite use of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial effect in reducing cardiovascular events. GLP-1 receptor agonist trials are safe with an eGFR as low as 15 mL per minute per 1.73 m².

Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibition Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are recommended to slow kidney disease progression in people with albuminuria and hypertension. An ACE inhibitor or ARB should be titrated to maximal tolerated dosage with monitoring of blood pressure, serum potassium, and serum creatinine within two to four weeks of dosing changes.

### Pillar risk-based treatment for chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^116HyCSo]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

There are two main markers of kidney disease that should be monitored at least annually in people at risk of, or diagnosed with, CKD: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatine ratio (UACR). eGFR is calculated from serum creatinine concentration, measured in the laboratory using an enzymatic method in a venous blood sample. UACR is measured in a spot urine sample, preferably collected from the first morning void. UACR (i.e. urine albumin [mg]/urine creatinine [g]) is calculated from laboratory-measured urine albumin and creatinine concentrations (preferred) or can be estimated directly using dipstick-based measurement with automated reading.

Once an abnormal eGFR or UACR is identified, repeat testing is recommended 3 months later by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), an international clinical practice guidelines working group. eGFR is a marker of kidney function, whereas UACR is a marker of kidney damage, and testing these together allows one to characterize and prognosticate CKD and its risk for progression, as well as cardiovascular events and death, as illustrated in the KDIGO heatmap (Fig. 1). In CKD, UACR may be elevated before eGFR declines to levels associated with impaired kidney function, and should be recognized as a measure that is as important as blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to trigger treatments for reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks. Despite recommendations, UACR testing is widely underutilized in clinical practice, especially compared with eGFR testing. The lack of UACR testing was also noted by The Center for Kidney Disease Research, Education, and Hope Registry, which showed that of over 2.6 million people with T2D at risk of CKD, only 8.7% of adults were tested for UACR (n / N = 52,511/606,064), likely resulting in a significant underestimation of diagnosed CKD cases and complete lack of prognostication.

Management OF CKD In Patients With T2D

Glycemic Control

Intensive glycemic control in patients with T2D results in significant reductions in the development of microvascular complications, with the evidence of prevention of incident CKD being stronger than that for decreasing progression of established CKD. Therefore, the ADA guidelines provide treatment goals for glucose control (target levels of glycated hemoglobin [A1C], described in Table 1), and recommend that A1C is assessed at least twice per year in patients meeting these goals, and quarterly in patients who have switched therapy or who are not meeting treatment goals. This approach is endorsed in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO®) 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines. It is important to note that in patients with advanced CKD, A1C levels may be falsely low, and therefore patients with T2D and CKD should be encouraged to self-monitor their blood glucose levels more frequently. This is due to patients commonly having anemia of chronic disease, and the decreased survival time of erythrocytes in these patients leads to falsely low A1C results. The incidence of adverse effects associated with intensive glycemic control is increased in patients with concomitant CKD, so careful individualization of glycemic goals is recommended (Table 1).

Dietary Intervention

Dietary interventions can help to improve blood pressure (BP) and glucose control, as well as slow the progression of CKD. Recommended nutritional interventions include protein intake of approximately 0.8 g/kg/day and sodium intake < 2300 mg/day (ADA) or < 2000 mg/day (KDIGO) Dietary protein intake less than the recommended daily allowance of 0.8 g/kg/day does not improve outcomes. For patients on dialysis, higher levels of dietary protein intake should be considered, as malnutrition is a problem in some dialysis patients. It is helpful to have the input of a registered dietician or a certified diabetes educator to help operationalize these goals for patients.

### Differences in risk factors for the onset of albuminuria and decrease in glomerular filtration rate in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications for the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease [^114FyqRg]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease worldwide, reflecting the global increase in the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic kidney disease has been traditionally diagnosed based on the presence of (micro)albuminuria 1, 2. In 2002, the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation proposed guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of chronic kidney disease, including diabetic kidney disease 3, in which chronic kidney disease was defined and staged mainly according to estimated GFR (eGFR). Recently, the classification of chronic kidney disease has been modified to include both eGFR and albuminuria stages, creating the 'heat map' that describes the relative risks for renal and cardiovascular outcomes 4.

It is generally believed that microalbuminuria is an early clinical manifestation of diabetic kidney disease, and that decreased GFR occurs secondarily, mainly in people with longstanding diabetes. This clinical course appears to be typical for those with Type 1 diabetes 5. In contrast, the natural history of chronic kidney disease in Type 2 diabetes appears to be heterogeneous. We 6 and others 7, 8 identified a subgroup of people with Type 2 diabetes who had decreased GFR despite normoalbuminuria. These cross‐sectional observations suggest that risk factors for albuminuria and those for decreased GFR may differ; however, previous longitudinal studies in people with Type 2 diabetes have focused exclusively on risk factors for albuminuria 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. We conducted the present observational cohort study to investigate, therefore, whether onset of albuminuria and decreased eGFR share common risk factors or have unique sets of risk factors in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
