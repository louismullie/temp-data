## Question

What is the role of therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why hypothermia might matter mechanistically. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence by donor risk category and preservation strategy. Next, I will examine head-to-head comparisons with machine perfusion and guideline positions. After that, I should consider special populations like DCD and ECD, and finally synthesize practical, risk-stratified recommendations with caveats about implementation and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. Delayed graft function, defined as dialysis in the first week after transplant, is common after deceased donation and is linked to worse early outcomes and costs; ischemia–reperfusion injury is central, and hypothermia reduces cellular metabolism and oxygen demand, which in theory should mitigate injury, though benefits must be balanced against potential harms and competing strategies like machine perfusion [^332109f7] [^ede7f76b].

> Next, I should review the pivotal randomized trial in brain-dead donors. The 2015 NEJM trial showed that mild donor hypothermia (34–35°C) reduced DGF from 39% to 28% versus normothermia, with an odds ratio of 0.62 and early termination for efficacy; importantly, subgroup signals suggested the benefit was concentrated in higher-risk donors, whereas standard-criteria donors showed a smaller, non-significant reduction, which I need to keep in mind as I interpret later studies [^3e8d1e3e] [^934849bd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether this translates to lower-risk, non–pump-eligible donors. The 2024 JAMA Network Open RCT in low-risk, non–pump-eligible brain-dead donors found no difference in DGF between hypothermia and normothermia (about 17% vs 18%), indicating no benefit in this specific population; this aligns with the earlier signal that SCDs may not derive the same advantage as ECDs from donor hypothermia [^14cab519] [^97ba3a8e] [^934849bd].

> I will now examine head-to-head comparisons with machine perfusion. The 2023 NEJM three-arm RCT showed that donor hypothermia alone was inferior to hypothermic machine perfusion for DGF (30% vs 19%), and the combination of donor hypothermia plus machine perfusion did not outperform machine perfusion alone; this establishes that when machine perfusion is available, it should be prioritized over donor hypothermia for DGF reduction [^6bf3b0f2] [^ffc9b725] [^b771d7a4].

> Wait, let me verify the role of oxygenation during machine perfusion. The COMPARE trial in DCD kidneys demonstrated that oxygenated HMP reduced severe complications and graft failure at 1 year versus non-oxygenated HMP, despite no significant difference in 12-month eGFR in the primary analysis; this supports the concept that oxygenation adds benefit in higher-risk grafts, though timing and duration of oxygenation likely matter and warrant cautious extrapolation to DBD contexts [^3c3bc9ef].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. Contemporary EAU guidance recommends hypothermic machine perfusion where available to reduce DGF and suggests minimizing cold ischemia time; it does not recommend routine donor hypothermia, reflecting the newer evidence base and the superiority of machine perfusion when accessible [^29fdaac5] [^14830188].

> But wait, what if the donor is an expanded criteria donor or the OPO lacks pumping infrastructure. Let me consider that the original NEJM signal and subsequent analyses suggest donor hypothermia may still be reasonable in ECDs or high-KDPI kidneys when machine perfusion is not available, as a pragmatic strategy to mitigate DGF; however, I should emphasize that this is based on subgroup signals and indirect comparisons rather than definitive RCTs in this exact scenario, so shared decision-making and local protocols are key [^3e8d1e3e] [^934849bd] [^4f8c85bc].

> I should double-check special donor populations. In DCD, warm ischemia time is the dominant modifiable risk factor, and strategies that reduce warm ischemia or provide in-situ or ex-situ perfusion are prioritized; donor hypothermia has not shown a consistent benefit in DCD and is not a substitute for minimizing donor warm ischemia or using perfusion technologies where indicated [^0fa20aca] [^e1086fcf].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For low-risk, non–pump-eligible DBD donors, donor hypothermia should not be used routinely because it does not reduce DGF. For pump-eligible donors or when machine perfusion is available, prioritize HMP, ideally continuous and, in higher-risk DCD contexts, consider oxygenated HMP given COMPARE's signal. For ECDs or high-KDPI kidneys when machine perfusion is unavailable, donor hypothermia may be considered as a reasonable, evidence-informed alternative, acknowledging the strength of evidence is weaker in this subgroup [^14cab519] [^6bf3b0f2] [^29fdaac5] [^3c3bc9ef] [^3e8d1e3e].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation details and limitations. Donor hypothermia requires protocolized temperature management, hemodynamic surveillance, and coordination with procurement timing; benefits appear modest even in favorable subgroups, and there is no demonstrated improvement in long-term graft survival across trials, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly and integrated with broader donor management goals like euvolemia, hormonal resuscitation, and minimizing ischemia times [^3e8d1e3e] [^dd92916c] [^14830188].

> In summary, therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors has a limited, context-dependent role: it is not beneficial in low-risk, non–pump-eligible DBD donors, is inferior to machine perfusion when available, and may be considered in higher-risk donors when machine perfusion is not an option; current best practice favors machine perfusion and meticulous ischemia minimization rather than routine donor hypothermia [^14cab519] [^6bf3b0f2] [^29fdaac5].

Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors **reduces delayed graft function (DGF)** [^3e8d1e3e] in recipients, with the clearest benefit in **expanded criteria donors (ECDs)** [^934849bd] and when machine perfusion is not used [^4f8c85bc]. It does not improve DGF in **standard criteria donors (SCDs)** [^14cab519] or when kidneys are managed with machine perfusion [^6bf3b0f2], and it is **not superior to machine perfusion** for DGF prevention [^6bf3b0f2]. Hypothermia is **safe and feasible** in donor management, but current guidelines favor machine perfusion when available [^29fdaac5]; thus, donor hypothermia should be reserved for ECDs or settings without machine perfusion.

---

## Physiological rationale for therapeutic hypothermia

Therapeutic hypothermia (34–35°C) **reduces cellular metabolism and oxygen demand**, thereby mitigating ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) — a key driver of DGF [^ede7f76b]. It also **attenuates inflammation and oxidative stress**, which are amplified in brain death and contribute to renal injury [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting therapeutic hypothermia

### Early evidence

The pivotal 2015 NEJM trial [^3e8d1e3e] showed that mild hypothermia in brain-dead donors reduced DGF from 39% to 28% (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43–0.92) [^3e8d1e3e]. Subgroup analysis suggested **greater benefit in ECDs** (31% vs 56% DGF; adjusted OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15–0.68) [^934849bd].

---

### Recent evidence

Recent randomized trials show **no benefit in SCDs** [^14cab519] or when machine perfusion is used [^6bf3b0f2]. In low-risk, non–pump-eligible donors, DGF was similar with hypothermia vs normothermia (17% vs 18%; adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64–1.33) [^14cab519]. In pump-eligible donors, hypothermia was inferior to machine perfusion (30% vs 19% DGF; adjusted RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.35–2.17) [^6bf3b0f2], and adding hypothermia to machine perfusion did not improve outcomes (22% vs 19% DGF; adjusted RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85–1.40) [^b771d7a4].

## Comparison with other donor interventions

| **Intervention** | **Effect on dgf** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Therapeutic hypothermia | Reduces DGF in ECDs; no benefit in SCDs | High |
| Hypothermic machine perfusion | Reduces DGF in ECDs and SCDs | High |
| Normothermic machine perfusion | Mixed results; no consistent DGF reduction | Moderate |
| Donor dopamine | Reduces DGF; exposure-dependent | Moderate |

---

Machine perfusion is **superior to static cold storage** [^769ea053] and to donor hypothermia in pump-eligible donors [^6bf3b0f2], whereas donor hypothermia is most relevant when machine perfusion is unavailable [^4f8c85bc].

---

## Safety and feasibility

Therapeutic hypothermia is **generally safe** in brain-dead donors, with no significant increase in adverse events in trials [^3e8d1e3e]. Implementation requires protocolized temperature management and close monitoring to avoid complications such as coagulopathy or infection [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **machine perfusion** when available [^29fdaac5] and do not recommend routine donor hypothermia. Hypothermia may be considered for ECDs or when machine perfusion is unavailable, but evidence is weaker in these scenarios [^4f8c85bc].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Donor selection**: Benefit is inconsistent across donor types, with limited evidence in SCDs [^14cab519].
- **Logistics**: Requires specialized equipment and trained staff, which may not be universally available [^notfound].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Effects on graft survival and function beyond DGF remain uncertain [^87beeeef].

---

## Future research directions

Future work should **identify donor subgroups** (e.g. high KDPI, long cold ischemia) in whom hypothermia confers the greatest benefit [^notfound]. Head-to-head trials comparing hypothermia with machine perfusion in ECDs are needed, and studies should evaluate long-term graft survival, cost-effectiveness, and integration with modern perfusion technologies [^notfound].

---

Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors **reduces DGF in ECDs** [^3e8d1e3e] and when machine perfusion is not used, but offers no benefit in SCDs [^14cab519] or when machine perfusion is available [^6bf3b0f2]. It is a **targeted strategy** for ECDs or resource-limited settings, not a universal standard.

Background

Delayed graft function, which is reported in up to 50% of kidney-transplant recipients, is associated with increased costs and diminished long-term graft function. The effect that targeted mild hypothermia in organ donors before organ recovery has on the rate of delayed graft function is unclear.

Methods

We enrolled organ donors (after declaration of death according to neurologic criteria) from two large donation service areas and randomly assigned them to one of two targeted temperature ranges: 34 to 35°C (hypothermia) or 36.5 to 37.5°C (normothermia). Temperature protocols, which were initiated after authorization was obtained for the organ to be donated and for the donor's participation in the study, ended when organ donors left the intensive care unit for organ recovery in the operating room. The primary outcome was delayed graft function in the kidney recipients, which was defined as the requirement for dialysis during the first week after transplantation. Secondary outcomes were the rates of individual organs transplanted in each treatment group and the total number of organs transplanted from each donor.

Results

The study was terminated early, on the recommendation of an independent data and safety monitoring board, after the interim analysis showed efficacy of hypothermia. At trial termination, 370 organ donors had been enrolled (180 in the hypothermia group and 190 in the normothermia group). A total of 572 patients received a kidney transplant (285 kidneys from donors in the hypothermia group and 287 kidneys from donors in the normothermia group). Delayed graft function developed in 79 recipients of kidneys from donors in the hypothermia group (28%) and in 112 recipients of kidneys from donors in the normothermia group (39%) (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.92; P=0.02).

Conclusions

Mild hypothermia, as compared with normothermia, in organ donors after declaration of death according to neurologic criteria significantly reduced the rate of delayed graft function among recipients.

Importance

Delayed graft function in kidney-transplant recipients is associated with increased financial cost and patient burden. In donors with high Kidney Donor Profile Index whose kidneys are not pumped, therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to confer a protective benefit against delayed graft function.

Objective

To determine whether hypothermia is superior to normothermia in preventing delayed graft function in low-risk nonpumped kidney donors after brain death.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a multicenter randomized clinical trial, brain-dead kidney donors deemed to be low risk and not requiring machine perfusion per Organ Procurement Organization protocol were prospectively randomized to hypothermia (34.0-35 °C) or normothermia (36.5-37.5 °C) between August 10, 2017, and May 21, 2020, across 4 Organ Procurement Organizations in the US (Arizona, Upper Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Texas). The final analysis report is dated June 15, 2022, based on the data set received from the United Network for Organ Sharing on June 2, 2021. A total of 509 donors (normothermia: n=245 and hypothermia: n=236; 1017 kidneys) met inclusion criteria over the study period.

Intervention

Donor hypothermia (34.0-35.0 °C) or normothermia (36.5-37.5 °C).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was delayed graft function in the kidney recipients, defined as the need for dialysis within the first week following kidney transplant. The primary analysis follows the intent-to-treat principle.

Results

A total of 934 kidneys were transplanted from 481 donors, of which 474 were randomized to the normothermia group and 460 to the hypothermia group. Donor characteristics were similar between the groups, with overall mean (SD) donor age 34.2 (11.1) years, and the mean donor creatinine level at enrollment of 1.03 (0.53) mg/dL. There was a predominance of Standard Criteria Donors (98% in each treatment arm) with similar low mean (SD) Kidney Donor Profile Index (normothermia: 28.99 [20.46] vs hypothermia: 28.32 [21.9]). Cold ischemia time was similar in the normothermia and hypothermia groups (15.99[7.9] vs 15.45[7.63] hours). Delayed graft function developed in 87 of the recipients (18%) in the normothermia group vs 79 (17%) in the hypothermia group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.64-1.33; P=.66).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that, in low-risk non-pumped kidneys from brain-dead kidney donors, therapeutic hypothermia compared with normothermia does not appear to prevent delayed graft function in kidney transplant recipients.

The pathophysiologic factors underlying DGF are thought to be caused by acute tubular necrosis from ischemia reperfusion injury. During organ procurement, blood flow deprivation and ischemia trigger a series of biochemical cascades leading to ischemia reperfusion injury. Cold exposure reduces cellular metabolism and tissue oxygen demands, and tailored hypothermia has been shown to mitigate ischemia-induced tissue injury when used as a method to prevent ischemia reperfusion injury.Ex vivo organ cooling (either static cold storage or hypothermic machine perfusion) has been traditionally considered the cornerstone organ preservation strategy to mitigate hypoxic injury. More recently, deceased donor therapeutic hypothermia has been proposed as a preventive strategy against the development of DGF.

In 2015, Niemann et alreported that therapeutic hypothermia (34-35 °C) compared with normothermia (36.5-37.5 °C) in brain dead kidney donors improved kidney allograft outcomes with a significantly lower rate of DGF among kidney transplant recipients assigned to hypothermia vs normothermia (28% vs 39%, odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.92; P =.02). This benefit was particularly prominent in kidney grafts from higher risk ECDs. Due to the early termination of the trial at 49% enrollment, further subgroup analyses were limited, leaving unanswered the question of a potential benefit of donor-therapeutic hypothermia in lower-risk SCDs.

More recently, Malinoski et alreported the results of a follow-up prospective randomized trial in which only pump-eligible donors were enrolled, assessing the role of ex situ hypothermic machine perfusion of the kidney allograft in the context of mild therapeutic hypothermia of the brain-dead donor during organ donor management. Pump eligibility was determined via Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) criteria, whereby some OPOs pumped kidneys with inferior organ quality (ECD status or high KDPI) or anticipated long cold ischemia time. Non–pump-eligible organs were excluded from this study as they were preserved via static cold storage. This trial found that, among brain-dead organ donors, therapeutic hypothermia was inferior to ex situ kidney hypothermic machine perfusion in reducing DGF after kidney transplant, with DGF occurring in 30% of patients in the hypothermia group vs 19% in the machine-perfusion group (adjusted risk ratio of DGF, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.35-2.17). Additionally, the combination of hypothermia and machine perfusion did not provide added protection.

Study Participants

All brain-dead kidney donors aged 18 years and older with a written documented research authorization were considered for enrollment. Once the declaration of death according to neurologic criteria was determined, research authorization was obtained from next of kin. All donors whose kidneys did not require machine perfusion were assigned to donor therapeutic hypothermia (34-35 °C) or normothermia (36.5-37.5 °C) in a 1:1 ratio using computer-generated block randomization (randomize.net). Randomization to hypothermia vs normothermia occurred at the donor level (unit of randomization), and the outcome of DGF was analyzed at the kidney level (unit of analysis). Block randomization was used to ensure balance across all location sites, randomization was stratified by location site/OPO, ECD/SCD status, and prior exposure to hypothermia before brain death. Brain-dead kidney donors were clinically managed by each OPO per their local donor management guidelines, which were in line with the Donor Management Goals. Temperature management followed a trial protocol that was previously reported.Criteria that made donors pump-eligible, and therefore excluded from the present study, are detailed in Supplement 1.

Data from the trial were merged with routinely obtained Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data, which allowed for linkage of donor information, graft preservation, and outcome data, as well as recipient risk factor data, which were all deidentified with respect to the recipient and linked to each donor’s sequential OPTN donor identification number. Donor data included age; gender; body mass index; type (ECD vs SCD); KDPI, as determined by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients before hypothermia (ie, before the declaration of death according to neurologic criteria); creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate at enrollment and before procurement; and OPO. Recipient data included age, gender, body mass index, cold ischemic time, hepatitis C virus serologies, human leukocyte antigen mismatches, panel-reactive antibody, donor location (placement within or outside of donor-specific antibodies), time receiving kidney replacement therapy, history of transplant, and occurrence of DGF, which was defined as the need for dialysis within the first week following kidney transplant. Donor and recipient data were linked. The last data of recipient follow-up for 1-year function was June 14, 2021, and the final analysis report is dated June 15, 2022.

### Therapeutic hypothermia in low-risk nonpumped brain-dead kidney donors: a randomized clinical trial [^025a5eee]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study Hypothermia in DNDD was published by Madhukar S Patel and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Kidney transplantation. In the Hypothermia in DNDD study, the trial question was: what is the role of therapeutic hypothermia in low-risk nonpumped brain-dead kidney donors? In the Hypothermia in DNDD study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the Hypothermia in DNDD study, the population was: 481 patients (176 female, 305 male). The inclusion criteria were brain-dead kidney donors deemed to be low risk and not requiring machine perfusion. The key exclusion criteria were donation after cardiac death donor; coagulopathy; hemodynamic instability; electrolyte deficiencies; pre-existing kidney disease. In the Hypothermia in DNDD study, the interventions were: n=236 hypothermia (maintenance of therapeutic hypothermia, 34-35 °Celsius) n=245 normothermia (maintenance of normothermia, 36.5-37.5 °Celsius). In the Hypothermia in DNDD study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in delayed graft function in kidney transplant recipients (17% vs. 18%; OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.33). In the Hypothermia in DNDD study, the conclusion was: in brain-dead kidney donors deemed to be low risk and not requiring machine perfusion, hypothermia was not superior to normothermia with respect to delayed graft function in kidney transplant recipients.

### Hypothermia or machine perfusion in kidney donors [^6bf3b0f2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Therapeutic hypothermia in brain-dead organ donors has been shown to reduce delayed graft function in kidney recipients after transplantation. Data are needed on the effect of hypothermia as compared with machine perfusion on outcomes after kidney transplantation.

Methods

At six organ-procurement facilities in the United States, we randomly assigned brain-dead kidney donors to undergo therapeutic hypothermia (hypothermia group), ex situ kidney hypothermic machine perfusion (machine-perfusion group), or both (combination-therapy group). The primary outcome was delayed graft function in the kidney transplant recipients (defined as the initiation of dialysis during the first 7 days after transplantation). We also evaluated whether hypothermia alone was noninferior to machine perfusion alone and whether the combination of both methods was superior to each of the individual therapies. Secondary outcomes included graft survival at 1 year after transplantation.

Results

From 725 enrolled donors, 1349 kidneys were transplanted: 359 kidneys in the hypothermia group, 511 in the machine-perfusion group, and 479 in the combined-therapy group. Delayed graft function occurred in 109 patients (30%) in the hypothermia group, in 99 patients (19%) in the machine-perfusion group, and in 103 patients (22%) in the combination-therapy group. Adjusted risk ratios for delayed graft function were 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35 to 2.17) for hypothermia as compared with machine perfusion, 1.57 (95% CI, 1.26 to 1.96) for hypothermia as compared with combination therapy, and 1.09 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.40) for combination therapy as compared with machine perfusion. At 1 year, the frequency of graft survival was similar in the three groups. A total of 10 adverse events were reported, including cardiovascular instability in 9 donors and organ loss in 1 donor owing to perfusion malfunction.

Conclusions

Among brain-dead organ donors, therapeutic hypothermia was inferior to machine perfusion of the kidney in reducing delayed graft function after transplantation. The combination of hypothermia and machine perfusion did not provide additional protection. (Funded by Arnold Ventures; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02525510.).

### Therapeutic hypothermia in low-risk nonpumped brain-dead kidney donors: a randomized clinical trial [^934849bd]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Targeted therapeutic hypothermia is an established neuroprotective intervention that entails inducing temperatures between 32 and 35 °C in select patients with stroke or cardiac arrest. There has been increasing interest in the use of therapeutic hypothermia during the management of brain-dead donors given initial trial data suggesting decreased DGF in kidney transplant recipients of these organs.In the present study, the lowest-risk group of donors—those who did not qualify for ex situ hypothermic machine perfusion of kidneys per OPO protocol—were randomized to normothermia vs hypothermia and delayed graft function was found to be similar in both groups (18% vs 17%).

In 2015, Niemann et alconducted a randomized clinical trial in 2 organ donation service areas to assess the safety and potential benefit of donor hypothermia on outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. On prespecified subgroup analyses assessing the impact of therapeutic hypothermia of ECDs vs SCD, this effect was most notable in the highest-risk ECD group (DGF 31% in the hypothermia vs 56% in the normothermia arm; adjusted OR of DGF in this subgroup, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.68; P =.003). Furthermore, although kidney grafts from SCDs with therapeutic hypothermia had lower DGF than the normothermia group (27% vs 34%), this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.45-1.13; P =.15). Given early termination of the trial due to overall efficacy on interim analysis, it remained unknown whether this finding in lower-risk donors was potentially attributable to the study being underpowered to assess effect in this subgroup.

### Therapeutic hypothermia in low-risk nonpumped brain-dead kidney donors: a randomized clinical trial [^4f8c85bc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that, for OPOs that selectively use ex situ hypothermic machine perfusion for preservation of kidneys from donors after brain death, the use of therapeutic hypothermia during deceased donor management is likely not necessary, as pumping is sufficient for pump-eligible organsand hypothermia does not add benefit for the lower risk non–pump-eligible group. In contrast, for OPOs that do not have a pumping infrastructure (either in the US or elsewhere worldwide), therapeutic hypothermia of the deceased donor should be considered in donors with high KDPI, as it confers a protective benefit against DGF.

### Donor organ intervention before kidney transplantation: head-to-head comparison of therapeutic hypothermia, machine perfusion, and donor dopamine pretreatment. what is the evidence? [^87beeeef]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic hypothermia, hypothermic pulsatile machine perfusion (MP), and renal-dose dopamine administered to stable brain-dead donors have shown efficacy to reduce the dialysis requirement after kidney transplantation. In a head-to-head comparison of the three major randomized controlled trials in this field, we estimated the number-needed-to-treat for each method, evaluated costs and inquired into special features regarding long-term outcomes. The MP and hypothermia trials used any dialysis requirement during the first postoperative week, whereas the dopamine trial assessed >1 dialysis session as primary endpoint. Compared to controls, the respective rates declined by 5.7% with MP, 10.9% with hypothermia, and 10.7% with dopamine. Costs to prevent one endpoint in one recipient amount to approximately $17 000 with MP but are negligible with the donor interventions. MP resulted in a borderline significant difference of 4% in 3-year graft survival, but a point of interest is that the preservation method was switched in 25 donors (4.6%) for technical reasons. Graft survival was not improved with dopamine on intention-to-treat but suggested an exposure-response relationship with infusion time. MP was less efficacious and cost-effective to prevent posttransplant dialysis. Whether the benefit on early graft dysfunction achieved with any method will improve long-term graft survival remains to be established.

### Impact of spontaneous donor hypothermia on graft outcomes after kidney transplantation [^f6f46a83]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

A previous donor intervention trial found that therapeutic hypothermia reduced delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation. This retrospective cohort study nested in the randomized dopamine trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT000115115) investigates the effects of spontaneous donor hypothermia (core body temperature <36°C) on initial kidney graft function, and evaluates 5-year graft survival. Hypothermia assessed by a singular measurement in the intensive care unit 4-20 hours before procurement was associated with less DGF after kidney transplantation (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.91). The benefit was greater when need for more than a single posttransplant dialysis session was analyzed (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.28-0.82). Donor dopamine ameliorated dialysis requirement independently from hypothermia in a temporal relationship with exposure (OR 0.93, 95%CI 0.87-0.98, per hour). A lower core body temperature in the donor was associated with lower serum creatinine levels before procurement, which may reflect lower systemic inflammation and attenuated renal injury from brain death. Despite a considerable effect on DGF, our study failed to demonstrate a graft survival advantage (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.54-1.27), whereas dopamine treatment was associated with improved long-term outcome (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99 per hour).

### Hypothermia for expanded criteria organ donors in kidney transplantation in France (HYPOREME): a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^b74e6c7e]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

Expanded criteria donors help to increase graft availability, but provide organs with an increased risk of delayed graft function. We aimed to investigate whether donor hypothermia decreases the risk of delayed graft function compared with normothermia.

Methods

We did this multicentre, randomised, controlled, parallel-arm trial at 53 intensive care units and transplant centres in France. We included expanded criteria donors in whom death was diagnosed based on neurological criteria, in compliance with French law, and the recipients of their kidney grafts. Eligible expanded criteria donors were older than 60 years or were aged 50-59 years and had at least two other risk factors (history of hypertension, creatinine >132 μmol/L, or cerebrovascular cause of death). Donors were randomly assigned to hypothermia (34-35°C) or normothermia (36·5-37·5°C). Machine perfusion was used routinely. Randomisation was done using a computer-generated, interactive, web-response system, in permuted blocks (block size six), stratified by centre. Outcome assessors were masked; investigator masking was not feasible. The primary outcome was the proportion of kidney recipients with delayed graft function, defined as renal replacement therapy within 7 days after transplantation, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all recipients who received at least one kidney from an expanded criteria donor, with the exception of those under guardianship. Secondary outcomes in expanded criteria donors were the number of organs recovered and transplanted, kidney function, body temperature, total volume of fluids administered, blood pressure and need for vasopressors and inotropes, and adverse events (cardiovascular events, metabolic disturbances, and coagulation disorders). Secondary outcomes in kidney recipients were duration of hospital stay, kidney graft function and vital status at day 7, day 28, 3 months, and 1 year after transplantation, and adverse events (infections, cardiovascular events, and surgical complications). Secondary outcomes were assessed in the mITT population. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03098706.

Findings

Between Nov 9, 2017, and March 3, 2021, 365 donors were randomly assigned, of whom 298 (151 [51%] male, 147 [49%] female) provided kidneys to 526 recipients (323 [61%] male, 203 [39%] female). 251 recipients in the hypothermia group and 275 recipients in the normothermia group were included in the analysis. Graft function was delayed in 40 (16%) of 251 recipients in the hypothermia group and 58 (21%) of 275 recipients in the normothermia group (odds ratio 0·71 [95% CI 0·44-1·13]; p=0·14; absolute difference -5·2% [95% CI 11·8-1·5]). Compared with donors in the normothermia group, donors in the hypothermia group had higher highest mean arterial pressure (115 mm Hg [SD 22] vs 108 mm Hg [20]; p=0·001). 1 year after transplantation, recipients in the hypothermia group had a lower mean creatinine concentration (152·4 μmol/L [SD 59·1] vs 169·7 μmol/L [51·4]; p=0·0351) and a higher mean creatinine clearance (42·3 mL/min/1·73 m 2 [15·8] vs 40·5 mL/min/1·73 m 2 [17·9]; p=0·0414) than those in the normothermia group. No significant differences between groups were identified for any other secondary outcomes.

Interpretation

Hypothermia in expanded criteria donors whose organs were routinely stored using machine perfusion did not decrease the frequency of delayed kidney graft function. However, hypothermia was associated with a lower serum creatinine concentration and a higher creatinine clearance 1 year after transplantation.

### Hypothermia or machine perfusion in kidney donors [^e37c59c3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors (hypothermia vs. hypothermia plus machine perfusion) was published by Darren Malinoski and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Kidney transplantation and Brain death. In the Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors (hypothermia vs. hypothermia plus machine perfusion) study, the trial question was: is hypothermia alone superior to a combination of hypothermia and machine perfusion of the kidney in brain-dead organ donors? In the Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors (hypothermia vs. hypothermia plus machine perfusion) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors (hypothermia vs. hypothermia plus machine perfusion) study, the population was: 838 patients (317 female, 521 male). The inclusion criteria were adult brain-dead kidney donors. The key exclusion criteria were donation after cardiac death; end-stage kidney disease; or a history of dialysis during terminal hospitalization. In the Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors (hypothermia vs. hypothermia plus machine perfusion) study, the interventions were: n=359 hypothermia (therapeutic hypothermia at 34-35 degree Celsius) n=479 combination therapy (combination of therapeutic hypothermia and machine perfusion). In the Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors (hypothermia vs. hypothermia plus machine perfusion) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in delayed graft function in kidney transplant recipients (30% vs. 22%; RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.96). In the Therapeutic hypothermia in deceased kidney donors (hypothermia vs. hypothermia plus machine perfusion) study, the conclusion was: in adult brain-dead kidney donors, hypothermia was inferior to combination therapy with respect to delayed graft function in kidney transplant recipients.

### Therapeutic hypothermia in low-risk nonpumped brain-dead kidney donors: a randomized clinical trial [^ad3f0ad4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

More recently, a follow-up prospective randomized trial compared the efficacy of 3 strategies in reducing DGF in pump-eligible donors: donor therapeutic hypothermia (34-35 °C), ex situ hypothermic machine perfusion of the kidney, or their combination.In this trial, only pump-eligible donors were analyzed, and therapeutic hypothermia was found to be inferior to machine perfusion in reducing DGF after kidney transplant (adjusted risk ratio of DGF, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.35-2.17). In the present report, we thus assessed outcomes of the low-risk nonpumped kidneys from brain-dead donors to assess whether there is the benefit of therapeutic hypothermia in this lower-risk group of donors. We expected to see a similar kidney protective pattern of reduction in the rates of DGF in the hypothermia group. However, we found no statistically significant differences in the rates of DGF on univariate and adjusted analyses. The low-risk nonpumped group was predominantly composed of SCDs (472 [98%]), which by definition represented a younger and healthier subset of donors. Thus, despite its potential benefit in ECDs that are unable to undergo machine perfusion, therapeutic hypothermia does not appear to confer a similar benefit in reducing DGF in nonpumped donors.

Results

During the study period, 517 brain-dead organ donors (1033 kidneys) did not require machine perfusion per OPO protocol (ie, were non–pump eligible). Of these, 8 donors were disenrolled (due to meeting exclusion criteria, request by the donor’s family or the accepting organ center, or decision by the principal investigator), leaving 509 donors (1017 kidneys) randomized. Of the 1017 kidneys enrolled, 934 kidneys from 481 donors were transplanted with known DGF outcomes (reasons for nontransplant in the remaining 83 included 51 discarded, 21 not recovered, and 11 research). There were 474 kidneys randomized to the normothermia group and 460 to the hypothermia group (Figure 1). Mean (SD) donor age was 34.2 (11.1) years, and donor creatinine level at enrollment was 1.03 (0.53) mg/dL The non–pump-eligible population of the trial was stopped early due to operational reasons (a slower than anticipated enrollment in the non–pump-eligible arm and the grant funding period ending). As a result, the non–pump-eligible population stopped enrolling before the first interim analysis was conducted (which was planned to be conducted when 600 nonpump donors had known DGF outcomes). Thus, the sample size for the present analysis is much lower than the planned maximum of 1400 donors.

Donor characteristics are presented in Table 1 and were similar between groups. These were notable for a predominance of SCD donors (98% in both treatment arms) and similar KDPIs. The proportion of kidneys (by treatment arm) that were transplanted, discarded, not recovered, and used for research is presented in Figure 2. Recipient characteristics are presented in Table 2. Cold ischemia time was similar in the normothermia vs hypothermia group (16 [7.8] vs 15.5 [7.6] hours) as was the nonadjusted rate of DGF (18% vs 17%; OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.63-1.31; P =.61). When adjusted for prespecified covariates (creatinine level at enrollment, donor age, donor type, cold ischemic time, and OPO), the OR for DGF in the hypothermia vs normothermia group was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.64-1.33; P =.66). The results of the primary efficacy analysis are presented in Table 3.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for kidney transplantation, more specifically with respect to donor kidney preservation, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to use hypothermic machine-perfusion where available for deceased donor kidneys to reduce delayed graft function. Consider using hypothermic machine-perfusion for standard criteria deceased donor kidneys. Use low pressure values for hypothermic machine perfusion preservation. Ensure hypothermic machine-perfusion is continuous and controlled by pressure and not flow.

### Therapeutic hypothermia in low-risk nonpumped brain-dead kidney donors: a randomized clinical trial [^8034da35]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The present study represents the second population of the overarching trial: low-risk non–pump-eligible donors from participating OPOs. In this randomized study, the aim was to determine whether mild hypothermia was superior to normothermia (machine perfusion was not part of the planned interventions). The maximum sample size of 1400 donors for the present study was determined via simulation. The adaptive design report of the trial protocol (Supplement 1) details that a maximum of 1400 donors provided 90% power to detect an absolute improvement of 7.5% in DGF rates for hypothermia vs normothermia and 80% power to detect an absolute improvement of 6% in DGF rates for hypothermia vs normothermia. Due to funding and operational reasons, the trial was stopped before an interim analysis was conducted in the non–pump-eligible population. At the time the overarching trial was stopped, 517 non–pump-eligible donors were enrolled (Figure 1), leading to a total enrollment of 1427 in the overarching trial (including 910 donors from the previously published pump-eligible population), as listed on ClinicalTrials.gov.

### Hypothermia and kidney: a focus on ischaemia-reperfusion injury [^ede7f76b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Cellular damage after reperfusion of ischaemic tissue is defined as ischaemia–reperfusion injury (IRI). Hypothermia is able to decrease oxygen consumption, preventing a rapid loss of mitochondrial activity. However, even though cooling can help to decrease the deleterious effects of ischaemia, the consequences are not exclusively beneficial, such that hypothermic storage is a compromise between benefits and harm. The present review details the relationship between renal IRI and hypothermia, describing the pathophysiology of IRI and hypothermic protection through experimental evidence. Although experimental models of renal IRI are a valuable tool for understanding the pathophysiology of renal ischaemia–reperfusion, the clinical transfer of experimental results has several limitations, particularly because of anatomical and physiological differences. In this review limitations of animal models but also hypothermia as a strategy to protect the kidney from IRI are discussed. We also attempt to describe three clinical scenarios where hypothermia is used in clinical settings of IRI: transplantation, deceased donors and post-cardiac arrest.

### Therapeutic hypothermia in low-risk nonpumped brain-dead kidney donors: a randomized clinical trial [^75c235f7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Delayed graft function (DGF), defined as the need for dialysis within the first week following kidney transplant,is a common complication occurring in 25% to 31% of deceased donor transplant recipients in the US. Historically, it has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including increased risk of acute rejection and shorter graft survival,, as well as increased costs and length of hospital stay.Major risk factors for DGF include those associated with a higher risk allograft. Specifically, in the assessment of a deceased donor kidney quality, traditional risk factors included history of hypertension, donor age older than 60 years, terminal serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), and/or death from a cerebrovascular accident, based on which a kidney was deemed lower risk (Standard Criteria Donor [SCD]) or higher risk (Extended Criteria Donor [ECD]). More recently, the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) has been used as it combines 10 donor demographic and clinical parameters to yield a numeric quantification of deceased donor kidney quality relative to other grafts. In addition to these donor parameters, the presence of human leukocyte antigen antibodies and prolonged cold ischemia time increase the risk of DGF.

### Normothermic machine perfusion versus static cold storage in donation after circulatory death kidney transplantation: a randomized controlled trial [^7e625270]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study EVNP was published by Sarah A Hosgood and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Kidney transplantation. In the EVNP study, the trial question was: what is the role of normothermic machine perfusion in donation after circulatory death kidney transplantation? In the EVNP study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EVNP study, the population was: 290 patients (109 female, 181 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing donation after circulatory death kidney transplantation. The key exclusion criteria were donors aged < 18 year; donors in Maastricht Categories I and II; third and subsequent kidney transplant recipients; multi-organ transplants; dual kidney transplants. In the EVNP study, the interventions were: n=143 normothermic machine perfusion (static cold storage plus 1-hour ex-vivo normothermic perfusion) n=147 static cold storage (kidney stored using cold storage technique between donation and transplantation). In the EVNP study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in delayed graft function (60.7% vs. 58.5%; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.84). In the EVNP study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in primary nonfunction (4% vs. 2%; OR 2.34, 95% CI 0.56 to 9.86) No significant difference in median duration of delayed graft function (4 days vs. 6 days; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.34) Significant increase in creatinine reduction ratio on post-transplant day 2 (7.97 vs. 1.58; MD 6.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 12.7). In the EVNP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in incidences of biopsy-proven acute rejection, renal artery or venous thrombosis. In the EVNP study, the conclusion was: in adult patients undergoing donation after circulatory death kidney transplantation, normothermic machine perfusion was not superior to static cold storage with respect to delayed graft function.

### Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion in extended criteria donor kidney transplantation – A randomized clinical trial [^0d24f22a]. Clinical Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The study HOPE for Kidney Transplantation was published by Gerti Dajti and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Clin Transplant. This study is related to the following diseases: Kidney transplantation. In the HOPE for Kidney Transplantation study, the trial question was: what is the role of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion in patients undergoing kidney transplantation with extended criteria donor grafts? In the HOPE for Kidney Transplantation study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the HOPE for Kidney Transplantation study, the population was: 109 patients (47 female, 62 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing kidney transplantation with extended criteria donor grafts. The key exclusion criteria were donor age < 18 years; combined transplantation and donation after cardiac death grafts; hypothermic oxygenated perfusion already started at graft level; hypothermic oxygenated perfusion decided by investigator. In the HOPE for Kidney Transplantation study, the interventions were: n=54 hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (kidney grafts perfused through the renal artery at a pressure of 25-30 mmHg) n=55 static cold storage (grafts preserved with static cold storage alone). In the HOPE for Kidney Transplantation study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in delayed graft function (57% vs. 67%; ARD -10, 95% CI -28.75 to 8.75). In the HOPE for Kidney Transplantation study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in primary non-function rate (6% vs. 7%; ARD -1, 95% CI -5.86 to 3.86) No significant difference in delayed graft function duration (5 days vs. 8 days; AD -3 days, 95% CI -9.88 to 3.88) No significant difference in acute rejection (7% vs. 15%; ARD -8, 95% CI -20.2 to 4.2). In the HOPE for Kidney Transplantation study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in complications. In the HOPE for Kidney Transplantation study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing kidney transplantation with extended criteria donor grafts, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion was not superior to static cold storage with respect to delayed graft function.

### Normothermic and hypothermic machine perfusion preservation versus static cold storage for deceased donor kidney transplantation [^42c501ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for kidney failure. Donation, transport and transplant of kidney grafts leads to significant ischaemia reperfusion injury. Static cold storage (SCS), whereby the kidney is stored on ice after removal from the donor until the time of implantation, represents the simplest preservation method. However, technology is now available to perfuse or "pump" the kidney during the transport phase ("continuous") or at the recipient centre ("end-ischaemic"). This can be done at a variety of temperatures and using different perfusates. The effectiveness of these treatments manifests as improved kidney function post-transplant.

Objectives

To compare machine perfusion (MP) technologies (hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and (sub) normothermic machine perfusion (NMP)) with each other and with standard SCS.

Search Methods

We contacted the information specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies until 15 June 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing machine perfusion techniques with each other or versus SCS for deceased donor kidney transplantation were eligible for inclusion. All donor types were included (donor after circulatory death (DCD) and brainstem death (DBD), standard and extended/expanded criteria donors). Both paired and unpaired studies were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

The results of the literature search were screened, and a standard data extraction form was used to collect data. Both of these steps were performed by two independent authors. Dichotomous outcome results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Survival analyses (time-to-event) were performed with the generic inverse variance meta-analysis of hazard ratios (HR). Continuous scales of measurement were expressed as a mean difference (MD). Random effects models were used for data analysis. The primary outcome was the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF). Secondary outcomes included graft survival, incidence of primary non-function (PNF), DGF duration, economic implications, graft function, patient survival and incidence of acute rejection. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies (4007 participants) were included. The risk of bias was generally low across all studies and bias domains. The majority of the evidence compared non-oxygenated HMP with standard SCS (19 studies). The use of non-oxygenated HMP reduces the rate of DGF compared to SCS (16 studies, 3078 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88; P < 0.0001; I 2 = 31%; high certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis revealed that continuous (from donor hospital to implanting centre) HMP reduces DGF (high certainty evidence). In contrast, this benefit over SCS was not seen when non-oxygenated HMP was not performed continuously (low certainty evidence). Non-oxygenated HMP reduces DGF in both DCD and DBD settings in studies performed in the 'modern era' and when cold ischaemia times (CIT) were short. The number of perfusions required to prevent one episode of DGF was 7.69 and 12.5 in DCD and DBD grafts, respectively. Continuous non-oxygenated HMP versus SCS also improves one-year graft survival (3 studies, 1056 participants: HR 0.46, 0.29 to 0.75; P = 0.002; I 2 = 0%; high certainty evidence). Assessing graft survival at maximal follow-up confirmed a benefit of continuous non-oxygenated HMP over SCS (4 studies, 1124 participants (follow-up 1 to 10 years): HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77; P = 0.0005; I 2 = 0%; high certainty evidence). This effect was not seen in studies where HMP was not continuous. The effect of non-oxygenated HMP on our other outcomes (PNF, incidence of acute rejection, patient survival, hospital stay, long-term graft function, duration of DGF) remains uncertain. Studies performing economic analyses suggest that HMP is either cost-saving (USA and European settings) or cost-effective (Brazil). One study investigated continuous oxygenated HMP versus non-oxygenated HMP (low risk of bias in all domains); the simple addition of oxygen during continuous HMP leads to additional benefits over non-oxygenated HMP in DCD donors (> 50 years), including further improvements in graft survival, improved one-year kidney function, and reduced acute rejection. One large, high-quality study investigated end-ischaemic oxygenated HMP versus SCS and found end-ischaemic oxygenated HMP (median machine perfusion time 4.6 hours) demonstrated no benefit compared to SCS. The impact of longer periods of end-ischaemic HMP is unknown. One study investigated NMP versus SCS (low risk of bias in all domains). One hour of end ischaemic NMP did not improve DGF compared with SCS alone. An indirect comparison revealed that continuous non-oxygenated HMP (the most studied intervention) was associated with improved graft survival compared with end-ischaemic NMP (indirect HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.92; P = 0.03). No studies investigated normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) or included any donors undergoing NRP.

Authors' Conclusions

Continuous non-oxygenated HMP is superior to SCS in deceased donor kidney transplantation, reducing DGF, improving graft survival and proving cost-effective. This is true for both DBD and DCD kidneys, both short and long CITs, and remains true in the modern era (studies performed after 2008). In DCD donors (> 50 years), the simple addition of oxygen to continuous HMP further improves graft survival, kidney function and acute rejection rate compared to non-oxygenated HMP. Timing of HMP is important, and benefits have not been demonstrated with short periods (median 4.6 hours) of end-ischaemic HMP. End-ischaemic NMP (one hour) does not confer meaningful benefits over SCS alone and is inferior to continuous HMP in an indirect comparison of graft survival. Further studies assessing NMP for viability assessment and therapeutic delivery are warranted and in progress.

### Therapeutic hypothermia in low-risk nonpumped brain-dead kidney donors: a randomized clinical trial [^45bc7604]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

A pragmatic (designed to evaluate interventions in routine practice conditions), adaptive, multisite prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted between August 10, 2017, and May 21, 2020, across 7 states (Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, and Texas) and 6 OPOs. In this overarching trial,there were 2 donor populations (pump eligible and non–pump eligible) and enrollment was based on each OPO’s current pumping criteria. This study used data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The OPTN data system includes data on all donor, wait-listed candidates, and transplant recipients in the US, submitted by the members of the OPTN. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the US Department of Health and Human Services provides oversight to the activities of the OPTN contractor. The first study focused on the pump-eligible donor population and aimed to determine the relative effect of targeted mild hypothermia in the donor vs ex vivo machine perfusion of kidney grafts on kidney recipient DGF. As mentioned, pump eligibility was determined via OPO criteria, whereby some OPOs pumped kidneys with inferior organ quality (ECD status or high KDPI) or anticipated long cold ischemia time. There were 2 OPOs that intended to pump all kidneys, resulting in 4 OPOs included in the present report. The primary results of the population of pump-eligible donors were recently reported.The study was evaluated by the University of California, San Francisco, Institutional Review Board. It was determined that the enrollment of brain-dead organ donors did not constitute human participants research, and a waiver of informed consent for research on kidney recipients was granted. This report follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline for randomized clinical trials.

### Oxygenated versus standard cold perfusion preservation in kidney transplantation (COMPARE): a randomised, double-blind, paired, phase 3 trial [^3c3bc9ef]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Deceased donor kidneys are preserved in cold hypoxic conditions. Providing oxygen during preservation might improve post-transplant outcomes, particularly for kidneys subjected to greater degrees of preservation injury. This study aimed to investigate whether supplemental oxygen during hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) could improve the outcome of kidneys donated after circulatory death.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, paired, phase 3 trial was done in 19 European transplant centres. Kidney pairs from donors aged 50 years or older, donated after circulatory death, were eligible if both kidneys were transplanted into two different recipients. One kidney from each donor was randomly assigned using permuted blocks to oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion (HMPO 2 ), the other to HMP without oxygenation. Perfusion was maintained from organ retrieval to implantation. The primary outcome was 12-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation in pairs of donated kidneys in which both transplanted kidneys were functioning at the end of follow-up. Safety outcomes were reported for all transplanted kidneys. Intention-to-treat analyses were done. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN32967929, and is now closed.

Findings

Between March 15, 2015, and April 11, 2017, 197 kidney pairs were randomised with 106 pairs transplanted into eligible recipients. 23 kidney pairs were excluded from the primary analysis because of kidney failure or patient death. Mean eGFR at 12 months was 50·5 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 (SD 19·3) in the HMPO 2 group versus 46·7 mL/min per 1·73m 2 (17·1) in HMP (mean difference 3·7 mL/min per 1·73m 2 , 95% CI -1·0 to 8·4; p=0·12). Fewer severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb or more) were reported in the HMPO 2 group (46 of 417, 11%, 95% CI 8% to 14%) than in the HMP group (76 of 474, 16%, 13% to 20%; p=0·032). Graft failure was lower with HMPO 2 (three [3%] of 106) compared with HMP (11 [10%] of 106; hazard ratio 0·27, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·95; p=0·028).

Interpretation

HMPO 2 of kidneys donated after circulatory death is safe and reduces post-transplant complications (grade IIIb or more). The 12-month difference in eGFR between the HMPO 2 and HMP groups was not significant when both kidneys from the same donor were still functioning 1-year post-transplant, but potential beneficial effects of HMPO 2 were suggested by analysis of secondary outcomes.

### Oxygenated end-hypothermic machine perfusion in expanded criteria donor kidney transplant: a randomized clinical trial [^c3519563]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Continuous hypothermic machine perfusion during organ preservation has a beneficial effect on graft function and survival in kidney transplant when compared with static cold storage (SCS).

Objective

To compare the effect of short-term oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion preservation (end-HMPo2) after SCS vs SCS alone on 1-year graft survival in expanded criteria donor kidneys from donors who are brain dead.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial, kidneys from expanded criteria donors were randomized to either SCS alone or SCS followed by end-HMPo2 prior to implantation with a minimum machine perfusion time of 120 minutes. Kidneys were randomized between January 2015 and May 2018, and analysis began May 2019. Analysis was intention to treat.

Interventions

On randomization and before implantation, deceased donor kidneys were either kept on SCS or placed on HMPo2.

Main Outcome and Measures

Primary end point was 1-year graft survival, with delayed graft function, primary nonfunction, acute rejection, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and patient survival as secondary end points.

Results

Centers in 5 European countries randomized 305 kidneys (median [range] donor age, 64 [50-84] years), of which 262 kidneys (127 [48.5%] in the end-HMPo2 group vs 135 [51.5%] in the SCS group) were successfully transplanted. Median (range) cold ischemia time was 13.2 (5.1-28.7) hours in the end-HMPo2 group and 12.9 (4-29.2) hours in the SCS group; median (range) duration in the end-HMPo2 group was 4.7 (0.8-17.1) hours. One-year graft survival was 92.1% (n=117) in the end-HMPo2 group vs 93.3% (n=126) in the SCS group (95% CI, -7.5 to 5.1; P=.71). The secondary end point analysis showed no significant between-group differences for delayed graft function, primary nonfunction, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and acute rejection.

Conclusions and Relevance

Reconditioning of expanded criteria donor kidneys from donors who are brain dead using end-HMPo2 after SCS does not improve graft survival or function compared with SCS alone. This study is underpowered owing to the high overall graft survival rate, limiting interpretation.

### In silico deceased donor intervention research: a potential accelerant for progress [^161cd72d]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Progress in deceased donor intervention research has been limited. Development of an in silico model of deceased donor physiology may elucidate potential therapeutic targets and provide an efficient mechanism for testing proposed deceased donor interventions. In this study, we report a preliminary in silico model of deceased kidney donor injury built, calibrated, and validated based on data from published animal and human studies. We demonstrate that the in silico model behaves like animal studies of brain death pathophysiology with respect to upstream markers of renal injury including hemodynamics, oxygenation, cytokines expression, and inflammation. Therapeutic hypothermia, a deceased donor intervention studied in human trials, is performed to demonstrate the model's ability to mimic an established clinical trial. Finally, future directions for developing this concept into a functional, clinically applicable model are discussed.

### New strategies to optimize kidney recovery and preservation in transplantation [^f54c70c6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Optimizing kidney preservation is a primary issue in transplantation, particularly in relation to new donor sources, such as expanded criteria donors (ECDs) and donation after cardiac death (DCD). Kidneys from these donors are highly sensitive to ischemia-reperfusion injuries--the emblematic lesions encountered during transplantation. Despite years of research, static cold storage, with solutions designed in the 1980s, remains the gold standard in kidney transplantation. This kind of preservation, however, is unable to fully protect an ECD or DCD kidney, highlighting the need for novel strategies to improve kidney preservation or promote kidney recovery. This Review provides an overview of the emerging strategies to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injuries in donor kidneys and describes strategies that are aimed at the donor, organ or recipient to improve graft outcome. These approaches include management of donors, preconditioning of the kidney, improvements in organ preservation solutions, postconditioning and regenerative therapies of the kidney graft following transplantation. In addition, machine perfusion provides an interesting opportunity to evaluate kidney graft quality before transplantation. Overall, a combination of therapeutic approaches seem to provide the best outcome, but preclinical studies using relevant models are needed before these approaches can be incorporated into clinical practice.

### Machine perfusion preservation versus static cold storage for deceased donor kidney transplantation [^f10a999e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Retrieval, transport and transplant of kidney grafts causes ischaemia reperfusion injury. The current accepted standard is static cold storage (SCS) whereby the kidney is stored on ice after removal from the donor and then removed from the ice box at the time of implantation. However, technology is now available to perfuse or "pump" the kidney during the transport phase or at the recipient centre. This can be done at a variety of temperatures and using different perfusates. The effectiveness of treatment is manifest clinically as delayed graft function (DGF), whereby the kidney fails to produce urine immediately after transplant.

Objectives

To compare hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and (sub)normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) with standard SCS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies to 18 October 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing HMP/NMP versus SCS for deceased donor kidney transplantation were eligible for inclusion. All donor types were included (donor after circulatory (DCD) and brainstem death (DBD), standard and extended/expanded criteria donors). Both paired and unpaired studies were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

The results of the literature search were screened and a standard data extraction form was used to collect data. Both of these steps were performed by two independent authors. Dichotomous outcome results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous scales of measurement were expressed as a mean difference (MD). Random effects models were used for data analysis. The primary outcome was incidence of DGF. Secondary outcomes included: one-year graft survival, incidence of primary non-function (PNF), DGF duration, long term graft survival, economic implications, graft function, patient survival and incidence of acute rejection.

Main Results

No studies reported on NMP, however one ongoing study was identified.Sixteen studies (2266 participants) comparing HMP with SCS were included; 15 studies could be meta-analysed. Fourteen studies reported on requirement for dialysis in the first week post-transplant (DGF incidence); there is high-certainty evidence that HMP reduces the risk of DGF when compared to SCS (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90; P = 0.0006). HMP reduces the risk of DGF in kidneys from DCD donors (7 studies, 772 participants: RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87; P = 0.0002; high certainty evidence), as well as kidneys from DBD donors (4 studies, 971 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93; P = 0.006; high certainty evidence). The number of perfusions required to prevent one episode of DGF (number needed to treat, NNT) was 7.26 and 13.60 in DCD and DBD kidneys respectively. Studies performed in the last decade all used the LifePort machine and confirmed that HMP reduces the incidence of DGF in the modern era (5 studies, 1355 participants: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91; P = 0.002; high certainty evidence). Reports of economic analysis suggest that HMP can lead to cost savings in both the North American and European settings.Two studies reported HMP also improves graft survival however we were not able to meta-analyse these results. A reduction in incidence of PNF could not be demonstrated. The effect of HMP on our other outcomes (incidence of acute rejection, patient survival, hospital stay, long-term graft function, duration of DGF) remains uncertain.

Authors' Conclusions

HMP is superior to SCS in deceased donor kidney transplantation. This is true for both DBD and DCD kidneys, and remains true in the modern era (studies performed in the last decade). As kidneys from DCD donors have a higher overall DGF rate, fewer perfusions are needed to prevent one episode of DGF (7.26 versus 13.60 in DBD kidneys).Further studies looking solely at the impact of HMP on DGF incidence are not required. Follow-up reports detailing long-term graft survival from participants of the studies already included in this review would be an efficient way to generate further long-term graft survival data.Economic analysis, based on the results of this review, would help cement HMP as the standard preservation method in deceased donor kidney transplantation.RCTs investigating (sub)NMP are required.

### Past, present, and future of dynamic kidney and liver preservation and resuscitation [^badc60b4]. American Journal of Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

The increased demand for organs has led to the increased usage of "higher risk" kidney and liver grafts. These grafts from donation after circulatory death or expanded criteria donors are more susceptible to preservation injury and have a higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. Dynamic, instead of static, preservation could allow for organ optimization, offering a platform for viability assessment, active organ repair and resuscitation. Ex situ machine perfusion and in situ regional perfusion in the donor are emerging as potential tools to preserve and resuscitate vulnerable grafts. Preclinical findings have ignited clinical organ preservation research that investigates dynamic preservation, its various modes (continuous, preimplantation) and temperatures (hypo-, sub, or normothermic). This review outlines the current status of dynamic preservation of kidney and liver grafts and describes ongoing research and emerging clinical trials.

### Kidney grafts from brain dead donors: inferior quality or opportunity for improvement? [^75bb9813]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Major improvements in immunosuppressive treatment, surgical techniques, and treatment of post-transplant complications have contributed considerably to improved outcome in renal transplantation over the past decades. Yet, these accomplishments have not led to similar improvements in transplant outcome when the results of living and deceased donors are compared. The enormous demand for donor kidneys has allowed for the increase in acceptance of suboptimal donors. The use of brain dead patients as organ donors has had a tremendous positive influence on the number of renal transplants. Unfortunately, the physiologically abnormal state of brain death has a negative effect on transplant outcome. The fact that transplanted kidneys derived from brain dead donors have a decreased viability indicates that potential grafts are already damaged before retrieval and preservation. In this review, we present an overview of the current knowledge of (patho)-physiological effects of brain death and its relevance for renal transplant outcome. In addition, several options for therapeutic intervention during brain death in the donor with the goal to improve organ viability and transplant outcome are discussed.

### Utilizing pathophysiological concepts of ischemia-reperfusion injury to design renoprotective strategies and therapeutic interventions for normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion [^bbba053a]. American Journal of Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has emerged as a promising tool for the preservation, viability assessment, and repair of deceased-donor kidneys prior to transplantation. These kidneys inevitably experience a period of ischemia during donation, which leads to ischemia-reperfusion injury when NMP is subsequently commenced. Ischemia-reperfusion injury has a major impact on the renal vasculature, metabolism, oxygenation, electrolyte balance, and acid-base homeostasis. With an increased understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, renoprotective strategies and therapeutic interventions can be devised to minimize additional injury during normothermic reperfusion, ensure the safe implementation of NMP, and improve kidney quality. This review discusses the pathophysiological alterations in the vasculature, metabolism, oxygenation, electrolyte balance, and acid-base homeostasis of deceased-donor kidneys and delineates renoprotective strategies and therapeutic interventions to mitigate renal injury and improve kidney quality during NMP.

### Opportunities and challenges with the implementation of normothermic machine perfusion in kidney transplantation [^06ef6c70]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The Healthy People 2020 initiative is a 10 year national objective for improving the health in the US. The initiative pursues to “Increase the proportion of patients receiving a kidney transplant within 3 years of kidney failure (CKD stage 4-5)”. Furthermore, the Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative aims at doubling the number of available organs by 2030. One key objective to comply with this ambition is to increase the number of organs that are transplanted after procurement of deceased donor organs. To increase the number of transplantations, but also guarantee good outcomes, this requires an ability to limit organ injury caused by cold organ storage and to properly assess the donor organ quality and function prior to transplantation.

The outcomes after deceased donor kidney transplantation are generally good and there is a relatively high threshold to accept a marginal deceased donor kidney for transplantation. Nonetheless, in countries where the system penalizes below average transplant outcomes, a reluctance to transplant marginal or suboptimal kidneys is common

The fear of transplanting an imperfect organ outweighs the potential benefits. Hence, while the outcome of kidney transplant is generally very good, many patients remain on dialysis. This behavior inflates the number of patients remaining on dialysis for many years and with a poor prognosis –. The organ transplant rate in the US has steadily increased over the past 10 years and reached a record high in 2023, but the proportion of transplanted organs out of the pool of authorized organs has steadily declined (Fig. 1 ; srtr annual report,). According to the SRTR database, 18,527 organs were recovered but not transplanted in 2023. The proportion of discarded organs has grown from 13,8% in 2012 to 19,4% in 2023. Reasons for kidney discard including age, histology, presumed inferior quality and long ischemia times,. Over the past decade, 112,622 organs have been discarded in the US. At the same time, many kidneys were transplanted with sub-optimal outcomes –. A key determining reason for both these problems is the inability to accurately define kidney quality and kidney damage resulting from donor kidney history, the process of brain death, kidney retrieval, cold storage and transplantation. The decision to transplant a kidney is made by assessment of donor factors, in some cases histological evaluation and measurement of perfusion parameters collected during hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). HMP allows an assessment of flow and resistance indices to determine quality. However, the predictive value of these parameters to predict outcome has shown poor accuracy.

### Machine perfusion or cold storage in deceased-donor kidney transplantation [^769ea053]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Static cold storage is generally used to preserve kidney allografts from deceased donors. Hypothermic machine perfusion may improve outcomes after transplantation, but few sufficiently powered prospective studies have addressed this possibility.

Methods

In this international randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned one kidney from 336 consecutive deceased donors to machine perfusion and the other to cold storage. All 672 recipients were followed for 1 year. The primary end point was delayed graft function (requiring dialysis in the first week after transplantation). Secondary end points were the duration of delayed graft function, delayed graft function defined by the rate of the decrease in the serum creatinine level, primary nonfunction, the serum creatinine level and clearance, acute rejection, toxicity of the calcineurin inhibitor, the length of hospital stay, and allograft and patient survival.

Results

Machine perfusion significantly reduced the risk of delayed graft function. Delayed graft function developed in 70 patients in the machine-perfusion group versus 89 in the cold-storage group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; P=0.01). Machine perfusion also significantly improved the rate of the decrease in the serum creatinine level and reduced the duration of delayed graft function. Machine perfusion was associated with lower serum creatinine levels during the first 2 weeks after transplantation and a reduced risk of graft failure (hazard ratio, 0.52; P=0.03). One-year allograft survival was superior in the machine-perfusion group (94% vs. 90%, P=0.04). No significant differences were observed for the other secondary end points. No serious adverse events were directly attributable to machine perfusion.

Conclusions

Hypothermic machine perfusion was associated with a reduced risk of delayed graft function and improved graft survival in the first year after transplantation. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN83876362.)

### Delayed graft function in kidney transplantation [^332109f7]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Delayed graft function is a form of acute renal failure resulting in post-transplantation oliguria, increased allograft immunogenicity and risk of acute rejection episodes, and decreased long-term survival. Factors related to the donor and prerenal, renal, or postrenal transplant factors related to the recipient can contribute to this condition. From experimental studies, we have learnt that both ischaemia and reinstitution of blood flow in ischaemically damaged kidneys after hypothermic preservation activate a complex sequence of events that sustain renal injury and play a pivotal part in the development of delayed graft function. Elucidation of the pathophysiology of renal ischaemia and reperfusion injury has contributed to the development of strategies to decrease the rate of delayed graft function, focusing on donor management, organ procurement and preservation techniques, recipient fluid management, and pharmacological agents (vasodilators, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents). Several new drugs show promise in animal studies in preventing or ameliorating ischaemia-reperfusion injury and possibly delayed graft function, but definitive clinical trials are lacking. The goal of monotherapy for the prevention or treatment of is perhaps unattainable, and multidrug approaches or single drug targeting multiple signals will be the next step to reduce post-transplantation injury and delayed graft function.

### Normothermic machine perfusion versus static cold storage in donation after circulatory death kidney transplantation: a randomized controlled trial [^edf34905]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The total number of patients who had biopsy-proven acute rejection was 19 in the SCS group and 24 in the NMP group. The unadjusted mean number of biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes per patient was numerically higher in the NMP arm compared to the SCS arm (0.3 per participant versus 0.2, respectively) but was not statistically different (adjusted rate ratio (95% CI) 1.57 (0.83–2.95) for the MITT population; Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3).

Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were not statistically significant at 1, 3, 6 or 12 months after transplant in the MITT or per-protocol analyses (P values from the time by treatment interaction term: serum creatinine 0.19 and 0.096, respectively, and eGFR P = 0.42 and P = 0.15, respectively; Supplementary Table 4 and Fig. 2a,b).

### Benefits of active oxygenation during hypothermic machine perfusion of kidneys in a preclinical model of deceased after cardiac death donors [^6cfcb0d1]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Deceased after cardiac death donors (DCDs) represent a valuable source of organs; however, preventing poor outcome is difficult, even with the use of machine perfusion (MP). It is of paramount importance to improve this method. We proposed to evaluate the benefits of active oxygenation during kidney graft hypothermic MP using a novel perfusion machine: Kidney Assist (KA).

Methods

We used a pig model of DCD transplantation in Large White pigs. Cold preservation was performed by conventional non-oxygenated MP (KAnoO2) or oxygenated MP (KA).

Results

In the first 2 wk post-transplant, KA grafts displayed a lower serum creatinine peak and a faster return to normal levels compared with KAnoO2 animals, translating into a smaller area under the curve. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels and serum aspartate amino transferase levels were lower in KA animals compared with the non-oxygenated group. These correlated with better chronic function. Longer follow-up of the animals (3 mo) permitted evaluation of chronic outcome lesions. Interstitial fibrosis was reduced in the KA group, and these kidneys also displayed significantly lower levels of vimentin staining. Further histologic investigation also showed a trend toward decreased chronic inflammation in kidneys preserved with oxygen.

Conclusions

This new MP system is efficient in preserving DCD kidneys, greatly enhancing the capacity of the graft to withstand preservation stress and improving outcome. Oxygen delivery during preservation is thus valuable for highly damaged organs and offers an important therapeutic tool for transplant teams faced with decreased quality of donor organs.

### Management and investigation of neonatal encephalopathy: 2017 update [^38eeda3e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Redirection of care and organ donation

Mortality rates in moderate to severe HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia, are ∼25%.Most deaths occur after redirection of care, when clinical evidence supports brain death or devastating neurological injury. Guidelines for the diagnosis of brain death in the neonate are available;,they are, however, not often used. More commonly, clinicians and families agree to cease life-sustaining therapy when clinical assessment supports severe neurological injury—persisting encephalopathy and low voltage aEEG after rewarming±severe injury on neuroimaging.

Organ donation, from severely affected HIE donors, is becoming a possibility. In the USA, neonatal organ donation is more established, while in the UK it is gaining momentum.In one US cohort, profound central nervous system injury and/or encephalopathy was the most common cause of death for potentially eligible neonatal donation after cardiac death donors.Importantly, despite the global hypoxia ischaemia suffered in HIE, organs such as the kidney usually recover once transplanted. Eligibility criteria for donation and organs harvested differ between transplant centres. Commonly there are weight restrictions (ie, >2 kg) and potential donor organs depend on whether harvested before (ie, after brain death) or after circulatory death. Most cases of neonatal solid organ donation to date are of en bloc kidneys to an adult donor, harvested after confirmation of circulatory death—as was the case for the first neonatal organ donation in the UK in 2013.In the USA a neonate with severe HIE donated her heart, liver and kidneys after determination of brain death.To our knowledge, this has yet to be performed in the UK, due, until recently, to the lack of guidelines for determining brain death in the neonate. A guideline for diagnosing brain death in infants less than 2 months has recently been published by the UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.Other impediments to neonatal organ donation include a lack of awareness of available services and a reluctance of staff to discuss donation with grieving families. Families are increasingly aware of organ donation, and may be the first to raise the subject. Our advice is to always consider organ donation, discuss with your local transplant service as soon as possible prior to redirection of care, and offer the choice to the families of eligible infants.

### Protocols for uncontrolled donation after circulatory death: a systematic review of international guidelines, practices and transplant outcomes [^c601cc9e]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to compare the worldwide variability in practices, protocols, and transplant outcomes for uDCD in order to inform future protocol development and health policy. We conclude that uDCD is a viable option for increasing the organ donation pool. Despite variations in practice and heterogeneity of outcomes, uDCD yields success in kidney, liver, and lung transplantation. The implementation of uDCD has significant medical and logistic complexities, and international leaders should be recognized for their efforts. Depending on regional perspectives, there are a number of procedural, medical, legal, and ethical challenges that include definitions of refractory cardiac arrest, time limits for organ ischaemia, timing and type of consent required, determination of death, and organ-preserving interventions. Given the limited levels of evidence on which the current guidelines are based as well as the lack of both standardized definitions and processes between guidelines, it is not possible to recommend one protocol over another. Further standardization of guidelines and outcomes is required. Further research is required into the role of extracorporeal resuscitation and other novel therapies for treatment of refractory cardiac arrest of cardiac origin. The maintenance of trust by health professionals and by the public is recognized as a key point for the long-term success and widespread implementation of the valuable and promising uDCD strategy.

### A new approach in organ preservation: potential role of new polymers [^6d0af198]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The storage conditions of the donor kidney may influence the deleterious consequences of ischemia/reperfusion (IR), which remains a major source of complications in clinical practice. Delayed graft function (DGF), seen in 20% to 50% of transplanted cadaver kidneys, is a major risk factor affecting early and long-term graft survival, patient management, and costs of transplantation. Cold preservation plays a key role in this process and is based on hypothermia and high potassium solutions. In this review, the authors focused on the major molecular mechanisms of cold storage (CS) injury at the cellular level, which have been recently evidenced with modern biochemical and cell biologic methods. These newly uncovered aspects of cold preservation injury are often not fully addressed by preservation solutions in current clinical practice. The role of new molecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) is presented and their properties are analyzed in the organ preservation context. PEG improves organ function recovery and reduces inflammation and fibrosis development in several models. Because organs shortage is also a real public health problem, organs from non-heart beating donors or marginal donors are now used to expand pool of organs. As a consequence, the development of better organ preservation methods remains a major target and deserves scientific consideration.

### Improving outcomes in kidney transplantation through advances in donor organ perfusion [^5eb2905c]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

The global shortage of suitable donor kidneys is the primary challenge in kidney transplantation, and it is exacerbated by ageing donors with increased numbers of health issues. Improving organ assessment, preservation and conditioning could enhance organ utilization and patient outcomes. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is associated with better results than static cold storage by reducing delayed graft function and improving short-term graft survival, especially in kidneys recovered from marginal-quality donors. Although HMP is useful for organ preservation, it is difficult to assess organ viability during HMP because of the reduced metabolic activity at low temperatures, and the adoption of HMP has faced logistical challenges. The addition of oxygen during HMP is aimed at reducing ischaemia-reperfusion injury, but has shown mixed results in kidney transplantation, often depending on the duration of perfusion, although some studies found that the addition of oxygen improved outcomes in higher-risk donors. Normothermic machine perfusion helps to restore kidney function by delivering oxygen and nutrients at body temperature, potentially reducing ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Early studies suggest its safety, but clinical benefits remain unproven. Normothermic machine perfusion also holds promise for assessing organ viability pre-transplantation by enabling real-time evaluation. In this Review, we will summarize the different methods of kidney preservation, providing details of the effect that each method has on graft and patient outcomes and the strengths and limitations of each method.

### Molecular profile of urine extracellular vesicles from normo-functional kidneys reveal minimal differences between living and deceased donors [^062ebd38]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease is a public health issue, causing an important mortality rate and high economic impact. Currently, different replacement therapies for end-stage renal disease include haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation (KTx). Of these, only KTx improves the quality of life of the patients, and is clearly better compared to dialysis regarding patient survival.

KTx may be performed using organs from living (LD) or deceased donors (DD). Although the number of LDs has increased in the late years, the majority of transplanted organs come from aged DDs in a state of neurological death. Some of the most important parameters affecting patient’s survival after transplantation are related to age (of both donor and recipient), previous pathology of the recipient and the extent of the ischemia-reperfusion injury [,–]. It is widely accepted, and strongly supported, that transplantation from LDs offers better long-term outcomes than deceased organ transplants ; because of DDs are usually older, have more comorbidities and longer cold ischemia time than LD. Moreover, in order to maintain the organs in optimal conditions, hemodynamic stability, adequate oxygenation, the correction of hypothermia, diabetes insipidus and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected by drug administration. For these purposes, DDs might receive dopamine, noradrenalin and vasopressin among other drugs. In addition, specific antibiotic treatment might be administered if infection is suspected. All these maintaining interventions may modify the quality of the organ.

### Hypothermia vs normothermia on societal participation and cognitive function at 6 months after OHCA (...) [^3bd61539]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Is there an effect of targeted hypothermia vs targeted normothermia on functional outcome focusing on societal participation and cognitive function in survivors 6 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Findings In this predefined analysis of a randomized clinical trial, limitations in societal participation and cognitive impairment were common 6 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with no differences between the 2 intervention groups. Younger survivors reported more limitations in societal participation. Meaning In this study, targeted hypothermia had no significant effect on societal participation or cognitive function compared with targeted normothermia at 6 months in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Importance The Targeted Hypothermia vs Targeted Normothermia After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest trial reported no difference in mortality or poor functional outcome at 6 months after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

This predefined exploratory analysis provides more detailed estimation of brain dysfunction for the comparison of the 2 intervention regimens. Objectives To investigate the effects of targeted hypothermia vs targeted normothermia on functional outcome with focus on societal participation and cognitive function in survivors 6 months after OHCA. Design, Setting, and Participants. Limitations in societal participation were common regardless of intervention. Cognitive impairment was identified in 353 of 599 survivors. Conclusions In this predefined analysis of comatose patients after OHCA, hypothermia did not lead to better functional outcome assessed with a focus on societal participation and cognitive function than management with normothermia. At 6 months, many survivors had not regained their pre-arrest activities and roles, and mild cognitive dysfunction was common.

) trial5 reported no difference in mortality or poor functional outcome by the modified Rankin Scale at 6 months after OHCA. 5 A subsequent meta-analysis found no difference in 6-month mortality or functional outcome between temperature control with hypothermia and normothermia. 6 Guidelines for postresuscitation care were updated to recommend continuous monitoring of core temperature and active intervention to avoid fever for at least 72 hours in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. 7, 8.

### Organ storage in renal transplantation [^92fde445]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Kidney transplantation is vital for those with end-stage renal disease, enhancing quality of life and longevity. It is the preferred treatment but is hindered by a global disparity between donor kidney availability and demand. Therefore, optimizing organ storage techniques is crucial to mitigate the effects of ischemia reperfusion injury in available organs. Recent interest has centered on innovative methods like oxygenated normothermic perfusion and abdominal regional perfusion.

Recent Findings

Multiple recent metanalyses, including a Cochrane review, confirm the benefits of hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) for deceased donor kidneys, demonstrating its utility and cost effectiveness. The benefits of oxygenated normothermic perfusion have been seen in retrospective data sets but not in prospective trials. Abdominal regional perfusion (aNRP) is gaining interest, especially for liver transplantation, but kidney specific data are scant.

Summary

High-quality evidence backs the use of HMP for deceased donor kidneys. Despite interest in other techniques, clinical evidence for their benefits in kidney transplantation is lacking. The gap between innovation and verified success emphasizes the need for continued research and collaboration between medical professionals, researchers, and ethical committees. This review aims to further illuminate the complexities and advancements in the field, bridging the knowledge gap and aiding in the continual pursuit of excellence in transplantation.

### Expanding controlled donation after the circulatory determination of death: statement from an international collaborative [^4adf3dc1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Ex situ kidney perfusion and repair

The first Statement of NMP in kidney transplantation began in Leicester, UK with a series of 28 extended-criteria donors and 8 cDCDD kidneys. Circulating a red cell-based solution through the kidney allograft at near normal temperature for a brief 1-h period prior to transplantation reduced the rate of DGF from 36 to 11% in this cohort of patients. A standard cardiac pulmonary bypass technology was adapted to perfuse an isolated kidney.

A randomized controlled trial (Trial number: ISRCTN15821205) to assess the effects of 1 h NMP compared to static cold storage in DCDD kidney transplantation has completed recruitment and will be reported in 2021. The primary end point is the rate of DGF in the first 7 days after transplantation. Four UK transplant centres have participated in the trial (Cambridge, London, Newcastle and Edinburgh).

NMP can also be used as a device to test the quality of a kidney prior to transplantation. A particular advantage is the assessment of the microvasculature in DCDD kidneys that have been inadequately flushed at retrieval. The Leicester group is running a programme using NMP to retrieve and assess kidneys that have been discarded on this basis. A total of 21 kidneys have been assessed, 11 of these were successfully transplanted.

The results of the randomized trial will inform clinical practice for DCDD kidney transplants in the future. It is also likely that the technology will be used as an assessment device and as a platform for the delivery of therapeutic agents.

In situ organ preservation and repair

NRP has emerged as a strategy to reperfuse and reoxygenate organs in situ using an ECMO device, following the determination of death by circulatory criteria and before organ recovery. NRP is now routinely applied in cDCDD in France, Italy, Spain and the UK, and is being piloted in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland.

### Adopting orphan deceased donor kidneys for transplantation [^912fb2b0]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney transplantation is the best option for overcoming kidney replacement therapy in the end stage kidney disease population. Yet the number of available kidney donors remains limited. The use of aggressive kidney offers could serve as an alternative to address the shortage of donors and reduce the rate organ non-use.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed ten kidneys that were aggressively offered to our transplant center before being included in the non-usable organ pool. They were transplanted in a short period of time. Donor and recipient demographics, intraoperative data, and recipient outcomes were included in the analysis.

Results

Ten orphan kidneys were transplanted into appropriate recipients from three deceased kidney after cardiac death and three from brain death donors. The median cold ischemia time was 2,216 min, and median warm ischemia time was 25 min. Five recipients experienced delayed graft function. The median creatinine levels were 1.5 mg/dl, 1.5 mg/dL, and 1.4 mg/dL at 3, 6 and 12 months.

Conclusions

We successfully transplanted ten kidneys that otherwise would have been classified within the UNOS organ non-use rate. Several factors contributed to the successful utilization of these kidneys, including kidney biopsies, hypothermic machine perfusion, treatment during machine perfusion, and careful selection of appropriate recipients by the transplant team. The non-use kidney pool presents a valuable opportunity for enhancing kidney utilization for transplantation and increasing organ availability.

### Anastomosis time and outcomes after donation after circulatory death kidney transplantation [^bf9ef3b3]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

At every stage in the transplantation process for a deceased-donor kidney, time means ischemia. Donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidneys are already subject to warm ischemia in the donor, but another underappreciated component of warm ischemia time is the time required for anastomosis prior to reperfusion. We studied the effect of anastomosis time (AT) on outcomes after DCD kidney transplantation.

Study Design

This is a retrospective study of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, including all US adult DCD kidney transplantation recipients from 2009 to 2015 (N = 6,397). Our exposure was AT (time out of cold storage until reperfusion, quartiles). Outcomes included delayed graft function (DGF), death-censored graft survival, and overall patient survival. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression quantified the association of AT with outcomes, adjusting for donor and recipient factors (including donor warm ischemia time).

Results

AT accounted for 67% of total warm ischemia time on average, with a median AT of 38 minutes (median total warm ischemia 56 minutes). Longer AT (fourth [≥48min] vs first quartile [≤30min]) was associated with increased DGF (odds ratio = 1.19, p = 0.024) and increased graft failure (hazard ratio = 1.21, p = 0.043) but was not associated with patient survival. Comparing patients with the longest vs shortest AT, adjusted DGF incidence was 44.0% vs 36.7% (p = 0.024), and 5-year graft survival was 84.8% vs 88.2% (p = 0.004).

Conclusion

Prolonged AT is associated with worse graft outcomes in DCD kidney transplant recipients. Efforts to minimize rewarming during implantation and optimize AT may improve graft outcomes.

### The future of marginal kidney repair in the context of normothermic machine perfusion [^abb3dc75]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

2 STATE OF RENAL TRANSPLANTATION

The shortage of suitable donor organs remains one of the leading issues facing renal transplantation today. In an attempt to close this growing gap, the demographics of accepted kidney donations have changed over the past 15 years. Kidneys from extended criteria donors (ECDs) are being considered more frequently. ECDs are estimated to last an average of 5.1 years as compared to standard‐criteria donor kidneys, which are projected to function on average for more than 10 years. 9 In addition to ECDs, there has been a significant increase in the use of donation after cardiac death (DCD) kidneys. However, there is some hesitation in using marginal DCD kidneys due to exposure to conditions of warm ischemia prior to procurement. Prolonged warm ischemia has been associated with worsened long‐term outcomes in DCD kidney transplants. 10 These kidneys are thought to be markedly more susceptible to the deleterious effects of cold storage and as a result typically have higher rates of delayed graft function (DGF). 11 Due to this concern, around 13% of DCD kidneys retrieved are discarded, even though some of these organs may have yielded successful long‐term results. 12 There remains a need for new pretransplant therapies to address the increased susceptibility associated with ECD and DCD kidneys. Optimizing the use of these marginal organs will require developing comprehensive IRI therapies.

Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) for donors after circulatory death (DCD)—Historically, “abdominal organs have been recovered after DCD using rapid explantation followed by standard cold storage,” a strategy with “an obligatory period of warm ischemia associated with the diagnosis and confirmation of donor death after WLST, plus subsequent ischemia during cold storage,” which “has been implicated in worse postoperative outcomes for liver and kidney transplant.” DCD heart donation introduced “in situ (within the donor) and ex situ (without the donor) reperfusion techniques.” In situ recovery “uses extracorporeal circulation to reperfuse the chest and abdominal organs, thus more rapidly ending their ischemia,” with cerebral circulation “excluded by interruption of the aortic arch vessels.” Thoracoabdominal NRP (taNRP) “allows for heart recovery and in early clinical series is associated with satisfactory outcomes for heart, liver, and kidney transplant,” and “decreases WIT to visceral organs,” although “larger studies examining early and late outcomes are necessary to determine if the technique is superior to direct recovery.” For planned NRP, “donors have been co-located in recipient hospitals or a mobile team has been sent to donor hospitals,” and “The initial experience of New York University and Papworth have stressed co-location of donor and recipient.”

Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) kidney transplantation—Some studies suggest that DCDD kidneys are associated with a significantly higher rate of delayed graft function compared with donation after neurologic determination of death (DNDD) kidneys, while other studies suggest a similar rate of this complication. In one study of recipients with delayed graft function, graft survival in the DCDD recipients was better at 3 years (84%) compared with DNDD recipients (73%) (p < 0.05), and at 6 years (84% vs 62%, respectively). Ischemic exposure influences outcomes: in an evaluation of 100 DCDD donors, warm ischemic time of 30 minutes or more was independently associated with early graft failure but not with 12-month graft survival; in a study of 2,562 DCDD kidney transplants, DCDD donors younger than 50 years old with cold ischemic times less than 12 hours had long-term graft survival similar to that of standard donors, whereas for DCDD kidneys a warm ischemic time of more than 20 min and a cold ischemic time of more than 12 hours were associated with a significantly higher prevalence of primary graft nonfunction. Successful renal transplantation has also been documented in uncontrolled DCDD patients receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, irrespective of its duration.

### Effect of donor nephrectomy time during circulatory-dead donor kidney retrieval on transplant graft failure [^b4de9cb3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

When the blood supply ceases in a deceased organ donor, ischaemic injury starts. Kidneys are cooled to reduce cellular metabolism and minimize ischaemic injury. This cooling is slow and kidneys are lukewarm during nephrectomy. Smaller single-centre studies have shown that prolonged donor nephrectomy time decreases early kidney transplant function, but the effect on long-term outcome has never been investigated in large multicentre cohort studies.

Methods

The relationship between donor nephrectomy time and death-censored graft survival was evaluated in recipients of single adult-to-adult, first-time deceased-donor kidneys transplanted in the Eurotransplant region between 2004 and 2013.

Results

A total of 13914 recipients were included. Median donor nephrectomy time was 51 (i.q.r. 39-65) min. Kidneys donated after circulatory death had longer nephrectomy times than those from brain-dead donors: median 57 (43-78) versus 50 (39-64) min respectively (P<0·001). Donor nephrectomy time was independently associated with graft loss when kidneys were donated after circulatory death: adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1·05 (95 per cent c.i. 1·01 to 1·09) per 10-min increase (P=0·026). The magnitude of this effect was comparable to the effect of each hour of additional cold ischaemia: HR 1·04 (1·01 to 1·07) per h (P=0·004). For kidneys donated after brain death, there was no effect of nephrectomy time on graft survival: adjusted HR 1·01 (0·98 to 1·04) per 10min (P=0·464).

Conclusion

Prolonged donor nephrectomy time impairs graft outcome in kidneys donated after circulatory death. Keeping this short, together with efficient cooling during nephrectomy, might improve outcome.

### Peritoneal cooling may provide improved protection for uncontrolled donors after cardiac death: an exploratory porcine study [^e56c1ab2]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled donation after cardiac death (DCD) renal transplantation relies on rapid establishment of organ preservation interventions. We have developed a model of the uncontrolled DCD, comparing current in situ perfusion (ISP) techniques with additional peritoneal cooling (PC). Ten pigs were killed and subjected to a 2 h ischemia period. The ISP group modeled current DCD protocols. The PC group (PC) modeled current protocols plus PC. Two animals were used as controls and subjected to 2 h of warm ischemia. Core renal temperature and microdialysis markers of ischemia were measured. Preservation interventions began at 30 min, with rapid laparotomy and kidney recovery performed at 2 h, prior to machine perfusion viability testing. The final mean renal temperature achieved in the ISP group was 26.3 degrees C versus 16.9 degrees C in the PC group (p = 0.0001). A significant cryopreservation benefit was suggested by lower peak microdialysate lactate and glycerol levels (ISP vs. PC, p = 0.0003 and 0.0008), and the superiority of the PC group viability criteria (p = 0.0147). This pilot study has demonstrated significant temperature, ischemia protection and viability assessment benefits with the use of supplementary PC. The data suggests a need for further research to determine the potential for reductions in the rates of ischemia-related clinical phenomena for uncontrolled DCDs.

Kidney donor—fluid resuscitation strategy: Most studies investigating renal graft function in resuscitated brain-dead organ donors are either retrospective case series or uncontrolled observational studies, but appropriate management of DI, restoration of adequate intravascular volume, and correction for acidosis were all associated with lower rates of delayed graft function and improved serum creatinine levels prior to organ recovery. IV fluids should be administered to maintain euvolemic volume status and addressing ongoing fluid losses and electrolyte disturbances associated with DI.

### Challenges and opportunities in organ donation after circulatory death [^47018ef0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In a Eurotransplant cohort study analysing 18,065 kidney recipients, of which 1059 received a DCD organ, DCD kidney transplantation was associated with a 28% higher risk of graft failure compared to DBD (hazard ratio [HR] of 1.28 [95% CI 1.10–1.46]), and the duration of the asystolic time was an independent predictive factor for graft failure. Furthermore, for every 10‐min increase in warm ischaemia, there was an increase in the 5‐year rate of graft failure from 10% (asystolic time <10 min) to 35% if the warm ischaemic time exceeded 20 min. Similar findings were reported for liver transplantation, where the duration of the functional warm ischaemic time is considered the most crucial factor in risk stratification, with an accepted limit of 30 min and pancreas transplantation, where a longer asystolic time significantly increased the risk of graft failure 2.5‐fold (adjusted HR: 2.51, 95% confidence interval 1.16–5.43, p = 0.02).

Several studies demonstrated that mitigation of these risk factors—focused on reducing the asystolic warm ischaemic time, shortening CIT and selecting donors with a donor body mass index (BMI) ≤30 kg/m 2 —can improve DCD transplant outcomes. However, the interpretation of these risk factors varies not only among countries but also between individual centres and physicians, and with increasing experience, it has become clear that many of these limits have been chosen arbitrarily, highlighting the importance of considering these factors together, combined into a comprehensive donor risk profile. Furthermore, there are also important recipient factors that need to be considered when matching a particular recipient with a DCD organ. Recipient factors that are associated with favourable outcomes include young age, low model for end stage liver disease (MELD)‐score, patients without renal failure and patients not on ventilator (for liver transplantation). To address these challenges in liver transplantation, the UK DCD Risk Score was developed, using donor‐and‐recipient parameters to detect high‐risk and futile combinations and to help select appropriate donor and recipient combinations for DCD transplantation that minimize the risk of poor outcomes while reducing the risk of discarding viable organs, which may benefit from additional graft treatment. The risk score stratifies the donor–recipient pairs into three risk groups and involves the following risk factors: donor age, donor BMI, functional donor warm ischaemia, cold storage time, recipient age, recipient MELD‐score and re‐transplantation.

Key Points

Question

What are the experiences, practices, and perspectives of normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) by organ procurement organizations (OPOs) in the United States as of the end of 2023?

Findings

In this survey study of 55 OPOs with 100% response rate, 49 OPOs reported experience with NRP. There was wide variation in NRP experience and practice; 52 OPOs desired standardized guidelines related to NRP.

Meaning

These results suggest that improved standardization of NRP policies, protocols, and practices are desired and necessary to maximize organ donation and transplantation potential from donation after circulatory determination of death donors.

### Equivalent long-term transplantation outcomes for kidneys donated after brain death and cardiac death: conclusions from a nationwide evaluation [^3f26b21e]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Population

The Netherlands Organ Transplant Registry (NOTR) is a mandatory nationwide registry of kidney transplant recipients from all eight kidney transplant centres in the Netherlands. The NOTR registry is managed by the Dutch Transplant Foundation and includes recipient and donor characteristics, and a variety of outcome parameters (Table 1). In the first year after transplantation, registry follow-up is at month 3, thereafter on a yearly basis. Quality checks are performed by on-site polls, business rules in application and cross checks with the national dialysis registry. We retrieved data on recipient and donor characteristics, and transplantation outcomes for all procedures performed between January 1st 2000 and January 1st 2017. There were no missings for type of donor, graft survival or recipient survival. With respect to follow-up time for graft survival, 2.5% was missing and for recipient survival no missing for follow-up time. Missing percentages were higher for some of the clinical parameters. If appropriate the percentage missings for these parameters are indicated in Table 1.

Donor and recipient characteristics a, b.

Grafts were preserved via arterial cold perfusion, generally using University of Wisconsin (UW) or Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) preservation solution. Almost all organs were retrieved and preserved by means of static cold storage. However, as of 2016 most kidney grafts were preserved using hypothermic machine perfusion. Organs were allocated according to the Eurotransplant guidelines.

DCD kidneys were all from controlled circulatory death donors (Maastricht category 3 (controlled DCD: awaiting cardiac arrest after withdrawal of life-supporting treatments in the ICU). We excluded grafts from uncontrolled circulatory death donors (n = 136), as well as graft recipients younger than 12 years of age (n = 118), and combined organ recipients (n = 366). This resulted in 3611 DBD and 2711 DCD grafts available for final analysis.

### Response to American college of physician's statement on the ethics of transplant after normothermic regional perfusion [^1f8ed5af]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

This paper responds to the position statement released by the American College of Physicians (ACP) entitled "Ethics, Determination of Death, and Organ Transplantation in Normothermic Regional Perfusion (NRP) with Controlled Donation after Circulatory Determination of Death (cDCD): American College of Physicians Statement of Concern." The ACP's statement engages with critical ethical issues surrounding cDCD NRP, but several of their conclusions are flawed. Contrary to the statement, the practice respects the dead donor rule and the legal definition of death while honoring the wishes of the deceased and their loved ones to help save the lives of those in need of organ transplants. cDCD NRP is well established in many countries, it can enhance trust in medical practice and organ donation, and will increase the availability of optimal organs for life-saving transplants.

### Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion improves vascular and contractile function by preserving endothelial nitric oxide production in cardiac grafts obtained with donation after circulatory death [^690fd092]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

NO is known to initiate numerous cellular processes, including activation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase–cGMP–protein kinase G pathway and direct protein nitrosylation, some with cardioprotective effects. One of the key effects of NO is the prevention of ischemia–reperfusion‐induced cellular calcium overload by inhibiting the L‐type calcium channel.We measured a lower total tissue calcium in HOPE‐treated hearts compared with all other groups, reaching statistical significance when compared with CSS or HOPE and L‐NAME and bradykinin. In line with these findings, correlations of tissue calcium with several parameters showed statistical significance, including measurements of ventricular function, cell death markers, and the release of cytochrome C. The latter may indicate that the effect of NO associated with HOPE could have an impact on mitochondrial integrity.

In this study, we demonstrate that blocking NO activity during HOPE with L‐NAME leads to increased oxidative stress. Our group previously reported that the cardioprotective effects of HOPE in rat hearts require oxygen; hypothermic, anoxic perfusion does not provide the same benefits.Taken together, these studies support the concept that HOPE‐dependent reductions in oxidative stress result, at least in part, from the preservation of NOS activity and production of NO. Consistent with findings of high oxidative stress in the HOPE with L‐NAME group, tyrosine nitration was significantly higher, and total antioxidant capacity was significantly lower compared with CSS. Contrary to previous studies in liver, kidney,,and heart,our data show a picture in which HOPE does not lead to reduced oxidative stress when compared with CSS. It is important to note that effective HOPE treatment is likely achieved by providing the appropriate combination of oxygen delivery and cooling. If either fall above or below the effective range, HOPE may not provide optimal benefits. Furthermore, a minimal time of application is likely required. At present, HOPE conditions that provide the greatest cardioprotection have yet to be defined. It would be of value in future studies to investigate oxygen delivery and cooling thresholds, as well as treatment duration, to optimize HOPE therapy.

### Do we need a different organ allocation system for kidney transplants using donors after circulatory death? [^133e15c7]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Whilst long term outcomes and graft survival are similar between DBDs and DCDs, it has been well established that kidneys from DCD’s have higher rates of primary non-function (PNF) and delayed graft function (DGF) than from DBD kidneys [-]. These differences impact on in-hospital stay and overall costs which are consequently much higher in DCD compared to DBD transplants. Primary warm ischemia time (WIT) and haemodynamic events around the retrieval period are likely to be responsible for the increase in DGF/PNF in DCD kidneys and is accepted as an inevitable consequence of use of this donor source. DCD organs are being increasingly utilized due to the shortage of DBD kidneys and the ever expanding number of patients requiring a transplant. In the UK the use of kidneys from DCD donors has risen from 3% of all deceased donors in 2000 to 82% in 2012. Between April 2011 and March 2012, 674 kidney transplants from donors after circulatory death (17% increase compared with the previous year) took place and accounted for one in four of all kidney transplants. Hence, it is important to identify and overcome factors which may adversely affect the outcome of DCD kidney transplants both in terms of patient interest and health care economics.

In addition to warm ischaemic damage, cold ischemia time (CIT), donor age, recipient body mass index and pre-transplant dialysis are factors contributing to the risk of DGF [-]. Of these, CIT is probably the most readily modifiable factor for both DBD and DCD transplantation [-]. Minimizing CIT reduces not only DGF but also acute rejection episodes and graft loss which are both increased in cases of DGF.

When both kidneys from a single donor are allocated to the same centre which has been the standard practice in our region, the recipient operations are most likely to occur sequentially rather than simultaneously due to staff and operating theatre availability. An inevitable anticipated consequence of this practice is a substantial difference in cold ischemia times between the two recipients which then could potentially impact on graft outcomes. Conversely, if kidneys from a given donor are sent to different centres’ in close proximity, then similar CIT’s for both organs should be the anticipated outcome.

In this audit we compared the outcomes between paired DCD kidneys within our regional allocation policy of both kidneys being offered to a single centre. Our aim was to determine whether this policy resulted in clinically significant delays in the implantation of the second kidney with the increased CIT impacting on DGF and patient outcome.

### The duration of asystolic ischemia determines the risk of graft failure after circulatory-dead donor kidney transplantation: a eurotransplant cohort study [^0fa20aca]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Circulatory death donor (DCD) kidney transplantations are steadily increasing. Consensus reports recommend limiting donor warm ischemia time (DWIT) in DCD donation, although an independent effect on graft outcome has not been demonstrated. We investigated death-censored graft survival in 18 065 recipients of deceased-donor kidney transplants in the Eurotransplant region: 1059 DCD and 17 006 brain-dead donor (DBD) kidney recipients. DWIT was defined as time from circulatory arrest until cold flush. DCD donation was an independent risk factor for graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.46), due to an increased risk of primary nonfunction (62/1059 vs 560/17 006; P < .0001). With DWIT in the model, DCD donation was no longer a risk factor, demonstrating that DWIT explains the inferior graft survival of DCD kidneys. Indeed, DCD transplants with short DWIT have graft survival comparable to that of standard-criteria DBD transplants (P = .59). DWIT also associated with graft failure in DCDs (adjusted HR 1.20 per 10-minute increase, 95% CI 1.03-1.42). At 5 years after transplantation, graft failure occurred in 14 of 133 recipients (10.5%) with DWIT <10 minutes, 139 of 555 recipients (25.0%) with DWIT between 10 and 19 minutes, and 117 of 371 recipients (31.5%) with DWIT ≥20 minutes. These findings support the expert opinion-based guidelines to limit DWIT.

Perfusion repair for increasing organ transplantation success in cDCDD

The period of donor warm ischemia inherent to the cDCDD process, related to progressing hypoxemia and hypotension after WLST, can damage organs intended for transplantation and the liver and heart in particular, since the biliary and myocardial cells are highly susceptible to warm ischemia. Initial experiences with DCDD liver transplantation described high rates of graft dysfunction and non-function and of ischemic type biliary lesions (ITBL). Although complication rates have decreased in frequency with experience, the rate of post-transplant ITBL remains higher among recipients of DCDD grafts vs those obtained from DNDD donors. Development of ITBL leads to repeat biliary procedures and hospitalizations; up to 70% of patients with ITBL either require re-transplantation or die. Kidney transplants from cDCDD donors exhibit a higher incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), with similar graft survival and function in the short and mid-term.

Innovative approaches for the perfusion of organs recovered for transplantation are underway by ex situ (outside the body) machine perfusion of individual deceased donor organs and in situ (inside the body) regional perfusion of thoracic and abdominal organs in the deceased donor (see the Algorithm Fig. 1). Appropriate post-transplant outcomes have been accomplished with cDCDD kidneys and lungs without the necessity of dynamic perfusion strategies. Hence, developing countries need not presume that sophisticated preservation technology is a requirement for successful cDCDD kidney transplantation. Nevertheless, strategies of perfusion and repair are essential for cDCDD liver transplantation because of the complications that occur following cold storage of the liver, and to make cDCDD heart transplantation possible.

This section summarizes these recent advancements without preferentially recommending the approaches that are described.

Ex situ organ preservation and repair

Ex situ liver perfusion and repair

Most promising and actively explored methods of ex situ machine perfusion of livers include hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HMP) and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Both modalities can be applied either to replace static cold storage or after static cold storage at the center (post-ischemic) performing the transplant. While HMP reduces ischemia–reperfusion injury of DCDD grafts and may reduce the incidence of (biliary) complications after transplantation, NMP enables ex situ assessment of hepatobiliary viability of cDCDD livers prior to transplantation. In contrast to HMP, end-ischemic NMP has not yet been proven to reduce biliary complications. However, this technique may increase the number of transplanted organs through ex situ assessment and improve the condition of injured or marginal liver allografts.

### Impact of CRRT on graft outcomes in kidney transplantation from deceased donors with severe acute kidney injury [^6bd5380f]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Kidney transplantation (KT) from deceased donors (DDs) with acute kidney injury (AKI) has become increasingly common due to organ shortages. While AKI has traditionally raised concerns about graft quality, recent studies suggest that kidneys from donors with AKI can provide acceptable outcomes. These studies have primarily focused on comparisons between AKI and non-AKI donors, demonstrating that selected AKI grafts—particularly those from mild to moderate stages—can function well after KT.

However, fewer studies have evaluated outcomes from donors with severe AKI. Studies that have considered the role of renal replacement therapy (RRT), including continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), are even fewer. CRRT is frequently employed in critically ill donors with hemodynamic instability and severe metabolic derangements. Although its use reflects a higher severity of illness, CRRT might also stabilize the internal environment prior to procurement, potentially mitigating injury to the allograft.

A recent large-scale registry-based study has reported that kidneys from donors who have received dialysis are associated with a higher incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), although there is no significant difference in long-term graft or patient survival compared to non-dialysis donors. Similarly, a single-center study has demonstrated that kidneys from donors requiring CRRT yield excellent one-year outcomes when carefully selected, with both graft survival and patient survival being 100%. Another study has suggested that initiating CRRT after brain death in donors with oligoanuric AKI may improve hemodynamic stability and expand organ utilization, although kidney outcomes are not directly addressed in that study.

Despite these promising findings, prior studies have not stratified outcomes by AKI severity or explicitly evaluated the influence of CRRT as a modality distinct from other forms of RRT. Most available data treat RRT as a binary surrogate of donor severity without examining its potential therapeutic role in supporting early graft recovery.

Thus, this study aimed to address this knowledge gap by evaluating graft outcomes in recipients of kidneys from DDs with severe AKI and comparing outcomes across stratified groups based on both AKI severity and CRRT exposure.

### Protocols for uncontrolled donation after circulatory death: a systematic review of international guidelines, practices and transplant outcomes [^3733e198]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Ethical, legal, and logistic issues

To a variable extent, all of the included guidelines address a number of ethical, legal, and logistic issues associated with uDCD. Table 2 describes various issues in guidelines, including information provided to next of kin in the field (4/6), organ preservation initiated in the ambulance during transport (4/6), consent for cannulation and procurement (5/6), objective of inserting an intra-aortic balloon (3/6), health providers’ attitudes and beliefs (4/6), role of ECMO organ-preserving versus lifesaving technique (1/6), and cost-effectiveness considerations (4/6).

Guideline appraisal

To assess the rigour of clinical practice guideline development, the six documents from countries with national or regional guidelines were evaluated. Additional file 1 contains an appraisal of each of the guidelines. In accordance with the AGREE II appraisal process, scaled scores for each of six different domains are presented. After a global interpretation of the quality scores, we observed that lower scores for all the guidelines assessed were in the domains of “Rigour of development”, “Applicability”, and “Editorial independence”. The higher-quality scores were obtained in the domains of “Scope and purpose” and “Clarity of presentation”. In regard to the domain of “Stakeholder involvement”, the quality scores were low or fair for all assessed guidelines, with the exception of the New York City protocol, which obtained the highest score.

Main characteristics and protocol details of studies reporting transplant outcomes

Our review included 18 studies that reported outcomes for recipients of organs recovered by uDCD protocols. The main characteristics of the studies are described in Table 1 (“Eligible outcome studies” section) and are summarized here.

Types of studies and organs procured

The included studies were carried out at centres in Spain, France, the US, The Netherlands, and Russia. There were no randomized controlled trials; all studies were observational in nature. Three studies were prospective cohorts, one study was a prospective case control, one was a retrospective cohort with matched controls, three were retrospective cohorts with comparisons to cDCD or donation after brain death, eight were retrospective cohorts, and two were case series. The organs procured were kidneys (10 studies), livers (seven studies), and lungs (four studies). Although one study reported results for all three organs and another for two organs, most studies were focused on single-organ procurement.

### Equivalent long-term transplantation outcomes for kidneys donated after brain death and cardiac death: conclusions from a nationwide evaluation [^02052641]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dutch registry data confirm a higher susceptibility of DCD grafts for prolonged cold-ischemia as also reported for the UK-cohort. Remarkably, detailed exploration of this phenomenon showed that this negative impact is limited to a higher risk for early graft loss: prolonged cold ischemia times did not disproportionately impact early graft loss-censored-graft-survival and rejection episodes. Implying the decisions to accept these grafts should be primarily based on the consequences of early graft loss to the recipient.

Long-term survival and functional equivalence, and comparable rates of rejection-related graft losses for DCD and DBD grafts imply that under the current immunosuppressive regimens immunological aspects are not a main point of concern with regard to the use of DCD grafts. The higher incidence of delayed graft function and more profound impact of prolonged cold ischemia time on early DCD graft survival, and the pronounced negative effect of delayed graft function on DBD-graft survival rather points to differences in graft resilience. In this context, DCD grafts appear to sustain a more profound ischemic insult, which is compensated by a superior functional recovery potential. The latter is supported by the graft recovery analyses (eGFR) showing equal function for DCD and DBD grafts during prolonged follow-up. One could speculate that the differences in resilience relate to a negative impact of donor brain death on DBD grafts,, and/or activation of tissue protective responses such as ischemic preconditioning, and activation of the innate repair receptorduring the initial warm ischemia episode following cardiac death in DCD grafts. A further, and non-exclusive explanation is that incident delayed graft function in DBD grafts marks a poorer graft quality.

Multivariable analyses stressed the impact of the first warm ischemic period on incident early graft loss and delayed graft function. In fact, for incident delayed graft function the impact of 1 min of warm ischemia equalled the impact of 1 h cold ischemia. As such attempts to further minimize the first warm ischemic period could improve short term outcomes of DCD grafts. Longer anastomosis times primarily associate with early graft loss. Yet, it cannot be excluded that this association (partially) reflects technical difficulties during the transplant procedure. The analysis did not indicate cold-ischemia time as a negative factor for graft survival, this phenomenon may reflect the notion that the negative impact of cold ischemia times in mainly limited to ischemia times over 24 h, and the progressive awareness on avoiding long cold ischemia times in the Netherlands (Supplemental Table 2). As result the number of grafts with cold ischemia times exceeding 24 h in the current study is low.

### Equivalent long-term transplantation outcomes for kidneys donated after brain death and cardiac death: conclusions from a nationwide evaluation [^e4d81a1b]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

In the light of expressed concerns with regard to a disproportionate impact of longer ischemia times on DCD grafts outcomes, we specifically addressed the impact of prolonged (> 24 h) cold ischemia time on outcome. In fact, prolonged cold ischemia time disproportionally impacted early graft survival (viz. graft loss within 90-days of transplantation) in the DCD group (early graft losses: 17.1 vs. 10.7% in the DCD and DBD group respectively, P = 0.007). However, the similar conditional graft survival for grafts surviving the first 90 days (HR for graft loss (DBD is reference) 1.15 (0.82–1.62); p = 0.41) indicates that the disproportionate effect reflects impaired graft recovery.

Comparable 10-year graft survival for DBD and DCD grafts in the context of a more than doubled incidence of delayed graft function in DCD grafts implies differential impacts of delayed graft function on graft outcome in the two donor types. A discordant effect is supported by the differential impacts of incident delayed graft function on graft survival when censored for early graft loss (and recipient death) (Fig. 2 : HR for graft loss after delayed graft function 2.11 (95% CI: 1.73–2.57) for DBD grafts vs. 1.46 (95% CI: 1.22–1.75) for the DCD grafts, P = 0.001) (graft survival for DBD and DCD grafts without delayed graft function is reference)) and discordant associations between incident delayed graft function and graft loss in DBD and DCD grafts (Supplemental Tables 4–7).

The impact of delayed graft function on graft function (estimated clearance) on the other hand was similar for both donor types, with equal 1- and 5-year eGFRs in DBD and DCD grafts without delayed graft function, and approximately 12% lower eGFRs in grafts that sustained delayed graft function (Table 2).

### Opportunities and challenges with the implementation of normothermic machine perfusion in kidney transplantation [^ec43105b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 
Indications and current use of organ normothermic preservation devices

Kidney normothermic machine perfusion holds the promise to replace or shorten cold storage while enabling a thorough assessment of function and viability of kidney grafts. We expect this to facilitate a significantly higher utilization rate of procured kidneys. Further to the immediate impact on the number of organs available for transplantation, this technology may also serve as a future platform for transplant organ reconditioning, treatment and modification. While the demand is immense and the promise is apparent, the development of kidney NMP instruments and protocols is still evolving. In this perspective, we aim to describe the unmet needs in kidney transplantation and take a deep dive on the opportunities, but also the hurdles towards the clinical realization of kidney NMP in transplantation and beyond. While the opportunity is evident, the complexity of the task at hand still poses a big challenge.

Resuscitation of potential donors

Optimal and aggressive critical care of the potential donor begins long before the declaration of death. To ensure that the donor organs would be of utmost benefit to the recipients, efforts must be made to ensure optimal organ status through the process of referral, consent, and organ recovery. The following components of resuscitation would be useful in addressing some of these responses.

Hemodynamic monitoring

To guide resuscitation and support, a recommended practice is to institute some sort of hemodynamic monitoring. The growing use of and comfort with bedside echocardiography and ultrasound has led them to be used routinely to help guide resuscitation strategies.

Fluid resuscitation

The goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain optimal fluid status to preserve end organ perfusion. Fluid resuscitation is recommended to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8–12 mm Hg and a systolic arterial pressure between 90 and 140 mm Hg.

The role of vasopressin

After the achievement of adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressin should be considered as the first-choice hemodynamic therapy. Administration of vasopressin acts to inhibit the diuresis of DI and the resultant hypotension due to its catecholamine sparing effects and ability to counteract vasodilatation. Vasopressin is also usually seen to be deficient in donors who require catecholamine support.

The role of thyroxine

The hemodynamic instability in DNDDs is partly due to low circulating levels of thyroxine. Therapeutic replacement with T3 has been associated with significant improvements in cardiovascular status, reductions in inotropic support, and decreases in donors lost from cardiac instability.A ‘T4 protocol’ is recommended in situations where there are increased vasopressor requirements. This protocol consists of 1 ampule 50% dextrose, 2 g of solumedrol, 20 units regular insulin, and 20 μg of thyroid hormone (T 4), followed by a continuous infusion of 10 μg/h.

The role of insulin

After the development of neurological death, insulin levels have been measured to decrease to 50% of baseline at 3 hours, and even further to 20% at 13 hours.Keeping glucose levels under 150 mg/dL has been recommended for optimal outcomes.

Managing potential complications

Brain death is associated with numerous complications such as DIC, DI, NPE, hypothermia, and cardiac arrhythmias.Understanding and anticipating these complications is important for the managing physician. Early identification of these complications coupled with adequate supplementation is necessary to maintain hormonal balance, hemodynamic stability, and organ perfusion.

### Therapeutic hypothermia in "Expanded criteria" brain-dead donors and kidney-graft function (HYPOREME) [^e2dddf12]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Study Identification Study Status Sponsor/Collaborators Oversight Study Description Each year, only one third of patients registered on the waiting list receive a kidney transplant. Numerous paths are being explored with the aim of reversing this shortage. The first is to increase the number of organs by developing harvesting from donors in a state of brain-death termed "expanded criteria donors" or from patients deceased from circulatory arrest. Another fundamental factor is to insure the success of the transplant by limiting the dysfunction of donor kidneys, marked by a delayed graft function. The development of techniques to insure correct perfusion of harvested organs, and the optimization of reanimation and intensive care of brain-dead donors constitute important factors in DGF reduction. Therapeutic Hypothermia could to be an attractive care strategy for BD patients.

### Kidney donation after circulatory death (DCD): state of the art [^a0549fe1]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The use of kidneys from controlled donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors has the potential to markedly increase kidney transplants performed. However, this potential is not being realized because of concerns that DCD kidneys are inferior to those from donation after brain-death (DBD) donors. The United Kingdom has developed a large and successful controlled DCD kidney transplant program that has allowed for a substantial increase in kidney transplant numbers. Here we describe recent trends in DCD kidney donor activity in the United Kingdom, outline aspects of the donation process, and describe donor selection and allocation of DCD kidneys. Previous UK Transplant Registry analyses have shown that while DCD kidneys are more susceptible to cold ischemic injury and have a higher incidence of delayed graft function, short- and medium-term transplant outcomes are similar in recipients of kidneys from DCD and DBD donors. We present an updated, extended UK registry analysis showing that longer-term transplant outcomes in DCD donor kidneys are also similar to those for DBD donor kidneys, and that transplant outcomes for kidneys from expanded-criteria DCD donors are no less favorable than for expanded-criteria DBD donors. Accordingly, the selection criteria for use of kidneys from DCD donors should be the same as those used for DBD donors. The UK experience suggests that wider international development of DCD kidney transplantation programs will help address the global shortage of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation.

### Effect of donor age and cold storage time on outcome in recipients of kidneys donated after circulatory death in the UK: a cohort study [^95b51779]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Use of kidneys donated after controlled circulatory death has increased the number of transplants undertaken in the UK but there remains reluctance to use kidneys from older circulatory-death donors and concern that kidneys from circulatory-death donors are particularly susceptible to cold ischaemic injury. We aimed to compare the effect of donor age and cold ischaemic time on transplant outcome in kidneys donated after circulatory death versus brain death.

Methods

We used the UK transplant registry to select a cohort of first-time recipients (aged ≥ 18 years) of deceased-donor kidneys for transplantations done between Jan 1, 2005, and Nov 1, 2010. We did univariate comparisons of transplants from brain-death donors versus circulatory-death donors with χ tests for categorical data and Wilcoxon tests for non-parametric continuous data. We used Kaplan-Meier curves to show graft survival. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for donor and recipient factors associated with graft-survival with tests for interaction effects to establish the relative effect of donor age and cold ischaemia on kidneys from circulatory-death and brain-death donors.

Findings

6490 deceased-donor kidney transplants were done at 23 centres. 3 year graft survival showed no difference between circulatory-death (n=1768) and brain-death (n=4127) groups (HR 1·14, 95% CI 0·95-1·36, p=0·16). Donor age older than 60 years (compared with <40 years) was associated with an increased risk of graft loss for all deceased-donor kidneys (2·35, 1·85-3·00, p<0·0001) but there was no increased risk of graft loss for circulatory-death donors older than 60 years compared with brain-death donors in the same age group (p=0·30). Prolonged cold ischaemic time (>24 h vs <12 h) was not associated with decreased graft survival for all deceased-donor kidneys but was associated with poorer graft survival for kidneys from circulatory-death donors than for those from brain-death donors (2·36, 1·39-4·02, p for interaction=0·004).

Interpretation

Kidneys from older circulatory-death donors have equivalent graft survival to kidneys from brain-death donors in the same age group, and are acceptable for transplantation. However, circulatory-death donor kidneys tolerate cold storage less well than do brain-death donor kidneys and this finding should be considered when developing organ allocation policy.

### Advancing the science of organ donor management [^a6989b15]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Though hypothesized, the mechanism for reduced dose and duration of vasopressors with low dose hydrocortisone is still unclear. Similar results have been found with corticosteroid use in other disease states such as septic shock, perhaps as a result of increasing cardiac and vascular sensitivity to catecholamines. Future adoption of best practice in donor management needs to be guided with a deeper understanding of biologic mechanisms and effective interventions. The physiology for organ systems failure after brain death is complex and multifactorial. For example, the documented pro-inflammatory environment in the potential donor has yet to translate into antiflammatory therapies that improve graft function. Optimization of the donor with multimodal approaches including hormonal therapy need to be individualized and based on our increasing knowledge of physiology during the dying process.

Current donor management studies often suffer from paradigm challenges. Traditional ICU interventional studies aim to improve organ function and meaningful outcomes in the patient receiving those interventions. Meanwhile, donor management studies seek to improve organ function in situ of another patient, the transplant recipient. Numerous uncontrollable variables independent of donor management impact on transplant outcomes (transplant logistics, surgical procurement, preservation, storage, immunosuppressive therapies, recipient conditions, and so on). While improving transplant outcomes is clearly the most important goal, it may not be the most scientifically valid outcome. The scientific question should first assess whether a specific strategy improves organ function in the brain-dead donor themselves, and then second, assess whether improved donor organ function leads to increased organ utilization and transplant graft survival. Outcomes analysis should change from traditional graft survival to specific physiologic goal-directed targets relevant at the bedside of the donor. We would propose that physiologic outcomes and end organ function, such as haemodynamics, cardiac ejection fraction, oxygenation status, hepatic markers, and renal function, need to be prospectively measured to identify specific benefits of specific donor management therapies.

### The impact of cold ischemia time on renal transplant outcome [^2c553fed]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Cold ischemia triggers a cascade of noxious effects, which are amplified by restoration of blood supply reperfusion. These injuries generate inflammatory and immune responses that may potentially result in delayed graft function, enhanced alloimmune reactivity, and development of progressive pathological changes. Debout et al. outline the clinical importance of cold ischemia time in renal transplantation by demonstrating that each additional hour of cold ischemia can increase the risk of allograft failure and death.

End stage kidney disease and dialysis are lifetime limiting and lifestyle-defining conditions with enormous costs to the health care system. Despite a severe organ shortage, thousands of organs that are retrieved for transplantation go to waste every year because of the presumed inadequacy of organ quality and/or the limited organ preservation time. Normothermic kidney machine perfusion (NMP) holds the potential to resolve this through improved preservation, prolonged preservation time, kidney quality assessment, reconditioning and treatment. We herein develop a perspective on the potential, but also the hurdles towards the breakthrough of this technology.

This systematic review has several limitations. Although organisations provided us with draft protocols or guidelines for uDCD, only fully developed guidelines were included in the review, reducing the overall scope of guidelines to assess. The AGREE II appraisal process was used to assess the quality of guideline development. Though well supported, this tool is not the only accepted method for this purpose. The lack of homogenous data from the studies reporting transplant outcomes also precluded a meta-analysis and prevented the linking of outcomes to specific protocols used for the uDCD process.

### Use and outcomes of kidneys from donation after circulatory death donors in the United States [^40ff73d1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors are an important source of kidneys for transplantation, but DCD donor transplantation is less common in the United States than in other countries. In this study of national data obtained between 2008 and 2015, recovery of DCD kidneys varied substantially among the country's 58 donor service areas, and 25% of DCD kidneys were recovered in only four donor service areas. Overall, 20% of recovered DCD kidneys were discarded, varying from 3% to 33% among donor service areas. Compared with kidneys from neurologically brain dead (NBD) donors, DCD kidneys had a higher adjusted odds ratio of discard that varied from 1.25 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 1.34) in kidneys with total donor warm ischemic time (WIT) of 10-26 minutes to 2.67 (95% CI, 2.34 to 3.04) in kidneys with total donor WIT >48 minutes. Among the 12,831 DCD kidneys transplanted, kidneys with WIT≤48 minutes had survival similar to that of NBD kidneys. DCD kidneys with WIT>48 minutes had a higher risk of allograft failure (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.41), but this risk was limited to kidneys with cold ischemia time (CIT) >12 hours. We conclude that donor service area-level variation in the recovery and discard of DCD kidneys is large. Additional national data collection is needed to understand the potential to increase DCD donor transplantation in the United States. Strategies to minimize cold ischemic injury may safely allow increased use of DCD kidneys with WIT>48 minutes.

### Donor time to death and kidney transplant outcomes in the setting of a 3-hour minimum wait policy [^866f0f43]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This national cohort study was performed using prospectively collected data from the UK Transplant Registry, derived from the 23 UK kidney transplant units. NHS Blood and Transplant granted data access after internal review board approval. NHS Blood and Transplant also determined that study-specific ethical review or approval was not required, nor was study-specific informed consent. We included adult (aged ≥18 years at the time of transplant) recipients of Maastricht criteria III DCD kidney-only transplants performed between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2021.Exclusion criteria were multiorgan transplants (including simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplants), dual kidney transplants, and ABO-incompatible transplants or human leukocyte antigen antibody–incompatible transplants (n = 71). Pretreatment of DCD donors with heparin is not performed in the UK. Data were extracted on October 27, 2023. Ethnicity is reported here exactly as provided by the UK Transplant Registry; there are no additional data on the ethnic minorities coded as “other.” Ethnicity is known to affect outcomes in the UK setting, and was therefore required as a confounder to assess the independent association of TTD with posttransplant outcomes. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

The primary exposure was TTD, defined as the time from WLST until mechanical asystole. The UK has a 5-minute “hands-off” period after mechanical asystole, after which death is confirmed and DCD donation proceeds. Asystolic time was defined as the time between mechanical asystole and aortic cold flush or start of normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). Definitions of TTD, functional TTD (fTTD), and other ischemic times can be found in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. Time-to-death values over 600 minutes (n = 19) were deemed likely timestamp errors and removed. UK policy states: “Abdominal teams must wait at least three hours for the onset of functional warm ischaemia (defined as systolic BP [blood pressure] <50 mm Hg). If the systolic blood pressure has not fallen <50 mm Hg [at three hours] then they may stand down at that stage.”Kidney allocation was via a national offering scheme during the years 2019 to 2021, and a hybrid national and local scheme during the years 2013 to 2019. The withdrawal process was identical to that for nondonating persons.

### Prolonged warm ischemia time is associated with graft failure and mortality after kidney transplantation [^354aba00]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Warm ischemia time is a potentially modifiable insult to transplanted kidneys, but little is known about its effect on long-term outcomes. Here we conducted a study of United States kidney transplant recipients (years 2000-2013) to determine the association between warm ischemia time (the time from organ removal from cold storage to reperfusion with warm blood) and death/graft failure. Times under 10 minutes were potentially attributed to coding error. Therefore, the 10-to-under-20-minute interval was chosen as the reference group. The primary outcome was mortality and graft failure (return to chronic dialysis or preemptive retransplantation) adjusted for recipient, donor, immunologic, and surgical factors. The study included 131,677 patients with 35,901 events. Relative to the reference patients, times of 10 to under 20, 20 to under 30, 30 to under 40, 40 to under 50, 50 to under 60, and 60 and more minutes were associated with hazard ratios of 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.15), 1.13 (1.06-1.22), 1.17 (1.09-1.26), 1.20 (1.12-1.30), and 1.23 (1.15-1.33) for the composite event, respectively. Association between prolonged warm ischemia time and death/graft failure persisted after stratification by donor type (living vs. deceased donor) and delayed graft function status. Thus, warm ischemia time is associated with adverse long-term patient and graft survival after kidney transplantation. Identifying strategies to reduce warm ischemia time is an important consideration for future study.

The importance of developing endpoints for the further development of NMP

NMP of kidney grafts can target several unmet needs. As with all innovations in health care, the path from an invention to clinical routine application is long and complex. The definition of a clinical trial path, of endpoints that are both acceptable to the regulating bodies, but also providing a robust indication, the size that makes it reasonable and economically sustainable to perform such a trial, the cost/benefit ratio on the market and many more aspects need to be met for the technology to be successful.

Learning from the evolution of NMP in other organs such as the liver, the pathway towards approval of preservation devices is depending on the temperature at which organs are preserved. While hypothermic preservation devices are class II medical devices (considered moderate risk classification for regulatory approval), normothermic preservation devices, typically used with blood-based preservation solutions, are mostly qualified as class IIb (higher risk within class II, often requiring more detailed evaluations) or III (high risk devices, requires Premarket Approval (PMA), with extensive safety and efficacy testing prior to clinical use),. This categorization largely determines the path towards clinical development. The second key determination is the establishment of an indication for use. For currently existing NMP devices, the safety as displayed by a CE mark have been established, but no pivotal trials and hence no indications for its use have been developed. A careful determination of the indication for use, the development of a safe and effective preservation device and perfusion recipe and clarification of logistics together with a robust cost/benefit ratio are the critical factors for success of kidney NMP. Minimizing the cold ischemic injury preservation time is an important objective for the development of NMP. A porcine model showed that protective effects of NMP corresponded with the achieved reduction in cold storage time. DCD grafts not exposed to cold storge but preserved with NMP over a prolonged period had excellent outcomes, comparable to porcine living donor kidney transplantation. Prolonged NMP could exhibit additional benefits: kidney transplantation would eventually be transformed into a semi-elective daytime procedure. In addition, portable NMP devices could allow to shorten or eliminate cold storage times, extend total preservation times and hence enable organ sharing over longer distances. This would be particularly meaningful in the context of hard-to place kidneys where the search for a recipient could be extended without adding cold storage time. The time added to the process would also be beneficial for “hard to transplant patients” such as patients with high panel reactive antibodies. Due to their immunological profile, the pool of donor kidneys that are immunologically compatible with the recipient is much smaller. Hence the travel time for kidneys would often be longer. Also, pretreatment of the recipient through e.g. immunoadsorption could be become possible with NMP. A corresponding measurable endpoint would be the waiting time for hard-to-transplant patients and the utilization rate of hard to place (HTP) kidneys. Such a concept is currently being tested by 34 Lives. In a first clinical trial, HTP kidneys are machine perfused at their center and then shipped to a recipient site after testing and advanced matching (Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06263023). With a similar intention, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network supports a protocol for “accelerated placement of hard-to-place kidneys”. In this study, participating centers will offer kidneys with a kidney donor profile index of 75% and higher (indicating that kidneys are of sub-optimal quality), to high priority kidney transplant candidates.

### American society of transplant surgeons recommendations on best practices in donation after circulatory death organ procurement [^e1086fcf]. American Journal of Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Transplant Surgeons supports efforts to increase the number of organs that are critically needed for patients desperately awaiting transplantation. In the United States, transplantation using organs procured from donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors has continued to increase in number. Despite these increases, substantial variability in the utilization and practices of DCD transplantation still exists. To improve DCD organ utilization, it is important to create a set of best practices for DCD recovery. The following recommendations aim to provide guidance on contemporary issues surrounding DCD organ procurement in the United States. A work group was composed of members of the American Society of Transplant Surgeon Scientific Studies Committee and the Thoracic Organ Transplantation Committee. The following topics were identified by the group either as controversial or lacking standardization: prewithdrawal preparation, definition of donor warm ischemia time, DCD surgical technique, combined thoracic and abdominal procurements, and normothermic regional perfusion. The proposed recommendations were classified on the basis of the grade of available evidence and the strength of the recommendation. This information should be valuable for transplant programs as well as for organ procurement organizations and donor hospitals as they develop robust DCD donor procurement protocols.

### Donor time to death and kidney transplant outcomes in the setting of a 3-hour minimum wait policy [^71356494]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Association With Graft Survival

Figure 3 A shows a Kaplan-Meier plot as a visual display of death-censored graft survival stratified by TTD. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association of TTD with graft survival (censored at 5 years; 799 events) (eTable 8 in Supplement 1). Time to death was not associated with this long-term outcome; the adjusted hazard ratio for graft survival was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.95-1.07; P =.92) each time TTD doubled. Cold ischemic time and second warm ischemic time were independently associated with graft survival, while asystolic and nephrectomy time were not (eTable 8 in Supplement 1).

Association of Time to Death and Other Key Variables With Death-Censored Graft Survival

A, Kaplan-Meier plot as a visual representation of time-to-death categories. B, Donor age. C, Time to death (withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment to mechanical asystole). D, Asystolic time. Restricted cubic splines had 4 knots and were adjusted for all factors in eTable 8 in Supplement 1. Results were pooled from 20 imputed datasets. Includes patients with complete graft survival follow-up data (n = 7113). HR indicates hazard ratio.

All these findings were confirmed on restricted cubic spline modeling (Figure 3 B-D; eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). These splines revealed the association between donor age and graft survival to be nonlinear (χ 2 2 = 9.69; P =.008). Analysis of transplant survival (graft loss or patient death) was consistent with the death-censored graft survival model regarding TTD and ischemic times (eTable 9 in Supplement 1).

### Normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion preserves mitochondrial and graft function after warm ischemia and is further enhanced by AP39 [^c8ae40e8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The optimal renal replacement therapy for patients with end-stage kidney disease is kidney transplantation. Expanding the use of marginal grafts and increasing the donor pool are essential strategies to shorten the waiting period for deceased donor kidney transplantation. Although static cold storage (SCS) is widely used worldwide because of its simplicity, this preservation method has been reported to decrease the metabolic activity of the organ and aggravate ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an unavoidable insult that occurs during organ preservation and is caused by a decrease in oxygen supply during ischemia, which causes cells to switch to anaerobic metabolism and impairs mitochondrial function. Accumulation of succinate and reversal of electron transport in the mitochondrial complex during reperfusion leads to reactive oxygen species release and mitochondrial injury, which is reflected in reduced ATP production, triggering inflammation and organ damage –. These observations highlight the importance of maintaining cellular mitochondrial function during organ preservation.

We have studied NEVKP as a method to maintain kidneys in a physiological environment ex vivo. We have reported that NEVKP is superior in organ protection compared to SCS. More recently, through proteomic and genomic approaches, we found that NEVKP maintains the levels of key proteins involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis in porcine kidneys in a model of donation after cardiac death (DCD). We also reported that NEVKP promotes the expression of genes related to mitochondrial metabolism. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports evaluating mitochondrial function using live cells from preserved organs. In this study, using a porcine kidney autotransplantation model we showed that NEVKP has a superior mitochondrial protective effect as compared to SCS and that NEVKP prevents subsequent oxidative stress and inflammation.

In recent years, NEVKP has been recognized as an emerging platform for therapeutic interventions. The ability to offer a near-physiological environment ex vivo provides the opportunity to modify a single organ prior to transplantation through cell therapy or drug administration,. AP39 is a compound used to supply hydrogen sulfide (H2S) within mitochondria. Hydrogen sulfide released from AP39, which has a mitochondrial target domain, has been shown to function as an electron donor at the mitochondrial membrane, supporting mitochondrial electron transport and ATP production,. While there have been reports of organ protection using AP39,, to our knowledge, there are no reports of AP39 administered during NEVKP in large animals followed by transplantation. In this study, we aimed to enhance graft protection from ischemia by administering AP39 during perfusion after prolonged warm ischemia to stimulate the mitochondrial metabolic capacity of the cells of the renal cortex, thus further improving graft survival.

### Analysis of factors that affect outcome after transplantation of kidneys donated after cardiac death in the UK: a cohort study [^e2c80105]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

A third of all kidneys from deceased donors in the UK are donated after cardiac death, but concerns have been raised about the long-term outcome of such transplants. We aimed to establish these outcomes for kidneys donated after controlled cardiac death versus brain death, and to identify the factors that affect graft survival and function.

Methods

We used data from the UK transplant registry to select a cohort of deceased kidney donors and the corresponding transplant recipients (aged ≥18 years) for transplantations done between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2007. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess graft survival, and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with graft survival and with long-term renal function, which was measured from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Findings

9134 kidney transplants were done in 23 centres; 8289 kidneys were donated after brain death and 845 after controlled cardiac death. First-time recipients of kidneys from cardiac-death donors (n=739) or brain-death donors (n=6759) showed no difference in graft survival up to 5 years (hazard ratio 1·01, 95% CI 0·83 to 1·19, p=0·97), or in eGFR at 1-5 years after transplantation (at 12 months -0·36 mL/min per 1·73 m(2), 95% CI -2·00 to 1·27, p=0·66). For recipients of kidneys from cardiac-death donors, increasing age of donor and recipient, repeat transplantation, and cold ischaemic time of more than 12 h were associated with worse graft survival; grafts from cardiac-death donors that were poorly matched for HLA had an association with inferior outcome that was not significant, and delayed graft function and warm ischaemic time had no effect on outcome.

Interpretation

Kidneys from controlled cardiac-death donors provide good graft survival and function up to 5 years in first-time recipients, and are equivalent to kidneys from brain-death donors. Allocation policy for kidneys from cardiac-death donors should reduce cold ischaemic time, avoid large age mismatches between donors and recipients, and restrict use of kidneys poorly matched for HLA in young recipients.

### Standardized deceased donor kidney donation rates in the UK reveal marked regional variation and highlight the potential for increasing kidney donation: a prospective cohort study [^82d0616e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Editor's key points

There is a significant shortfall in the availability of donor kidneys for transplantation.
Factors influencing donor rates were studied in a large cohort of patients who died in UK intensive care units.
Significant factors included: type of unit, region, age, and ethnicity.

Kidney transplantation prolongs life, improves quality-of-life and is more cost-effective than dialysis.However, there is a severe global shortage of kidneys for transplantation and a continuing need for countries to improve deceased donor kidney donation rates.

The most common mode of deceased donation is donation after brain death (DBD).Transplantable kidneys can also be recovered from patients whose death is determined according to cardiorespiratory criteria after planned withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments within a critical care setting. This is known as controlled donation after circulatory death (DCD). Although kidneys from controlled DCD donors incur a variable period of warm ischaemic injury at the time of donation, concerns that they are inferior to DBD donor kidneys have been allayed by recent registry data from both the UK and the USA. –

In 2008, the UK Organ Donation Taskforce made a number of key recommendations aimed at increasing the number of organ donors, and these have subsequently been implemented by NHS Blood and Transplant (the special authority with responsibility for organ donation and transplantation)and others. The changes made include the creation of a centrally coordinated UK-wide network of specialist nurses in organ donation embedded in all intensive care units (ICUs) and a national organ retrieval service for all potential organ donors. The work of the Taskforce resulted in the provision of a professional, ethical, and legal framework for controlled DCD, thereby establishing this mode of deceased donation into clinical practice in the UK.

The introduction of these changes in UK organ donation practice has been associated with a 17% increase in deceased kidney donor numbers from 2007 to 2011. However, this increase is due exclusively to a doubling of DCD kidney donors. Overall deceased donor organ donation rates in the UK remain disappointing on a per capita basis and were exceeded in 2011 by the USA, and several European countries, most notably Spain, Belgium, Portugal, France, and Italy.When DBD and DCD donor rates are considered separately, the UK compares unfavourably for DBD donor rates. In contrast, DCD donation rates in the UK have doubled since 2007 and UK DCD donation rates in 2011 were exceeded only by those in The Netherlands.

### Normothermic human kidney preservation drives iron accumulation and ferroptosis [^7a792323]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Given that residual ferroptotic activity persisted despite fHb removal during RBC-based perfusion, we explored cell-free perfusion to circumvent hemolysis-driven injury. To support aerobic metabolism without an oxygen carrier, preservation temperature was reduced from 37 °C to 25 °C, thereby lowering the metabolic rate ensuring adequate oxygen delivery. Our findings indicate that cell-free perfusion prevents hemolysis-induced iron accumulation, phospholipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis gene signature enrichment, when compared to RBC-based perfusion. Hence, this approach establishes a more graft-protective environment for (prolonged) preservation of deceased donor kidneys. Although subnormothermic preservation is often considered a limitation, recent studies demonstrated it supports molecular and cellular repair processes,. Moreso, we previously demonstrated that it supports 4 day ex vivo metabolic and functional preservation of human kidneys.

Machine perfusion of deceased donor organs is a rapidly developing field that holds the potential to change transplantation medicine. Despite the prevailing assumption that RBC-based NMP confers protection to deceased donor kidneys,, our findings challenge this notion by demonstrating that the use of RBCs as oxygen carriers, and associated hemolysis, may actually offset the anticipated benefits of normothermic perfusion. While our analysis primarily focused on prolonged preservation (≥6 h), iron uptake from the perfusate, a ferroptosis gene signature, and release of phospholipid peroxidation products were already observed after 6 h of RBC-based perfusion. This is concerning given an increasing number of clinical trials looking into normothermic kidney perfusion, and clinical implementation of kidney NMP by commercial organ procurement organizations.

Consequently, as our study underscores the pathological role of hemolysis and iron in exacerbating AKI, we urge caution in the clinical implementation of RBC-based perfusion for deceased donor kidneys. Our findings challenge the current kidney preservation dogma and necessitate reconsideration of the framework needed to establish a protective environment to facilitate ex situ reconditioning, repair, and regeneration of deceased donor kidneys.
