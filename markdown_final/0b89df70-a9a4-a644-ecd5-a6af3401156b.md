## Question

Retrograde ejaculation and prostate abscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between retrograde ejaculation and prostate abscess, including whether one causes the other, how they interact, and what the diagnostic and management implications are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify whether there is a causal link between prostate abscess and retrograde ejaculation. Next, I will examine shared risk factors and overlapping clinical contexts. After that, I need to check diagnostic implications, especially imaging and how to distinguish them. Finally, I will consider management strategies and fertility outcomes, and close with a concise synthesis and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate mechanisms. Retrograde ejaculation is the backward flow of ejaculate into the bladder due to failure of bladder neck closure during emission, whereas a prostate abscess is a purulent collection within the prostate parenchyma, typically arising from acute bacterial prostatitis and often associated with diabetes, instrumentation, or voiding disturbances [^111HgGCH] [^111k9qDG].

> Wait, let me verify the causal relationship before drawing conclusions. I initially wondered if a prostate abscess could mechanically disrupt the bladder neck and cause retrograde ejaculation, but hold on, I should double-check the literature. I do not find evidence that prostate abscess directly causes retrograde ejaculation; instead, both conditions share common antecedents and treatments for BPH/LUTS are the predominant iatrogenic cause of retrograde ejaculation, not abscess itself [^113wAvzi] [^115c8jtd]. Conversely, retrograde ejaculation does not lead to abscess formation, so there is no bidirectional causal link in the sources provided.

> I need to check shared risk factors and overlapping clinical contexts. Both entities can arise in men with lower urinary tract obstruction, diabetes, or after urologic instrumentation, and both may present with lower urinary tract symptoms or pelvic discomfort, which can create diagnostic confusion if I don't keep the pathophysiology straight [^111tEX6W] [^111k9qDG] [^113wAvzi]. But let me reconsider: while obstruction and instrumentation are common threads, the mechanism for retrograde ejaculation is neuromuscular failure of bladder neck closure, whereas abscess reflects suppurative infection and tissue destruction, so the overlap is contextual rather than mechanistic [^111HgGCH] [^111tEX6W].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications and imaging. Hold on, I should verify guideline positions. For suspected prostatic abscess, transrectal ultrasound is recommended in selected cases to rule out abscess, and CT or MRI can delineate extent and extraprostatic spread; importantly, abscess can mimic cancer on imaging, so clinical correlation is essential [^111tEX6W] [^1114RgDq]. For retrograde ejaculation, diagnosis is clinical with post-orgasm urine demonstrating sperm; ultrasound may show seminal vesicle dilation in anejaculation but is not used to diagnose retrograde ejaculation per se, so I need to ensure I'm ordering the right test for the right question [^111HgGCH] [^114khjzc].

> I will now examine management principles and where they intersect. For prostatic abscess, prolonged antibiotics are foundational, and drainage is indicated for larger collections or failure to improve; transurethral drainage is preferred when feasible, and size thresholds around 20 mm often guide intervention decisions, though I should confirm that size alone is not absolute and clinical course matters [^111k9qDG] [^114oXusw] [^113DBetX]. For retrograde ejaculation, medical therapy with sympathomimetics and bladder neck–targeted strategies can restore antegrade flow in some cases, and if medication fails, sperm retrieval from post-orgasm urine enables fertility with assisted reproduction; I need to ensure alkalinization and timing protocols are correct when counseling on sperm recovery [^117A3GjA] [^111HgGCH] [^113bNo9w].

> But wait, what if both coexist in a man with BPH undergoing surgery or with chronic LUTS. I should confirm ejaculatory counseling before BPH procedures because TURP and related surgeries carry high rates of retrograde ejaculation, whereas TUIP and some minimally invasive options lower that risk; this is where shared decision-making is crucial, especially for men prioritizing ejaculation preservation [^115c8jtd] [^116CUqiS] [^113wAvzi]. If a patient has both a treated abscess and persistent ejaculatory dysfunction, I need to distinguish residual obstruction or neuropathic bladder neck dysfunction and tailor therapy accordingly, including urodynamics when indicated and fertility-directed sperm retrieval if conception is desired [^111HgGCH] [^1117cNem].

> Let me synthesize succinctly so I don't overstate anything. There is no direct causal relationship between prostate abscess and retrograde ejaculation; they are distinct entities that can co-occur in shared clinical contexts such as BPH, obstruction, diabetes, or instrumentation, and their management paths diverge: abscess requires infection control and possible drainage, while retrograde ejaculation requires bladder neck–targeted medical therapy or sperm retrieval for fertility, with prognosis for abscess generally good when treated appropriately and for retrograde ejaculation dependent on etiology and fertility goals [^111tEX6W] [^111k9qDG] [^111HgGCH] [^117A3GjA].

> Finally, I should double-check practical counseling points. For men with acute prostatitis not improving as expected, image for abscess to avoid delays in drainage; for men with dry ejaculate after prostate or bladder neck surgery, confirm retrograde ejaculation with post-orgasm urine and discuss medication trials and sperm retrieval options early if fertility is a priority, aligning choices with patient values and partner involvement [^112S9NG4] [^1114RgDq] [^111HgGCH] [^115R1HrZ].

---

Retrograde ejaculation and prostate abscess are distinct entities with different mechanisms and management. Retrograde ejaculation is the **backward flow of semen into the bladder** due to bladder neck dysfunction, often from medications, surgery, or neurological disease, and is managed medically or with sperm retrieval for fertility [^111HgGCH] [^113bNo9w]. Prostate abscess is a **pus collection within the prostate** from acute bacterial prostatitis, typically requiring prolonged antibiotics and drainage if large or refractory [^111tEX6W] [^111k9qDG]. They are not causally linked, but both can present with urinary symptoms; **imaging is essential** to distinguish them and guide treatment [^1114RgDq] [^111tEX6W].

---

## Pathophysiology and etiology

### Retrograde ejaculation

Retrograde ejaculation results from **failure of the bladder neck to close during ejaculation**, causing semen to enter the bladder rather than exit through the urethra. Common causes include:

- **Medications**: Alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin), antihypertensives, antidepressants.
- **Surgical procedures**: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), prostatectomy, bladder neck surgery.
- **Neurological conditions**: Diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury.
- **Congenital anomalies**: Urethral valves, bladder neck abnormalities.

---

### Prostate abscess

Prostate abscess arises from **acute bacterial prostatitis**, with bacteria ascending from the urethra or bladder. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, immunocompromise, indwelling catheters, and recent prostate instrumentation [^111tEX6W]. Common pathogens are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus [^111tEX6W] [^114mCrqs].

---

## Clinical presentation

| **Feature** | **Retrograde ejaculation** | **Prostate abscess** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptoms | - Dry orgasm <br/> - Minimal or absent ejaculate <br/> - Cloudy post-orgasm urine <br/> - Infertility | - Fever <br/> - Chills <br/> - Dysuria <br/> - Frequency <br/> - Urgency <br/> - Perineal or rectal pain <br/> - Urinary retention <br/> - Hematuria <br/> - Sepsis |
| Signs | - No specific physical findings <br/> - Post-orgasm urine may contain sperm | - Tender, boggy prostate on DRE <br/> - Fluctuance <br/> - Elevated PSA <br/> - Leukocytosis <br/> - Positive urine cultures |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Retrograde ejaculation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by post-orgasm urinalysis showing sperm. Additional tests may include:

- **Transrectal ultrasound**: To assess prostate, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts [^115DXmVS].
- **Urodynamic studies**: To evaluate bladder neck function [^notfound].

---

### Prostate abscess

Diagnosis relies on **imaging**, with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) as first-line [^1114RgDq]. CT or MRI may be used to define extent, loculations, or extraprostatic spread [^111tEX6W]. Laboratory tests include CBC, PSA, and urine cultures [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Retrograde ejaculation

Management depends on cause and fertility goals. Medical therapy with **alpha-agonists** (e.g. pseudoephedrine) may restore antegrade ejaculation in some cases [^116rjALs]. If medical therapy fails, **sperm retrieval** from post-orgasm urine for assisted reproduction is effective [^117A3GjA].

---

### Prostate abscess

Treatment centers on **antibiotics and drainage**. Prolonged antibiotic therapy (4–6 weeks) is essential [^notfound]. Transurethral drainage or aspiration is indicated for abscesses > 20 mm or those failing antibiotics [^111k9qDG] [^114oXusw].

---

## Potential complications

Retrograde ejaculation primarily causes **infertility** and psychological distress [^113wAvzi]. Prostate abscess can lead to sepsis, chronic prostatitis, urethral strictures, and fistula formation if untreated [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Retrograde ejaculation has a favorable prognosis with treatment; **fertility can be achieved** with sperm retrieval and assisted reproduction [^117A3GjA]. Prostate abscess prognosis depends on **early diagnosis and intervention**; delayed treatment increases morbidity and mortality [^111GL2Dv].

---

## Relationship between retrograde ejaculation and prostate abscess

There is **no direct causal relationship** between retrograde ejaculation and prostate abscess. They are distinct entities with different pathophysiology and management. However, both can coexist in patients with prostate pathology or after prostate surgery, and accurate diagnosis is essential to guide appropriate treatment [^notfound].

---

Retrograde ejaculation and prostate abscess are separate conditions with distinct causes and treatments. Retrograde ejaculation is managed medically or with sperm retrieval, whereas prostate abscess requires antibiotics and drainage. Accurate diagnosis with **imaging and clinical evaluation** is essential to guide therapy and prevent complications [^1114RgDq] [^111tEX6W].

Conclusion

The misdiagnosis of PCa is influenced by multiple factors, including insufficient specificity of PCa-related biomarker testing, atypical imaging findings, patients' comorbidities, and insufficient understanding among clinicians about PCa. Therefore, it is essential to integrate multiple examination techniques to establish a multimodal diagnostic system, and strengthen training for clinicians on complex PCa cases, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy.

### Chronic bacterial prostatitis leading to intrascrotal abscess after transperineal prostate biopsy [^115tBjAa]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Transperineal biopsy is becoming more commonly used, driven by improved detection rates, better complication profile and increasing application of prostate MRI leading to guided biopsy. However, it can still lead to complications such as urinary retention, postoperative pain and erectile dysfunction. There is also a potential for adverse events such as severe infection, abscess and fistula. This article describes a case of an intrascrotal abscess post-transperineal biopsy, which required an orchidectomy.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^115rdaYp]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

One previous report described that approximately 6% of prostatic abscesses develop in patients during the follow-up period after acute prostatitis. However, prostatic abscess are often found in patients who do not improve with initial antibiotic therapy. Therefore, without routine imaging study, a prostate abscess present initially may be missed rather than developing from acute prostatitis during the follow-up period. In our 111 cases of confirmed acute prostatitis without abscess, abscess formation was not identified during the treatment period. Routine imaging studies such as CT or TRUS should be considered in cases of acute prostatitis for this reason, especially in patients with long-term symptom duration and voiding disturbances. Such imaging will allow physicians to anticipate a treatment method for an abscess, since these abscesses may require drainage. Ludwig et al. found that fluctuation during the digital rectal exam was present in 83.3% of prostate abscesses. The group agreed that additional imaging is necessary to avoid missing a diagnosis of prostate abscess.

### Laser therapy for benign prostatic hypertrophy… [^116wNvUB]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Middle-aged and older men commonly have lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy. Trans-urethral resection of the prostate is the most common surgical treatment, but it fails to resolve symptoms in approximately 20 percent of men. The morbidity rate associated with TURP ranges from 5 to 10 percent, and the mortality rate is approximately 0. 2 percent. In addition, 5 percent of patients are impotent after the procedure, and 60 percent have retrograde ejaculation. Because of these risks, the use of noninvasive methods such as drug therapy, laser therapy and even observation alone has increased. Donovan and associates compared the effectiveness of TURP, laser therapy and observation in the treatment of BPH. Men who had uncomplicated lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH and no evidence of urinary retention were eligible for the randomized controlled study.

Those who met the study criteria were randomized to receive laser therapy, TURP or conservative therapy. Five measures were the primary outcomes: the International Prostate Symptom Score, the mean maximum urinary flow rate, a composite measure of success, the mean I-PSS quality of life score and the postvoid residual urinary volume. Secondary outcomes included failure to complete treatment, the need for further treatment, hospitalization, major complications and urodynamics. A total of 340 men was enrolled in the symptomatic trial, with more than 100 randomized to each of the treatment groups. The baseline characteristics were similar across groups, except for marital status, number actively employed and nonmanual social status. Patients receiving laser therapy and TURP had significantly lower symptom scores than did patients in the conservative management group. TURP performed better than laser therapy, but the difference was not statistically significant.

The length of hospital stay and complication rates were significantly less in the laser therapy group compared with those receiving TURP. Time to catheter removal was longer following laser therapy than after TURP. The authors conclude that both TURP and laser therapy are safe and effective means of treating BPH in men. TURP was more effective than laser therapy but had a higher incidence of complications and longer hospitalization. The authors also note that conservative management consisting of observation only is a safe option.

### ACR-AIUM-SRU practice parameter for the performance of ultrasound evaluation of the prostate (and surrounding structures) [^115DXmVS]. SRU/ACR/AIUM (2025). High credibility.

ACR–AIUM–SRU prostate ultrasound — scope, utility, and limitations — ultrasound examination of the prostate and surrounding structures is used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, benign prostatic enlargement, prostatitis, prostatic abscess, congenital anomalies, ejaculatory dysfunction, and male infertility as well as for the treatment of prostatic cancer, abscess, and benign prostatic enlargement, and ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate is useful to evaluate patients with abnormal digital rectal examinations or an abnormal serum prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) level, azoospermia, low ejaculatory volume, and in patients requiring tissue diagnosis for further management. Grayscale, color, spectral, and power Doppler imaging are insufficient to confirm or exclude the presence of prostate cancer and should not be used to obviate the need for prostate biopsy, and although micro ultrasound elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound may provide superior detection of prostate cancer, these techniques are not sufficiently established to be considered routine at this time. Ultrasound of the prostate and surrounding structures should be performed only when there is a valid medical reason, and the lowest possible ultrasonic exposure should be used to gain the necessary diagnostic information, and sometimes, an additional and/or specialized examination may be required.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^117VAS3n]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Ulleryd et al. concluded that routine radiological exams are dispensable in men with febrile urinary tract infection. However, it would be wise to perform imaging studies in patients who are suspected to have acute prostatitis when their symptom duration is relatively long, or any evidence of voiding disturbance. Acute prostatitis with abscess requires long-term antibiotic treatment, and sometimes even surgical drainage. Surgical procedures such as TUR-P in patients with prostatic abscesses are advantageous because they reduce the period of antibiotic treatment and may improve voiding symptoms. A wide range of microorganisms may be detected in prostatitis with abscess. Therefore, physicians should perform urine culture prior to administering empirical antibiotics. These cultures should be repeated, if possible, during treatment. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis of acute prostatitis with and without abscess would not differ.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^111GL2Dv]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In general, abscesses form as a result of an inflammatory process that arises from an infection. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a prostate abscess develops from a prostatic infection. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports comparing acute prostatitis with and without abscesses. Prostate abscess is a rare condition. Only a few reports of its diagnosis and treatment have been described over several decades. Several groups have suggested that indwelling catheters, infravesical obstruction, instrumentation of the lower urinary tract, diabetes mellitus (DM), liver disease, and prostate biopsy are predisposing factors of prostate abscess. These risk factors are reasonable, but not yet supported by evidence. Patients with prostate abscess must be watched closely, as they may experience a high mortality rate if adequate and proper and timely treatment does not occur. However, compared to acute prostatitis without abscess, outcomes of acute prostatitis with abscess are unclear. Here, we present data from 142 acute bacterial prostatic infections and compare acute bacterial prostatitis with and without abscess.

### Incidental findings in and around the prostate on prostate MRI: a pictorial review [^112WYpGs]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Key points

Familiarity with MRI signal characteristics of blood, calcifications and cyst fluid is important.
Location of the incidental finding narrows the differential list as some pathologies occur more frequently in certain sites.
Prostate abscess can have similar imaging characteristics to prostate cancer; history and clinical presentation is useful to distinguish.
Recent prostate or peri-prostate interventions can mimic pathology.

### Seminal vesicle fistula: a rare pathology in complicated Crohn's disease [^113adA5Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Seminal vesicle fistulation (SVF) is a rare pathology. The literature is sparse; thus, case reports are imperative for allowing prospective case series. Crohn's disease, previous surgery, diverticulitis, trauma and neoplasia have been implicated in its aetiology.

Patient symptoms vary. Pneumaturia, testicular pain, rectal drainage, malodorous semen, decline in semen volume and fever have all been described as presenting symptoms in SVF. Chronic urinary tract infections not amenable to antibiotic therapy should also alert the clinician to the possibility of an SVT.

Diagnostic imaging modality varies throughout the literature. In this case, MRI of the perineum was the investigation of choice, as it best depicts the soft tissue structures within the perineum as well as the fistulous tract(s).

MRI with concomitant vesiculography has been reported as a successful imaging modality when ejaculate volume is low. Alternatively, when the seminal vesicle is fistulating with bowel, CT of the abdomen and pelvis with both intravenous and rectal contrast has been shown to provide an accurate picture.

Management options vary. Given the paucity of evidence, there is no gold standard approach. Principal treatment strategies are similar to that for other fistulae. Aetiology plays an important role. For example, if the fistula has formed secondary to an acute complication of diverticulitis, resection of the diseased bowel is indicated. In contrast, where the fistula has formed in the chronic setting, in the absence of a coexistent acute perforation or abscess formation, a conservative approach may be trialled. SVF can induce a localised inflammatory process rather than peritonitis and systemic upset. Therefore, the patient will likely have time to weigh up the risks and benefits of both conservative and surgical approaches.

### A rare urological presentation of appendicitis [^115s147V]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 17-year-old boy with no medical comorbidities, but a significant family history of malignancy, presented to Accident and Emergency following 3days of increasing rectal pain, symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction (poor flow, intermittent stream and hesitancy) and dysuria. Notably he had no abdominal pain. Digital rectal examination revealed a tender, enlarged prostate. Inflammatory markers were significantly raised (white cell count 17.7, C reactive protein 191). He was diagnosed clinically as prostatitis and commenced on intravenous antibiotics. Despite this his pain and inflammatory markers deteriorated, necessitating a CT of his abdomen and pelvis. This demonstrated multiloculated large thick-walled abscesses in the pelvis closely related to the rectum, prostate and seminal vesicles with some bowel wall thickening. Laparoscopy demonstrated a large colonic mass adherent to surrounding structures. The procedure was converted to laparotomy to enable resection of the mass via a limited right haemicolectomy. He recovered well and was discharged. Histopathological analysis of the specimen revealed appendicitis.

### Bacterial prostatitis [^112eRCMd]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review provides the infectious disease community with a urologic perspective on bacterial prostatitis. Specifically, the article briefly reviews the categorization of prostatitis by type and provides a distillation of new findings published on bacterial prostatitis over the past year. It also highlights key points from the established literature.

Recent Findings

Cross-sectional prostate imaging is becoming more common and may lead to more incidental diagnoses of acute bacterial prostatitis. As drug resistance remains problematic in this condition, the reemergence of older antibiotics such as fosfomycin, has proven beneficial. With regard to chronic bacterial prostatitis, no clear clinical risk factors emerged in a large epidemiological study. However, bacterial biofilm formation has been associated with more severe cases. Surgery has a limited role in bacterial prostatitis and should be reserved for draining of a prostatic abscess or the removal of infected prostatic stones.

Summary

Prostatitis remains a common and bothersome clinical condition. Antibiotic therapy remains the basis of treatment for both acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Further research into improving prostatitis treatment is indicated.

### The role of benign prostatic hyperplasia treatments in ejaculatory dysfunction [^113wAvzi]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Ejaculatory dysfunction is not only psychologically distressing but can become a significant obstacle for men who wish to conceive. Dysfunction comes in the form of anejaculation, reduced ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, painful ejaculation, or premature ejaculation. Most treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, which commonly occurs in aging men, carry significant risks of absent, reduced, or retrograde ejaculation. This review focuses on such risks that accompany both the medical and surgical management of lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia and how these risks impact male fertility.

### Can we clinically distinguish anejaculation from retrograde ejaculation in patients on α ₁ A-blockers therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms? [^114khjzc]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the physiopathology of ejaculatory disorders (EjD) and discriminate between retrograde ejaculation (REj) and anejaculation (AEj) induced by α1A-blockers, through the association between the mean postorgasm seminal vesicle volume and the presence of sperm in midstream urine, in patients with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic enlargement.

Materials and Methods

Therapy-naïve male patients with LUTS and without previous EjD were treated with α1A-blockers. Pre- and post-treatment EjD were investigated through question 4 of the 4-item Male Sexual Function questionnaire and the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire for Ejaculatory Dysfunction Short Form (MSHQ-EjD-SF). After 12 weeks, postorgasm urine was collected for sperm count and seminal vesicle volume was calculated through transrectal ultrasound.

Results

All 42 patients reported with EjD after treatment with α1A-blockers: 4-item Male Sexual Function questionnaire and MSHQ-EjD-SF Q4 scores were significantly higher (P < .001) and MSHQ-EjD-SF Q1-3 score was significantly lower (P < .001) than before. Postorgasm seminal vesicle volume was significantly higher in patients with postorgasm sperm-negative urine (AEj), and lower in patients with postorgasm sperm-positive urine (REj; P < .001).

Conclusion

We clearly demonstrated an association between the presence of sperm in the midstream urine and seminal vesicle volume after orgasm, strongly confirming and differentiating the hypothesis of a dual etiology for EjD (REj vs AEj) secondary to α1A-blockers therapy for LUTS.

### Case report: tubercular cold abscess of seminal vesicle: minimally invasive endoscopic management [^116B3k7Q]. Journal of Endourology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tubercular cold abscess of the seminal vesicle is very rare, and only a few cases are reported in literature. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult and to the best of our knowledge has not been reported.

Case Report

A 35-year-old man presented with a 7-year history of blood in the semen and a reddish brownish discharge per urethra while defecating. On rectal examination, a soft fluctuant mass was felt above the prostate. Abdominal ultrasonography showed cystic swelling of the right seminal vesicle bulging into the posterior bladder wall. Semen examination showed abundant pus cells and 90% immotile sperm with normal morphology. Acid-fast bacilli were not seen, but acid-fast bacilli were found in a 24-hour urine specimen. Cystoscopy showed tubercles in the urethra and brownish discharge from the orifice of the right ejaculatory duct on per-rectal compression of the mass. The abscess cavity was incised with a Collings' knife. Brownish material was evacuated, and the abscess cavity was seen. An 18F Foley catheter was placed for 3 days. Antitubercular therapy was instituted. Ultrasonography repeated after 3, 25, 45, and 75 days showed gradual regression of the abscess cavity. Semen examination after 75 days was normal, with 75% motility, and cystoscopy 45 days postoperatively showed complete healing of the wound.

Conclusion

The incision connecting the bladder with the abscess cavity facilitated evacuation of pus and complete resolution of the abscess.

### Congenital cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: a disorder with various treatment approaches and pitfalls-case report [^114CovQm]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cysts of the male pelvic floor are uncommon and usually benign. These clinical findings are often incidental and may become symptomatic during the third and fourth decades of life. Symptoms are nonspecific and may include abdominal, perineal and pelvic pain, painful ejaculation, hematospermia, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary retention with subsequent appearance of recurrent prostatitis, epididymitis and infertility. Moreover, these cysts have different anatomic origins and may be associated with various genitourinary congenital anomalies including hypospadias, intergender disorder, adult polycystic kidney, cryptorchidism and omolateral renal agenesis. There are two principal groups of male lower urinary tract cysts: intraprostatic and extraprostatic. Intraprostatic cysts are divided in medial cysts, that develop from the prostatic utricle and Mullerian ducts, paramedial cysts (ejaculatory ducts cysts) and lateral cysts, related to prostatic retention, associated to tumors or prostatic abscesses. The extraprostatic ones include seminal vesicles, deferent ducts and Cowper ducts cysts. The differential diagnosis is usually with ureterocele, bladder diverticulum, hydroureter and ectopic ureter.

In this article we describe the etiopathology, diagnosis and treatment of a case study of congenital cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract.

We report our retrospective experience concerning two patients affected by extraprostatic genito-urinary cysts treated with open and mini-invasive surgery.

### The etiology and management of acute prostatitis [^1121WTtG]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial prostatitis is a common and clinically important genitourinary disorder. Patient populations who are at especially high risk of acute prostatitis include those with diabetes, cirrhosis, and suppressed immune systems. The cause is usually an ascending infection, but bacteria can also be introduced during transrectal prostate biopsy. Clinical presentation ranges from mild lower urinary tract symptoms to full sepsis. The causative organisms are usually similar to those that cause other common genitourinary infections, and include Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. Oral or intravenous antibiotics are usually effective for curing the infection and progression to chronic bacterial prostatitis is, therefore, uncommon. Immunosuppressed patients require special consideration, as bacterial prostatitis in these patients can be caused by atypical infecting organisms and might, therefore, require additional therapies. A lack of response to standard therapy can lead to complications such as a prostatic abscess or fistula.

### Sigmoidovesical fistula expansion with sepsis following transurethral resection of prostate: a case report [^117X46Gt]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SVF, a distinct subtype of colovesical fistula, presents persistent diagnostic and therapeutic challenges at the intersection of gastrointestinal and urological surgery. While existing literature identifies diverticulitis, colorectal malignancies, and Crohn's disease as predominant etiologies for SVF, this case represents the first reported instance of SVF expansion following TURP, offering a critical warning for clinical practice.

TURP is the primary treatment modality for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and its main complications include bleeding, perforation of the prostatic capsule, urethral stricture, transient incontinence, retrograde ejaculation, and bladder neck contracture. Although bladder rupture has been reported on rare occasions, no cases of sigmoid colon injury have been documented to date. Anatomically, the pathogenesis of SVF in this case arose from a combination of factors. Pelvic MRI performed on November 8, 2023 (post-TURP but prior to laparoscopic sigmoidectomy) revealed multiple sacculated protrusions in the sigmoid colon, indicative of asymptomatic diverticulosis, which likely served as a structural foundation for fistula development. Recurrent urinary tract infections further exacerbated the condition. Crucially, during resection of the median lobe protruding 2 cm into the bladder, direct cutting trauma from the electrocautery system breached the attenuated bladder-sigmoid interface, as directly evidenced by intraoperative extrusion of enteric contents. This triad of predisposing anatomy, chronic inflammation, and iatrogenic trauma underscores the multifactorial nature of SVF pathogenesis. During emergency laparoscopy on August 3, dense adhesions between the sigmoid colon and left bladder wall were observed without pelvic fluid collection. This supports our conclusion that the intraoperative extrusion of enteric contents during TURP (August 2) represented expansion of a preexisting sigmoidovesical fistula rather than acute colonic perforation. The chronic inflammatory containment likely prevented peritoneal contamination — explaining the absence of abdominal distension or peritonitis despite fistula violation.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction; links for diagnosis, management and treatment [^115dh2TX]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2007). Low credibility.

Recent large-scale epidemiological studies have documented a strong association between lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED). This observation has two important scientific and clinical aspects: (i) to reveal the pathomechanism linking LUTS and ED and (ii) to consider this fact in the individual approach for diagnosis and management of these two disorders. The following hypotheses are under investigation to explain the relation between LUTS and ED: (i) an increased Rho-kinase activation, (ii) an alpha-adrenergic receptor imbalance, (iii) a decrease of NOS/NO in the endothelium, (iv) atherosclerosis affecting the small pelvis and (v) an autonomic hyperactivity, each affecting simultaneously bladder, prostate and penis. According to a recent randomized trial, sildenafil has a positive effect on LUTS yet not on uroflowmetry in men with LUTS and ED. Although further trials are mandatory, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors might play a role in the management of LUTS in the future. alpha-Blockers have no relevant effect on erectile function, tamsulosin leads to retrograde ejaculation in up to 10%. 5alpha-Reductase inhibitors are associated with ED, loss of libido and reduction of ejaculate volume in up to 10%. Transurethral and open prostatectomy induce retrograde ejaculation in up to 90% of patients while their impact on erectile function is still controversially discussed. Minimal invasive treatment options (laser prostatectomy, transurethral microwave thermotherapy) have a lower rate of retrograde ejaculation in the range of 20–70%. LUTS and ED are strongly linked although the exact mechanism is poorly understood. Men seeking for help for LUTS/benign prostatic hyperplasia should be assessed for different aspects of sexual dysfunction and informed regarding the impact of medication and surgery on sexual health.

### Prostatitis: diagnosis and treatment [^117UiJHL]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis ranges from a straightforward clinical entity in its acute form to a complex, debilitating condition when chronic. It is often a source of frustration for the treating physician and patient. There are four classifications of prostatitis: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic. Diagnosis of acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis is primarily based on history, physical examination, urine culture, and urine specimen testing pre- and post-prostatic massage. The differential diagnosis of prostatitis includes acute cystitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract stones, bladder cancer, prostatic abscess, enterovesical fistula, and foreign body within the urinary tract. The mainstay of therapy is an antimicrobial regimen. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a more challenging entity, in part because its pathology is poorly understood. Diagnosis is often based on exclusion of other urologic conditions (e.g., voiding dysfunction, bladder cancer) in association with its presentation. Commonly used medications include antimicrobials, alpha blockers, and anti-inflammatory agents, but the effectiveness of these agents has not been supported in clinical trials. Small studies provide limited support for the use of nonpharmacologic modalities. Asymptomatic prostatitis is an incidental finding in a patient being evaluated for other urologic problems.

Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) — comparative outcomes versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in men with small prostates are as follows: TUIP has been used to treat small prostates, usually defined as ≤ 30g. A meta-analysis found lower retrograde ejaculation with TUIP (18.2% versus 65.4%) and lower need for blood transfusion (0.4% versus 8.6%) after a minimum 6‑month follow-up. For the guideline period, 1 RCT (n = 86; 80 completers) with 4‑year follow-up in men with small prostates (≤ 30g) reported mean age 65 years, baseline IPSS 19 and prostate size 28g; long‑term change in IPSS was similar (WMD: 0.5; 95%CI: -0.2, 1.2). Erectile dysfunction occurred in 8% with TUIP versus 20% with TURP and was not significant (RR: 0.4; 95%CI: 0.1, 1.3), whereas retrograde ejaculation occurred in 30 participants overall (9 TUIP, 21 TURP).

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^114xwNjN]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Infections of the seminal vesicles

In the current antibiotic era, seminal vesicle abscesses (SVAs) are even more uncommon than PAs, and are frequently associated with ABP or epididymo-orchitis. SVAs may present with haemospermia or unspecific symptoms of UTI. However, both PAs and SVAs are often insidious and clinically unsuspected; therefore, a high index of suspicion is recommended when interpreting CT studies with the usual risk factors.

Transabdominal or transrectal ultrasound may detect SVAs (Figs. 12 and 13) as hypo-anechoic masses. At cross-sectional imaging, the normal seminal vesicles appear as paired, finely septated fluid-containing structures, measuring approximately 3×1.5 cm in adults, and may be moderately asymmetric in size and tend to shrink with advancing age. Their content is normally homogeneous, with fluid-like CT attenuation and low T1- and fluid-like T2-hyperintense MRI signal with enhancing walls and septa after intravenous contrast.

### Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in men with premature ejaculation [^112bUrf3]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence of chronic prostatitis in men with premature ejaculation. The etiology of premature ejaculation is currently considered psychological in nature. However, the possibility that urologic, hormonal, or neurologic factors may contribute to this condition should be considered in its management.

Methods

We evaluated segmented urine specimens before and after prostatic massage and expressed prostatic secretion specimens from 46 patients with premature ejaculation and 30 controls by bacteriologic localization studies. The incidence of premature ejaculation in the subjects with chronic prostatitis was also evaluated.

Results

Prostatic inflammation was found in 56.5% and chronic bacterial prostatitis in 47.8% of the subjects with premature ejaculation, respectively. When compared with the controls, these novel findings were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Considering the role of the prostate gland in the mechanism of ejaculation, we suggest a role for chronic prostate inflammation in the pathogenesis of some cases of premature ejaculation. Since chronic prostatitis has been found with a high frequency in men with premature ejaculation, we stress the importance of a careful examination of the prostate before any pharmacologic or psychosexual therapy for premature ejaculation.

### Frequency of sexual activity and prostatic health: fact or fairy tale? [^1154cpGr]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate whether the symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia can be aggravated by infrequent sex, which has been suggested historically, using cross-sectional data from the Olmsted County Study of Urinary Symptoms and Health Status Among Men.

Methods

In 1989 and 1990, 2115 white men between the ages of 40 and 79 years were recruited from a random sample of Olmsted County residents (55% participation rate). During follow-up, these men completed a self-administered questionnaire that assessed lower urinary tract symptom severity, and 81% reported the frequency of ejaculation during the previous month.

Results

Overall, men who reported ejaculating at least once a week were less likely to have moderate to severe (International Prostate Symptom Score greater than 7) symptoms than men reporting no ejaculations (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.75). The dose-response relation was strong, with men who reported more frequent ejaculations having the lowest prevalence of moderate to severe symptoms. Similar associations were seen for peak urinary flow rates, prostate volume, and health-related quality of life. The associations with urologic measures did not exist within the age decade, however. Thus, after adjusting for age, the odds ratio for ejaculation frequency and symptom severity was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.24) and was similar for peak urinary flow rates and prostate volume.

Conclusions

These cross-sectional data suggest that the frequency of ejaculation has no effect on lower urinary tract symptoms, peak urinary flow rates, or prostate volume; the apparent protective association appears to be an artifact caused by the confounding effects of age.

### Minimally invasive treatments for benign prostatic enlargement: systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^116CUqiS]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Selection and study characteristics

We included randomised controlled trials if they compared minimally invasive interventions for benign prostatic enlargement with transurethral resection of the prostate. We excluded trials reporting on men without a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic enlargement and comparisons against conservative management. The table shows the interventions considered (table A on bmj.com provides full descriptions of the treatments). The primary outcome measure was change in symptom score 12 months after surgery, measured by the international prostate symptom score or the American Urological Association symptom index — these were considered equivalent and we therefore combined trials using these instruments. The international prostate symptom score/American Urological Association symptom questionnaire asks men to rate four voiding symptoms (poor stream, intermittent flow, straining, incomplete emptying) and three storage symptoms (frequency, nocturia, urgency) on a scale from 0 (not present) to 5 (severe) to give a total score ranging from 0 to 35, with severity of symptoms defined as mild (0–7), moderate (8–19), or severe (20–35).

Secondary outcomes were improvement in quality of life and increase in peak urine flow rate (for effectiveness); blood transfusion, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urethral stricture, urinary tract infection, retrograde (loss of) ejaculation, erectile dysfunction (for morbidity); and duration of operation, length of hospital stay, and need for reoperation (for descriptors of care). We considered all reports of prespecified complications regardless of their timing. As separate reporting of stenosis of the bladder neck and urethral stricture was inconsistent we combined these complications.

Details of 22 included studies (22 trials with 24 relevant comparisons) and summary of baseline characteristics (means or medians)

Prostatic artery embolization (PAE) safety and sexual function — complications and ejaculation outcomes — note a postembolization syndrome that typically lasts less than 1 week with symptomatic management. In more than 2,000 patients across 17 unique cohort or comparative studies, six major complications were encountered, no major vascular access events were reported, and the overall major complication rate is estimated to be less than 0.5%. Across reviewed studies, none showed a decrease in IIEF; three meta-analyses showed slight improvement and two showed no change; and the three RCTs showed no change in IIEF after PAE. Meta-analyses estimated the risk of retrograde ejaculation following PAE at 0%–2.3%; in the UK-ROPE registry 24.1% reported retrograde ejaculation following PAE; RCTs reported reduced ejaculation in 3 of 30 and 14 of 25 PAE patients, and both RCTs demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of retrograde ejaculation for PAE compared with TURP.

### Management of the dry ejaculate: a systematic review of aspermia and retrograde ejaculation [^116EQk6W]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

A dry ejaculate (aspermia), may occur either because of an inability to transport semen (anejaculation) or because of an inability to ejaculate in an antegrade direction (retrograde ejaculation). The treatment of aspermia varies with underlying etiology and includes medical therapy with sympathomimetics, urinary sperm retrieval, bladder neck reconstruction, prostatic massage, penile vibratory stimulation, electroejaculation, and surgical sperm retrieval. A systematic review of the current literature was performed for articles on ejaculatory dysfunction related to dry ejaculate. However, the data are insufficient to allow firm comparisons between treatment options. Treatments must be tailored to the individual patient, and treatment decisions should involve consideration of ease of administration, degree of invasiveness, and anticipated success.

Cross-sectional imaging features of infections of the prostate and seminal vesicles

Prostatic infections and abscesses

With the widespread use of antibiotics, C-UTIs involving the prostate have become increasingly rare, and nowadays are primarily caused (almost two-thirds of cases) by E. coli infection. Acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) is a serious infection which requires intensive parenteral antibiotics.

Prostatic abscesses (PAs) may result from unrecognised or inappropriately treated ABP, or may develop shortly after transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy. Most cases occur in the fifth and sixth decades of life, and the usual predisposing factors include diabetes, indwelling catheters, urological instrumentation and anatomical abnormalities. The non-specific clinical manifestations largely overlap with those of ABP, and include fever, dysuria or frequency, dull pelvic or perineal pain, rectal tenesmus, prostatic tenderness at digital rectal examination, and sometimes acute urinary retention. Laboratory findings indicate acute UTI, and increased serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is common but generally regresses with therapy. Urine cultures are often negative, and may become positive when the abscess opens into the urethra or bladder.

PAs may be detected by TRUS as single or multiple hypoechoic areas with thick walls, floating echogenic speckles in the cavity, and poorly defined periphery, with increased colour Doppler signals.

Compared to TRUS, CT with multiplanar image reconstruction provides a more comprehensive visualisation of PAs. The usual appearance is single, septated or multiple fluid-like (−19 to 13 HU attenuation) collections, often with perceptible peripheral or septal enhancement, which cause more or less symmetric prostatic enlargement of variable entity (Figs. 4, 9 and 10). In addition, CT may depict signs of extraprostatic penetration (Fig. 10) in the prevesical space, rectum, perineum or ischiorectal fossa, and consistently allows monitoring of changes after medical or surgical treatment (Figs. 4 and 10). The differential diagnosis should consider prostate carcinoma, particularly with regressive changes after treatment (Fig. 11).

### The management of retrograde ejaculation: a systematic review and update [^113bNo9w]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the best management of retrograde ejaculation to optimize the chance of conception.

Design

Systematic review.

Setting

Tertiary reproductive medicine center.

Patient(S)

Subfertile men with retrograde ejaculation.

Method(S)

Systematic search of studies using search terms "management" or "therapy" or "treatment" and "retrograde ejaculation". We excluded case reports and papers not in English.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy and live birth rates and rates of achievement of antegrade ejaculation.

Result(S)

Thirty-four studies met our criteria. Studies were mostly observational. Descriptions of predictive and confounding variables were often insufficient. The treatment options included urinary sperm retrieval and medical management with anticholinergics and sympathomimetics. Successful pregnancies and live births were also achieved using surgical techniques and electroejaculation; however, numbers were small.

Conclusion(S)

Many treatment options exist in the management of retrograde ejaculation; however, current literature is insufficient to allow firm comparisons between interventions. Treatment should be tailored, therefore, to the individual. Our findings support the need for further research in this area-including large randomized controlled trials. However, these would be difficult logistically and may not be possible.

### Critical analysis of the relationship between sexual dysfunctions and lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112Nuzpu]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Context

This review focuses on the relationship among sexual dysfunction (SD), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and related therapies.

Objective

We reviewed the current literature to provide an overview of current data regarding epidemiology and pathophysiology of SD and LUTS. Moreover, we analysed the impact of currently available therapies of LUTS/BPH on both erectile dysfunction (ED) and ejaculatory dysfunction and the effect of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) in patients with ED and LUTS.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a Medline search to identify original articles, reviews, editorials, and international scientific congress abstracts by combining the following terms: benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction.

Evidence Synthesis

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of more relevant general population-based and BPH/LUTS or SD clinic-based trials and evaluated the common pathophysiologic mechanisms related to both conditions. In a further step, the overall impact of current BPH/LUTS therapies on sexual life, including phytotherapies, novel drugs, and surgical procedures, was scrutinized. Finally, the usefulness of PDE5-Is in LUTS/BPH was critically analysed, including preclinical and clinical research data as well as possible mechanisms of action that may contribute to the efficacy of PDE5-Is with LUTS/BPH.

Conclusions

Community-based and clinical data demonstrate a strong and consistent association between LUTS and ED, suggesting that elderly men with LUTS should be evaluated for SD and vice versa. Pathophysiologic hypotheses regarding common basics of LUTS and SD as discussed in the literature are (1) alteration of the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, (2) enhancement of RhoA-Rho-kinase (ROCK) contractile signalling, (3) autonomic adrenergic hyperactivity, and (4) pelvic atherosclerosis. The most important sexual adverse effects of medical therapies are ejaculation disorders after the use of some α-blockers and sexual desire impairment, ED, and ejaculatory disorders after the use of α-reductase inhibitors. Minimally invasive, conventional, and innovative surgical treatments for BPH may induce both retrograde ejaculation and ED. PDE5-Is have demonstrated significant improvements in both LUTS and ED in men with BPH; combination therapy with PDE5-Is and α1-adrenergic blockers seems superior to PDE5-I monotherapy.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis: two different sub-categories according to a previous manipulation of the lower urinary tract [^117PFjph]. World Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bacterial prostatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bacterial prostatitis is an uncommon infection of the prostate gland due to bacteria, usually with severe presentation.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute bacterial prostatitis is an infection of the prostate gland, typically caused by common urinary tract pathogens. The bacteria usually enter the prostate from the urethra, triggering an inflammatory response within the gland. This inflammation can lead to swelling and discomfort in the prostate and surrounding areas.
- **Epidemiology**: Acute bacterial prostatitis constitutes nearly 10% of prostatitis diagnoses, predominantly affecting individuals aged 20–40 and those > 70 years.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute bacterial prostatitis often present with a range of symptoms. These can include fever, chills, and malaise, as well as urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. Some patients may also experience pelvic or perineal pain, and in severe cases, there may be blood in the urine. In some instances, patients may present with symptoms of urosepsis, such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute bacterial prostatitis is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves antibiotics.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^1125xZtL]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

DM was a predisposing factor for abscess formation in univariate analysis. Studies of prostate abscesses commonly emphasize that DM is the most important predisposing medical condition. However, diabetes by itself was not a risk factor for prostate abscess in multivariate analysis in the present study. DM is undoubtedly a serious condition that increases the risk of infection with uro-pathogens. However, its role in the development of prostatic abscess remains unclear and requires further investigation. Voiding disturbance was a significant risk factor for prostate abscess in the present study. Therefore, physicians should monitor voiding status in patients with acute prostatitis. In doing so, a physician can decide whether or not to perform a urinary diversion, such as suprapubic cystostomy, or to conduct imaging for the early diagnosis of a prostate abscess.

Abscess drainage with transurethral resection of prostate (TUR-P) was done in 45.2% (14/31) of patients with prostatic abscess. The other 55.8% of patients with abscesses only required medical treatment. We excluded confounding factors including one patient death, and 4 patients with other abscess foci when comparing the TUR-P group and medical treatment group in 31 abscesses. With regard to the length of hospital stay, it seems that medical treatment was non-inferior to surgical procedures in the treatment of prostatic abscesses. If we did not perform TUR-P in patient with prostate abscess over 20 mm, hospital stay might be longer in abscess patients. The duration of antibiotic treatment was longer in the medical treatment group (Table 1) than it was in the surgical group despite the cases treated with TUR-P had larger size of abscess pockets than the medical cases. Because TUR-P group and medical treatment group have different sizes of prostate abscess, and relevant cases in prostate abscess (n = 26) were small for comparison between TUR-P (n = 13) and medical treatment (n = 13), comparing treatment outcomes in 26 prostate abscesses may have potentially less clinically significant in the present study. However, considering there are wide concerns of antibiotic resistance in the community, minimizing the duration of exposure to antibiotics is an important issue. Furthermore, voiding disturbances were reflected in a large proportion of patients with prostate abscesses according to the present study. So, patients who underwent TUR-P might have an advantage. Therefore, TUR-P should be recommended to patients with prostate abscesses, although surgical procedures are not necessary for relatively small abscesses.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^114DwjGi]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Regardless of the surgical procedure, the presence of a prostatic abscess did not increase the risk of septic shock during treatment. In our experience, patients with prostate abscesses require long-term antibiotic treatment and potentially surgery depending on abscess size. However, abscess formation may not exert an influence on the prognosis, such as septic shock or death, under the assumption that they were treated appropriately.

The vast majority of acute prostatitis were infected by gram negative bacteria. Regardless of the presence of an abscess, the selection of empirical antibiotics with cefoxitin, cefotaxime or ciprofloxacin would be appropriate in patients with acute prostatitis who have not undergone urological procedure (s) in Korea. Nevertheless, clinicians should be ready to adjust the antibiotic regimen according to susceptibility data, especially in the case of prostate abscess. This is because unexpected microorganisms are more likely to be isolated in acute prostatitis with abscess than in those without abscess.

This study has limitations. It is a retrospective, multi-centre chart review in design which has potential biases associated with it, however designing a randomised control trial comparing treatment outcome in 2 groups of equally matched patients with prostatic abscess is not feasible given the rarity, severity of the disease and heterogeneity of management for this condition throughout the urological community.

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: an analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^1121KemT]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, a multitude of guidelines for the surgical treatment of LUTS/BPO is available. They largely agree on established therapies backed by a substantial body of evidence but also exhibit relevant discrepancies. These differences may not only indicate gaps in evidence but also the need for clearer criteria regarding the evidence required for a guideline recommendation of novel treatments. The plethora of treatment options facilitates more patient-oriented therapy. However, this also means that guidelines should pay more attention to systematic representation of patient factors, such as comorbidities, anticoagulation status, and desire to preserve ejaculation. Our consensus algorithm not only facilitates a quick overview of different scenarios but also highlights areas of agreement and discrepancy among key guidelines, aiding urologists in decision-making and patient counseling.

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^111HgGCH]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Ejaculatory dysfunction — Aspermia is the absence of antegrade ejaculation with orgasm, and retrograde ejaculation is the backward flow of ejaculate into the bladder instead of antegrade expulsion. After retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancer, loss of emission can occur from hypogastric plexus damage; it is important to counsel these men about sperm banking before surgery when they desire future fertility, and there is no available treatment for restoring seminal emission in these patients. Retrograde ejaculation can be secondary to medications inhibiting bladder neck closure (i.e., alpha blockers) or surgical procedures on the prostate and/or bladder neck; when caused by an alpha blocker, stopping the medication will restore antegrade ejaculation, and medical therapies include alpha agonists and tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine, with variable results. If medical therapies are not successful or are not attempted, sperm can be collected using postejaculatory urine specimens for either IUI or IVF, with conventional protocols including urine alkalinization for a period of 24 hours followed by a postorgasm urinalysis. In spinal cord injury, there has been encouraging success with penile vibratory stimulation as a minimally invasive method to potentially harvest sperm, and when this is ineffective and an ejaculation is desired for fertility purposes, electroejaculation has shown promising results.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^111k9qDG]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for abscess formation in acute bacterial prostatitis, and to compare treatment outcomes between abscess group and non-abscess group.

Methods

This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. All patients suspected of having an acute prostatic infection underwent computed tomography or transrectal ultrasonography to discriminate acute prostatic abscesses from acute prostatitis without abscess formation.

Results

A total of 31 prostate abscesses were reviewed among 142 patients with acute prostatitis. Univariate analysis revealed that symptom duration, diabetes mellitus and voiding disturbance were predisposing factors for abscess formation in acute prostatitis. However, diabetes mellitus was not related to prostate abscess in multivariate analysis. Patients with abscesses < 20 mm in size did not undergo surgery and were cured without any complications. In contrast, patients with abscesses > 20 mm who underwent transurethral resection had a shorter duration of antibiotic treatment than did those who did not have surgery. Regardless of surgical treatment, both the length of hospital stay and antibiotic treatment were longer in patients with prostatic abscesses than they were in those without abscesses. However, the incidence of septic shock was not different between the two groups. A wide spectrum of microorganisms was responsible for prostate abscesses. In contrast, Escherichia coli was the predominant organism responsible for acute prostatitis without abscess.

Conclusion

Imaging studies should be considered when patients with acute prostatitis have delayed treatment and signs of voiding disturbance. Early diagnosis is beneficial because prostatic abscesses require prolonged treatment protocols, or even require surgical drainage. Surgical drainage procedures such as transurethral resection of the prostate were not necessary in all patients with prostate abscesses. However, surgical intervention may have potential merits that reduce the antibiotic exposure period and enhance voiding function in patients with prostatic abscess.

Sensitivity analysis 1

Figure 1 shows a decision tree that split into two arms, one for each intervention. Each arm consisted of the different outcomes and their associated probabilities, total costs and assigned QALY values (table 3). In each arm, the total cost of an outcome was derived from the sum of the intervention cost and cost of managing the complications observed. The individual QALY value of each patient-reported complication was considered for each branch to account for its impact on QoL post intervention in the analysis.

Figure 1
Decision tree showing sensitivity analysis 1 (including expected QALY and cost (in £ per patient). PAE, prostate artery embolization; QALY, quality-adjusted life year; TURP, transurethral resection of the prostate.

Outcomes where urinary infection was present were assigned a QALY value of 0.93, while outcomes where incontinence was present were assigned a QALY value of 0.89, in line with the literature.

The average QALY value for the group of patients who experienced no complications was 0.96 in the PAE arm and 0.99 in the TURP arm (outcome 11 and 7 in table 3, respectively). For the purpose of a sensitivity analysis, where urinary infection and/or incontinence was absent, but other complications (hematuria, hematospermia and/or retrograde ejaculation) were present, a QALY value of 0.96 was assigned in the PAE arm and 0.99 in the TURP arm. This is because these complications had no pre-existing associated utility values in the literature and can be considered painless/benign. Therefore, such complications were assumed to be associated with 'perfect health'.

The QALY values and total costs associated with each outcome were used with corresponding probability values, to derive an expected cost and expected QALY for each intervention. An ICER was subsequently derived.

Sensitivity analysis 2

Figure 2 shows the decision tree of a further sensitivity analysis that involved assigning all outcomes associated with complications a QALY of 0.89, as this was the lowest QALY associated with a patient-reported complication (incontinence). This allowed another ICER to be derived to investigate the impact of complications on the cost-effectiveness of PAE versus TURP, assuming the complications were associated with worse QALY values.

### Prostatitis [^116yUBYf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is a common condition that accounts for a significant number of visits to both the emergency department and the urologist. The precise pathogenic mechanism of prostatitis is not known. The most prevalent theory is that reflux of urine from the urethra into the intraprostatic ducts promotes ascending infection and leads to chemical or bacterial prostatitis. Treatment is challenging because many antimicrobial agents do not effectively diffuse into prostatic tissue and many cases of prostatitis are not found to have an infectious etiology. Prostatitis can be divided into different classifications which range from acute severe infections, to chronic indolent infections, to chronic pain syndromes. The differentiation and management of these entities can be difficult. This article seeks to clarify the different infections, and provide a rational approach to treatment and disposition of these patients.

### Antibiotic treatment can delay ejaculation in patients with premature ejaculation and chronic bacterial prostatitis [^116nPN3i]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Premature ejaculation (PE) is regarded as the most common male sexual disorder. Previous studies reported that prostatic inflammation was highly prevalent in PE. However, the effect of antibiotic treatment of cases with PE and chronic prostatitis has not been extensively investigated.

Aim

To examine the effect of antibiotic treatment in delaying ejaculation in patients with PE and chronic prostatitis.

Methods

A total of 145 consecutive men attending of secondary premature ejaculation (SPE) were included in this study. Sequential microbiologic specimens were obtained from urine and prostatic fluid. Antibiotics were given for 1 month according to the results of their culture and sensitivity test. All patients were instructed to follow up with our clinic monthly for at least 4 months. At the end of the 4-month follow-up, another prostatic secretion analysis was performed.

Results

Based on expressed prostatic secretion culture and white blood cell (WBC) count, 94 (64.8%) were having chronic bacterial prostatitis. The remaining 51 (35.2%) patients had negative WBC count. Of the 94 patients with SPE and chronic bacterial prostatitis, 20 patients were left untreated and considered as a control group. All 74 patients with PE and chronic prostatitis continued the 1-month treatment duration. Following 1-month antibiotic treatment, all 74 patients with initially positive cultures had sterile final cultures (P < 0.05). Sixty-two (83.9%) patients showed increases in their ejaculatory latency time and reported good control of their ejaculation and were considered treatment responsive. None of the control group patients experienced any improvement either in their prostatic infection condition or in their ejaculation time. The follow-up of treatment-responsive patients (N = 62) revealed no recurrence of PE with negative prostatic culture.

Conclusions

Successful eradication of causative organisms in patients with PE and chronic prostatitis may lead to marked improvement in intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and ejaculatory control.

### Prostate cancer misdiagnosed as prostatic abscess: case report and literature review [^111G3xUX]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common malignant tumors in men, prostate cancer (PCa) has garnered substantial research investment from the medical community. However, due to multiple challenges in diagnostic techniques and clinical practice, cases of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis still persist.

Case presentation

This article presents a case of a 36-year-old male renal transplant recipient (RTR) who was initially misdiagnosed with prostatic abscess (PA) due to perineal discomfort, but was later confirmed to have PCa through surgery.

Conclusion

This case highlights the similarities in symptoms and imaging manifestations between PCa and PA, as well as the complexity involved in diagnosing PCa. Furthermore, the article particularly underscores the significance of being vigilant about the increased risk of PCa following kidney transplantation, employing clinical examination methods judiciously, and enhancing the ability to differentiate PCa.

In this study, the symptom duration and voiding disturbance with low Qmax (< 5 ml/sec) or high residual urine (> 100 ml) were associated with abscess formation in acute bacterial prostatitis. Two of 17 prostate abscess patients with voiding problems had urethral stricture. The size of the prostate tended to be larger in acute prostatitis patients with abscesses than in those without abscesses, although not significantly. Over half of the patients in the abscess group (51.6%) had DM, while 28.8% of non-abscess patients had DM (p = 0.03, OR = 2.633). Other underlying medical diseases were not associated with the presence of prostate abscess. Catheterization also did not exert an influence on abscess formation in this study. In multivariate analysis, symptom duration and voiding disturbances were predisposing factors for abscess formation in acute prostatitis (Table 2).

Table 2
Multivariate analysis of risk factors for abscess formation in acute bacterial prostatitis

Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression test

Twenty-six patients (83.8%) with acute prostatitis with abscesses eventually underwent suprapubic cystostomy. 14 patients with prostate abscess (45.2%) had transurethral resection of prostate (TUR-P) during the treatment period (Fig. 1). Among those 14 patients, one with a liver abscess simultaneously underwent percutaneous drainage for liver abscess. Only one patient among 15 patients who had prostate abscess larger than 20 mm in maximal diameter, did not have any procedures, and eventually died two days after admission. 16 patients with abscesses less than 20 mm in size were treated conservatively (Fig. 2a and b). Among the 30 survivors with prostatic abscesses, only one patient who had been treated conservatively developed a recurrence within 3 months. This patient eventually underwent transurethral resection of prostate.

### Inflammatory disorders of the prostate and the distal genital tract [^115wh2bX]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Inflammatory disease of the prostate and distal genital tract is emerging as a major health problem because it is estimated that up to 15% of adult men may be affected at some point in their lives. Clinically, the diagnosis of "prostatitis" refers to multiple disorders that cause pelvic pain and discomfort, ranging from acute bacterial infection to complex conditions that may not necessarily be caused by prostatic inflammation. Because the traditional etiology-based classification system did not always correlate with symptoms and therapeutic efficacy, a new classification of prostatitis has been suggested by the National Institutes of Health. New imaging techniques such as high-resolution transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and MR imaging provide exquisite anatomic detail and often play a crucial role in the evaluation of these patients.

### Incidental findings in and around the prostate on prostate MRI: a pictorial review [^115yBHdc]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Prostate and periprostatic region

Haematospermia with and without stone in seminal vesicles

On T2W images, seminal vesicles appear as high-intensity sac-like structures and can be easily differentiated from significantly lower signal intensity of periprostatic fat. On T1W images, this signal pattern is reversed, and seminal vesicles have lower signal intensity compared to periprostatic fat.

Haematospermia is the presence of blood in the seminal fluid. Normal appearances of the seminal vesicles are grape-like clusters with high T2 signal intensity of internal content and low T2 signal intensity of the wall. The size of normal seminal vesicles is highly variable. Given blood has intrinsic high T1 signal; this is on its own a benign and usually straightforward diagnosis to make. However, high T1 signal can also be seen in the seminal vesicles with no haematospermia due to proteinaceous content. Haematospermia is usually a benign and self-limiting condition commonly seen in young sexually active males but albeit invokes anxiety in the patient and referrer.

In Fig. 1 a–d, the cause for haematospermia is also demonstrated, which is a small stone in bilateral seminal vesicles. Calculi are low T2 signal on MRI. Seminal vesicle stones are rare and are postulated to be associated with urinary tract infections, anomalies, obstruction and reflux into the ejaculatory duct. Other aetiologies include prior biopsy or focal therapies; however, often the cause remains idiopathic. Patients presenting with stones in the seminal vesicles may be asymptomatic or symptomatic with haematospermia, testicular pain, painful ejaculation, low ejaculate volumes or infertility.

### Ejaculation frequency and risk of prostate cancer: updated results with an additional decade of follow-up [^1148UPUJ]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that ejaculation frequency may be inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer (PCa), a disease for which few modifiable risk factors have been identified.

Objective

To incorporate an additional 10 yr of follow-up into an original analysis and to comprehensively evaluate the association between ejaculation frequency and PCa, accounting for screening, clinically relevant disease subgroups, and the impact of mortality from other causes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective cohort study of participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study utilizing self-reported data on average monthly ejaculation frequency. The study includes 31925 men who answered questions on ejaculation frequency on a 1992 questionnaire and followed through to 2010. The average monthly ejaculation frequency was assessed at three time points: age 20–29 yr, age 40–49 yr, and the year before questionnaire distribution.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Incidence of total PCa and clinically relevant disease subgroups. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results and Limitations

During 480831 person-years, 3839 men were diagnosed with PCa. Ejaculation frequency at age 40–49 yr was positively associated with age-standardized body mass index, physical activity, divorce, history of sexually transmitted infections, and consumption of total calories and alcohol. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test utilization by 2008, number of PSA tests, and frequency of prostate biopsy were similar across frequency categories. In multivariable analyses, the hazard ratio for PCa incidence for ≥ 21 compared to 4–7 ejaculations per month was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.92; p < 0.0001 for trend) for frequency at age 20–29 yr and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69–0.89; p < 0.0001 for trend) for frequency at age 40–49 yr. Associations were driven by low-risk disease, were similar when restricted to a PSA-screened cohort, and were unlikely to be explained by competing causes of death.

Conclusions

These findings provide additional evidence of a beneficial role of more frequent ejaculation throughout adult life in the etiology of PCa, particularly for low-risk disease.

Patient Summary

We evaluated whether ejaculation frequency throughout adulthood is related to prostate cancer risk in a large US-based study. We found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### Emphysematous prostatic abscess: a case report and review of literature [^112D1LKr]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Emphysematous prostatic abscess, namely, is an inflammatory process associated with gas and abscess formation in the prostate gland. It is a rare clinical condition and a few cases have been reported in the literature. We report a case of emphysematous prostatic abscess due to Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 60-year-old man with a 5-year history of diabetes mellitus and a 6-year history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Computerized tomography confirmed the clinical diagnosis. We successfully treated the patient with parenteral antimicrobial agents and surgical drainage. The patient was discharged without any voiding difficulty.

### Recommendations for conducting invasive urodynamics for men with lower urinary tract symptoms: qualitative interview findings from a large randomized controlled trial (UPSTREAM) [^1117cNem]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ninety percent of men aged 50‐80 years live with one or more lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which can negatively impact quality of life. 1 LUTS prevalence and severity increase with age, and with demographic aging the management of LUTS is an increasing priority.

Optimal LUTS treatment depends on identifying causal mechanisms. Urodynamic testing is well established in functional urological assessment for men with LUTS, to determine underlying pathologic lower urinary tract conditions. 2 Urodynamics with invasive multichannel cystometry involves inserting small catheters in the bladder and rectum to measure bladder function and capacity. In current pathways, multi‐channel urodynamics is for men who remain bothered by voiding LUTS despite initial pharmacological treatment, and are therefore considering interventional care. 3 It aims to help determine whether an individual would realistically benefit from relief of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and whether there are any risk factors for adverse outcomes.

However, there is variation in urodynamic practice in most countries, including the UK, 4 reflecting ongoing debate about the extent to which urodynamics should be used. 3 Some clinicians advocate routine use of urodynamics to determine which men have BOO and will therefore benefit from surgery, and to prevent intervention in men who do not have BOO and will be at risk of adverse effects of unnecessary surgery (eg, retrograde ejaculation because of transurethral resection of the prostate). Others advocate restricted use of urodynamics due to possible complication rates, perceived unpleasant experience, lack of evidence of better outcomes, and associated cost. 5, 6 Systematic reviews examining the outcomes of urodynamics are inconclusive, 7, 8 and current guidelines consequently make only limited recommendations for testing. 9

### Ejaculation frequency and subsequent risk of prostate cancer [^113S9CaD]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Sexual activity has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of prostate cancer, but epidemiological data are virtually limited to case-control studies, which may be prone to bias because recall among individuals with prostate cancer could be distorted as a consequence of prostate malignancy or ongoing therapy.

Objective

To examine the association between ejaculation frequency, which includes sexual intercourse, nocturnal emission, and masturbation and risk of prostate cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective study using follow-up data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (February 1, 1992, through January 31, 2000) of 29 342 US men aged 46 to 81 years, who provided information on history of ejaculation frequency on a self-administered questionnaire in 1992 and responded to follow-up questionnaires every 2 years to 2000. Ejaculation frequency was assessed by asking participants to report the average number of ejaculations they had per month during the ages of 20 to 29 years, 40 to 49 years, and during the past year (1991).

Main Outcome Measure

Incidence of total prostate cancer.

Results

During 222 426 person-years of follow-up, there were 1449 new cases of total prostate cancer, 953 organ-confined cases, and 147 advanced cases of prostate cancer. Most categories of ejaculation frequency were unrelated to risk of prostate cancer. However, high ejaculation frequency was related to decreased risk of total prostate cancer. The multivariate relative risks for men reporting 21 or more ejaculations per month compared with men reporting 4 to 7 ejaculations per month at ages 20 to 29 years were 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73–1.10); ages 40 to 49 years, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.53–0.86); previous year, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.27–0.88); and averaged across a lifetime, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.51–0.89). Similar associations were observed for organ-confined prostate cancer. Ejaculation frequency was not statistically significantly associated with risk of advanced prostate cancer.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that ejaculation frequency is not related to increased risk of prostate cancer.

### Ejaculatory duct obstruction [^111yP9Hh]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Ejaculatory duct obstruction presents with infertility, pain, or hematospermia. Partial or functional forms of ejaculatory duct obstruction can be difficult to diagnose. Transrectal ultrasound has replaced formal vasography as the first-line diagnostic test but is not specific. Adjunctive procedures such as seminal vesicle aspiration, seminal vesiculography, and chromotubation further delineate the diagnosis. Using an evidence-based approach, this article reviews how best to approach the diagnosis and treatment of ejaculatory duct obstruction.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial prostatitis, more specifically with respect to management of voiding symptoms, CUA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider administering α-blockers to reduce the risk of urinary retention and facilitate micturition, particularly in patients with moderately severe obstructive voiding symptoms.

### Hydrogel spacer rectal wall infiltration associated with severe rectal injury and related complications after dose intensified prostate cancer stereotactic ablative radiation therapy [^111LfhBa]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Sagittal (A) and axial (B) follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography images at 7 months posttreatment blended with pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging depict a large defect in the lower anterior rectal wall corresponding to the abnormal area shown in Fig. 1 A. This results in free communication between the rectal lumen and the air-filled rectoprostatic space, in keeping with the wall defect identified on sigmoidoscopy (C).

At 9 months after RT completion, the patient developed urine per rectum, related to a large recto-urethral fistula, as shown on retrograde urethrogam (Fig. 4). Despite receiving suprapubic tube in attempt to temporize for flap repair, he developed osteomyelitis and soft tissue abscess, eventually requiring abdomino-perineal resection, cystoprostatectomy, and ileal conduit urinary diversion, now at 15 months from RT. Pathology demonstrated prostate adenocarcinoma with marked radiation therapy changes confined to the prostate and at the prostatic urethra margin, rectourethral fistula tract, and unremarkable rectal mucosa. Due to these complications and corrective procedures, the patient has required routine physical therapy and had to take leave from work for several months, with associated substantial effects on his quality of life. Despite this, he has made remarkable progress. As of last follow-up, he has undetectable prostate-specific antigen, is without evidence of infection or further sequelae, and has even returned to work full time.
