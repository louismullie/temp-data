## Question

How does the FABER test differentiate between hip and lower back pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the FABER test can be used to differentiate between hip pain and lower back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomy and mechanics of FABER and which structures it stresses. Then, I should verify the expected pain locations that point to intra-articular hip pathology versus sacroiliac or lumbar sources. Next, I will review the diagnostic accuracy and limitations of FABER, including sensitivity and specificity. After that, I need to integrate FABER into a cluster approach with other tests to improve diagnostic confidence. Finally, I will consider special scenarios and when to escalate to diagnostic injections or imaging, and then synthesize a practical decision pathway with caveats about overlap and dual pathology.

> Let me first confirm the mechanics and anatomical targets of FABER. FABER stands for Flexion, Abduction, External Rotation, and in the classic Patrick maneuver the patient lies supine, the tested hip is flexed, abducted, and externally rotated so the foot rests on the contralateral knee, and the examiner stabilizes the pelvis and applies a gentle downward force on the flexed knee to load the joint and surrounding structures, which compresses and tensions the hip joint capsule, labrum, and cartilage while also stressing the ipsilateral sacroiliac joint depending on force direction and stabilization, so I need to ensure I'm interpreting pain location in that context [^114WxbQx] [^111oRuJ7] [^1156wkVD].

> Now, I should verify the pain localization that suggests intra-articular hip pathology. Pain reproduced in the anterior groin during FABER strongly suggests intra-articular hip disease such as labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement, osteoarthritis, or ligamentum teres pathology, and I should double-check that this anterior groin signal is consistent with the patient's typical pain complaint to avoid false positives from non-specific provocation [^113aGLde] [^11241nJH] [^1116mF1G].

> Wait, let me verify the posterior pain signal. Pain localized to the posterior buttock near the ipsilateral sacroiliac joint during FABER, especially when the force vector and stabilization stress the SI region, supports SI joint–mediated pain rather than primary hip pathology, and I should confirm that this buttock pain is below the L5 level and not accompanied by dermatomal radiation or neurologic deficits to keep lumbar radiculopathy lower on the list [^111oRuJ7] [^1156wkVD] [^111L8CGt].

> Hold on, I should review the diagnostic performance so I don't overstate certainty. FABER shows moderate to high sensitivity but low specificity for intra-articular hip pathology, with sensitivity around 0.82–0.88 in some cohorts and much lower specificity, meaning a positive FABER can support but not confirm hip disease, whereas a negative FABER is more useful to help rule out intra-articular hip pain when combined with other negative findings; similarly, for SI joint pain, FABER can be among the more sensitive provocation tests but still requires clustering to reach acceptable diagnostic accuracy [^113i9MrE] [^11128WZP] [^114QKUEr] [^1171nRQF].

> I need to ensure I'm not relying on FABER in isolation. Let me consider the cluster approach: for suspected SI joint pain, three or more positive SI provocation tests, including FABER, distraction, compression, thigh thrust, and Gaenslen, yields substantially improved diagnostic confidence, with reported sensitivity around 85–91% and specificity around 76–78%, so FABER should be interpreted within this battery rather than as a standalone test [^114QKUEr] [^111L8CGt] [^113r1QoJ].

> Next, I should review complementary hip-focused tests to triangulate the hip source. FADIR tends to be more sensitive for femoroacetabular impingement and labral pathology, and a positive FADIR with a positive FABER strengthens the case for intra-articular hip pain; conversely, pain-free FADIR and no restricted FABER ROM compared with the unaffected side help rule out FAIS, so I should double-check symmetry and pain quality across both maneuvers before concluding [^11128WZP] [^116qxBAk] [^117Ccoqz].

> But wait, what if the pain is lateral rather than anterior or posterior. Lateral hip pain with FABER, especially when accompanied by point tenderness over the greater trochanter and pain with resisted abduction or single-leg stance, steers me toward greater trochanteric pain syndrome rather than intra-articular hip disease, and I should confirm that the pain does not localize to the groin or SI region to avoid misclassification [^111fzxKn] [^116CBQeA] [^116xceRo].

> I will now examine the role of range-of-motion asymmetry within FABER as an additional clue. A side-to-side difference in FABER excursion of roughly 4 cm or more, the FABER distance test, correlates with higher alpha angles and can serve as a screening marker for cam-type FAI, though it is not diagnostic on its own and should be integrated with impingement tests and, when needed, imaging to confirm morphology and intra-articular pathology [^114MxZ3K] [^1137ezSR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the spine just because FABER is negative. I should confirm lumbar and radicular features with straight leg raise, seated or supine slump, and neurologic screening, and I need to remember that facet-mediated pain can mimic hip or SI pain radiating to the buttock or groin, so FABER positivity must be weighed against the broader clinical picture and, when indicated, diagnostic blocks to localize the generator [^117Hnggr] [^116hsNDS] [^111sJMPi].

> Let me consider special scenarios and dual pathology. Hip-spine syndrome is common, and up to a quarter of patients presenting with low back pain may have clinically meaningful hip or SI contributions, so a positive FABER may reflect a hip source, an SI source, or both, and I should double-check for concurrent lumbar stenosis or facet disease when symptoms persist despite targeted hip or SI interventions [^113XFRyu] [^111c5gQ5] [^112LanHG].

> Next, I should review when to escalate diagnostic certainty. If history, FABER within a cluster, and basic imaging are inconclusive, image-guided intra-articular hip injection that relieves pain supports an intra-articular source, whereas SI joint injection that relieves pain supports SI pathology. In complex cases with combined hip and spine disease, diagnostic injections can clarify the predominant pain generator and guide sequencing of care, and I need to ensure these are interpreted alongside the clinical examination rather than in isolation [^1124MX3s] [^114QuXzC] [^116RkVbw].

> Synthesis for practice: I should confirm that FABER is performed with proper stabilization and graded load, then interpret pain location as follows: anterior groin pain supports intra-articular hip pathology, posterior buttock pain near the SI joint supports SI pathology, and lateral pain over the greater trochanter supports GTPS. Because FABER has limited specificity, I must integrate it with FADIR, other SI provocation tests, neuro screening, and, when needed, diagnostic injections to avoid misattribution and to identify dual generators that require staged or combined management [^111oRuJ7] [^11128WZP] [^117Hnggr].

The FABER test helps distinguish hip from lower back pain by **pain location and ROM asymmetry** [^111oRuJ7] [^114MxZ3K]. Hip pathology typically produces **anterior groin pain** with limited ROM and a side-to-side difference ≥ 4 cm, whereas lower back or sacroiliac pain localizes to the **posterior buttock or low back** without groin symptoms [^115JTzsG] [^114RNySH] [^114MxZ3K] [^111oRuJ7]. A positive FABER is sensitive but not specific for hip disease; **interpret results with the clinical context and other tests** (FADIR, straight leg raise, SI provocation) to improve diagnostic accuracy [^11128WZP] [^1156TcW5] [^111L8CGt].

---

## Clinical technique of the FABER test

- **Patient position**: Supine, pelvis stabilized.
- **Examiner action**: Flex, abduct, and externally rotate the tested hip, placing the foot on the contralateral knee (figure-four).
- **Force application**: Gentle downward pressure on the knee while stabilizing the contralateral ASIS.
- **Positive test**: Reproduction of the patient's typical pain and/or limited ROM compared to the unaffected side [^1144tJ31].

---

## Interpretation of FABER test results

| **Pain location** | **Likely pathology** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Anterior groin | Hip joint pathology (e.g. labral tear, FAI, osteoarthritis) | Positive for hip pathology |
| Posterior buttock or low back | Sacroiliac joint dysfunction or lumbar spine pathology | Positive for SIJ or lumbar pathology |
| Lateral hip | Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) | Positive for GTPS [^111fzxKn] |

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of the FABER test

- **Sensitivity**: High for intra-articular hip pathology (approximately 82–88%) [^113i9MrE].
- **Specificity**: Low (approximately 25%), indicating false positives are common [^113i9MrE].
- **FABER distance**: A side-to-side difference ≥ 4 cm suggests hip pathology, particularly cam-type FAI [^114MxZ3K].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Overlap**: Hip and spine pathologies can coexist, complicating interpretation [^111c5gQ5].
- **False positives**: Common due to low specificity; results must be contextualized [^11128WZP].
- **Patient factors**: Age, BMI, and comorbidities can affect test performance [^notfound].

---

## Integration with other clinical tests

To improve diagnostic accuracy, the FABER test should be **combined with other tests**:

- **FADIR test**: High sensitivity for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) [^11128WZP].
- **Straight leg raise**: Screens for lumbar radiculopathy [^111sJMPi].
- **SIJ provocation tests**: Thigh thrust, distraction, compression, Gaenslen's test [^113r1QoJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines recommend using FABER within a **comprehensive assessment** that includes history, physical examination, and imaging when indicated [^11241nJH]. Clinicians should consider **diagnostic injections** (hip or SIJ) when the source remains uncertain [^1124MX3s].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Pain location**: Anterior groin pain suggests hip pathology; posterior buttock or low back pain suggests SIJ or lumbar pathology.
- **ROM asymmetry**: A side-to-side difference ≥ 4 cm supports hip pathology [^114MxZ3K].
- **Accuracy**: High sensitivity, low specificity; interpret with clinical context [^113i9MrE].
- **Combination**: Use with other tests (FADIR, straight leg raise, SIJ provocation) for better accuracy [^111L8CGt].

---

The FABER test is a **useful screening tool** for differentiating hip from lower back pain, but its low specificity necessitates integration with other clinical findings and tests for accurate diagnosis [^113i9MrE].

Figure 4
Seated slump test: 1) While seated, the patient is instructed to place her hands behind her back and then slump into cervical, thoracic, and lumbar flexion; 2) The examiner then extends the knee and dorsiflexes the ankle of the affected leg (A); 3) The test is positive if the patient's typical pain is reproduced with this maneuver and is subsequently relieved with neck extension (B).

For lumbar disc herniations, the seated slump test has a sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.83, which is overall superior to the straight leg raise test (sensitivity of 0.52 and specificity of 0.89). The predictive value of the seated slump test for lumbar radicular pain is not ideal. In patients with a negative seated slump test but high clinical suspicion for radicular pain, conservative management can be pursued despite the negative test. Additionally, the patient can be referred to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist for further evaluation. Of note, thorough discussion of the femoral nerve stretch test is beyond the scope of this article, but this test has also been shown to have a high likelihood ratio for mid-lumbar nerve root impingement.

Conclusion

The usefulness and clinical adoption of this algorithm is predicated on a grasp of several key takeaway points and the flexibility to incorporate rapidly emerging new technologies into the continuum of care. Many patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain are in their 30–50s underscoring the reality that their spine care will span many forthcoming decades. In summary, the starting point for the physical examination assessment is in the identification of patients with midline low back pain with no neurologic deficits that is increased with forward flexion and sitting who have a positive sustained hip flexion test that narrows the diagnostic aperture to anterior column involvement as the primary pain source. The identification of painful intervertebral discs is done via MRI and MRS which represents a potentially novel breakthrough in the precise and personalized diagnosis of lumbar discogenic pain. When these advancements in quantitative imaging are combined with effective first line intradiscal interventions, the potential exists to optimize spine care by restoring and preserving native disc structure and mechanics. There has been a renewed appreciation of the importance of the intervertebral disc as a catalyst in spine degeneration and this has hastened the development of new diagnostic and treatment technologies aimed at averting spinal surgery. A concerted and collaborative effort will be necessary from all stakeholders to amass the supporting compendium of data to fulfill regulatory and reimbursement requirements so that effective treatments can be made available to patients.

Physical Examination

While there exist several specialized tests to support a diagnosis of SID, the Fortin finger test is one of the more specific tests in the physical exam. This test is positive if the patient's major foci of pain is within 1 cm of the posterior superior iliac spine, generally inferomedially. Laslett et al described the presence of 3 of the following 5 provocative tests is associated with a high specificity of SID pathology. These provocative tests are positive if they serve to reproduce the patient's pain. All the following tests are performed with the patient supine, unless otherwise specified:
SIJ distraction: lateral pressure over the anterior iliac spine impinges the SIJs bilaterally.
SIJ compression: posterior-to-anterior compression over the sacrum or medially directed compression (with the patient in a lateral decubitus position) of the iliac crest.
Gaenslen's maneuver: excessive hip flexion of the contralateral SIJ with hip extension of the implicated laterality (by having this leg hanging off the exam table).
Patrick's test: hip flexion (to at least 90 degrees), abduction, and external rotation of the implicated laterality.
Thigh thrust: applying a high-velocity thrust into the femur (in 90 degrees of flexion) from superior to inferior into the SIJ.

Best Practice Statement on the Physical Examination in SIJ Dysfunction

The clinician should understand the validated physical examination maneuvers that play a role in the diagnosis of SID. The presence of three positive provocative maneuvers increases the specificity of diagnosing SIJ dysfunction, although less than three positive provocation maneuvers does not entirely rule out the SIJ as a source of pain.

Imaging Modalities

For chronic low back pain overall, the utility of imaging modalities has been shown to lack clinical relevance in certain etiologies. Moreover, the presence of various degenerative findings on imaging tests has not been shown to correlate to clear pathology with reliable specificity. In a review of computed tomography (CT) scans of 373 patients without low back pain, Eno et al found that radiographic signs of SIJ degeneration were present in 65.1% of patients. These findings are expected given that the presence of non-specific radiographic degenerative changes increases with age. However, imaging studies may be helpful to rule out alternate non-degenerative pathologies including tumor, infection, fracture, etc. Moreover, imaging studies may also prove useful in assisting with the planning of advanced interventions and surgeries.

4.6.4 Sacroiliac joint pain and dysfunction

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is the largest axial joint and consists of a synovial joint and complex ligamentous structures. SIJ dysfunction is a common cause of low back, buttock, and leg pain, with a prevalence of 15%–30% in persons presenting with low back pain. Although the sacroiliac joint is located in the posterior pelvis, pain arising from the joint can manifest as pain in the lumbar spine, buttock, leg distal to the knee, and into the foot. The pain tends to worsen with transitions, such as from sitting to standing. Numerous provocative tests have been described. Pain to palpation of the SIJ (just inferior and medial to the posterior superior iliac spine) and absence of pain above L5 support the diagnosis. Additional evidence‐based tests include Gaenslen's test, SIJ distraction test, thigh thrust test, SIJ compression test, and the FABER test, although none of these tests have high reliability when used alone. Due to the challenging nature of the diagnosis, some experts advocate that the presence of three positive tests should be considered indicative of SIJ dysfunction (sensitivity 0.94, specificity 0.78). Injection into the SIJ can also provide diagnostic and/or therapeutic benefit and confirm the diagnosis.

Although inflammatory arthritides and spondyloarthropathies may present with SIJ pain, a comprehensive review of relevant history and physical examination findings is beyond the scope of this review. However, clinicians should strongly consider the possibility in patients with skin or nail manifestations of psoriasis, a personal history of uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease, a family history of spondyloarthropathy, or clinical dactylitis.

Description of included studies

The characteristics of included studies are shown in the online supplementary table 1. The studies were performed in Canada, the USAand France. All studies were prospective. Seventeen clinical tests and two test combinations were reported. Three studies investigated the FABER test, but only one of these reported specificity. Two studies examined the FABER distance test(only one reported specificity). Two studies investigated the Stinchfield test(only one reported specificity). Two studies investigated the sensitivity of the posterior impingement test (PIT)(none reported specificity) and four studies investigated the FADIR test(only one reported specificity). For the remaining tests, there was only one study per test. In total, both sensitivity and specificity could be calculated for nine tests in five studies. For the other 10 clinical tests, only sensitivity could be calculated.

Studies provided data for 1666 hips. The prevalence of FAI morphology ranged from 10% to 64% (see table 1). Two studiesincluded only participants with confirmed FAI syndrome, while from another studywe extracted data from participants with confirmed FAI morphology and excluded asymptomatic participants so as to conform to our inclusion criteria.

Thigh Thrust Test

With the patient still supine and examiner standing on the patient's affected side, position the ipsilateral leg to 90-degree hip flexion and allow the knee to passively flex. The examiner places one hand on contralateral ASIS to stabilize the pelvis. The opposite hand is then placed on the anterior aspect of the passively flexed knee and vertical pressure is applied posteriorly through the patient's femur to create a shearing force at the affected SI joint. The test is positive when the patient's pain is reproduced.

FABER Test

While the patient remains supine, position the affected leg to 90-degree hip and knee flexion. Abduct and externally rotation the ipsilateral leg at the hip joint and rest the lateral aspect of the patient's calf on the anterior aspect of the contralateral thigh, resembling a figure four. The examiner places one hand on the contralateral ASIS to stabilize the pelvis. The opposite hand applies a gentle posteriorly directed force on the anteromedial aspect of the affected side knee. This test is positive for SI joint pain when the patient describes posteriorly localized pain near the affected side SI joint and can fulfill the three or more requirement for provocation testing. However, if the pain is described anteriorly this may indicate hip pathology as the sole or an additional source of pain contributing to the patient's presentation. At this point, addition hip special testing (i.e. Scour Test, FADIR Test) can be performed.

Compression Test

If the examiner must continue provocative testing to adequately evaluate the SI joint, the patient is asked to lie on the unaffected side with the suspected SI joint facing upward and both hips and knees comfortable flexed. Examiner will stand posterior to the patient at the level of the pelvis. The examiner places one palm between the upward-facing ASIS and greater trochanter and uses the free hand to brace the contacted hand. With the examiner's elbows fully extended, vertical pressure is applied through the pelvis into the exam table. The test is positive when the patient's pain is reproduced.

### Evaluation of the patient with hip pain [^115JTzsG]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Hip pain is a common and disabling condition that affects patients of all ages. The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad, presenting a diagnostic challenge. Patients often express that their hip pain is localized to one of three anatomic regions: the anterior hip and groin, the posterior hip and buttock, or the lateral hip. Anterior hip and groin pain is commonly associated with intra-articular pathology, such as osteoarthritis and hip labral tears. Posterior hip pain is associated with piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, lumbar radiculopathy, and less commonly ischiofemoral impingement and vascular claudication. Lateral hip pain occurs with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Clinical examination tests, although helpful, are not highly sensitive or specific for most diagnoses; however, a rational approach to the hip examination can be used. Radiography should be performed if acute fracture, dislocations, or stress fractures are suspected. Initial plain radiography of the hip should include an anteroposterior view of the pelvis and frog-leg lateral view of the symptomatic hip. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed if the history and plain radiograph results are not diagnostic. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable for the detection of occult traumatic fractures, stress fractures, and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Magnetic resonance arthrography is the diagnostic test of choice for labral tears.

### Does this patient have hip osteoarthritis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^1144eJSj]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of pain and disability.

Objective

To identify the clinical findings that are most strongly associated with hip OA.

Data Sources

Systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception until November 2019.

Study Selection

Included studies (1) quantified the accuracy of clinical findings (history, physical examination, or simple tests) and (2) used plain radiographs as the reference standard for diagnosing hip OA.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Studies were assigned levels of evidence using the Rational Clinical Examination scale and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Data were extracted using individual hips as the unit of analysis and only pooled when findings were reported in 3 or more studies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Six studies were included, with data from 1110 patients and 1324 hips, of which 509 (38%) showed radiographic evidence of OA. Among patients presenting to primary care physicians with hip or groin pain, the affected hip showed radiographic evidence of OA in 34% of cases. A family history of OA, personal history of knee OA, or pain on climbing stairs or walking up slopes all had LRs of 2.1 (sensitivity range, 33%-68%; specificity range, 68%-84%; broadest LR range: 95% CI, 1.1–3.8). To identify patients most likely to have OA, the most useful findings were squat causing posterior pain (sensitivity, 24%; specificity, 96%; LR, 6.1 [95% CI, 1.3–29]), groin pain on passive abduction or adduction (sensitivity, 33%; specificity, 94%; LR, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.6–20]), abductor weakness (sensitivity, 44%; specificity, 90%; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 2.4–8.4]), and decreased passive hip adduction (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 81%; LR, 4.2 [95% CI, 3.0–6.0]) or internal rotation (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 79%; LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.7–6.0]) as measured by a goniometer or compared with the contralateral leg. The presence of normal passive hip adduction was most useful for suggesting the absence of OA (negative LR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.11–0.54]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Simple tests of hip motion and observing for pain during that motion were helpful in distinguishing patients most likely to have OA on plain radiography from those who will not. A combination of findings efficiently detects those most likely to have severe hip OA.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^112VRbNS]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — diagnosis/classification and risk factors: Clinicians should consider the presence of osseous abnormalities, local or global ligamentous laxity, connective tissue disorders, and nature of the patient's activity and participation as risk factors for hip joint pathology (Recommendation based on expert opinion.). Clinicians should use the clinical findings of anterior groin or lateral hip pain or generalized hip joint pain that is reproduced with the hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation (FADIR) test or the hip flexion, abduction, external rotation (FABER) test, along with consistent imaging findings, to classify a patient with hip pain into the ICD categories of M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabula, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament, and the associated ICF impairment-based categories of hip pain (b28016 Pain in joints) and mobility impairments (b7100 Mobility of a single joint; b7150 Stability of a single joint) (Recommendation based on weak evidence.). Clinicians should consider diagnostic categories other than nonarthritic joint pain when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section or when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the impairments of body function (Recommendation based on expert opinion.).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^111sJMPi]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline glossary — serious neurologic conditions and examination are characterized as follows: Cauda equina syndrome is compression on nerve roots in the lumbosacral spine, usually due to a massive, centrally herniated disc or severe lumbar spinal stenosis, which can result in urinary retention or incontinence from loss of sphincter function, bilateral motor weakness of the lower extremities, and saddle anesthesia; a progressive neurologic deficit is an abnormal finding of altered function attributable to pathology of the nerves, spinal cord, or brain that worsens with serial examination, with examples including decreased sensation progressing to loss of sensation or reflexes moving from diminished to absent; and the straight leg raise test is a procedure in which the hip is flexed with the knee extended to tension the L4-S1 nerve roots and reproduce a patient's lower extremity symptoms and is usually considered positive when symptoms are reproduced between 30 and 70 degrees of hip flexion, with reproduction on the unaffected leg considered a positive crossed straight leg raise test.

### Demystifying the clinical diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome in women [^113Wj3BB]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 10 clinical tests that can be used in the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) in women, and to compare these clinical tests to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-eight participants with GTPS (49.5 ± 22.0 years) and 18 asymptomatic participants (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 52.5 ± 22.8 years) were included. A blinded physiotherapist performed 10 pain provocation tests potentially diagnostic for GTPS-palpation of the greater trochanter, resisted external derotation test, modified resisted external derotation test, standard and modified Ober's tests, Patrick's or FABER test, resisted hip abduction, single-leg stance test, and the resisted hip internal rotation test. A sample of 16 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic women undertook a hip MRI scan. Gluteal tendons were evaluated and categorized as no pathology, mild tendinosis, moderate tendinosis/partial tear, or full-thickness tear.

Results

Clinical test analyses show high specificity, high positive predictive value, low to moderate sensitivity, and negative predictive value for most clinical tests. All symptomatic and 88% of asymptomatic participants had pathological gluteal tendon changes on MRI, from mild tendinosis to full-thickness tear.

Conclusions

The study found the Patrick's or FABER test, palpation of the greater trochanter, resisted hip abduction, and the resisted external derotation test to have the highest diagnostic test accuracy for GTPS. Tendon pathology on MRI is seen in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits-hip osteoarthritis: revision 2017 [^1154hubr]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Appendix C — article inclusion and exclusion criteria for hip osteoarthritis (OA) — states that included evidence comprised "systematic reviews, meta-analyses, experimental, cohort, and cross-sectional studies", with diagnostic hip OA confirmed radiographically or clinically and "Have at least a sample size of 15 or greater"; if both hip and knee OA were studied, "the results must be reported separately". Eligible topics included tests and measures for diagnosis/differential diagnosis within physical therapy scope; imaging-based diagnosis (ultrasound, plain-film radiography, MRI); measurement properties using active/passive ROM, pain, manual muscle and special tests such as flexion–abduction–external rotation (FABER), flexion–adduction–internal rotation (FADIR), log roll, and scour; and measurement properties tied to function and participation including the 6-minute walk test, self-paced walk test, timed up-and-go test, Berg Balance Scale, 5-time sit-to-stand test, 10-m walk test, and EQ-5D, with "Interventions within the scope of the practice of physical therapy" (coordination, functional, gait and balance training; modalities; manual therapy; exercise; assistive devices; education). Exclusion criteria included study protocols, animal studies, "Children (aged less than 18 years)", primary surgical studies, and specific conditions (Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, congenital hip dislocation, SCFE, hip dysplasia, FAI).

### Low back pain [^113vTGPt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Manual therapy for low back pain — prediction rules for thrust manipulation: A derivation study identified five predictors of rapid treatment success, defined as a 50% or greater reduction in Oswestry Disability Index scores within 2 visits, with application of thrust manipulation to the lumbar spine, advice to remain active, and mobility exercise, namely duration of symptoms of less than 16 days, no symptoms distal to the knee, lumbar hypomobility, at least 1 hip with greater than 35° of internal rotation, and FABQ-W score less than 19. The presence of 4 or more predictors increased the probability of success with thrust manipulation from 45% to 95% and was validated in patients meeting 4 of the 5 predictors who received thrust manipulation (+LR = 13.2; 95% CI: 3.4, 52.1), with results remaining significant at 6-month follow-up. A pragmatic rule based on only 2 factors (duration less than 16 days and not having symptoms distal to the knee) yielded +LR = 7.2; 95% CI: 3.2, 16.1 for a successful outcome following application of thrust manipulation.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1138xq9T]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1.2 Avascular necrosis of the femoral head

Femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) occurs when disruption of the blood supply to the femoral head leads to bone death over months to years. AVN typically presents with groin pain or vague pain around the hip region, which can be mistaken for other disease conditions such as radiculopathy. In one retrospective case series, 38% of patients who were not given their initial correct diagnosis of AVN were misdiagnosed as having lumbar disc herniation. This diagnosis should be suspected in young people with groin pain, especially if they have risk factors that are etiological factors for AVN. If left untreated, AVN will lead to collapse of the femoral head and worse outcomes compared to patients identified in the early stages of the disease, underscoring the importance of early recognition.

AVN generally affects a younger population, with age at first treatment averaging between 33 and 38 years old. The etiology of AVN can be idiopathic or attributable to a wide range of causes including steroid use, alcohol use, sickle cell anemia, radiation, trauma, and vasculitis. Physical exam maneuvers to aid in diagnosis include assessing for decreased hip ROM and tests for intraarticular hip joint pathology (see next section).

Plain radiographs have a low sensitivity of detecting the disease, particularly in the early stages.MRI has a sensitivity > 0.90 when compared with surgical pathology. Although hip intraarticular injections can be used to identify pathology within the hip joint, such as AVN, and to distinguish it from radiculopathy, hip joint injections should be used with caution in this condition as they can contribute to progression of AVN.

### Identifying and treating a common cause of hip pain… [^112vcFNB]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Testing Radiography should be performed in patients in whom the history and physical examination are consistent with FAI. An anteroposterior view of the pelvis evaluates the hips for osteoarthritis; the acetabulum for dysplasia, overhang, or retroversion; the femoral head for osteonecrosis or remodeling; the sacroiliac joints for arthritis; and the lower lumbar spine. Because standard AP and lateral views of the hip can miss important abnormalities in patients with FAI, modified Dunn view radiography, in which the hip is flexed 90 degrees and abducted 20 degrees., should be ordered. 11 This view is highly sensitive for detecting cam lesions and osteophytes on the anterior femoral neck. 11 If concern for FAI persists, magnetic resonance arthrography is recommended to evaluate the labrum. Magnetic resonance imaging without arthrography has limited sensitivity for labral tears; arthrography improves sensitivity to 90 to 92 percent.

12, 13 Arthrography is usually accompanied by a diagnostic injection of local anesthetic. The patient should keep a pain diary for four days after the injection; relief of pain confirms an intra-articular origin of pain. The physician should keep in mind, however, that labral tears can be asymptomatic. One retrospective study found that intra-articular injection of the hip with bupivacaine during magnetic resonance arthrography has 92 percent sensitivity, 97 percent specificity, and 90 percent accuracy for diagnosis of an intra-articular disorder. 14 The absence of pain relief with the injection suggests an extra-articular source of pain, which theoretically rules out FAI. 15 However, the anesthetic will not relieve pain in some patients because contrast media can irritate the joint. In these patients, a separate diagnostic injection with bupivacaine can be done.

The goals of arthroscopy are to alleviate impingement, to repair or remove injured tissue, and to prevent or delay osteoarthritis. To alleviate impingement, pincer and cam lesions are removed and femoral offset is corrected, restoring bony alignment.

### European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic girdle pain [^115Xk85Q]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

A guideline on pelvic girdle pain (PGP) was developed by "Working Group 4" within the framework of the COST ACTION B13 "Low back pain: guidelines for its management", issued by the European Commission, Research Directorate-General, Department of Policy, Coordination and Strategy. To ensure an evidence-based approach, three subgroups were formed to explore: (a) basic information, (b) diagnostics and epidemiology, and (c) therapeutical interventions. The progress of the subgroups was discussed at each meeting and the final report is based on group consensus. A grading system was used to denote the strength of the evidence, based on the AHCPR Guidelines (1994) and levels of evidence recommended in the method guidelines of the Cochrane Back Review group. It is concluded that PGP is a specific form of low back pain (LBP) that can occur separately or in conjunction with LBP. PGP generally arises in relation to pregnancy, trauma, arthritis and/or osteoarthritis. Uniform definitions are proposed for PGP as well as for joint stability. The point prevalence of pregnant women suffering from PGP is about 20%. Risk factors for developing PGP during pregnancy are most probably a history of previous LBP, and previous trauma to the pelvis. There is agreement that non risk factors are: contraceptive pills, time interval since last pregnancy, height, weight, smoking, and most probably age. PGP can be diagnosed by pain provocation tests (P4/thigh thrust, Patrick's Faber, Gaenslen's test, and modified Trendelenburg's test) and pain palpation tests (long dorsal ligament test and palpation of the symphysis). As a functional test, the active straight leg raise (ASLR) test is recommended. Mobility (palpation) tests, X-rays, CT, scintigraphy, diagnostic injections and diagnostic external pelvic fixation are not recommended. MRI may be used to exclude ankylosing spondylitis and in the case of positive red flags. The recommended treatment includes adequate information and reassurance of the patient, individualized exercises for pregnant women and an individualized multifactorial treatment program for other patients. We recommend medication (excluding pregnant women), if necessary, for pain relief. Recommendations are made for future research on PGP.

4. Special tests

1) Patellar tilt test [patient supine and knee extended – apply downward pressure to the medial edge of the patella to assess lateral patellar restraints. Test is positive if the patellar tilt angle is more than 5 degrees.]

2) Medial and lateral patellar glide [push patella medially and laterally noting degree of movement relative to width of patella, > 75% translation is hypermobile]

3) Quadriceps setting/grind test, patellar inhibition [suprapatellar resistance while patient performs isometric quadriceps contraction with knee in full extension. Pain indicates a positive test.]

4) Patellar compression test [direct compression of the patella into the trochlea, pain indicative of articular cartilage degeneration or acute chondral injury]

5) Patellar apprehension test [apply lateral pressure to patella at 30° knee flexion, positive if patient feels instability or pain]

6) Lachman test [positive for anterior cruciate insufficiency if there is anterior translation of tibia on femur with knee in 30° flexion]

7) Posterior drawer test [positive for posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency if there is posterior translation of tibia on femur with knee in 90° flexion]

8) McMurray's test [positive for meniscal tear if palpable or audible click. Patient supine, flex hip to 90°, maximally flex knee followed by passive knee extension, first with external tibial rotation while applying a varus stress at the knee (lateral meniscus) and then with internal tibial rotation while applying a valgus stress (medial meniscus) at the knee]

9) Trendelenberg test [positive when patient stands on one leg and contralateral hip drops, indicative of gluteal/hip abductor weakness]

5. Flexibility

The knee should be moved thru active range of flexion and extension and then placed thru full passive range of motion. Active range of knee motion includes flexion (135°), extension (0°), internal and external rotation (10°). Muscles that span two joints are important for functional range of motion and should be tested independently (hamstrings, rectus femoris, gracilis, tensor fascia lata and iliotibial band, and gastrocnemius muscles).

6. Strength

Knee extension and flexion

Hip extension, flexion, abduction, adduction.

7. Hip joint and lumbar spine exam

Range of motion. Further detailed exam as appropriate.

8. Neurovascular exam

### Hip-spine syndrome [^111c5gQ5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

The incidence of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip and degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is increasing in our aging population. Because the subjective complaints can be similar, it is often difficult to differentiate intra- and extra-articular hip pathology from degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. These conditions can present concurrently, which makes it challenging to determine the predominant underlying pain generator. A thorough history and physical examination, coupled with selective diagnostic testing, can be performed to differentiate between these clinical entities and help prioritize management. Determining the potential benefit from surgical intervention and the order in which to address these conditions are of utmost importance for patient satisfaction and adequate relief of symptoms.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1116mF1G]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1.3 Labral tears

Two hip joint pathologies that mimic lumbosacral radiculopathy are labral tear and femoroacetabular impingement (see next section). Like AVN, these conditions are more common in younger adults.

The labrum of the hip joint is the fibrocartilaginous tissue that surrounds the acetabulum which plays a role in shock absorption, joint stability, and pressure distribution. Labral tears are associated with athletic activities and affect up to 55% of athletes who present with hip pain along with mechanical symptoms such as clicking, locking, and instability. Labral tears are more common in women, particularly between 15 and 41 years of age. Labral tears typically present with anterior groin pain, with nearly all patients who have arthroscopically diagnosed labral tears noting this symptom. However, pain attributable to labral tears can be felt in the lateral hip, or radiate to the buttocks or the knees, mimicking lumbosacral radiculopathy. Acetabular labral tears can be caused by trauma, joint hypermobility, age‐related degeneration, hip dysplasia such as shallow acetabulum and femoral/acetabular anteversion, and femoroacetabular impingement.

There are no specific physical exam maneuvers that distinguish an acetabular labral tear from other forms of intraarticular hip pathology such as osteoarthritis or AVN, but the Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation (the FABER test or maneuver) is commonly used to diagnose intraarticular hip pathology. The FABER test is positive when there is anterior hip/groin pain when the hip is placed in the Flexed, Abducted and Externally Rotated hip position. In one small case series, the sensitivity of the FABER test was 0.88 for intraarticular hip pathology identified on hip arthroscopy. Another labral test is the hip scour test; it has a sensitivity 0.62 and a specificity 0.75 for detecting hip intraarticular pathology. The scour test is positive if it elicits groin pain and is performed with the hip in flexion, while an axial loading force is applied as the hip moves into abduction with hip external rotation and then adduction with hip internal rotation. Because the scour test also loads the lumbosacral spine, it may elicit low back pain; therefore, it is important to note the location of the patient's pain when performing this test.

### Stabilization of the sacroiliac joint [^114sEH2M]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Lower back pain and pain involving the area of the posterior iliac spine are extremely common. Degeneration of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is one potential cause for lower back pain and pain radiating into the groin or buttocks. Degenerative changes to the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints are common. A recent study evaluating SIJ abnormalities in a primary low back pain population demonstrated 31.7% of patients demonstrated SI joint abnormalities. (4) As is the case for the evaluation and management of isolated lower back pain, the evaluation, management, and role for surgical intervention in SIJ pain is very controversial. Many patients have degenerative changes of the disc, facet joints, and SIJs. A recent systematic review performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests available to clinicians to identify the disc, facet joint, or SIJ as the source of low back pain concluded that tests do exist that change the probability of the disc or SIJ (but not the facet joint) as the source of low back pain. (3) It was also concluded that the usefulness of these tests in clinical practice, particularly for guiding treatment selection, remains unclear. (3) Although there is general agreement that SIJ pathological changes are a potential cause of pain, there is far less agreement about the optimal management of these conditions. A variety of conditions can cause SIJ dysfunction including degenerative and inflammatory arthritis, trauma, prior lumbosacral fusion, hip arthritis, limb length inequality, infections, and neoplasia. (8) There is increasing evidence that image intensifier-guided single periarticular injection can correctly localize pain to the SIJ but the optimal management strategy remains controversial. Recent publications have compared surgical versus injection treatments and fusion versus denervation procedures. (1, 8) A systematic review found improvement regardless of the treatment, with most studies reporting over 40% improvement in pain as measured by VAS or NRS scores. (8) It cautioned that one of the studies reported 17.6% of patients experiencing mild/no pain compared with 82.4% experiencing marked/severe pain at 39 months after SIJ fusion procedures. (6, 8) This systematic review also noted that despite improvements in reported pain, less than half of patients who had work status reported as returning to work. (8) Because of the functional and socioeconomic consequences of chronic lower back pain, numerous surgical treatments to improve this condition have been attempted by spinal surgeons through the years. Arthrodesis of the SIJ is a surgical procedure with a long history dating to the beginnings of spinal surgery. (7) Poor results, high complication rates and the need for additional surgical procedures have generally diminished the enthusiasm for this procedure until recently. (6) A variety of "minimally invasive" procedures have been recently introduced that have rekindled enthusiasm for the surgical management of SIJ pathology. The technique demonstrated in the "Stabilization of the SIJ with SI-Bone" is one of these new techniques. There has been a recent publication detailing the very short term clinical outcomes with this technique that reported encouraging results. (5) In this series of 50 patients, quality of life questionnaires were available for 49 patients preoperatively, 41 patients at 3 months, 40 at 6 months and only 27 at 12 months, complicating the ability to accurately assess true outcomes. Although the focus of this video by Geisler is on the surgical technique, there should have been more information provided on the expected surgical outcomes and potential complications of SIJ fusion. (2) The video only gives minimal information on how to appropriately select patients with potential SIJ pathology for surgical intervention. There are insufficient recommendations on the clinical and radiographic follow-up needed for this procedure. A concern with this implant is whether the porous plasma spray coating on the implant actually results in bone growth across the SIJ or only serves as a stabilizer. If true fusion does not result, deterioration in the clinical result could occur over time. This video nicely demonstrates the surgical technique of stabilization of the SIJ with SI-Bone product. There are numerous unanswered questions regarding patient selection for SIJ fusion or stabilization. There are an increasing number of surgical techniques for treating SIJ pathology and it is not clear which method may provide the best outcomes. Without prospective trials with nonconflicted surgeons and standardized selection criteria, the true role for SIJ fusion procedures in the management of chronic lower back pain will remain murky. The consequences of the unsupported enthusiasm for the surgical management of discogenic back pain still negatively impacts the public perception of spinal surgeons. Much more high quality information is needed regarding the surgical management of SIJ pathology before widespread use of this technique should be adopted.

### Comparison of hip and lumbopelvic performance between chronic low back pain patients suited for the functional optimization approach and healthy controls [^1128uq49]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study.

Objective

We explored the differences between chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients suited for the functional optimization approach and healthy controls in isometric hip-strength and lumbar-endurance tests and determined classificatory cutoff values for strength and endurance tests and ratios.

Summary Of Background Data

To optimize the treatment effect for CLBP, some approaches have classified patients into homogeneous subgroups matched to specific treatments. We evaluated CLBP patients suited for the functional optimization approach, who seek care because they experience symptoms during activities with high physical demands, although they are relatively asymptomatic.

Methods

Three hundred fifty subjects (healthy controls, 170; CLBP patients, 180) were stratified by age (18–40 and 41–65 yrs), sex, and physical activity level. The CLBP patients had an Oswestry Disability Index score < 20% and a Numeric Pain Rating Scale score < 3. The subjects underwent hip abductor, extensor, and flexor isometric strength tests; a deep abdominal function test; and lateral/frontal bridge and lumbar flexor/extensor endurance tests.

Results

Relative to the healthy controls, the CLBP patients showed significantly (P > 0.05) higher strength scores in the hip flexor and deep abdominal function tests but lower endurance in the lateral and frontal bridge and lumbar flexor and extensor tests. The cutoff values of the lumbar flexor test and the lumbar flexor/extensor, lateral bridge/lumbar flexor, frontal bridge/lumbar flexor, and hip extensor/flexor test ratios showed acceptable accuracy (AUC = 0.84, 0.82, 0.79, 0.75, and 0.73, respectively).

Conclusion

In lumbopelvic and hip-performance tests, CLBP patients suited for the functional optimization approach showed differences from healthy controls. These patients could be discriminated from healthy controls on the basis of accurate cutoff values for strength and endurance tests and ratios, which should be considered in treatment decision-making when patients need to return to activities with higher physical demands.

### Infographic. consensus recommendations on the classification, definition and diagnostic criteria of hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults from the international hip-related pain research network, zurich 2018 [^115nvzRY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic clinical utility for the various clinical and radiological measures was stratified according to magnitude of the pretest to post-test probability shift, precision (repeatability of the results), and study quality. Each of these values were represented on a 2×2 quadrant (magnitude×precision) as not recommended (red quadrant), cautiously recommended (yellow quadrants) or recommended (green quadrant) if the study quality was high.

We determined that the diagnostic utility of clinical examination and diagnostic imaging in isolation are limited and recommend a comprehensive diagnostic approach of patient symptoms, clinical signs and diagnostic imaging. We recognise that the diagnostic capability of matching symptoms, clinical signs and diagnostic imaging is unknown for patients with hip-related pain and recommend that future studies be considered in determining such diagnostic utilities.

### Hip pain in adults: MR imaging appearance of common causes [^113HSVg7]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

To determine the exact origin of hip pain can be challenging. Symptoms apparently originating from the hip may arise from the pelvis, the sacroiliac joint, the lumbar spine, periarticular structures such as muscles and bursae, or from unexpected sites such as the abdominal wall, the genitourinary tract, or the retroperitoneal space. This article reviews the differential diagnosis of hip pain arising from the hip and surrounding structures and the role of different imaging methods with emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging where most recent advances have occurred.

### Doha agreement meeting on terminology and definitions in groin pain in athletes [^117S9LJZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Defined clinical entities for groin pain. Adductor-related groin pain: Adductor tenderness AND pain on resisted adduction testing. Iliopsoas-related groin pain: Iliopsoas tenderness+more likely if pain on resisted hip flexion AND/OR pain on hip flexor stretching. Inguinal-related groin pain: Pain in inguinal canal region AND tenderness of the inguinal canal. No palpable inguinal hernia is present. More likely if aggravated with abdominal resistance OR Valsalva/cough/sneeze. Pubic-related groin pain: Local tenderness of the pubic symphysis and the immediately adjacent bone. No particular resistance tests to test specifically for pubic-related groin pain.

There was agreement that pain from the hip joint should always be considered as a possible cause of groin pain.

History should focus on the onset, nature and location of the pain and mechanical symptoms such as catching, locking, clicking or giving way. It was acknowledged that hip-related groin pain can be hard to distinguish from other causes and that it may coexist with other types of groin pain. The group recommended that physical examination including a passive range of motion and hip special tests (Flexion-abduction-external rotation (FABER) and Flexion-adduction-internal rotation (FADIR) test) should be performed in all cases when athletes present with groin pain.

The expert group found it hard to recommend single discriminatory clinical tests to identify the hip as a cause of groin pain in athletes. Previous studies demonstrated that while hip surgeons often do perform certain special tests, there are a large number used in clinical practice. Most clinical tests for the hip joint have good sensitivity but poor specificity. This means that clinical tests can be useful in practice for excluding hip-related groin.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116s653f]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In the context of pain and tenderness over the lateral femoral epicondyle, a positive Ober's test is supportive of ITBS. The maneuver has a high inter-rater reliability of 97% and intra-rater reliability of 90%. To perform the test, as demonstrated in Figure 2, the patient is positioned in side-lying with the affected leg on top, and the pelvis is stabilized perpendicular to the exam table by the examiner's hand. Next, the hip and knee of the affected leg are passively flexed to 90°, and then the examiner passively stretches the hip through abduction and extension in order to position the ITB behind the GT. Finally, the knee of the affected leg is allowed to slowly drop under the weight of gravity until it reaches its final resting angle. If the final angle is greater than 0°, meaning the hip is still abducted, Ober's test is positive and indicates the patient has a tight ITB. Oftentimes in patients with ITBS, the examiner will also be able to palpate a taut ITB while the patient is standing or supine. Because the diagnosis of this syndrome is clinical, imaging is not necessary unless coexisting lumbar radicular and/or intra-articular hip pathology is suspected.

Similar to the treatment for GTPS, hip abductor strengthening is essential for long-term resolution of ITBS. ITB stretching, in addition to correction of other contributing factors such as core weakness, suboptimal biomechanics, and improper footwear can be helpful, as well. Relative rest, ice, and acetaminophen are appropriate for acute management, but similar to the limitation of corticosteroid injections for GTPS, these treatments are unlikely to provide lasting relief unless the underlying biomechanical imbalance is also addressed.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: defining the clinical syndrome [^116xceRo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Effective treatment of hip pain improves population health and quality of life. Accurate differential diagnosis is fundamental to effective treatment. The diagnostic criteria for one common hip problem, greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) have not been well defined.

Purpose

To define the clinical presentation of GTPS.

Methods

Forty-one people with GTPS, 20 with hip osteoarthritis (OA), and 23 age-matched and sex-matched asymptomatic participants (ASC) were recruited. Inclusion and exclusion criteria ensured mutually exclusive groups.

Assessment

the Harris hip score (HHS), a battery of clinical tests, and single leg stance (SLS). Participants identified the site of reproduced pain.

Analysis

Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) informed recursive partitioning to develop two classification trees.

Results

Maximum walking distance and the ability to manipulate shoes and socks were the only HHS domains to differentiate GTPS from OA (ANOVA: p = 0.010 and < 0.001); OR (95% CI) of 3.47 (1.09 to 10.93) and 0.06 (0.00 to 0.26), respectively. The lateral hip pain (LHP) classification tree: (dichotomous LHP associated with a flexion abduction external rotation (FABER) test) had a mean (SE) sensitivity and specificity of 0.81 (0.019) and 0.82 (0.044), respectively. A non-specific hip pain classification tree had a mean (SE) sensitivity and specificity of 0.78 (0.058) and 0.28 (0.080).

Conclusions

Patients with LHP in the absence of difficulty with manipulating shoes and socks, together with pain on palpation of the greater trochanter and LHP with a FABER test are likely to have GTPS.

### Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for cam or pincer morphology in individuals with suspected FAI syndrome: a systematic review [^1137ezSR]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methods

The review protocol was registered in the international Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

The Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews was used for the conduct of this study and the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) checklist was used for reporting.

The search was conducted from inception to February 2019 in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus (see online supplementary file 6 for the PubMed search strategy). Reference lists of included studies were checked for additional articles, and searches for papers cited in the included articles were performed using Google Scholar.

Selection criteria

Study design

Studies were included if: (1) they investigated the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for cam, pincer or mixed morphology of the hip; (2) they included patients with symptoms such as groin, hip or buttock pain; (3) all patients underwent both an index test and a reference test that was able to identify cam or pincer morphology; and (4) the results allowed for the calculation of true or false positives and/or negatives. Studies including asymptomatic individuals and those classifying participants with labral tears only as true positives were excluded. No restrictions were set regarding the language of publication, study settings or the ages or previous surgical histories of included patients.

Index tests

Included studies had to describe a clinical test that was intended to identify cam, pincer or mixed morphology of the hip joint. All available clinical tests for FAI were accepted as index tests (ie, flexion-abduction-external rotation (FABER), flexion-adduction-internal rotation (FADIR), maximal squat test, and others).

Target condition

Patients had to show imaging findings of cam or pincer morphology, and could also exhibit labral or articular cartilage damage. Patients presenting with acetabular labral tears without any cam or pincer morphology were not classified as true positives.

Reference tests

MRA, MRI, CT and radiography were considered to be adequate reference tests. See online supplementary table 3S for a short description of the diagnostic accuracies of all reference tests used in the included studies and online supplementary table 4S for the reliability of plain radiography for measuring alpha angles.

Screening process

Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers (RC and RH), and consensus was sought. The same procedure was applied for full texts of included references; in case of disagreement, a third reviewer decided.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^112yXuro]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Radiography is used to help diagnose femoroacetabular impingement, although the preferred radiographic views may vary. Standing anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis may be most helpful for diagnosing of the pincer deformity, 26 whereas Meyer lateral and 90-degree Dunn views may be best to visualize the cam deformity.
27. 2, 5, 9 Physical examination for labral tears should include flexion adduction internal rotation and flexion abduction external rotation tests. 7 A standing radiograph should be the initial imaging test. 24 Previously, magnetic resonance arthrography with gadolinium injection of the hip was the diagnostic standard for labral tears. However, with recent advances to 3-tesla MRI and specialized hip protocols, noncontrast 3-tesla MRI is as sensitive and specific as magnetic resonance arthrography and does not require a procedure for contrast injection.

22, 23 Physicians should consult with a local radiologist to determine the most appropriate test in their area. ISCHIOFEMORAL IMPINGEMENT Ischiofemoral impingement is impingement of the quadratus femoris muscle and nerve between the proximal femur at the level of the lesser trochanter and the ischial tuberosity. 19 Patients with ischiofemoral impingement have gradual onset of deep buttock pain that is worsened with activities requiring a long stride, such as running. The long-stride walking test is the most sensitive and specific test for this condition. 18, 19. 17 Sacroiliac joint dysfunction and/or arthritis may also present as posterior hip pain. The most common physical examination finding is tenderness to palpation over the sacroiliac joint. Sacroiliac pain typically does not occur above the L5 level, which would indicate a lumbar spinal etiology of pain. 17 Radiography may show sacroiliac joint arthritis.

Image-guided injections may be a helpful diagnostic and therapeutic tool. If diagnosis is uncertain, MRI can show inflammation or arthritis at the sacroiliac joint.
17. 20 Hamstring tendinopathy or partial tears are typically exacerbated by hamstring strength testing but do not cause obvious bruising or deformity. Patients with acute tears should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. 20 If it is unclear whether the patient has a hamstring injury, MRI may be helpful in determining the diagnosis. 17.

The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — differential diagnosis and examination measures: The following differential diagnoses should be considered in an individual with signs or symptoms suggestive of hip OA: bursitis or tendinitis, chondral damage or loose bodies, femoral neck or pubic ramus stress fracture, labral tear, muscle strain, neoplasm, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, Paget's disease, piriformis syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, septic hip arthritis, and referred pain as a result of an L2–3 radiculopathy. The following physical examination measures may be helpful in the differential diagnostic process when differentiating hip pain from other sources of pain: the Scour test for labral tears, FABER (Patrick's) test for labral tears, Fitzgerald's test for labral tears, flexion-adduction internal rotation tests for labral tears, sacroiliac joint provocation tests for sacroiliac joint pain, and the femoral nerve stretch test for L2–3 radiculopathy. Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications other than osteoarthritis of the hip when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this guideline, or, when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the patient's impairments of body function.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^114QKUEr]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Criteria

Increasing the difficulty of diagnosis is the poor sensitivity with imaging. X-rays, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance may offer some indication for abnormalities, but may not be specific alone. The joint is difficult to profile well on radiographic views, and therefore the radiographic findings of sacroiliitis are often equivocal. MRI is the most sensitive imaging technique to detect sacroiliitis. It is the only imaging modality that can reliably reveal bone marrow edema and inflammation around the sacroiliac joints and is comparable to low dose CT for demonstrating erosions and ankyloses.

Three hundred and seventy-eight patients were retrospectively identified who underwent definitive diagnostic injections with different sources of low back pain. The mean age and the number of patients reporting hip girdle pain, leg pain, and thigh pain were determined in each diagnostic group. This explored the relationship between predictors and the source of LBP. Age correlates with the source of low back pain, as disc disease is more likely in the younger population and older patients are likely to have diagnosis of sacroiliac or facetogenic pain. Interestingly, the absence of thigh pain in older patients increases the likelihood of sacroiliac joint dysfunction as a source of low back pain.

Physical Exam Findings

Telli et al looked at the validity and reliability of provocation tests in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction in 156 patients, investigating the distraction test, compression test, Gaenslen test, thigh thrust test, sacral thrust test, and Faber test. Diagnosis was made with three or more positive provocation tests, with the highest sensitivity being Faber (91.4%) and lowest probability was Gaenslen test.

Description of Provocation Maneuvers

Provocative Testing

The five following provocative tests have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity when used in combination. Three or more tests must be positive with at least one resulting from the Thigh Trust or Compression Test. This diagnostic threshold yields a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 76%. Testing sequence ought to be performed in a manner to minimize position changes for patient comfort and may include tests to diagnose comorbid hip pathology.

The Distraction Test

The patient lies supine with the examiner standing next to the patient at or just inferior to the level of the pelvis. Examiner will place each palm on the patient's ASIS while keeping elbows extended and apply an adequate posterolateral force directed at distracting the SI joints. The test is positive when the patient's pain is reproduced.

Observation. A limited functional evaluation includes determining whether the affected leg can bear weight. If it can, important points to observe include the patient's posture, gait and ability to transfer independently from standing to sitting to lying down, and then back to standing. If the patient is able to stand erect, the examiner can estimate the height symmetry of the iliac crests by resting his or her hands on the iliac wings. If the crests are asymmetric or the patient is unable to stand, the next step is to compare leg lengths: the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine and the medial malleolus of each leg. Muscular Strength Testing. Muscle strength should be tested for the affected hip and the unaffected one to enable the physician to compare strength and detect subtle deficits. Hip flexion strength is best tested with the patient in a sitting position, lifting against the examiner's hand.

External and internal rotation also can be evaluated in this position, with the examiner providing resistance against the patient's lower leg. Abduction and adduction are best tested with the patient supine and the examiner providing resistance against the medial and lateral side of the knee. Extension strength is best tested with the patient prone and the examiner applying resistance against the lower leg. While the piriformis is an external rotator of the hip, it is best tested with the patient supine. Patients with the piriformis syndrome will have pain with passive internal rotation and palpation of the sciatic notch, as well as with active external rotation. Another common problem that merits specific testing is the iliotibial band syndrome. Symptomatic patients complain of pain over the lateral aspect of the hip and may feel snapping at the iliotibial band over the greater trochanter with flexion and extension.

Ober's test is done to check specifically for iliotibial band syndrome. 14 The typical history in these cases is progressively increasing pain with exercise that eventually becomes pain at rest. Femoral neck stress fractures can progress to unstable fractures and are at increased risk for avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Bone scans are a useful "negative" test because they are up to 100 percent sensitive 15 for stress fractures of the femoral neck. Positive scans are nonspecific and may require MRI or other imaging to be certain of a diagnosis.

### Consensus recommendations on the classification, definition and diagnostic criteria of hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults from the international hip-related pain research network, zurich 2018 [^117DsEp9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There is no agreement on how to classify, define or diagnose hip-related pain-a common cause of hip and groin pain in young and middle-aged active adults. This complicates the work of clinicians and researchers. The International Hip-related Pain Research Network consensus group met in November 2018 in Zurich aiming to make recommendations on how to classify, define and diagnose hip disease in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain as the main symptom. Prior to the meeting we performed a scoping review of electronic databases in June 2018 to determine the definition, epidemiology and diagnosis of hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain. We developed and presented evidence-based statements for these to a panel of 37 experts for discussion and consensus agreement. Both non-musculoskeletal and serious hip pathological conditions (eg, tumours, infections, stress fractures, slipped capital femoral epiphysis), as well as competing musculoskeletal conditions (eg, lumbar spine) should be excluded when diagnosing hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults. The most common hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without a distinct osseous morphology (labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions), and that these terms are used in research and clinical practice. Clinical examination and diagnostic imaging have limited diagnostic utility; a comprehensive approach is therefore essential. A negative flexion-adduction-internal rotation test helps rule out hip-related pain although its clinical utility is limited. Anteroposterior pelvis and lateral femoral head-neck radiographs are the initial diagnostic imaging of choice-advanced imaging should be performed only when requiring additional detail of bony or soft-tissue morphology (eg, for definitive diagnosis, research setting or when planning surgery). We recommend clear, detailed and consistent methodology of bony morphology outcome measures (definition, measurement and statistical reporting) in research. Future research on conditions with hip-related pain as the main symptom should include high-quality prospective studies on aetiology and prognosis. The most common hip conditions in active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) FAI syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without distinct osseous morphology including labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions. The last category should not be confused with the incidental imaging findings of labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres pathology in asymptomatic people. Future research should refine our current recommendations by determining the clinical utility of clinical examination and diagnostic imaging in prospective studies.

➢ Low back pain has a lifetime incidence of up to 84% and represents the leading cause of disability in the United States; 10% to 38% of cases can be attributed to sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction as an important pain generator.➢ Physical examination of the SIJ, including > 1 provocation test (due to their moderate sensitivity and specificity) and examination of adjacent joints (hip and lumbar spine) should be routinely performed in all patients presenting with low back, gluteal, and posterior hip pain.➢ Radiographic investigations including radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging with protocols optimized for the visualization of the SIJs may facilitate the diagnosis of common pathologies.➢ Intra-articular injections with anesthetic can be helpful in localizing the source of low back pain. Over-the-counter analgesics, physiotherapy, intra-articular injections, radiofrequency ablation, and surgery are all management options and should be approached from the least invasive to the most invasive to minimize the risks of complications.➢ Lumbar fusion surgery predisposes patients to more rapid SIJ degeneration and can also result in more rapid degenerative changes in the hip joints, especially with SIJ fusion.➢ Hip surgery, including hip arthroplasty and preservation surgery, is not a risk factor for SIJ degeneration, although reduced outcomes following hip surgery can be seen in patients with degenerative SIJ changes.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^1175XeCv]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — scope and intra-articular conditions — Pain in the hip region can originate from nonmusculoskeletal, lumbosacral spine, intra-articular, and extra-articular sources, and a consensus statement has outlined an evaluation algorithm to differentiate the musculoskeletal sources of regional hip pain; lumbosacral and extra-articular pathologies often coexist with intra-articular hip sources of hip pain. Nonarthritic hip joint pain specifically refers to an intra-articular source of hip pain resulting from 1 or more of the following conditions: FAIS, DDH, acetabular dysplasia, hip instability, acetabular labral tears, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, and ligamentum teres tears, and adequate strength and neuromuscular control of the lumbopelvic musculature are necessary to provide stability to the hip joint and control the pelvis during weight-bearing tasks.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115rVAJa]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many physicians assume that an older adult with low back pain (LBP) and concomitant lateral hip/thigh pain has lumbar spinal stenosis. However, in reality there are myriad causes of lateral hip/thigh pain in older adults and the diagnosis of this pain can be challenging due to pain referral patterns. First, the hip and nearby lumbopelvic structures share innervation from common nerve roots, so pain referral patterns from pathology of these structures overlap. Second, faulty mechanics of the lumbar spine and/or hip can lead to compensatory movement patterns and eventually result in multiple pain generators. These challenges are illustrated in a study by Sembrano and colleagues. In a sample of 200 patients presenting for evaluation by a spine surgeon, only 65% had isolated spine pain, whereas 17.5% had a combination of hip, spine, and/or sacroiliac (SI) joint pain. Lastly, diagnosing the etiology of hip and lumbopelvic pain in older adults is challenging in that many people have structural abnormalities on imaging studies that are asymptomatic. For instance, 93% of asymptomatic people 60–80 years old have MRI evidence of disc degeneration, 36% have a herniated disc, and 21% have spinal stenosis. Additionally, only 46.5% of women ages 65 years and older who have radiographic evidence of hip osteoarthritis (OA) report hip pain "on most days for at least 1 month".

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111fzxKn]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

GTPS can be difficult to distinguish from radiculopathies for several reasons. First, the distribution of pain may approximate L3, L4, or L5 radiculopathies due to the common complaint of pain radiating along the lateral thigh in a distal fashion. Second, patients with GTPS often have history and physical examination findings also found in radiculopathy, such as pain in the thigh (58%), pain below the knee (67%), and ipsilateral lower extremity weakness (62%). Finally, patients with radiculopathy are at an increased risk of GTPS due to biomechanical alterations, such as Trendelenberg gait, and patients with painful lower extremity conditions are at increased risk of lumbosacral radiculopathy due to imbalances in the spine. Biomechanical alterations associated with gluteus medius weakness can lead to GTPS, so clinicians should strongly consider the possibility that GTPS may occur concurrently with L5/S1 radiculopathy.

GTPS is characterized by pain at the lateral hip which may radiate down the lateral thigh, point tenderness at the greater trochanter (Figure 2) with palpation or lying on the affected side, pain with resisted hip abduction in side‐lying, and lateral hip pain at end‐range motion for hip Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation (i.e. the FABER test, sometimes termed Patrick's test). Ober's test, in which patients lie in lateral decubitus with the affected side up while the examiner passively abducts and extends the hip, and lowers the leg slowly to its passive resting position, is frequently used in the evaluation of patients with suspected GTPS. However, studies cast doubt on the utility of Ober's test and the modified Ober's test for this diagnosis. Pain may also occur with activity, prolonged standing, and transitions from sitting to standing. The onset of pain may be insidious, secondary to biomechanical alterations such as Trendelenberg gait or post‐hip arthroplasty, or may be traumatic, such as after a fall.

### The validity and reliability of provocation tests in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^1171nRQF]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SIJD) is generally regarded as a source of lumbar pain, its anatomical position and the absence of a diagnostic 'gold standard' lead to difficulties at examination and differential diagnosis. However, since sacroiliac (SI) joint blocks only provide information about pathologies of joint origin and since SIJD developing secondary to pathologies in structures around the joint can be missed. Provocation and palpation tests also need to be used in diagnosis.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability of clinical examination and provocation tests used in the diagnosis of SIJD.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.

Setting

Outpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic.

Methods

One hundred and seventeen patients presenting with lumbar and/or leg pain and diagnosed with SIJD through clinical evaluation were included in the study. Range of lumbar joint movement, pain location and specific tests used in the diagnosis of SIJD were evaluated. Positivity in 3 out of 6 provocation tests was adopted as the criterion.

Results

75.2% of patients were female and 24.8% were male. Mean age was 46.41 ± 10.45 years. A higher level of females was determined in ender distribution. SIJD was determined on the right in 52.6% of patients and on the left in 47.4%. When SI joint provocation tests were analyzed individually, the highest positivity, in 91.4% patients diagnosed with SIJD, was in the FABER test. The lowest positivity, in 56.4% of patients, was determined in the Ganslen test. The same patients were assessed by the same clinician at 2 different times. In these data, the simple consistence, kappa and PABAK coefficient values of all tests were close to 1 and indicating good agreement. The thigh thrust (POSH) and sacral thrust tests exhibited very good agreement with a kappa coefficient of 0.90 and a PABAK coefficient of 0.92, while the FABER test exhibited good agreement with a kappa coefficient of 0.78 and a PABAK coefficient of 0.92.

Limitation

Agreement between different observers was not evaluated, and also no comparison was performed with SI joint injection, regarded as a widely used diagnostic technique.

Conclusion

The anatomical position of the SI joint and the lack of a diagnostic 'gold standard' make the examination and diagnosis of SIJD difficult. Most SI joint clinical tests have limited reliability and validity on their own, while a multitest regimen consisting of SI joint pain provocation tests is a reliable method, and these tests can be used instead of unnecessary invasive diagnostic SI joint procedures.

Key Words

Dysfunction, lumbar, sacroiliac joint, provocation test, sacroiliac joint pain, pain pattern.

### The diagnostic and predictive value of hip anesthetic arthrograms in selected patients before total hip arthroplasty [^114QuXzC]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2006). Low credibility.

Concurrent osteoarthritis of the hip and lumbar spine occurs frequently. Our study tests the hypothesis that hip anesthetic arthrograms can be used as predictive diagnostic tool before total hip arthroplasty when standard evaluation techniques fail to provide convincing evidence of the source of pain. Thirty-four consecutive hip anesthetic arthrograms were reviewed retrospectively. Quantified outcome measures included Visual Analog Pain Score, Harris Hip Score, and patient satisfaction. The pain relief after hip anesthetic arthrogram accurately predicted pain relief after hip arthroplasty (positive predictive value = 95.23%, negative predictive value = 87.5%). Our study supports the selected use of hip anesthetic arthrograms in the preoperative assessment of patients with concurrent hip and lumbar spine osteoarthritis associated with nondiagnostic history and physical examinations.

### Infographic. consensus recommendations on the classification, definition and diagnostic criteria of hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults from the international hip-related pain research network, zurich 2018 [^116BvBW2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Young and middle-aged active adults with hip and groin pain often present with a confusing overlap of signs and symptoms. There is no consensus on how to define or classify hip disease with different and overlapping intra-articular and extra-articular contributors to symptoms in an anatomically complex region. Several researchers and consensus groups have previously attempted to define aspects of hip and groin pain. In 2017, the International Hip Pain Research Network (IHiPRN) was established to facilitate collaboration across research groups and disciplines and to improve knowledge dissemination of hip-related pain to clinicians. In this paper, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, we first describe the general consensus process applied to all topics in this series. We then make recommendations on the first topic on how to classify, define and diagnose hip disease in young and middle-aged active adults, with hip-related pain as the main symptom. Other papers in this series used this classification of hip-related pain in the assessment of (1) patient-reported outcome measures,(2) standardised measurement of physical capacityand (3) physiotherapist-led treatment.

For this paper, the working group used a scoping review framework to search the literature for systematic reviews, intervention and observational studies (prospective or retrospective) with a study population of at least 10 young and middle-aged active adults and published in English language, peer-reviewed journals. Evidence summaries and consensus recommendations were then presented to and discussed by the whole group of IHiPRN participants. We reached consensus on three clinical recommendations, one clinical and research recommendation, and two research recommendations (infographic), all of which were an amalgamation of best available evidence and expert opinion. Following discussion, each participant was asked to perform a blinded vote on the recommendation (infographic). Both non-musculoskeletal and serious hip pathology conditions (eg, tumours, infections, slipped capital femoral epiphysis), as well as competing musculoskeletal conditions (eg, lumbar spine) should first be excluded before categorising hip disease in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain. Once these are excluded, hip-related pain should be categorised into (1) femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without bony morphology causing hip-related pain, such as chondral, labral and ligamentum teres conditions.

### Hip and lumbar spine physical examination findings in people presenting with low back pain, with or without lower extremity pain [^115Ze28F]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design Prospective cohort study, cross-sectional design. Background The hip-spine syndrome is described in patients with known arthritis of the hip. This study describes the hip examination findings of people presenting with low back pain (LBP). Objectives To (1) report examination findings of the hip in patients with LBP and (2) compare pain and function in patients with positive hip examination findings to those in patients without positive hip examination findings. Methods An examination and validated questionnaires of spine and hip pain and function were completed. Pain and function scores were compared between patients with and without positive hip findings. Results Consecutive patients (68 women, 33 men) with a mean age of 47.6 years (range, 18.4–79.8 years) participated. On physical examination, 81 (80%) had reduced hip flexion; 76 (75%) had reduced hip internal rotation; and 25 (25%) had 1, 32 (32%) had 2, and 23 (23%) had 3 positive provocative hip tests. Patients with reduced hip flexion had worse LBP-related (mean modified Oswestry Disability Index, 35.3 versus 25.6; p = 0.04) and hip-related function (mean modified Harris Hip Score, 66.0 versus 82.0; p = 0.03). Patients with reduced hip internal rotation had worse LBP-related function (mean Roland-Morris questionnaire, 12.4 versus 8.2; p = 0.003). A positive provocative hip test was coupled with more intense pain (median, 9 versus 7; p = 0.05) and worse LBP-related (mean Roland-Morris questionnaire, 12.1 versus 8.5; p = 0.02) and hip-related function (mean modified Harris Hip Score, 65.8 versus 89.7; p = 0.005). Conclusion Physical examination findings indicating hip dysfunction are common in patients presenting with LBP. Patients with LBP and positive hip examination findings have more pain and worse function compared to patients with LBP but without positive hip examination findings.

### Editorial commentary: hip-spine syndrome: when the hip does not move, the spine labors double [^114wXDvW]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

When the hip does not move, the spine labors double. For example, limited hip extension results in lumbar spine hyperextension and an increase in spinal facet joint loading due to premature coupling. Patients who undergo hip surgery show significant improvement in concomitant lower back problems, and symptomatic low back pain resolves in approximately 80% of patients after total hip arthroplasty. When an impairment in hip range of motion (limitation or asymmetry) is identified, a logical relationship to lumbar pathology should be explored, and treatment options may include interventions that improve hip joint range of motion.

### The interrater reliability of 4 clinical tests used to assess individuals with musculoskeletal hip pain [^115wP4fM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Descriptive and reliability study.

Objectives

To evaluate the interrater reliability of the FABER test, flexion-internal rotation-adduction impingement test, log roll test, and the palpation of the greater trochanter for tenderness.

Background

Clinical examination for individuals with musculoskeletal hip pain is believed to provide critical diagnostic information. However, there is very limited information in the literature on the reproducibility of examination techniques for the hip region.

Methods and Measures

Seventy subjects were evaluated prospectively by an orthopaedic surgeon and physical therapist. Subjects had a mean age of 42 years (range 18–76 years; SD 15.4) and included 32 (46%) females and 38 (54%) males. Subject diagnoses were as follows: degenerative joint disease (n = 27 [39% of subjects]), labral tear (n = 35 [50% of subjects]), femoroacetabular impingement (n = 48 [69% of subjects]), capsular laxity (n = 28 [40% of subjects]), trochanteric bursitis (n = 29 [41% of subjects]), iliopsoas tendonitis (n = 10 [14% of subjects]), and adductor strain (n = 2 [3% of subjects)]. Subjects could have more than 1 diagnosis. Kappa, prevalence indexes, bias indexes, and maximal attainable kappa were calculated.

Results

Kappa (kappa) coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were as follows: FABER test kappa was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.43–0.83); flexion-internal rotation-adduction impingement test kappa was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.29–0.87); log roll test kappa was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41–0.81); and greater trochanteric tenderness kappa was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.48–0.84). Bias indexes were low (0.06–0.08) for all 4 tests while prevalence indexes were low (0.03–0.37) for 3 of the 4 tests. The flexion-internal rotation-adduction impingement test had a high prevalence index (0.76), with a higher proportion of positive tests.

Conclusion

The kappa values for the FABER test, log roll test, and assessment of greater trochanteric tenderness were greater than 0.40 (fair level of agreement) at a 95% confidence level. The low reliability obtained for the flexion-internal rotation-adduction impingement test may be related to a prevalence concern.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^113i9MrE]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Hip flexion, abduction, external rotation (FABER) test — nonarthritic hip joint pain evaluates impairment of body function, specifically pain in joints and mobility of a single joint, and is performed in supine with the hip passively externally rotated and abducted; a positive test is production or increase of anterior groin, posterior buttock, or lateral hip pain consistent with the presenting complaint. Provocation is recorded as nominal and range of motion is continuous, with degrees used for range of motion and none for provocation. Using pain relief with a diagnostic injection as the comparison, reported accuracy metrics were sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.96), specificity 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.48), positive predictive value 0.46 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.65), and negative predictive value 0.64 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.91). Mitchell et al reported sensitivity of 88% compared to intraoperative findings but no correlation to a specific hip joint pathology. No studies were located reporting FABER range-of-motion measurement properties in nonarthritic hip joint pain; in knee osteoarthritis, range-of-motion reliability was ICC = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.94).

### Differential diagnosis of hip disease versus spine disease [^114W9aeM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Many clinicians find it difficult to differentiate between symptoms caused by a spine disorder or a hip disorder. If surgery is indicated, the order in which these operations take place is an important factor in the patient's long-term outcome. A prospective evaluation and retrospective chart review of patients with lower extremity pain was performed at the principal investigator's clinic to determine which signs and symptoms best predict the primary source of pain in patients with hip and spine disorders. Medical histories, physical examinations, and diagnostic tests were done on 97 patients with lower extremity pain to determine which signs and symptoms were the best predictors of a primary source of the pain (a hip or a spine disorder). The presence of a limp, groin pain, or limited internal rotation of the hip significantly predicted the diagnosis of a disorder as originating primarily from the hip, as opposed to originating from the spine. Patients with a limp were seven times more likely to have a hip disorder only or a hip and spine disorder than a spine only disorder. Similarly, patients with groin pain or limited internal rotation of the hips were seven and 14 times, respectively, more likely to have a hip disorder only or a hip and spine disorder than a spine only disorder. These variables are of primary importance to the clinician when making a differential diagnosis between hip disease and spine disease.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^116CBQeA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Peritrochanteric pathology

There are several pathologies that can affect the abductor muscle complex in the peritrochanteric space which can be broadly classified into (1) greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), (2) abductor tendon (gluteus medius/minimus) tears and (3) external snapping hip syndrome (ESHS).

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)

GTPS is thought to be a degenerative condition affecting the abductor tendons and the bursae around them. GTPS has a female preponderance of 4:1 with the majority of the patients between the fourth and sixth decades of life. A varus femoral neck and females with increased gynoid adipose tissue are at a higher risk of developing GTPS. Spontaneous onset of lateral hip pain with point tenderness over the GT is suggestive of GTPS.

Clinical tests which help in the diagnosis of GTPS are inability to complete a single-leg stance for 30 s and inability to perform a resisted external derotation of the hip in the supine position with the hip flexed to 90° (Fig. 3) and in the prone position with hip extended. The resisted external derotation test is performed with the hip flexed to 90° and the hip being placed in full internal rotation and then the patient being asked to bring the leg to a neutral position against resistance. A positive test is indicated by pain or weakness. The sensitivity and specificity for single-leg stance was 100% and 97.3% and that for resisted external derotation of the hip in supine position was 88% and 97.3%, respectively, as correlated in the MRI study by Lequesne et al. This was also supported by the study by Ganderton et al. who reported that a positive hip flexion, abduction and external rotation (FABER) test, tenderness over GT, and a positive resisted hip abduction and external derotation test supported the diagnose of GTPS. Furthermore, a hip lag sign (Fig. 4), when correlated with an MRI, has been shown to be accurate in diagnosing hip abductor damage, with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 89%, 96%, 94% and 93%, respectively.

Hip impingement tests

The six impingement tests were performed according to the methods described by Martin et al. (Fig. 1 a–f). All tests were performed in a supine position. The patients were instructed to report any pain in the hip and/or groin area. The test results were categorized as either (1) negative (no pain) or (2) positive (the patient's typical hip and/or groin pain was reproduced).

Fig. 1
a – f Hip impingement tests: a AIMT: the examiner brings the hip into 90° of flexion and then moves the hip into internal rotation and adduction; b FADIR: the examiner brings the hip into maximal flexion, internal rotation and adduction; c FABER: the examined leg is placed with the foot just proximal to the contralateral knee joint, the hip is moved into a combined flexion, abduction and external rotation position, and the examiner places a hand on the contralateral side of the pelvis to minimize pelvic rotation; d DEXRIT; e DIRIT: the patient is asked to hold the contralateral hip in more than 90° of flexion. The examiner then brings the hip into approximately 90° of flexion and moves the hip through a wide arc of extension, abduction and external rotation (DEXRIT) or extension, adduction and internal rotation (DIRIT); and f PRIMT: with the patient in the supine position lying at the edge of the examining table, both hips are brought into flexion, and the patient is instructed to keep the contralateral hip in flexion while the examined hip is brought into extension, abduction and external rotation

### Differentiating hip pathology from lumbar spine pathology: key points of evaluation and management [^1124MX3s]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies may be a challenge because overlapping symptoms may delay a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Common complaints of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies include low back pain with associated buttock, groin, thigh, and, possibly, knee pain. A thorough patient history should be obtained and a complete physical examination should be performed in these patients to identify the primary source of pain. Plain and advanced imaging studies and diagnostic injections can be used to further delineate the primary pathology and guide the appropriate sequence of treatment. Both the surgeon and the patient should understand that, although one pathology is managed, the management of the other pathology may be necessary because of persistent pain. The recognition of both entities may help reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis, and the management of both entities in the appropriate sequence may help reduce the likelihood of persistent symptoms.

### How often is low back pain not coming from the back? [^113XFRyu]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Consecutive case series cohort.

Objective

To determine the relative frequencies of the spine, the sacroiliac (SI) joint, and the hip joint being the primary pain generator among patients presenting at a spine surgery clinic for low back pain (LBP).

Summary Of Background Data

Identification of the primary pain generator in a patient with LBP is difficult. Possible pain sources include the lumbar spine, the SI joint, and the hip joint. Their relative frequencies among patients presenting at a spine surgeon's clinic have not been well established.

Methods

Three hundred sixty-eight new patients were seen at a single spine surgeon's clinic during a 10-month period. Of these, 289 (78.5%) complained primarily of LBP with or without leg pain. Seventy-seven had previous surgery. The remaining 200 cases were reviewed for all diagnostic tests performed, as well as the final diagnosis.

Results

One hundred sixty-four (82%) had spine pathology, but only 130 (65%) had spine-only pathology, whereas 35 (17.5%) had a combination of spine plus hip and/or SI joint pathology. An additional 16 (8%) had hip and/or SI joint pathology without spine pathology. Twenty (10%) had an undefined pain source. Overall, 25 (12.5%) had hip pathology, and 29 (14.5%) had SI joint pathology.

Conclusion

For patients presenting to a spine surgeon's clinic for LBP, up to 25% of patients may have significant pain contribution from the hip or SI joints, and an additional 10% will still have an undefined pain source even after diagnostic workup. This underscores the need for clinicians to be aware of nonspinal pain generators and to appropriately pursue alternative diagnoses.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113bw672]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults. Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy. In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

### Diagnostic accuracy of patient history in the diagnosis of hip-related pain: a systematic review [^115bcQ6v]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of patient history associated with hip pain.

Data Sources

A systematic, computerized search of electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science), a search of the gray literature, and review of the primary author's personal library was performed. Hip-specific search terms were combined with diagnostic accuracy and subjective or self-report history-based search terms using the Boolean operator "AND".

Study Selection

This systematic review was conducted and reported according to the protocol outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The inclusion criteria were: (1) patients with hip pain; (2) the statistical association of at least 1 patient history item was reported; (3) study designs appropriate for diagnostic accuracy; (4) adults aged ≥ 18 years; (5) written in English; and (6) used an acceptable reference standard for diagnosed hip pathology. Titles and abstracts of all database-captured citations were independently screened by at least 2 reviewers.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted information and data regarding author, year, study population, study design, criterion standard, and strength of association statistics associated with the subjective findings.

Data Synthesis

For hip osteoarthritis (OA), a family history of OA (positive likelihood ratio [+LR], 2.13), history of knee OA (+LR, 2.06), report of groin or anterior thigh pain (+LR, 2.51–3.86), self-reported limitation in range of motion of 1 or both hips (+LR, 2.87), constant low back pain or buttock pain (+LR, 6.50), groin pain on the same side (+LR, 3.63), and a screening questionnaire (+LR, 3.87–13.29) were the most significant findings. For intra-articular hip pathology, crepitus (+LR, 3.56) was the most significant finding.

Conclusions

Patient history plays a key role in differential diagnosis of hip pain and in some cases can be superior to objective tests and measures.

### Role of patrick-FABER test in detecting sacroiliitis and diagnosing spondyloarthritis in subjects with low back pain [^115CBGw9]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of Patrick-FABER test in assessing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sacroiliitis and addressing the diagnosis of spondyloarthritis (SpA) in subjects with low back pain (LBP).

Methods

Subjects with LBP were consecutively enrolled. The assessors were blinded to patients' clinical, laboratory, or imaging data. All subjects underwent sacroiliac joint MRI to detect presence of sacroiliac oedema or structural changes.

Results

One hundred and ten subjects were included in the study [males (61.8%); median age of 45 (21–69) years; LBP duration of 78 (3–240) months]. Patrick-FABER test sign's sensitivity was 76.2% (95% CI: 60.5–87.9%), specificity was 66.2% (95% CI: 53.6–77.2%), positive predictive value (PPV) was 58.1% (95% CI: 44.1–71.3%) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 81.8% (95% CI: 69.1–90.9%) for the diagnosis of sacroiliitis, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 70%. At the univariate and multivariate analysis, Patrick-FABER test sign was associated with inflammatory lesions of sacroiliitis at MRI and SpA diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed an association between smoking status (p = 0.01), sacroiliitis, and SpA diagnosis. The odds of having sacroiliitis was 2.7 higher in smokers (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1–7) as compared to non-smokers and 6.3 higher in those with a positive Patrick-FABER test sign (OR: 6.3; 95%CI: 2.5–15.6) as compared to those with a negative sign.

Conclusions

Our study shows that Patrick-FABER test positivity could represent a useful clinical test for addressing the use of sacroiliac joints MRI and SpA diagnosis in subjects with LBP. Further, smoking habit could represent an associate anamnestic element for addressing the use of sacroiliac MRI.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^116RkVbw]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The two most common risk factors are history of pregnancy and history of prior lumbar surgery, but can also include scoliosis and repetitive athletic injuries among others. Physical exam findings are based on provocative maneuvers in which criteria usually calls for three or more being positive. These include distraction test, compression test, Gaenslen test, thigh thrust test, sacral thrust test, and Faber test. There is poor sensitivity with imaging, especially x-rays, but in general CT and MRI can be sensitive for detecting inflammation and/or arthritic type changes.

The IASP proposed criteria for diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunctionwhich includes pain in the area of the sacroiliac joint, reproducible with provocative maneuvers, and must be relieved with local anesthetic injection into the SIJ or the lateral branch nerves. Although the need for diagnostic and/or therapeutic injection has become controversial, it is generally accepted to be helpful in diagnosis and treatment.

Conventional non-surgical therapies such as oral analgesic use, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, radiofrequency denervation, and direct SI joint injections have been relied on as frontline therapies. However, they have shown limited durability in therapeutic benefit. It is generally accepted to start with conservative measures such as NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy. An SIJ injection whether diagnostic or therapeutic can also be considered as part of both the early diagnostic and treatment algorithm and may yield more clarity for patient identification for further treatment options if conservative measures fail. Figure 1 presents an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis and management of SI joint pain. It accounts for the use of conservative measures, diagnostic and therapeutic injections, as well as surgery and RFA. Some insurance carriers will require 70% pain relief with injections prior to proceeding with a surgical fixation. In addition, some carriers also require two injections prior to fixation which can be covered by having both a diagnostic and therapeutic injection.

### Adolescent elite skiers with and without cam morphology did change their hip joint range of motion with 2 years follow-up [^1144tJ31]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Hip ER, in the present study, was shown to be in line with earlier studies in athletes when compared at baseline, whilst the results from the follow-up are approximately 10° lower for both the cam and no-cam group. This may be due to an actual reduction in the hip joint ROM or muscular stiffness in the hip rotators, as a response to the alpine skiing.

The FABER test is commonly used as a diagnostic test in patients with hip and/or groin pain and is considered positive if the pain is reproduced and/or there is a decrease in ROM as compared with the non-affected leg. The most common method to measure hip ROM with the FABER test is with a stick between the lateral femoral condyle on the test side and the examination table. However, this method has not been able to distinguish between cam and no-cam morphology. In the present study, the hip ROM in FABER test was measured with a digital goniometer and the results were shown to conflict. The no-cam group had significantly lesser angle in the right hip from baseline to the follow-up, this was not shown for the cam group. In the left hip, none of the groups reached significant levels. Moreover, when comparing the groups from baseline to follow-up, there was no difference in either hip. Some previous studies, using this angle-measuring method, could not either report an association between hip ROM in the FABER test and participants with cam morphology. As the intra- and interobserver reliability was shown to be good to excellent in the present study, the likelihood of measurement errors due to the examiners is reduced. One may, therefore, speculate if the FABER test should be a predictor for hip ROM in patients with hip/groin pain, regardless of using the stick or the goniometer.

### Combining results from hip impingement and range of motion tests can increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with FAI syndrome [^1156TcW5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important finding of the present study was that the diagnostic accuracy for FAI syndrome can be improved when results from both hip impingement and range of motion tests are considered. The results show substantial agreement between two experienced raters for the AIMT, FADIR and FABER tests, moderate agreement for the DEXRIT and DIRIT, and poor agreement for the PRIMT. Moderate agreement was noted for all hip ROM tests, except the extension test, which showed poor agreement. The AIMT and FADIR test showed high sensitivity but low specificity in the diagnosis of FAI syndrome. The FABER test, DEXRIT and DIRIT showed moderate sensitivity and low to moderate specificity. Low sensitivity but high specificity was noted for ROM values rated as normal or decreased during internal rotation with a neutral hip position, external rotation with 90° of hip flexion, and abduction. Flexion and internal rotation with 90° of hip flexion exhibited moderate sensitivity and specificity.

The AIMT, FADIR, and FABER tests showed substantial agreement between two experienced raters. In line with these findings, Martin et al. reported substantial inter-rater agreement for the FABER test and moderate inter-rater agreement for the FADIR test. Ratzlaff et al. reported absolute agreement values for the AIMT, FADIR, and FABER that were comparable to our findings. However, no kappa values were reported in their study, and since absolute agreement values are limited due to the influence of chance and/or prevalent positive and negative outcomes, our results cannot easily be compared to their findings. Based on our results, which are supported by previous findings, the results from the AIMT, FADIR and FABER obtained from different raters may reliably be used in clinical practice as well as in research. The moderate agreement observed for the DEXRIT and DIRIT indicates that results obtained from different raters should be interpreted with caution. The PRIMT can be an inappropriate test for this patient group based on the poor inter-rater agreement observed.

4. Special tests

Scoliosis test (Adams Forward Bend Test)

Patient standing and instructed to forward flex with the feet together and knees straight. The curve of structural scoliosis is more apparent when bending over and the examiner may observe an imbalanced rib cage, with one side being higher than the other.

Modified Schober's test for lumbosacral spine mobility

Patient standing and measurements made 10 cm above and 5 cm below the lumbosacral junction (dimples of Venus). Repeat measurement with patient in full forward flexion. In general, the measure should increase by at least 6 cm to 21 cm. An increase of less than 6 cm suggests decreased lumbar spinal mobility, which may be seen in spodyloarthropathies. (Figure 1)

Figure 1
Modified Schober's Test. Patient standing and measurements made 10 cm above and 5 cm below the lumbosacral junction (dimples of Venus, iliac crest line). Repeat measurement with patient in full forward flexion.

Straight leg raise

Patient supine and the examiner lifts the leg keeping the knee straight, while supporting the calcaneus. Normal range is 80 degrees. If the patient has tight hamstrings, they may localize pain to the hamstring area. If the patient has sciatic pain, the patient may experience pain extending down the back of the leg or in the back. Lowering the leg 15 degrees and dorsiflexing the foot to stretch the sciatic nerve should reproduce sciatic pain. If pain persists it is sciatica, if not it is likely tight hamstrings.

FABER or Patrick test

Patient lying supine and leg passively brought into Flexion, ABduction, External Rotation with foot resting on opposite knee. Press down gently but firmly on the flexed knee and the opposite anterior superior iliac crest. Pain may be felt in the groin with intraarticular hip pathology or SI joint region with SI pathology.

Trendelenburg Test

Positive when patient stands on one leg and the contralateral hip drops, indicative of gluteals/hip abductor weakness. There are many conditions that may weaken the hip abductors including musculoskeletal and neurologic problems.

5.000000000000000e+00 Flexibility

The back and hips should be moved through active and passive range of motion.

Hamstring flexibility is determined by measuring the popliteal angle. The hips and knees are flexed to 90 degrees and then the examiner extends the knee until there is firm resistance. An angle greater than 45 degrees or asymmetry is common with tight hamstrings and low back pain.

### Hip MRI in flexion abduction external rotation for assessment of the ischiofemoral interval in patients with hip pain-a feasibility study [^1143ptCo]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the aforementioned studies, we aimed to adapt one of the two established clinical tests used for the diagnosis of IFI for MRI. The FABER test was chosen since the posterior impingement test would require prone patient positioning which would be time-consuming and difficult to standardize. However, it is important to note that this test is not specific for IFI and, like most clinical tests, has only moderate diagnostic efficacy. In the clinical setting, the FABER test is completed by applying progressive force to the knee to determine whether the test is positive or negative. FABER-MRI of the hip was feasible, and in our study, no patient requested termination of the examination. Interestingly, in the FABER position, the lesser trochanter moved more anteriorly and "out of plane" which prevented us from measuring the IFS. By contrast, we observed narrowing between the intertrochanteric ridge and the ischial tuberosity, especially at the proximal portion of the ridge, leading to an overall mean narrowing of 26 ± 7 mm (40 ± 8 mm vs 14 ± 9 mm) with FABER-MRI. In addition, we could identify a correlation between increasing femoral torsion and narrowing of the PID (r p = .41) and DID (r p = .38). Our results confirm the findings of a previous study using virtual, dynamic CT-based simulation of the FABER test using collision detection software. In that study, the intertrochanteric ridge and greater trochanter were identified as impingement location in 67% and 62%, respectively when simulating the FABER test in 40° of external hip rotation.

### Low back pain in professional golfers: the role of associated hip and low back range-of-motion deficits [^111GjnTB]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is fairly prevalent among golfers; however, its precise biomechanical mechanism is often debated.

Hypothesis

There is a positive correlation between decreased lead hip rotation and lumbar range of motion with a prior history of low back pain in professional golfers.

Study Design

A cross-sectional study.

Methods

Forty-two consecutive professional male golfers were categorized as group 1 (history of low back pain greater than 2 weeks affecting quality of play within past 1 year) and group 2 (no previous such history). All underwent measurements of hip and lumbar range of motion, FABERE's distance, and finger-to-floor distance. Differences in measurements were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Results

33% of golfers had previously experienced low back pain. A statistically significant correlation (P < .05) was observed between a history of low back pain with decreased lead hip internal rotation, FABERE's distance, and lumbar extension. No statistically significant difference was noted in nonlead hip range of motion or finger-to-floor distance with history of low back pain.

Conclusions

Range-of-motion deficits in the lead hip rotation and lumbar spine extension correlated with a history of low back pain in golfers.

### Clinical hip tests and a functional squat test in patients with knee osteoarthritis: reliability, prevalence of positive test findings, and short-term response to hip mobilization [^112KBpEu]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

One group pretest-posttest exploratory design.

Objectives

Primary purposes of this study were to examine the short-term effect of hip mobilizations on pain and range of motion (ROM) measurements in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to determine the prevalence of painful hip and squat test findings in both patients with knee OA and asymptomatic subjects. The secondary purposes were to assess intrarater reliability and to determine whether fewer subjects experienced painful test findings following hip mobilization.

Background

Conservative intervention, including manual physical therapy applied to the lower extremity, has been shown to reduce impairments associated with knee OA.

Methods and Measures

One rater pair administered 4 clinical hip tests to 22 patients with knee OA (mean age, 61.2 years; SD, 6.1 years) and 17 subjects without lower extremity symptoms or known pathology (mean age, 64.0 years; SD, 7.9 years). Intrarater reliability was examined for each clinical test. Patients with knee OA and painful-hip and squat test findings received hip mobilizations. Pain and ROM responses for each test were dependent variables.

Results

Intraclass correlation coefficients for all tests were greater than 0.87. Composite and individual test pain scores and ROM scores improved significantly following hip mobilization. All clinical test findings were more frequent in the group with knee OA, except for those of the FABER test, and the number of subjects with painful test findings following hip mobilization was reduced for all tests except the hip flexion test.

Conclusions

Patients experienced increases in ROM, decreased pain, and fewer subjects had painful test findings immediately following a single session of hip mobilizations. Examination and intervention of the hip may be indicated in patients with knee OA.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^114WxbQx]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Range of motion

Active movements. Hip flexion (most children can bring their knee to touch their chest; 120–135°), hip extension (30°), abduction (45–50°), adduction (20–30°).

Passive movements. Rotation measured with hip and knee flexed to 90°. Total internal and external rotation should equal 90°, internal rotation is greater with femoral anteversion and external rotation is greater with femoral retroversion. Femoral anteversion decreases with age (30° to 15°). If hip range of motion is normal in single planes, combined movement in the hip quadrant position (flexion, adduction, internal rotation) may reproduce pain, especially if there is intra-articular pathology as these movements decrease intracapsular volume.

Special tests

Thomas test for flexion contracture. Patient supine with level pelvis – place your hand under the patient's lumbar spine and flex one hip as far as possible. The patient's back should flatten and the extended leg should remain straight. A hip flexion contracture is present if the patient is unable to extend the leg straight without arching the spine. The degree of contracture is measured as the angle between the table and the leg at the point of greatest extension.

Trendelenburg Test. Positive when patient stands on one leg and the contralateral hip drops, indicative of gluteals/hip abductor weakness.

Ober test for contraction of iliotibial band. Patient lying on their side with their affected leg uppermost. Abduct the leg and flex the knee to 90° while keeping the hip joint in neutral position and then bring the leg into slight hip extension and external rotation. On release of the leg the thigh should drop into an adducted position. The thigh will remain abducted in a positive test.

FABER or Patrick test. Patient lying supine and leg passively brought into Flexion, ABduction, External Rotation with foot resting on opposite knee. Press down gently but firmly on the flexed knee and the opposite anterior superior iliac crest. Pain may be felt in the groin with intraarticular hip pathology or SI joint region with SI pathology.

Flexibility

The hip should be moved thru active range of motion and then placed thru full passive range of motion. Muscles that span two joints are important for functional range of motion and should be tested independently (rectus femoris, biceps femoris).

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^111pwwxp]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

When patients report posterior hip or low back pain below the level L5 or the beltline, various causes other than sacroiliitis should be considered, including seronegative spondyloarthropathies, posterior femoro-acetabular pathology, proximal hamstring tendinopathy, piriformis syndrome, stress fracture of the sacrum, and referred pain from lumbar spinal pathology including lumbosacral facet-mediated pain and proximal L5 radiculopathy. Although there are some overlapping characteristics amongst these other diagnoses, the following list helps to correlate various differentials with their particular findings.
Localization of pain to the spine or radiating pain into the lower extremities with a positive straight leg raise may suggest a spinal or spinal nerve pathology.
Concomitant anterior and posterior hip pain with a FABER test producing pain localizing in the groin area may point towards femoro-acetabular pathology.
Tenderness to palpation over the body of the piriformis muscle with a positive FADIR (Hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation) test may suggest piriformis syndrome.
Perineal pain worsened with palpation over the ischial spine may point toward a pudendal neuropathy.
Patients with reproducible pain along with the proximal hamstring muscle or tendon through various active, passive and resisted range of motion may have a hamstring strain, rupture, or tendinopathy.
Axial low back pain that is worse with lumbar extension and positive for lumbar facet loading may be indicative of lumbar facet arthropathy.
Pain localized over the inferior sacrum and coccygeal region may represent sacrocoxalgia or coccydynia.

Understanding the relationship between these various findings and correlated pathologies is crucial to identifying and appropriately addressing a patient's source of low back and posterior hip pain. It is not uncommon for SIJ pain to present concomitantly with some of these other underlying pathologies and having them in your differential will help formulate an appropriate treatment plan for the patient.

### Telemedicine in the era of COVID-19: the virtual orthopaedic examination [^1167JK9X]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2020). Medium credibility.

Hip

Many examination methods described above are applicable to the hip. The examination of the hip additionally includes the evaluation of the leg length, range of motion, and location of pain. For leg length, a virtual ruler can be used to make side-to-side comparisons of the measurements of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the floor. Patients can be asked to place a finger on the ASIS to assist with finding this landmark for measurement.

To measure hip flexion, the patient is asked to lie back with one side to the camera and to pull the knee to the chest. The measurements of internal and external rotation are obtained by having the patient sit in a chair facing the camera and rotating the hip with the knee bent at 90° (Fig. 2). External rotation can be assessed by asking the patient to initiate crossing the legs or placing them in a figure-of-4 position. Localization of pain and tenderness is assessed by asking the patient to point to this area and can include the C sign.

Fig. 2
External rotation of the hip can be measured by having the patient sit in a chair facing the camera and rotating the hip with the knee bent at 90°.

In atraumatic cases, flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) and flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABER) tests may be performed by demonstrating (or providing a visual example of) the test and having the patient mimic this motion, to help differentiate between hip and spine-related pain. Strength testing can be important to rule out spine-related symptoms and to identify muscle groups that can be targeted for rehabilitation. A straight-leg raise to test for hip strength and pain is performed. The evaluation of abduction strength in the side-lying position (gluteus medius, L5) can be assessed. Having the patient perform toe-walking can demonstrate strength in L5/S1 and having the patient perform heel-walking can demonstrate strength in L4. Hip extension strength (gluteals, L5/S1) can be assessed by having the patient arise from a chair without using the arms to assist (Fig. 3).

Hip extension strength can be assessed by having the patient sit back in a chair and arise without using the arms to assist.

### Development of an assessment schedule for patients with low back-associated leg pain in primary care: a Delphi consensus study [^116qctqF]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

From the 11 examination items that did not reach consensus for inclusion in the clinical assessment, the team agreed to include four items. The first was postural assessment (i.e. antalgic shift, scoliosis) ('important' 54.8%), the second was palpation of the lumbar spine ('important' 42.9%), the third was range of movement in relation to pain reproduction (see assessment schedule in Supplementary Appendix 2 for detail). Brief assessment of the hip joint as an exclusion test was also included in the assessment ('important' 61.9%). Again, the multidisciplinary group considered that simple observation findings such as antalgic shift, scoliosis should be recorded as an indication of severity and rarely as an indication of serious underlying pathology. Palpation was included for assessing severe bony tenderness. Pain response to movements was included as an extension to the item; 'demonstration of movement that produces symptoms', as it was thought to provide clues as to the mechanical nature of LBP. Finally, brief assessment of the hip joint for the purpose of excluding it as the source of symptoms was included as most participants commented in free text that they would assess the hip for that reason.

SIJ Provocative Tests

FABER Test (Patrick's Test)

When performing the FABER test (Figure 1), the patient lies supine on the examination table. The examiner brings the hip joint on the ipsilateral side of SIJ pain into the FABER position. The ipsilateral knee is flexed at 90° and the hip is externally rotated with the ipsilateral foot resting on the contralateral knee. Subsequently, the examiner presses the contralateral anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) against the table and pushes the flexed knee down toward the table. The test is considered positive if the patient feels pain in the SIJ on the side where the knee was flexed. Although, some textbooks suggest the FABER test can also stress the contralateral SIJ. At this point, pain in the buttocks is suggestive of SIJ pain, whereas pain in the groin region could indicate hip pathology. When performed correctly, the FABER test can have one of the highest sensitivities of the five provocative maneuvers. This test is also useful in this current age of telemedicine as patients can perform their own FABER examination by sitting on a chair, and crossing the ankle of the affected side over the contralateral knee and pushing down on their ipsilateral knee while leaning back in their chair.

Figure 1
FABER Test (Patrick's Test) – With the patient in a supine position, the lower extremity ipsilateral to the patient's painful SIJ is correctly positioned by lying their lateral ankle on the contralateral anterior thigh. Then with the clinician standing on the side of the painful SIJ, one hand must stabilize the contralateral ASIS with firm pressure, while simultaneously applying a downward force through the ipsilateral flexed, externally rotated and abducted lower extremity, as depicted by the arrow.

Thigh Thrust Test (Posterior Shear Test)

When performing the Thigh Thrust Test (Figure 2), the patient lies in a supine position while the tested-side hip joint and knee are flexed to approximately 90° by the examiner. An anterior to posterior shear force is applied to the SIJ through the axis of the femur. Resulting pain at the ipsilateral SIJ indicates a positive test.

Figure 2
Thigh Thrust Test (Posterior Shear Test) – With the patient lying in a supine position the hip and knee ipsilateral to the painful SIJ are flexed, and the femur is positioned perpendicular to the table. A linear downward force through the femur towards the table is applied as depicted by the arrow.

### Positive FABER distance test is associated with higher alpha angle in symptomatic patients [^114MxZ3K]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of the flexion abduction external rotation (FABER) distance test (FDT) for the diagnosis of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) as defined by alpha angle.

Methods

For this study, 603 patients with symptomatic, unilateral femoroacetabular impingement were included. Patients with symptoms of hip instability, bilateral symptoms, bilateral surgery, or bilateral alpha angles over 55 were excluded from the analysis. A positive FDT was defined as a difference of 4 cm or more between hips. A pathological cam was defined as an alpha angle of 78° or greater.

Results

The average age was 36.4 ± 12 years, with 344 males and 259 females. Faber distance of the injured hip was correlated with age at surgery (rho = 0.148; p < 0.001). Alpha angle on the injured hip was positively correlated with injured hip FABER distance (rho = 0.276; p < 0.001). The average alpha angle in patients with a positive FABER distance test was 74° (SD = 11°) compared to 68° (SD = 8°) in patients with a negative distance test (p = 0.001). The sensitivity of the FDT to diagnose pathological cam was 0.848 (0.79–0.89) with a negative predictive value of 86% (81–90%).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that the FABER distance test is correlated with the alpha angle and is a good diagnostic exam for pathological cam-type FAI as defined by and alpha angle equal to or greater than 78°.

Clinical Relevance

FABER distance test is a simple test that can be used as a screening test to decide if FAI should be suspected and further testing is needed.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^113vM5sE]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Tenderness to deep palpation of the suprapubic and sacroiliac area along the course of the long posterior sacroiliac and sacrotuberous ligaments, as well as a palpable step of the pubic symphysis joint, may be evident. Signs of local inflammation (erythema, oedema, warmth) may exist in a small percentage of the cases.

A wide variety of clinical examinations have been evaluated regarding their usefulness in the assessment and differential diagnosis of PPGP. Earlier studies were more focused on deep palpation and radiologic findings, while lately the weight of diagnosis has shifted toward the cumulative results of specific pain provocation tests. For the posterior elements of the pelvic girdle and the sacroiliac joints, the most reliable examinations are the posterior pelvic pain provocation test (P4/thigh thrust), the Patrick's FABER (flexion, abduction, external rotation at the hip), the active straight leg raise (ASLR), the long dorsal ligament and the Gaenslen tests. With regard to the pubic symphysis, the diagnosis is based mostly on deep palpation and the modified Trendelenburg test.

Because most of these tests have a proven high specificity but lower sensitivity, there appears to be a consensus for the combined use of all of these tests to minimise false-negative results. Leadbetter et al. described a scoring system to guide clinicians in screening the general pregnant patient population. In that system, they included five essential symptoms: pain of the pubic symphysis on walking, while standing on one leg, while climbing stairs, or while turning over in bed, as well as a history of damage to the pelvis or the lumbosacral area.

Laboratory blood tests are usually normal, with a nonspecific mild elevation of the acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) in a number of cases. However, for reasons related to differential diagnosis, most authors report acquiring a complete blood count, biochemistry and urine analysis.

Low back pain — clinical prediction rule (CPR) for SMT response: derivation and validation. In the derivation cohort, "Patients referred to physical therapy for LBP (n = 71) underwent an initial standardized examination", and "A CPR was developed using 5 variables: < 16-day duration of symptoms, at least one hip with > 35° of internal rotation, hypomobility with lumbar spring testing, FABQ work subscale score < 19 and no symptoms distal to the knee". The study reports that "the following clinical predictors are associated with 50% improvement for function within one week: symptoms less than 16 days, symptoms above the knee, low fear avoidance questionnaire score, at least one hypomobile segment, greater than 35° of internal rotation of the hip; presence of more predictors associated with increased likelihood of responding to treatment". In validation, "Patients who were referred to physical therapy for LBP were randomly assigned to receive exercise alone (n = 61) or exercise plus manipulation (n = 70)", and "To be considered positive on the CPR, patients had to have at least 4 out of 5 of the following: duration of current episode of LBP < 16 days, no symptoms distal to the knee, FABQ work subscale score < 19, at least one hypomobile segment in the lumbar spine, ≥ one hip with > 35° of internal rotation range of motion". Follow-up occurred "after one week, 4 weeks and 6 months". Outcomes showed that "Patients who received manipulation had greater improvements in disability and pain than those who received exercise alone", and "The patients who were positive on the rule and received manipulation had greater improvement in disability and pain at all follow-up points compared to patients who were negative on the rule and received manipulation".

History and Physical Exam

SIJ disorders are best differentiated from other forms of low back pain by using a combination of diagnostic modalities, including obtaining a thorough history and physical examination. SIJ pain typically presents as a uni- or bilateral aching pain below the L5 level without numbness or paresthesia (tingling). Patients typically report low back pain that is worse after prolonged sitting, bending forward, and with transfers out of a bed or up from a low chair or toilet. Pain in these patients may worsen after performing weight-bearing activities, such as climbing stairs, bending, twisting, or even prolonged walking. Repetitive bending with activities such as vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, pulling weeds and loading a dishwasher can also exacerbate SIJ pain. Gait is often compromised in individuals with SIJ pain. This dysfunction involves reduced coactivation of the gluteus maximus and contralateral latissimus dorsi, which together provide joint stability during walking.

While no single physical exam maneuver is diagnostic, a combination of specific findings and provocative tests can be essential in determining SIJ disorders. Specific physical exam provocative tests for SIJ dysfunction include FABER, compression, distraction, thigh thrust, and Gaenslen tests. Typically, SIJ pain is diagnosed when at least three out of the five provocative maneuvers are positive. Of the three positive tests, either the thigh thrust or compression test should be positive. By performing these provocative maneuvers, there is an 85% pretest probability that an intra-articular joint injection will be successful. Another study confirmed that three or more pain provocation SIJ tests have a 91% sensitivity and 78% specificity.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^116hsNDS]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation and pain patterns

FJ as a source of LBP was first described by Goldthwaite in 1911, and Ghormhley who used the term "facet syndrome" to describe a symptom originating from the FJ. It was initially described as lumbosacral pain with or without sciatica in 1933. Ten years later, Badgley et al. suggested FJ as the source of up to 80% of back pain. Facet syndrome included local pain and pseudo radicular radiation with variability of the distribution of referral patterns of pain. Most authors tried to classify the distribution of FJ pain provoked by an infiltration or electrical stimulation. The majority of these studies have not found reliable referral patterns of FJ pain. As suggested by Cohen, this may be explained by the fact that stimulation does not reproduce physiological conditions. FJ pain may be referred distally into the lower limb, thereby mimicking sciatica. "Pseudo-radicular" lumbar pain typically radiates uni- or bilaterally to the buttock and the trochanteric region (from the L4 and L5 levels), the groin and the thighs (from L2 to L5), ending above the knee, without neurological deficits (Fig. 5). However, radiating pain may reach the foot, mimicking sciatic pain, especially in cases of osteophytes or synovial cysts. Claudication is possible. Pain is usually worse in the morning, during periods of inactivity, and following stress exercise, lumbar spine extension or rotary trunk motions, is provoked by standing or sitting positions, and may be elicited on FJ palpation. Pain radiation can be subdivided into primary, secondary and least commonly painful areas as previously described by Barlocher et al. Abdominal and pelvic pain have also been described. Differential diagnoses include true sciatica, hip pathology (hip osteoarthritis or greater trochanteric bursitis) or sacroiliac impairment. However, lumbar FJ syndrome seems not to be a reliable clinical diagnosis, and a specific etiology of back pain can be diagnosed in only about 15% of patients with certainty based on clinical examination alone. The results of studies investigating the FJ as the source of a patient's symptoms suggest that the currently available tests have limited or no diagnostic validity. Moreover, history and physical examination may suggest but not confirm FJ as the source of pain.

### Combining results from hip impingement and range of motion tests can increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with FAI syndrome [^116qxBAk]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinical examination is an important part in the diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. However, knowledge on reliability and validity of clinical diagnostic tests is scarce. The aims were to evaluate the inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests to detect patients with FAI syndrome.

Methods

Eighty-one patients (49% women) were recruited. Two experienced raters performed impingement and range of motion (ROM) tests. Three criteria had to be fulfilled for the diagnosis of FAI syndrome: (1) symptoms; (2) CAM and/or Pincer morphology; and (3) being responder to intra-articular block injection. For inter-rater agreement, the Cohen's kappa statistics were used (0.41–0.60 = moderate, 0.61–0.80 = substantial agreement). For diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated.

Results

Anterior impingement test (AIMT), FADIR test and FABER test showed kappa values above 0.6. All passive hip ROM, except extension, had kappa values above 0.4. AIMT and FADIR showed the highest sensitivity, i.e., 80%, with a specificity of 26% and 25%, respectively. Passive hip ROM in internal rotation with neutral hip position had a sensitivity of 29% and a specificity of 94%.

Conclusion

The AIMT, FADIR and FABER tests were reliable between two experienced raters, while results from different raters for hip ROM should be interpreted with caution. The AIMT and FADIR test can only be used to rule out patients with FAI syndrome, while evaluation of ROM in internal rotation with neutral position may be more suitable to rule in patients with FAI syndrome.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^116bQTiT]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Evidence synthesis — Based on the evidence, the ability to accurately diagnose those with FAIS using clinical examination testing is limited; none of these tests could adequately identify those with FAIS due to low specificity; a finding of no pain with FADIR and no restricted ROM with FABER compared with the unaffected side was recommended as the best best test to identify those without FAIS. There was evidence with 1 level II cohort study to support the ligamentum teres test to accurately identify those with and without a ligamentum teres tear, and another level II cohort study found that the abduction-hyperextension-external rotation, prone instability, and resisted straight-leg raise tests have high specificity but low sensitivity for hip instability; the benefits of performing these clinical tests are that those without FAIS may be identified when select tests are negative and that those with and without a ligamentum teres tear can be identified, whereas the harms include potential aggravation of a patient's symptoms.
