## Question

How to manage a 75 year old female with atrial fibrillation who had a left atrial appendage who failed apixaban. Her renal function is normal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a management plan for a 75-year-old woman with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who has already undergone percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) and is now "failing apixaban". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "failed apixaban" actually means in this context. Then, I should verify her thromboembolic and bleeding risk profiles using validated scores. Next, I will examine the integrity of the LAAO with appropriate imaging to look for leaks or device-related thrombus. After that, I should align options with guideline-concordant therapy, including the possibility of discontinuing apixaban and relying on the device, switching anticoagulants, or considering a combined approach if a residual leak is present. Finally, I need to define follow-up imaging cadence, pericardioversion protocols, and address frailty and shared decision-making, especially in a 75-year-old woman with potentially higher bleeding risk and longer life expectancy than some very elderly cohorts [^111113pp] [^111djVnX] [^116iunBp].

> Let me first confirm what "failed apixaban" signifies here, because the phrasing is ambiguous; in a patient with prior LAAO, failure could mean recurrent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism despite apixaban, a major bleeding event attributable to apixaban, medication intolerance or nonadherence, or persistent left atrial appendage thrombus detected on preprocedural imaging despite therapy, and I should verify which of these applies before deciding on next steps [^1119PrFP] [^112JurDv].

> I should confirm baseline stroke and bleeding risks next; at age 75 and female, she has at least 3 points on CHA₂DS₂-VASc by age and sex, and if she has hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, prior stroke/TIA, or vascular disease, her score will be higher, which strengthens the indication for stroke prevention therapy, while HAS-BLED will help frame bleeding risk and guide intensity of antithrombotic therapy, especially in older adults where bleeding risk rises with age and comorbidity [^114bjJyj].

> Wait, let me verify the status of the LAAO before changing therapy; I need a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or cardiac CT to assess device position, completeness of occlusion, any peridevice leak, and device-related thrombus, because residual leak and thrombus are associated with increased thromboembolic risk and may alter antithrombotic management, and if cardioversion is ever planned, guidelines advise imaging to exclude thrombus and ensure adequate occlusion beforehand [^111ZaSG3] [^113NAuEz] [^116iunBp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if imaging shows a significant residual leak or device-related thrombus, I should consider intensifying antithrombotic therapy temporarily, often with a DOAC such as apixaban or rivaroxaban, and then reassess with repeat imaging in 6 to 8 weeks to document thrombus resolution before de-escalating, whereas if occlusion is complete and there is no thrombus, the device may obviate the need for ongoing anticoagulation in selected patients [^111ZaSG3] [^116iunBp].

> I will now examine the option of discontinuing apixaban and relying on the LAAO alone; guidelines support LAAO as reasonable when there is a nonreversible contraindication to long-term oral anticoagulation, and randomized and registry data suggest noninferior stroke prevention versus warfarin or DOACs with reduced major bleeding, though the evidence base is strongest in patients with high bleeding risk and careful selection is essential, so if her "failure" reflects bleeding or intolerance, stopping apixaban and using device-only strategy is appropriate with close follow-up [^112hyner] [^116BT1Lo] [^116kFGe3].

> But wait, what if the "failure" is an ischemic event despite therapeutic apixaban; I should double-check adherence, drug–drug interactions, and whether dose reduction criteria were inadvertently applied, because apixaban is dose-reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily only if at least two of age 80 or older, body weight 60 kg or less, or serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or higher are present, and with normal renal function and weight above 60 kg, standard 5 mg twice daily dosing is appropriate unless other interacting factors exist [^115Dva1x] [^114Scaud].

> If adherence and dosing are correct and she had an ischemic event, I should consider switching to an alternative anticoagulant rather than simply stopping therapy; switching to warfarin with a target INR 2.0–3.0, or to another DOAC such as rivaroxaban or dabigatran, is reasonable, and in frail older adults, observational data suggest apixaban may have favorable outcomes compared with warfarin or rivaroxaban, though head-to-head randomized data in this exact subgroup are limited, so I need to individualize based on renal function, bleeding risk, and comorbidities [^117EucWo] [^116JH2Bw].

> Let me consider the scenario of a residual leak with otherwise adequate device position; in that case, a short course of intensified anticoagulation with reassessment in 6 to 8 weeks is prudent, and if the leak persists and stroke risk remains high, combining LAAO with low-dose anticoagulation may be reasonable, acknowledging that optimal post-LAAO antithrombotic regimens remain an evidence gap and should be guided by consensus statements and patient-specific risk [^116iunBp] [^115N5WNh].

> I should confirm the follow-up plan; after any change in antithrombotic therapy or if imaging revealed a leak or thrombus, repeat TEE or CT at about 3 to 6 months and then annually is reasonable to surveil for device-related thrombus and peridevice leak, and if cardioversion is ever needed, I must obtain imaging to exclude thrombus and ensure adequate occlusion before proceeding, with pericardioversion anticoagulation considered if there is residual leak or thrombus [^113NAuEz] [^111GtERG].

> Next, I should review frailty and life expectancy, because at 75 with normal renal function, her expected survival may exceed a decade, which supports durable stroke prevention strategies; however, I need to screen for frailty, falls, and geriatric syndromes that increase bleeding risk, and if present, LAAO without long-term anticoagulation becomes more attractive, whereas if she is robust, continuing anticoagulation may be reasonable depending on the LAAO integrity and prior event type [^111113pp] [^117EucWo] [^1145afsC].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making; I should explain that LAAO reduces major bleeding compared with warfarin and performs comparably for stroke prevention in selected populations, but device-related thrombus and peridevice leak can occur and require surveillance, and that anticoagulation remains first-line for most patients without contraindications, so her preferences, prior bleeding phenotype, and tolerance will guide whether we stop apixaban entirely, switch agents, or continue a reduced-intensity regimen alongside the device [^112hyner] [^116BT1Lo] [^111113pp].

For a 75-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation, normal renal function, and a failed left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), the priority is to **restart anticoagulation** to reduce stroke risk, as LAAO alone is insufficient when occlusion fails [^111ZaSG3]. Apixaban is still appropriate at 5 mg twice daily given normal renal function [^115Dva1x], but if there was bleeding or intolerance, switch to warfarin or another DOAC (rivaroxaban 20 mg daily or edoxaban 60 mg daily) [^114Scaud] and monitor closely. If anticoagulation is contraindicated, consider aspirin 75–100 mg daily as a less effective alternative, and reassess occlusion with TEE or CT angiography to guide further intervention [^111ZaSG3]. Management should be individualized, with regular follow-up to monitor for thromboembolism, bleeding, and occlusion status [^111113pp].

---

## Clinical implications of failed LAAO

When LAAO fails, the left atrial appendage remains a **thromboembolic source**, and stroke risk returns to pre-occlusion levels; therefore, **anticoagulation is indicated** to mitigate this risk [^111ZaSG3].

---

## Recommended anticoagulation strategies

### Restarting anticoagulation

- **First-line therapy**: Resume anticoagulation promptly to restore stroke protection [^112JurDv].
- **Preferred agent**: Apixaban 5 mg twice daily is appropriate given normal renal function and favorable safety [^115Dva1x] [^115DwVFL].
- **Alternative agents**: If apixaban failed due to bleeding or intolerance, consider warfarin (INR 2–3) or another DOAC (rivaroxaban 20 mg daily or edoxaban 60 mg daily) [^114Scaud].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **imaging** with TEE or CT angiography should be arranged to assess occlusion status and detect device-related thrombus or residual leak [^111ZaSG3]. Ongoing clinical **monitoring** should track thromboembolic and bleeding events, with therapy adjusted as needed [^111113pp].

---

## Alternative stroke prevention strategies

If anticoagulation is contraindicated, consider the following:

| **Alternative strategy** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Aspirin monotherapy | 75–100 mg daily if anticoagulation is contraindicated | Low |
| Repeat LAAO or surgical closure | Consider if feasible and safe | Moderate |
| Combined antiplatelet therapy | Aspirin + clopidogrel if high thrombotic risk and anticoagulation contraindicated | Low |

---

## Special considerations in elderly patients

- **Bleeding risk**: Higher in elderly; use HAS-BLED to guide therapy and monitoring [^114bjJyj].
- **Frailty**: Common and associated with adverse outcomes; tailor therapy and follow-up [^117EucWo].
- **Comorbidities**: Hypertension, diabetes, and CKD increase risk; manage proactively [^117XKDMx] [^1158eKUN].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Restart anticoagulation**: Apixaban 5 mg twice daily or alternative agent if needed [^115Dva1x].
- **Monitor occlusion**: Use TEE or CT angiography to assess device status [^111ZaSG3].
- **Individualize therapy**: Base on bleeding risk, comorbidities, and patient preference [^111113pp].
- **Consider alternatives**: Aspirin or repeat/surgical closure if anticoagulation is contraindicated [^111djVnX].

---

For a 75-year-old woman with failed LAAO and normal renal function, **restart anticoagulation** (apixaban or alternative), monitor occlusion with imaging, and individualize therapy based on bleeding risk and comorbidities [^111ZaSG3].

Conclusion

As we have tried to illustrate, decision-making regarding LAAO is complex.

There should be postprocedure protocols regarding follow-up, imaging and medication in departments managing patients undergoing LAAO.
Patients should be included in clinical trials comparing LAAO and DOAC treatment to improve our knowledge about areas of uncertainty and our ability to select patients. This includes the potential consequences of PDL and device-related thrombus.

Fortunately, there are several planned or ongoing clinical trials underway, comparing LAAO with DOAC/OAC treatment-OPTION, CATALYST, CHAMPION AF.

A randomised controlled trial including apixaban as a comparator and inclusion of patients at higher risk of bleeding and risk factors such as age, frailty and female gender could provide valuable information.

The risk and frequency of LAAO procedural complication should be part of the decision-making process and weighed against the risk of bleeding on aspirin and DOAC treatment, the patient's comorbidity and prognosis.

We believe the strength of the evidence is presently too weak to warrant the current use of the procedure. It is our opinion, based on the available evidence, that LAAO can be considered in very selected patients, especially in cases with previous life-threating bleeding episodes, limited modifiable bleeding risk factors, a continuously high risk of bleeding, combined with a high risk of thrombosis and limited comorbidity. Above and beyond all other considerations, is to provide solid information to the patient.

### Left atrial appendage occlusion: rationale, evidence, devices, and patient selection [^111aJF5B]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a worldwide epidemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality, often due to disabling or fatal thromboembolic stroke. Oral anticoagulation is highly effective at preventing ischaemic stroke and improving all-cause survival in patients with non-valvular AF. Despite the efficacy of oral anticoagulation, many patients are not treated due to either absolute or perceived contraindications to therapy, including bleeding. Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure has emerged as a mechanical alternative to pharmacologic stroke prevention. Initial and mid-term clinical trial data suggest that LAA closure is safe, with less intracranial bleeding, and a net clinical benefit that appears to be non-inferior to oral anticoagulation. However, concern remains over the possible increased risk of ischaemic stroke in long-term follow-up. Careful patient selection for LAA closure is paramount. Patients with prior intracranial bleeding or recurrent serious bleeding who are not eligible for long-term oral anticoagulation are typical candidates for LAA closure; however, other populations may benefit as well, such as patients with end-stage renal disease. Clinical investigation and randomized trials are needed to clarify the best methods of LAA occlusion, optimal pharmacologic strategies in the short-term after LAA closure, and to identify patient populations who will derive the most benefit from LAA occlusion. In this article, we review the rationale for LAA closure, the currently available devices and their evidence base, patient selection, challenges in management, and future directions for LAA closure science.

Chronic kidney disease — synopsis highlights that CKD is a risk factor for stroke in patients with AF, independent of other risk factors, and the prevalence of AF among patients with renal failure on dialysis is high, including asymptomatic AF. VKAs are limited by a markedly reduced time in therapeutic range in patients with severe CKD, including those on dialysis, and association with calciphylaxis, while pivotal DOAC trials excluded patients on dialysis with dosing recommendations based on pharmacokinetics only. Only dabigatran is substantially removed by dialysis, and limited data on left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) exist in this group, with prospective comparison to anticoagulation or no therapy awaited.

Clinical Events

The base case analysis assumed a 70-year-old patient with a history of stroke and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years [double weight], diabetes mellitus, stroke [double weight], vascular disease [coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, aortic atherosclerosis], age 65–74 years, and female sex) of 7 (annual stroke risk 9.60%) and a HAS-BLED score (hypertension, abnormal renal and liver function, stroke, bleeding, labile INR, elderly, drugs or alcohol) of 3 (annual bleeding risk 3.74%). The baseline CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was derived from the CHADS₂ (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke [double weight]) patient profile in the secondary prevention subgroup analyses of the pivotal clinical trials.– Clinical inputs appear in the.

LAAC events were drawn primarily from a secondary prevention subgroup analysis of PROTECT AF at 5 years of follow-up (Boston Scientific, unpublished data, 2017). Event probabilities for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were taken from the secondary prevention subgroup analyses of their respective pivotal trials. – Event probabilities for warfarin were based on results from the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial on secondary prevention. Event rates from this trial were indirectly compared against event rates from the warfarin arms of the secondary prevention subgroup analyses of PROTECT AF, RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation), and ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation). –

### Stroke prevention strategies in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation [^111kyM7E]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Effective stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the cornerstone of the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. The use of OAC reduces the risk of stroke and death. For most patients with atrial fibrillation without moderate or severe mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic mechanical heart valves, treatment options include vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Although most guidelines generally recommend NOACs as the first-line OAC, caution is required in some groups of patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke and bleeding who have been under-represented or not studied in the randomized clinical trials on NOACs for stroke prevention. In addition to OAC, non-pharmacological, percutaneous therapies, including left atrial appendage occlusion, for stroke prevention have emerged, sometimes used in combination with catheter ablation for the treatment of the atrial fibrillation. High-risk groups of patients with atrial fibrillation include patients with end-stage renal failure (including those receiving dialysis), extremely old patients (such as those aged > 80 years with multiple risk factors for bleeding), patients with dementia or those living in a long-term care home, patients with previous intracranial bleeding or recent acute bleeding (such as gastrointestinal bleeding), patients with acute ischaemic stroke and patients with an intracardiac thrombus. This Review provides an overview of stroke prevention strategies, including left atrial appendage occlusion, in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke and bleeding.

Perioperative physicians should be well versed in atrial fibrillation (AF) management because it is the most common sustained arrythmia in the United States. In this narrative review of the 2019 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologists/Heart Rhythm Society Focused Update on Atrial Fibrillation, the authors detail the emergence of new evidence from completed studies that may affect the management of patients with AF presenting for surgery. Updates regarding non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) comprise the bulk of the update with newer evidence emerging regarding their equivalence and/or superiority compared to Coumadin. Apixaban is now the preferred drug of choice for first line stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF over Coumadin. Renal dysfunction and the management of patients with AF on hemodialysis is examined; in patients on hemodialysis with AF, the focused update recommends administration of either warfarin or dose-reduced apixaban. Evidence from new trials addressing the appropriate bridging of NOACs before surgery is discussed. Patients with nonvalvular AF may not exhibit an added benefit from bridging of anticoagulation, and perioperative physicians should balance the risks of stroke and major bleeding before surgery. Advances in nonpharmacologic treatment and management of AF are outlined, including left atrial appendage occlusion devices, catheter ablations, and electrical cardioversion. Anesthesiologists' understanding of these 2019 updated guidelines will allow for more adept optimization of patients with AF presenting for surgery.

### Diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation [^1172qmbG]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that adversely affects cardiac function and increases the risk of stroke. It is the most common arrhythmia and a major source of morbidity and mortality; its prevalence increases with age. Pulse rate is sensitive, but not specific, for diagnosis, and suspected atrial fibrillation should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography. Because normal electrocardiographic findings do not rule out atrial fibrillation, home monitoring is recommended if there is clinical suspicion of arrhythmia despite normal test results. Treatment is based on decisions made regarding when to convert to normal sinus rhythm vs. when to treat with rate control, and, in either case, how to best reduce the risk of stroke. For most patients, rate control is preferred to rhythm control. Ablation therapy is used to destroy abnormal foci responsible for atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke while increasing the risk of bleeding. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system assesses the risk of stroke, with a score of 2 or greater indicating a need for anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score estimates the risk of bleeding. Scores of 3 or greater indicate high risk. Warfarin, dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), and aspirin are options for stroke prevention. Selection of therapy should be individualized based on risks and potential benefits, cost, and patient preference. Left atrial appendage obliteration is an option for reducing stroke risk. Two implantable devices used to occlude the appendage, the Watchman and the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug, appear to be as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke, but they are invasive. Another percutaneous approach to occlusion, wherein the left atrium is closed off using the Lariat, is also available, but data on its long-term effectiveness and safety are still limited. Surgical treatments for atrial fibrillation are reserved for patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other reasons.

Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (pLAAO) — evidence overview: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated pLAAO to be noninferior to warfarin and DOACs for stroke and systemic embolism with a reduced risk of major bleeding, and prospective registries in patients not on long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) have shown high procedural success with low risks; based on these findings, pLAAO is reasonable in nonvalvular AF with a nonreversible contraindication to long-term OAC, and may be reasonable as an alternative to OAC based on patient preference after careful consideration of procedural risk with the understanding that there is a much greater body of evidence supporting OAC in this population in general.

### Anticoagulation management in haemodialysis patients with atrial fibrillation: evidence and opinion [^113MXQiN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

In the absence of robust evidence to guide clinical decision-making, the optimal approach to prevent stroke and systemic embolism in haemodialysis (HD) patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains moot. In this position paper, studies on oral anticoagulation (OAC) in HD patients with AF are highlighted, followed by an evidence-based conclusion, a critical analysis to identify sources of bias and practical opinion-based suggestions on how to manage anticoagulation in this specific population. It remains unclear whether AF is a true risk factor for embolic stroke in HD. The currently employed cut-off values for the CHA2DS2-VASc score do not adequately discriminate dialysis patients deriving a net benefit from those suffering a net harm from OAC. Anticoagulation initiation should probably be more restrictive than currently advocated by official guidelines. Recent evidence reveals that the superior benefit-risk profile of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) observed in the general population and in moderate chronic kidney disease can be extended to the HD population. VKA may be especially harmful in dialysis patients and should therefore be avoided, in particular in patients with a high bleeding risk and labile international normalized ratio. Dose-finding studies of DOACs suggest that rivaroxaban 10mg daily and apixaban 2.5mg twice daily are appropriate choices in dialysis patients. Combined treatment with oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents should be reserved for strong indications and limited in time. Left atrial appendage occlusion is a potential attractive solution to reduce the risk of stroke without increasing bleeding propensity, but it has not been properly studied in dialysis patients.

Management of atrial fibrillation in CKD

Key aspects in the management of Afib include the avoidance of stroke and thromboembolism as well as the reduction of symptoms by rate or rhythm control.

Anticoagulation for Afib and CKD

Scores for assessing the risk of thromboembolic events or bleeding have not been validated for higher-grade CKD, and the currently most frequently used CHA₂DS₂-VA score does not include eGFR or albuminuria despite the fact that individuals with CKD exhibit an elevated risk for both thromboembolism and bleeding. There are no published, dedicated randomized trials on the clinical risks and benefits of anticoagulation in patients with advanced CKD. Observational studies suggest that vitamin K antagonist treatment with warfarin reduces the relative risk of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism in Afib and CKD Stage G3 by 76%. In contrast, the effect of warfarin for stroke prevention in dialysis patients is controversial due to the increased risk of bleeding. In addition, a meta-analysis in a population of stroke patients showed that the relative frequency of haemorrhagic strokes increases with decreasing kidney function.

A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials and 19 observational studies suggest that direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) are associated with better efficacy in early CKD compared with vitamin K antagonists and appear to be associated with a better safety profile in advanced CKD Stages G4/5. Data from three small, randomized trials comparing DOACs vs vitamin K antagonists are now available for haemodialysis patients, indicating an acceptable safety profile for the DOACs apixaban and rivaroxaban. Of note, due to partial kidney excretion, the dose of DOACs should be adjusted in patients with advanced CKD.

If there are contraindications to antithrombotic therapy, atrial appendage occlusion can be a treatment option with registry data suggesting an acceptable safety profile for the procedure in higher-grade CKD.

Rhythm vs rate control

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a 2.3-fold increased risk of recurrence of Afib after catheter ablation in individuals with CKD compared with those without CKD.

### Strategy optimization for a combined procedure in patients with atrial fibrillation: the COMBINATION randomized clinical trial [^111h4RXf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

A total of 202 eligible patients with nonvalvular AF were enrolled in the COMBINATION trial and randomized (1:1) to the ablation-first group (n = 101) or the occlusion-first group (n = 101). Four patients in each group were lost to follow-up, leaving data from 194 patients (97 patients in each group) for analysis (Figure 1). The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 67.3 (9.2) years, 110 patients (56.7%) were male and 84 (43.3%) were female, and 74 patients (38.1%) had PAF. The median CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED scores were 4 (IQR, 3–5) and 2 (IQR, 2–3), respectively. A total of 96 patients (49.5%) had a history of cerebrovascular accident, and 22 (11.3%) experienced bleeding events while taking anticoagulants. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (Table 1). Most patients in both the ablation-first (86 [88.7%]) and occlusion-first (88 [90.7%]) groups had a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3 or greater.

### Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure in a patient with atrial fibrillation [^1179F1ES]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 73-year-old woman presented with a history of persistent atrial fibrillation, which had lasted more than five years. She also had a remote history of transient ischemic attack and had received warfarin therapy. The international normalized ratio had been carefully maintained at slightly subtherapeutic levels because of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which was severe enough to require frequent blood transfusions. With colonoscopy, the source of bleeding was localized to multiple arterial-venous malformations. The patient underwent catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction and received a single chamber pacemaker. Two years later, she received a dual chamber pacemaker followed by cardioversion to restore a sinus rhythm. Following brief cardioversion, her symptoms of atrial fibrillation returned after two days.

Investigations

Transesophageal echocardiography, pacemaker interrogation.

Diagnosis

Persistent atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion.

Management

Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion, antiplatelet therapy.

Antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention for atrial fibrillation in chronic kidney disease

In a general, mostly non-CKD population, the AVERROES trial of aspirin vs. apixaban was stopped early due to a higher risk of stroke with aspirin but with similar bleeding risk in both groups. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend single or dual antiplatelet therapy for prevention of stroke/thromboembolism in AF among patients with CKD G4, G5, or G5D, even when OAC is considered undesirable. Similarly, these patients should not receive concomitant antiplatelet therapy while taking anticoagulants, unless there is a specific secondary indication (e.g. recent coronary stent). The duration of concomitant single or dual antiplatelet therapy in those receiving anticoagulants needs to be minimized and individualized based on clinical factors and type of stent.

Left atrial appendage occlusion in chronic kidney disease

The left atrial appendage (LAA) is believed to be the site of thrombus formation for most AF-related cardio-embolic strokes. Circulatory exclusion of the LAA represents a non-pharmacological, device-based therapy for stroke prevention that could conceivably be an option in moderate to high stroke risk in CKD, particularly with contraindications to long-term OAC. Five-year data from two randomized trials of the Watchman ® LAA occlusion device demonstrated a reduction in stroke risk comparable to warfarin but with additional reduction in major bleeding. However, CKD prevalence or severity was not reported and could have been under-represented. The majority of patients receiving the device in trials and in practice are continued on dual- or single-antiplatelet drug therapy, which may be associated with higher bleeding risk in CKD. Moreover, enrolled subjects were without contraindications and hence randomized. Registry data of the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug, a similar device, has shown comparable procedural safety in CKD vs. normal kidney function. A randomized trial of LAA occlusion vs. VKAs in CKD Stages 4 and 5 (CKD G4 and G5) is ongoing (13 February 2018).

### 2015 ACC / HRS / SCAI left atrial appendage occlusion device societal Overview [^116PAdp4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion — clinical rationale and patient context emphasizes that percutaneous LAA occlusion has the potential to change the clinical approach to stroke prevention in selected patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, factor Xa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors have become the current standard of care to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with risk factors, albeit at the expense of an increase in bleeding risk. Some patients with AF whose stroke risk profiles would favor anticoagulation have relative or absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, others are unable or unwilling to adhere to long-term anticoagulation therapy, and thus alternatives to pharmacological therapy to reduce the risk of stroke have been pursued.

### State of the art in left atrial appendage Occlusion [^115N5WNh]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) has become an important therapeutic target for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Over the past 2 decades, several advancements in LAAO devices (percutaneous and surgical) have been made for stroke prevention and arrhythmia therapy. However, there are several unanswered questions regarding optimal patient selection, the preferred LAAO approach and device, the management of periprocedural and postprocedural complications, including pericardial effusion, device-related thrombus, and device leaks. This review focuses on fundamental foundational concepts in various aspects of the left atrial appendage and management strategies as they relate to current clinical needs.

Left atrial appendage occlusion randomized trials — LAACS and LAAOS III report as follows: LAACS was a relatively small study (n = 186) of patients with predominantly no history of atrial fibrillation (87%), showing no statistically significant reduction in stroke (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.27–1.43) and mortality (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.44–1.39) at 6 years of follow-up. LAAOS III enrolled 4770 patients undergoing concomitant cardiac surgery with a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, permitted several occlusion techniques including amputation and closure (preferred), and reported that approximately one-third underwent surgical ablation, 92% received the allocated left atrial appendage management, and 77% were compliant with oral anticoagulation; the trial found a significant reduction in the primary end point driven by reduction in stroke (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52–0.84) without a decrease in all-cause mortality, and a secondary analysis found this reduction was independent of the use of oral anticoagulation.

### Non-pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation [^112F86zc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice today. Contemporary medical treatment options include atrioventricular nodal blocking agents to control heart rates during AF, antiarrhythmic drugs aimed at maintaining normal sinus rhythm, and anticoagulation therapies to reduce stroke risk. Invasive treatment of AF has emerged because of the toxicities and lack of long-term efficacy of available antiarrhythmic medications along with the lack of improvement in symptoms for rate-controlled patients. The investigators review the evolution of the current catheter-delivered AF procedures, starting with surgical maze up to and including left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Individual catheter ablation targets, anatomic and electrophysiologic, are discussed, with a particular focus on the use of an incremental ablation target strategy dependent on the type of AF being treated. In conclusion, the history of invasive AF therapy provides a basic understanding of contemporary ablation strategies and a backdrop for the cutting-edge rhythm and stroke prevention therapies of today.

Key Points

Question

Does percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion compared with an oral anticoagulant offer reduced risk of bleeding, death, and stroke in patients with kidney failure and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are undergoing dialysis?

Findings

In this cohort study, 293 patients with kidney failure and atrial fibrillation who received left atrial appendage occlusion were propensity matched to 2051 patients receiving oral anticoagulants. The study found evidence that left atrial appendage occlusion was associated with a lower risk of recurrent bleeding events and death.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that in patients with kidney failure and atrial fibrillation, left atrial appendage occlusion may offer safer thromboembolic risk reduction compared with oral anticoagulants.

### Patient characteristics associated with using transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion versus oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation [^112nSbcd]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is an alternative to oral anticoagulants (OACs) for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, but the predictors of LAAO use in routine care are unclear. We aimed to assess the utilization trends of LAAO and compare the change in characteristics of LAAO users versus OACs since its marketing.

Methods

Using the US Medicare claims database (March 15, 2015, to December 31, 2020), we identified patients with atrial fibrillation, ≥ 65 years, and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 2 (men) or ≥ 3 (women), with either first implantation of an LAAO device or initiation of OACs, including apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or warfarin. Patient characteristics, measured 365 days before the first LAAO or OAC use date, were compared using logistic regression.

Results

There were 30058 LAAO recipients (mean age, 77.74 years; female, 42.1%) and 792600 OAC initiators (mean age, 78.48; female, 53.3%). In 2020, patients had higher odds of initiating LAAO use than in 2015 (0.52 versus 9.32%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 13.64 [95% CI, 12.56–14.81]). Old age (ie, > 85 versus 65–75 years; aOR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.80–0.88]), female sex (aOR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.71–0.76]), Black race (aOR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.58–0.68]) versus White race, and Medicaid eligibility (aOR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.58–0.64]) were associated with lower odds of receiving LAAO. Among clinical characteristics, frailty, cancer, fractures, and venous thromboembolism were associated with lower odds of LAAO use, while history of intracranial and extracranial bleeding, coagulopathy, and falls were associated with higher odds of receiving LAAO.

Conclusions

Among patients with atrial fibrillation receiving stroke-preventive therapy, LAAO use increased rapidly from 2015 to 2020 and was positively associated with the risk factors for OAC complications but negatively associated with old age, advanced frailty, and cancer. Black race and female sex were associated with a lower likelihood of receiving LAAO.

Derivation of the Study Cohort

We obtained data from the US Renal Data System (USRDS) on unique patients who received long-term maintenance dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). Patients in whom kidney transplant failed and who were returning for dialysis were also included. We excluded patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who did not survive for the first 6 months after starting dialysis or did not have a start date in the system. We further applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify patients with ESKD and an atrial fibrillation diagnosis (N = 42 857); 12 031 (28.3%) received only oral anticoagulants (OACs), 293 (0.7%) received left atrial appendage occlusion device (LAAO), and the remaining patients received neither treatment. Of the 293 patients who received LAAO, 175 (59.7%) received LAAO only, whereas the remaining 118 (40.3%) received LAAO after receiving OACs. ICD-10 indicates International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision.

A total of 2194 patients (93.6%) were receiving hemodialysis, with the remaining 150 (6.4%) receiving peritoneal dialysis. There were between-group differences in age, sex, race, dialysis modality, time on dialysis, and certain comorbidities (Table 1).

Severe CKD and dialysis — anticoagulation considerations note that the role of anticoagulation in patients with AF and severe CKD, including those on dialysis, is controversial. The pivotal clinical trials of apixaban excluded patients with CrCl < 25 mL/min, but FDA-approved labeling was extended to include those with end-stage renal failure, including those on hemodialysis. A pharmacokinetic study found apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily produced drug levels approximating those seen with 5 mg twice daily in normal renal function, suggesting 2.5 mg is a more appropriate dose in such patients. Observational data are mixed: a Medicare cohort found no difference in thromboembolism but less major bleeding with apixaban versus warfarin, while another analysis found increased risk of thromboembolism and fatal or intracranial bleeding with apixaban 5 mg twice daily versus no anticoagulation but not with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. Two small trials of apixaban versus warfarin in hemodialysis did not show differences in safety or efficacy outcomes but reported significantly more bleeding than stroke events.

Closure of the left atrial appendage

It has been shown that most atrial thrombi in patients with non-valvular AF arise in the left atrial appendage. 'Extra-appendage' atrial thrombosis is a rare condition usually associated with prosthetic valves or thrombophilia. Therefore, left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has been proposed as an alternative to OAC for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with AF. The combined 5-year outcomes of two RCTs, the PREVAIL (NCT01182441) and the PROTECT AF (NCT00129545) trials, demonstrated that LAAC provides stroke prevention in AF comparable to VKA, with reduction in major bleeding, haemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. Subsequently, the PRAGUE-17 RCT (NCT02426944), with > 4 years of follow-up, showed non-inferiority of LAAC versus DOACs (predominantly apixaban) versus a composite primary endpoint of cardioembolic events, cardiovascular death and clinically significant bleeding. However, an eCrCl < 30 ml/min was an exclusion criterion. Cardiology guidelines provide a weak recommendation for LAAC as an alternative to OAC, as the patients involved in these three trials had no contraindications to VKAs or DOACs. An international consensus paper was recently published that highlighted the importance for nephrologists, neurologists, haematologists and gastroenterologists who deal with populations at high risk of bleeding to consider LAAC in case of AF.

Atrial fibrillation — timing of anticoagulant interruption before invasive procedures (Table 18): Apixaban is held 1 d before low bleeding risk procedures and 2 d before high bleeding risk procedures. Dabigatran with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 50 mL/min is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk, and with CrCl 30–50 mL/min is held 2 d for low risk and 4 d for high risk. Edoxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. Rivaroxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. For warfarin, hold 5 d or for a target INR < 1.5; an alternative is 2–3 d for a target INR < 2. For patients with CrCl lower than the table values, the footnote states to consider holding for an additional 1 to 3 days, and it clarifies that the number of days refers to full days before surgery and the drug is also not taken the day of surgery.

Exposure and Switching

The primary exposure variable was assignment to an OAC prescription or a receipt of LAAO. From a new diagnosis of AF after the dialysis start date for a cohort member, each patient receiving an OAC (warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban) was followed up after appearance of the first prescription following a 6-month window without it. There could be instances of individuals being previously exposed to an OAC before receiving LAAO. There were 4 different patterns of treatments prescribed to the patients: individuals who (1) received OACs throughout the observation window (new AF diagnosis till death or censorship); (2) had no OAC treatment before receiving their first OAC prescription during the observation window; (3) had no OAC treatment before receiving LAAO during the observation window; and (4) started with no OAC treatment and then received OAC treatment for some time before receiving LAAO during the observation window. Thus, we chose treatment as a time-dependent exposure for analyses. This choice allowed us to include individuals who received OACs before their LAAO in the analyses in which the first date of OAC receipt was flagged. Individuals were followed up in the OAC arm until they received their LAAO and then switched to the LAAO arm.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was all-cause death, assessed from the USRDS, because nephrologists are mandated to submit a Death Notification Form, including time and cause of death, within 45 days of the event. The secondary outcome was time-to-first nonfatal ischemic stroke based on hospital claims (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Safety outcome was any nonfatal major bleeding (gastrointestinal, brain, and others) during the survival period that required hospitalization (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Bleeding events within 6 weeks of the device placement were designated periprocedural and excluded.

Right censoring occurred when follow-up time ended for a reason other than death, including discontinuation of dialysis, transplantation of kidney, loss to USRDS follow-up, or reaching the end date of the data (December 31, 2018).

### Early adoption of dabigatran and its dosing in US patients with atrial fibrillation: results from the outcomes registry for better informed treatment of atrial fibrillation [^112huzaL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Older patients with AF represent a significant challenge in the management of stroke prevention, as the risks of both ischemic stroke and major hemorrhage (including intracranial hemorrhage) are increased. – One strategy proposed to mitigate this risk treatment paradox is the use of modified dosing of novel anticoagulants in older patients. Guidelines in both Canada and Europe suggest the use of the 110‐mg dose of dabigatran for older individuals (≥ 80 years), even in the absence of renal dysfunction. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration did not approve this dose, as it found no patient subgroup in which the benefit outweighed the risk. However, a 75‐mg twice‐daily dose was approved for individuals with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min per 1.73 m²). Our data demonstrate that for 14% of patients aged ≥ 80 years (with preserved renal function), physicians are opting for the 75‐mg twice‐daily dose, possibly to offset bleeding risk. However, the sequelae of this dosing strategy are unknown. Notably, the prescribing information for the newest anticoagulant, apixaban, provides alternative dosing for elderly patients of low weight (with or without renal function impairment), based on the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial. – While preliminary data on dabigatran have failed to show a significant increased risk of bleeding with the US dosing regimen, more detailed correlations among dose, age, and outcomes are needed to guide management.

Limitations

These data are derived from an observational cohort of patients in clinical practice participating in a voluntary registry and thus subject to the limitations inherent of such methods. Specifically, sampling and/or reporting bias may influence the results of dabigatran uptake. Data were acquired via chart review, and their accuracy is therefore dependent on completeness of initial documentation and thoroughness of subsequent abstraction. Additionally, factors associated with adoption of dabigatran cannot be interpreted as causal relationships for switching therapies, and residual measured and unmeasured confounding may account for some or all of these findings. Similarly, precise timing of dabigatran initiation, relative to interim events such as hospitalization, cannot be precisely ascertained; this also limits any causal inferences that can be made from these data. Last, the collection period of the registry overlapped with the approval of dabigatran in October 2010, thus capturing an early phase of adoption following approval. This could have a significant impact on the rate of uptake observed in our study.

Adjust interruption to 2 days and 3–4 days for dabigatran with CrCl < 50 mL/minute. Consider continuing direct oral coagulants for low-risk procedures. Consuder continuing DOACs for intermediate-risk procedures in patients with normal renal function, based on clinical condition and importance.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2023 clinical practice guidelines for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation [^114sShzU]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation surgical ablation with left atrial appendage occlusion — anticoagulation practice and evidence gaps are summarized: Similar challenges exist for the use of anticoagulation after surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion, and balancing the risk of postoperative bleeding, oral anticoagulation is often initiated early postoperatively in patients after atrial fibrillation surgery because of the endothelial damage caused during ablation. Some centers have adopted single-antiplatelet therapy with no oral anticoagulation after surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion, but regarding long-term oral anticoagulation strategy, there are no randomized or robust observational data available to guide specific recommendations. Currently, factors to consider in the decision to use oral anticoagulation or not after surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion are documented freedom from atrial fibrillation, completeness of left atrial appendage occlusion, and the patient's bleeding risk and stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score), and anticoagulation management after surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion certainly is an area in need of further research.

### What did we learn from new oral anticoagulant treatment? [^11465whT]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Orally active direct inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa have now been approved for treatment or prevention of deep vein thrombosis, and stroke associated with atrial fibrillation. The factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, has shown promising results in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome but is not yet approved for that indication. These agents share a rapid onset and are cleared with half lives of approximately 10 hours. At present there is no approved antidote for either class of anticoagulant, making the treatment of life-threatening bleeding episodes problematic. These agents have fewer drug interactions than warfarin, have a predictable clearance, and hence do not require monitoring. Patients with renal insufficiency have delayed clearance and hence may have elevated levels of the drug leading to increased risk of bleeding.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy in women — "Aspirin 75–325 mg should be used in women with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a contraindication to warfarin or at low risk of stroke (< 1%/y) or CHADS2 score of < 2 (Class I; Level of Evidence A)". For others, "warfarin should be used to maintain the INR at 2.0 to 3.0 unless they are considered to be at low risk for stroke (< 1%/y or high risk of bleeding) (Class I; Level of Evidence A)". As an alternative, "Dabigatran is useful as an alternative to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with paroxysmal to permanent AF and risk factors for stroke or systemic embolization who do not have a prosthetic heart valve or hemodynamically significant valve disease, severe renal failure (creatinine clearance 15 mL/min), or advanced liver disease (impaired baseline clotting function) (Class I; Level of Evidence B)".

Results

Patient characteristics

Of the 18 201 patients enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial, 5471 (30%) were < 65 years of age, 7052 (39%) were 65 to < 75 years of age, and 5678 (31%) were ≥ 75 years of age. The youngest patient was 19 years old and the oldest patient 100 years old. A total of 2436 patients were ≥ 80 years of age (13% of the total population); 2352 octagenarians and 84 nonagenarians. Baseline characteristics of patients according to age category are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics according to age category

Patients 75 years or older of age were more likely to be female, have prior stroke, prior bleeding, or impaired renal function, but less likely to have a history of congestive heart failure or diabetes. CHADS 2 score was ≥ 3 in 20.1% of patients aged < 65 years vs. 48.5% of patients ≥ 75 years. A HAS-BLED score of ≥ 3 was found in only 5.3% of patients < 65 years of age, compared with 27.9% of patients 65–74 years and 33.7% of patients ≥ 75 of age. A reduced dose of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or placebo was administered in 19 patients < 65 years of age, 22 patients 65–74 years, and in 790 patients ≥ 75 years of age (13.9% of patients ≥ 75 years). Most of these patients were ≥ 80 years of age (n = 766, 31% of patients ≥ 80 years).

In patients receiving warfarin, the median TTR was lower in the younger compared with the older patient group [64.8% (50.1, 75.1) for age < 65 and 67.2% (53.7, 77.4) for age ≥ 75; P < 0.0001]; however, the numerical difference was small (< 3%). Excluding patients who died, more elderly patients discontinued study drug before the end of the study [1067 (20.2%) of 5290 patients < 65 years, 1483 (21.8%) of 6792 patients aged 65–74 years, and 1496 (27.9%) of 5361 patients ≥ 75 years of age; P < 0.0001].

### Left atrial appendage closure: a therapy uniquely suited for specific populations of patients with atrial fibrillation [^112R7s2j]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia and confers a fivefold increased risk for stroke. Cardioembolic stroke secondary to AF is a devastating event, but is largely preventable with appropriate oral anticoagulation (OAC). The PROTECT and PREVAIL trials demonstrated that the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) device in combination with short-term warfarin therapy is noninferior to long-term warfarin with respect to a composite endpoint of stroke, cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism. Importantly, the WATCHMAN confers a significant reduction in life-threatening bleeding compared to OAC. Although direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) are superior to warfarin in eligible patients, several important AF populations exist in whom left atrial appendage (LAA) closure may be preferable to DOAC. Populations warranting strong consideration of LAAC include patients with contraindications to DOAC, end-stage renal disease, prior intracranial hemorrhage, recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, and patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement or left atrial electrical isolation. Device-related thrombosis is an important complication of LAAC, and DOAC may be preferential to warfarin for prevention and treatment of this complication remains unexplored. Prospective clinical trials comparing DOAC to LAAC in these unique populations are either ongoing or needed.

Post-LAAO Medication

Discharge medication regimens were heterogenous, with the commonest being NOAC monotherapy, followed by a NOAC plus aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor, OAC monotherapy, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT, and finally OAC plus aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor (Figure, A). Details of medication after LAAO are presented in eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement. Postprocedural adherence rates to antithrombotic medication according to the ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AFwere 6.2% and the Chinese Society of Cardiology (CSC) expert consensus on LAA closure (eTable 3 in the Supplement)were 39.0% (Figure, B). Participants with a HAS-BLED score of at least 3 who were adherent with post-LAAO medication recommendations from the CSC expert consensus had a lower rate of death, stroke, systemic embolism, and any life-threatening or major bleeding, compared with those who were nonadherent (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.21; 95% CI, 1.02–4.77; p = 0.045) at 30 days (eTable 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement).

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115R9nNX]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — agents and scope state that although several VKAs are available, the guideline refers to warfarin when the term VKA is used because most evidence has assessed warfarin-treated patients, with few or no studies involving other VKAs. DOACs in clinical use comprise the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, and the factor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor dabigatran; because these drugs differ in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, recommendations that are specific for each DOAC will be made whenever possible, and where appropriate, recommendations will be made for DOACs collectively.

### Persistent left atrial appendage thrombus in atrial fibrillation despite anticoagulation [^1119PrFP]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Assess the characteristics and management of patients with LAA thrombus despite compliance with oral anticoagulation (OAC).

Background

Atrial fibrillation guidelines consider 4 weeks of uninterrupted OAC sufficient to avoid transesophageal echocardiography to rule out left atrial appendage thrombus. However, some patients may exhibit persistent thrombus despite compliance with OAC.

Methods

Clinical history, management, and outcomes were reviewed for patients with LAA thrombus on preprocedural TEE presenting for an AF related procedure between 2021 and 2024.

Results

Sixty-five (1.8%) of 3653 preprocedural TEEs exhibited LAA thrombus. OAC compliance of at least 4 week was documented in 39 (60%) of these patients, including Apixaban 64%, Rivaroxaban 23%, Warfarin 8%, Dabigatran 5%. Two of these patients (3%) experienced an embolic event and 8 (12%) died during the follow up period. Resolution of LAA thrombus was documented in 12/32 patients, 6 who switched to Dabigatran, 2 to Eliquis, 1 to Warfarin, and 3 remained on Eliquis. LAA-occlusion was successfully performed in seven patients with persistent LAA thrombus. CHADS-VASc 3 or greater, HFrEF, or valvular AF were present in 37/39 of these patients.

Conclusion

For 3653 patients who underwent Preprocedural TEE, 39 exhibited LAA thrombus despite compliance with OAC. Switching OAC or maintaining the same agent for longer period of time resolved the thrombus in 31% of cases. LAA-O was effective in cases where the thrombus did not resolve. Patients with non-valvular AF, compliance with OAC > 4 weeks, CHADS-VASc ≤ 2, and normal EF exhibited the lowest probability for not having a thrombus on TEE.

### Late-onset device related thrombosis after left atrial appendage occlusion and spleen systemic embolism: a case report [^114R1QVC]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Device-related thrombosis (DRT) is a rare but serious complication following left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO). A 58-year-old woman with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF), multiple comorbidities, and a history of transient ischemic attack despite anticoagulation underwent LAAO in December 2023. Initially prescribed oral anticoagulants, she discontinued them due to side effects and switched to single antiplatelet therapy. Nearly 1-year postprocedure, a thrombus was detected on the LAAO device. Despite heparin infusion, she developed systemic embolism, resulting in splenic infarction and subsequent splenectomy. She was discharged on warfarin, but a persistent thrombus was noted on a 1-month transesophageal echocardiogram, necessitating continued warfarin therapy and serial follow-ups. The prediction, detection, and management of DRT remain challenging and uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence-based protocols. Balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks, especially in frail patients, is complex. While LAAO is an effective stroke prevention strategy for AF patients, the risks of DRT should not be overlooked. Further research is essential to refine DRT management protocols.

### Bleeding with direct oral anticoagulants vs warfarin: clinical experience [^113UhHb8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The risk of bleeding in the setting of anticoagulant therapy continues to be re-evaluated following the introduction of a new generation of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Interruption of DOAC therapy and supportive care may be sufficient for the management of patients who present with mild or moderate bleeding, but in those with life-threatening bleeding, a specific reversal agent is desirable. We review the phase 3 clinical studies of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, in the context of bleeding risk and management.

We present the case of an 85-year-old female patient with a weight of 88 kg and a height of 165 cm who was admitted to our emergency department following a rapidly progressing atraumatic swelling of her lower left leg. One month prior to this event, a renal function monitored therapeutic anticoagulation with Enoxaparin sodium 80 mg/0.8 mL (Clexane®, ﻿Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) was initiated due to persistent atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 ml/min at the time of therapeutic anticoagulation initiation). Unfortunately, baseline CHA₂DS₂-VASc- and HAS-BLED scores were not provided at the initial hospital admission.

### New avenues for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^112iAzci]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were, until recently, the only option for chronic anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. Three new oral anticoagulants have been tested for this indication in recent randomized trials: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. They offer the promise of consistent effect without the need for monitoring drug levels. Overall, efficacy and safety appear to be noninferior, and in some instances superior, to warfarin. However, the new drugs have their downsides, and switching from warfarin is not recommended for all patients. This review focuses on the available evidence and attempts to provide guidance to clinicians in the field.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Table 4 — anticoagulation dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) details direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regimens with renal considerations. Apixaban initial treatment is 10 mg orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg orally twice daily, and after ≥ 6 months of initial therapy either 5 mg orally twice daily or 2.5 mg orally twice daily can be considered. Rivaroxaban initial treatment is 15 mg orally twice daily with food for the first 21 days followed by 20 mg orally once daily with food, and after ≥ 6 months either 20 mg orally daily with food or 10 mg orally daily with or without food can be considered; avoid use in patients with a CrCl of < 15 mL/min. Dabigatran is dosed 150 mg orally twice daily when preceded by 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, and patients with severe renal impairment (a CrCl of ≤ 30 mL/min) and those receiving hemodialysis were not enrolled, with no dosing recommendations in that population. Edoxaban is 60 mg orally once daily when preceded by at least 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, with dose reduction to 30 mg once daily for patients with a CrCl 15–50 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg. In cancer-associated VTE, dalteparin is 200 units/kg subcutaneously once daily for 1 month then 150 IU/kg once daily for months 2–6; enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily subcutaneously, with dose reduction to 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily for patients with a CrCl of < 30 mL/min.

### Treatment strategies of the thromboembolic risk in kidney failure patients with atrial fibrillation [^115vCZTf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients affected by kidney failure, i.e.g.lomerular filtration rate < 15 ml/min/1.73 m², is high and probably underestimated. Numerous uncertainties remain regarding how to prevent thromboembolic events in this population because both cardiology and nephrology guidelines do not provide clear recommendations. The efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC) in preventing thromboembolism in patients with kidney failure and AF has not been demonstrated for either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct anticoagulants (DOACs). Moreover, it remains unclear which is more effective and safer, because estimated creatinine clearance < 25–30 ml/min was an exclusion criterion in the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Three RCTs comparing DOACs and VKAs in kidney failure failed to reach the primary endpoint, as they were underpowered. The left atrial appendage is the main source of thromboembolism in the presence of AF. Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has recently been proposed as an alternative to OAC. RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of LAAC versus OAC in kidney failure were terminated prematurely due to recruitment failure. A recent prospective study showed a reduction in thromboembolic events in haemodialysis patients with AF and undergoing LAAC compared with patients taking or not taking OAC. We review current treatment standards and discuss recent developments in managing the thromboembolic risk in kidney failure patients with AF. The importance of shared decision-making with the multidisciplinary team and the patient to consider individual risks and benefits of each treatment option is underlined.

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation — synopsis and supportive text — states that prevention "is important in patients with AF to maximize survival, health, and QOL", and therapy selection "should be guided by the patient's risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and individual preferences". Decisions "should" be based on stroke risk "regardless of the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent)" and "should be periodically reassessed since a patient's risk, eligibility, and preferences can change over time". Supportive text adds that although risk is higher with more persistent AF, therapy "should be based on the risk of stroke and not the pattern of AF", and that "Treatment effects with oral anticoagulation are consistent across AF patterns". Ongoing follow-up is emphasized: "Typically, periodic assessment should be performed once a year but might need to be performed more frequently" with clinical changes such as "reduction in renal function or development of additional risk factors".

New oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation — dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are described as advances over warfarin due to more predictable pharmacological profiles, fewer drug–drug interactions, absence of dietary effects, and less risk of intracranial bleeding; they have rapid onset and offset so bridging at initiation is not needed, adherence is critical since missing even 1 dose could leave a period without protection, and the FDA issued black box warnings that discontinuation can increase thromboembolism risk and coverage with another anticoagulant may be needed; reversal agents are noted as not available, dose adjustments may be warranted in chronic kidney disease or body weight extremes, and these agents do not require regular monitoring of INR or activated partial thromboplastin time.

Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion (S-LAAO) during cardiac surgery — LAAOS III randomized outcomes show that LAAOS III was performed with 4770 patients with AF and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2, oral anticoagulation was continued postoperatively, and after a mean follow-up of 3.8 years the primary endpoint of stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 4.8% of the S-LAAO group and 7.0% of the no S-LAAO group (HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.53–0.85]; P = 0.001). More than 75% of subjects in both groups received OAC, and at hospital discharge > 80% were receiving OAC with > 75% on OAC at the 3-year visit. The mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 4.2 and surgical AF ablation was performed in one-third of both groups, and a subsequent meta-analysis of 5 RCTs and 22 observational studies including 54011 patients showed a significant decrease in stroke and thromboembolism with S-LAAO. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients without AF or patients who are not candidates for oral anticoagulation.

2014 ACC/AHA/HRS guideline excerpts for atrial fibrillation emphasize that nonvalvular atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke 5 times and AF with mitral stenosis increases risk 20 times versus sinus rhythm, that ischemic stroke risk stratification uses CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc with CHA₂DS₂-VASc offering a broader score range (0 to 9) including additional factors (female sex, 65 to 74 years of age, and vascular disease), and that antithrombotic therapy should be individualized and based on thromboembolism risk irrespective of AF pattern; recommendations include using the CHA2DS2-VASc score in nonvalvular AF, using warfarin for mechanical heart valves with target international normalized ratio (INR) intensity (2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5), and in nonvalvular AF with prior stroke, TIA, or a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater, oral anticoagulants are recommended with options including warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban.

### Left atrial appendage occlusion in patients with atrial fibrillation and previous major gastrointestinal bleeding (from the amplatzer cardiac plug multicenter registry) [^117A1zRH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

History of major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding may represent a frequent clinical indication for left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). This study aims to investigate the procedural safety and long-term outcome of patients with previous major GI bleeding (MGIB) who underwent LAAO. Data from the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug multicenter registry on 1,047 patients were analyzed. Patients with previous MGIB as indication for LAAO were compared with patients without previous MGIB. A total of 151 patients (14.4%) with previous MGIB were identified. Periprocedural major bleeding events were more frequent in patients with previous MGIB (4.0% vs 0.8%, p = 0.001). With an average follow-up of 1.3 years, the observed annual rate of stroke/transient ischemic attack and major bleeding for patients with previous MGIB were 2.1% (61.4% relative reduction according to the Congestive Heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 (doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (doubled), Vascular disease, Age 65–74, and Sex (female) [CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc] score) and 4.6% (20.1% relative reduction according to the expected rate based on the Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function (1 point each), Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly (> 65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly (1 point each) [HAS-BLED] score), respectively. In conclusion, in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and previous MGIB, LAAO was associated with a low annual rate of stroke/transient ischemic attack. Periprocedural major bleeding events were more frequent in this specific population although the annual major bleeding rate showed a 20.1% relative risk reduction according to the HAS-BLED score.

In addition, careful monitoring and dose adjustments should be considered in those patient populations that were less likely to be included in the phase III trial populations, that is, subjects 65 years or older and those with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min resulting from chronic or acute kidney disease. TSOAs are contraindicated in patients with end‐stage chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis. Dose reduction is required for those with severe renal insufficiency, that is, creatinine clearance 15 to 30 mL/min on dabigatran or creatinine clearance 15 to 50 mL/min on rivaroxaban. The presence of ≥ 2 of the following mandate the reduced dose of 2.5 mg twice daily for apixaban: aged ≥ 80 years, weight < 60 kg, or creatinine level of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL. Regular monitoring of kidney function at least once per year is recommended for patients on these drugs. More frequent monitoring is prudent for certain populations at risk for a decline in kidney function. –

Although concern has been raised about excessive thrombotic risk with cessation of these agents, there is no evidence to support a drug‐specific rebound phenomenon. As with warfarin, periods off of drug should be minimized to the extent that is safely possible given the underlying hypercoagulable states present with AF and VTE.

Stroke-risk thresholds for anticoagulation and DOAC use — modeling and trial populations: A Markov state transition decision model concluded that anticoagulation was preferred for a stroke rate of 1.7%, and a stroke and systemic embolism risk threshold of 2% is likely to yield a benefit that far exceeds risk. With DOACs demonstrating improved safety compared with warfarin, it is appropriate to designate a lower stroke risk threshold if a DOAC is utilized; in dabigatran and apixaban trials about one-third of patients had a CHADS2 score of 0 or 1, which likely corresponds to an estimated annual stroke risk of about 1%.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Clinical scenario 3 — patient with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) being considered for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) summarizes that the standard therapy for acute VTE is anticoagulation, and current guidelines give preference to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) over a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for non-cancer-associated VTE while low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or a DOAC (rather than a VKA) are recommended for cancer-associated VTE. Venous thromboembolism provoked by a transient risk factor can generally be treated for 3 months, whereas unprovoked VTE may be treated indefinitely, and in patients on indefinite anticoagulation reduced-intensity options include rivaroxaban 10 mg daily and apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. In patients with unprovoked VTE who stop anticoagulation after a minimum of 3 months, aspirin is an option for secondary prevention, although it is not as effective as anticoagulation, and in patients receiving PCI while on an OAC for VTE, triple therapy is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding.

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including apixaban tablets, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from apixaban tablets to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If apixaban tablets is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Evaluating real-world clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation patients receiving the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure technology: final 2-year outcome data of the EWOLUTION trial focusing on history of stroke and hemorrhage [^116kFGe3]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Left atrial appendage occlusion with WATCHMAN has emerged as viable alternative to vitamin K antagonists in randomized controlled trials. Evaluating real-life clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation patients receiving the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure technology was designed to collect prospective multicenter outcomes of thromboembolic events, bleeding, and mortality for patients implanted with a WATCHMAN in routine daily practice.

Methods

One thousand twenty patients with a WATCHMAN implant procedure were prospectively followed in 47 centers. Left atrial appendage occlusion indication was based on the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Follow-up and imaging were performed per local practice up to a median follow-up of 2 years.

Results

Included population was old (age 73.4 ± 8.9 years), at high risk for stroke (311 prior ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack and 153 prior hemorrhagic stroke) and bleeding (318 prior major bleeding), with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 5 in 49%, hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly ≥ 3 in 40% and oral anticoagulation contraindication in 72%. During follow-up, 161 patients (16.4%) died, 22 strokes were observed (1.3/100 patient-years, 83% reduction versus historic data), and 47 major nonprocedural bleeding events (2.7/100 patient-years, 46% reduction versus historic data). Stroke and bleeding rates were consistently lower than historic data in those with prior ischemic (-76% and -41%) or hemorrhagic (-81% and 67%) stroke and prior bleeding (-85% and -30%). Lowest bleeding rates were seen in patients with early discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients with early discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy showed lower bleeding rates, while they were highest for those with prior bleeding. Device thrombus was observed in 34 patients (4.1%) and was not correlated to drug regimen during follow-up (P = 0.28).

Conclusions

During the complete 2-year follow-up of Evaluating Real-Life Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Receiving the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology, patients with a WATCHMAN left atrial appendage occlusion device had consistently low rates of stroke and nonprocedural bleeding, although most were contraindicated to oral anticoagulation and used only single antiplatelet therapy or nothing.

### Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion discrepancy between randomised trials and clinical practice [^112TvBnb]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomised data

Three non-inferiority randomised trials have been completed where LAAO has been compared to anticoagulation with warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC).

PROTECT-AF was a multicentre, randomised (2:1) study, which included 707 patients with nonvalvular AF and at least one additional stroke risk factor to either LAAO with a Watchman device or warfarin. At a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, the composite endpoint including stroke, systemic embolism and cardiovascular/unexplained death met the non-inferiority margin. However, almost 20% of the patients in the warfarin group withdrew from the study during follow-up.

In the FDA-mandated PREVAIL trial, 407 patients with CHADS₂ score ≥ 2 or 1 and another risk factor were randomised to LAAO with a Watchman device or Warfarin. In this study, LAAO did not meet noninferiority for its first co-primary endpoint of stroke, systemic embolism or cardiovascular death/unexplained death due to more than twice as many ischaemic strokes in the LAAO arm.

In PRAGUE-17, 415 high-risk patients with AF were randomised to LAAO or DOAC. Median follow-up was 19.9 months. The CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 4.7 and the HAS-BLED score was 3.0. The primary endpoint was a composite of safety and efficacy characteristics of both strategies: (1) stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) or TIA; (2) systemic embolism; (3) clinically significant bleeding; (4) cardiovascular death or (5) a significant periprocedural or device-related complication. Approximately one-third and nearly half of patients had a history of an embolic event and a history of bleeding, respectively. There were 47 primary outcomes (stroke, transient ischaemic attack, systemic embolism, cardiovascular death, major or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding or procedure-related/device-related complications) in the DOAC group vs 38 in the LAAC arm, resulting in a HR of 0.84 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.31), which was below the non-inferiority margin of 1.47.

Another area of uncertainty is the use of NOACs in patients whose renal function fluctuates widely over time or who are at heightened risk for acute kidney injury, such as patients with advanced heart failure. Patients with AF and a ≥ 25% relative decrease in their estimated glomerular filtration rate had a 2‐fold higher risk of ischemic stroke. 121 Acute and chronic renal dysfunction is common among individuals requiring long‐term anticoagulant therapy. 122 Patients with impaired renal function represent a distinct high‐risk group and there are limited data on what the optimal strategy of anticoagulation should be.

### The increasing impact of cerebral amyloid angiopathy: essential new insights for clinical practice [^114ZmA9d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The use of aspirin is an alternate strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation and CAA-related ICH, but has limited evidence of efficacy for atrial fibrillation-related stroke prevention. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have proven efficacy in atrial fibrillation-related stroke prevention but only half the risk of intracranial haemorrhage as warfarin, and may thus be a valuable alternative to warfarin in ICH survivors. In the only randomised comparison of a NOAC with aspirin, in patients considered unsuitable for warfarin, apixaban was more effective at preventing thrombotic events with no difference in rates of overall bleeding or intracranial bleeding. In an MRI substudy of AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid [to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment), the number of new microbleeds was also not different between patients assigned to apixaban versus aspirin. Finally, the use of devices to occlude the left atrial appendage could be considered in eligible patients with atrial fibrillation and history of ICH, although the optimal postimplantation antithrombotic strategy has not been defined in prospective studies in patients with CAA. Further randomised trials of anticoagulation after ICH are clearly needed and are underway.

The risks of antithrombotic therapies in patients with incidentally discovered lobar microbleeds, possibly representing asymptomatic CAA, have been much debatedbut with little evidence on which to base decisions. In the general population, participants with lobar microbleeds have a very low annual risk of ICH (only 0.6% over mean 4.9 years of follow-up in one study); however, the degree to which this risk would be increased by anticoagulation is uncertain. In patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, cerebral microbleeds increase the risk of both future ischaemic stroke and ICH; the absolute risk of ischaemic stroke exceeds that of ICH, but in those with more than five microbleeds (mainly treated with antiplatelet therapy) these risks seem to be finely balanced. A scientific statement from the American Heart Associationsuggests that routine guideline recommended care for atrial fibrillation should be unchanged even when lobar microbleeds are present, with a preference for NOACs when anticoagulation is indicated. MRI screening prior to initiating anticoagulation is of unknown value and unlikely to be cost-effective. Ongoing cohort studies in patients with atrial fibrillation, ischaemic stroke and MRI, treated with OAC, will provide better prospective information on microbleeds and future ICH risk in this population.

Figure 7
Factors for leak generation following percutaneous left atrial appendage closure. Patient factors such as length of atrial fibrillation or ostial anatomy, device characteristics such as deformability, and implantation technique (coaxial device implantation, oversizing) play an important role in leak generation. Special care for device selection should be taken in complex anatomies, i.e. disc-type device for oval ostium in stiff left atrial appendage (red circle) or ball-type device for irregular ostial plane (red line).

Catheter-based left atrial appendage closure in multi-morbid and frail patients

Although LAAC might be appealing for older frail and comorbid patients who have a high bleeding risk, this patient group is particularly vulnerable to peri-procedural complications and major bleeding as mirrored in the HAS-BLED score, which includes age and comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic renal or liver disease, and history of bleeding. Presently, this cohort of patients is underrepresented in clinical trials of LAAC, and demographic development will lead to an increase of this population in the future. Several studies in a real-world cohort have demonstrated an association of age, female sex, body mass index, and comorbidity level with peri-procedural and long-term outcome. Therefore, adequate patient selection is important in real-world practice. However, patients undergoing LAAC in real-world practice represent a high-risk population, with a high comorbidity burden and a high rate of adverse events at follow-up, most of them not related to the LAAC device or procedure. However, only scarce data exist about treatment futility in these patients. In a recent multicentre registry including real-world (i.e. unselected) patients, early death after LAAC occurred in every sixth patient within 1 year after LAAC. Increased risk for early death was independently associated with older age, low body mass index, impaired renal function, diabetes, and heart failure. The risk of early death reached 50% in the presence of > 3 of these risk factors. These results confirm that early death after LAAC is not related to procedural success or peri-procedural complications but to patients' characteristics and estimated lifespan. Therefore, the precarious state of many patients undergoing LAAC highlights the urgent need for better patient stratification and selection as well as dedicated prospective studies in this field.

### Outcomes and disease management in patients with atrial fibrillation ≥ 80 Years: data from a consecutive 11-year real-world registry [^115ZrL64]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, our study observed no significant differences in the predefined outcome parameters between VKA and DOAC strategies among patients aged ≥ 80 years, prompting reconsideration of the optimal OAC approach in this subgroup. Although DOAC therapy showed favorable HR profile for stroke and major bleeding events, evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of DOAC regimens in older patients with AF remains limited. The percentage of patients ≥ 75 years included in randomized clinical trials is substantially limited, ranging from 31% in ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation)to 44% in ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation). Most evidence is derived from subgroup analyses or meta‐analyses from representative randomized clinical trials. However, it is noteworthy that older patients included in randomized clinical trials tend to exhibit relatively better health profiles, fewer comorbidities, and improved physical function compared with older adults in the general population. Thus, comparing our trial in the setting of an ED with these previous studies poses challenges due to the limited representation of frail older patients in the 4 pivotal DOAC trials. These patients were often excluded because of high anticipated bleeding risks or were overlooked by physicians, leading to underrepresentation of older patients with AF in current clinical trials. Moreover, prior analyses primarily assessed frailty through comorbidities and polypharmacy, overlooking broader aspects inherent in the clinical syndrome. Our findings additionally indicate that among patients aged ≥ 80 years, both apixaban (HR, 0.67; P < 0.001) and rivaroxaban (HR, 0.54; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a lower hazard of the primary composite end point compared with patients without an oral anticoagulation. However, the direct comparison between apixaban and rivaroxaban did not show a statistically significant difference (P = 0.155), suggesting that both DOACs provide similar protective effects in this age group. This reinforces the evidence that DOACs are effective alternatives to no anticoagulation in older patients with AF, despite the known frailty and comorbid conditions that characterize this population. However, the lack of significant differences between DOAC and VKA strategies in our study suggests that specific characteristics of the older population, such as increased frailty, multiple comorbidities, and polypharmacy, may limit the relative benefit of DOACs over VKAs in this age group. These factors can influence both the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of DOACs, potentially reducing their effectiveness compared with VKAs. This highlights the need for a more personalized anticoagulation approach in patients aged ≥ 80 years, taking into consideration individual bleeding risks and overall health status.

### Use of oral anticoagulation in the management of atrial fibrillation in patients with ESRD: pro [^111JthxP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Warfarin has had a thin margin of benefit over risk for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with ESRD because of higher bleeding risks and complications of therapy. The successful use of warfarin has been dependent on the selection of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at relatively high risk of stroke and systemic embolism and lower risks of bleeding over the course of therapy. Without such selection strategies, broad use of warfarin has not proven to be beneficial to the broad population of patients with ESRD and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In a recent meta-analysis of use of warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and ESRD, warfarin had no effect on the risks of stroke (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.82; P = 0.65) or mortality (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.13; P = 0.60) but was associated with increased risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.56; P < 0.01). In pivotal trials, novel oral anticoagulants were generally at least equal to warfarin for efficacy and safety in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and mild to moderate renal impairment. Clinical data for ESRD are limited, because pivotal trials excluded such patients. Given the very high risk of stroke and systemic embolism and the early evidence of acceptable safety profiles of novel oral anticoagulants, we think that patients with ESRD should be considered for treatment with chronic anticoagulation provided that there is an acceptable bleeding profile. Apixaban is currently indicated in ESRD for this application and may be preferable to warfarin given the body of evidence for warfarin and its difficulty of use and attendant adverse events.

Atrial fibrillation with prior left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) — pericardioversion assessment and device-related thrombosis: In the subset of patients who have undergone surgical or percutaneous LAAO (pLAAO), inadequate occlusion may be seen acutely during the procedure or delayed afterward and has been associated with elevated risks for thromboembolism, and device-related thrombosis in pLAAO devices has also been associated with elevated stroke/systemic embolism. Imaging with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or cardiac computed tomography can assess adequacy of LAAO, residual leak, and device-related thrombosis. Before electrical cardioversion, device-related thrombosis was detected in 2.7% (4 of 148 patients) of patients with Watchman LAAO device in a small multicenter retrospective analysis; these 4 patients were treated with oral anticoagulation and after 6 to 8 weeks, on confirmation of thrombus resolution by repeat TEE, underwent successful electrical cardioversion.

### Apixaban vs warfarin by renal function over time… [^115DwVFL]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Importance Renal impairment confers an increased risk of stroke, bleeding, and death in patients with atrial fibrillation. Little is known about the efficacy and safety of apixaban in relation to renal function changes over time. Objectives To evaluate changes of renal function over time and their interactions with outcomes during a median of 1. 8 years of follow-up in patients with atrial fibrillation randomized to apixaban vs warfarin treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants The prospective, randomized, double-blind Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation clinical trial randomized 18 201 patients with atrial fibrillation to apixaban or warfarin. Serial creatinine measurements were available in 16 869 patients. Worsening of renal function was defined as an annual decrease in estimated glomerular filtration more than 20%.

The relations between treatment, outcomes, and renal function were investigated using Cox regression models, with renal function as a time-dependent covariate. The beneficial effects of apixaban vs warfarin on rates of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding were consistent in patients with normal or poor renal function over time and also in those with worsening renal function. Conclusions and Relevance In patients with atrial fibrillation, declining renal function was more common in elderly patients and those with cardiovascular comorbidities. Worsening renal function was associated with a higher risk of subsequent cardiovascular events and bleeding. The superior efficacy and safety of apixaban as compared with warfarin were similar in patients with normal, poor, and worsening renal function. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00412984.

Oral anticoagulation with non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists are associated with substantially reduced risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation. 1–4 Assessment of renal function in this setting is important because the risks of thromboembolic complications and. gradually decreases with aging and also might be affected by comorbidities. 9 The importance of renal function in AF has also been emphasized becuase it was observed that 1 NOAC was associated with decreased efficacy in patients with AF and high renal function as. In the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation trial, apixaban compared with warfarin was associated with reduced risk of stroke, mortality, and major bleeding.

12 Subsequent analyses showed that the subgroup of patients with impaired renal function at randomization had similar results, with a trend towards even larger relative reduction in major bleeding with apixaban compared with warfarin. 8 Our aim in this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban vs warfarin in relation to changes in renal function over time. The specific objectives were to assess the development of renal dysfunction throughout follow-up and its association with efficacy and safety outcomes, and compare apixaban vs warfarin in patients with high renal function over time and in those with worsening renal function during follow-up. Question In patients with atrial fibrillation, how is variability in renal function over time affected by treatment with apixaban or warfarin and how does the change in renal function over time influence outcomes and interact with the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation… [^114Pf2gy]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia in adults, with the prevalence increasing from less than 1 percent in persons younger than 60 years to more than 8 percent in those older than 80 years. 1 Each year in the United States, there are more than 700, 000 admissions for cardiac dysrhythmias, 2 with about one third of these resulting from atrial fibrillation. 3 The aging of the U. S. population will make this problem even more prevalent in the day-to-day practice of physicians providing primary care to adults. In this issue of American Family Physician, 4 the clinical practice guideline created by a joint panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice Center is summarized. 5 This guideline is one product of the effort of the AAFP to promote evidence-based practice.

When the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research first established the evidence-based practice centers and solicited topics for examination, the AAFP recommended an evidence review of the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation. AAFP members and staff served as consultants to the Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice Center at the time. The Center's report on atrial fibrillation served as the foundation for the collaborative efforts of the ACP and the AAFP in the production of this guideline. This is the first guideline specifically created by a joint review and synthesis of the literature by these organizations, and it was clear during the process that they share the goal of promoting evidence-based, patient-centered practice. It is hoped that this will be the first of many collaborative efforts. The evidence reviewed supports a straightforward approach to management for most patients with atrial fibrillation.

The central question facing physicians is whether to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, or to control heart rate and prevent stroke. Rhythm control is not superior to the combination of rate control and chronic anticoagulation in reducing morbidity and mortality, and rhythm control may be associated with higher mortality rates in some patient subgroups. Rate control and prevention of stroke are the mainstays of atrial fibrillation management. Rate control is best accomplished with atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, or verapamil. Prevention of stroke requires adjusted-dose warfarin unless the patient has a very low risk of stroke or a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin. As physicians, we tend to consider "soft" contraindications, such as risk of falling. Results from studies using adjusted-dose warfarin clearly show that the benefits generally outweigh the harms, so we must be cautious when avoiding warfarin in the context of relative or theoretical contraindications.

We need to balance the theoretical, even unproven, risk of some adverse complication of anticoagulation with the proven benefit of stroke prevention. This guideline provides an outline for the care of the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Care will be straightforward for most of these patients and can be accomplished in the office of the family physician.

### Anticoagulation in frail patients with atrial fibrillation… [^117EucWo]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

With the increasing age and complexity of patients with atrial fibrillation, the role of frailty as a key driver of challenging management and poor prognosis has been increasingly acknowledged. Frailty is a clinical syndrome, defined by reduced physiological reserve and higher susceptibility to stressors, which bolsters the risk of adverse outcomes1; in clinical practice, frailty is entwined with aging and multimorbidity, thus entailing the so-called clinical complexity that often complicates management and prognosis in patients with AF. Current estimates suggest that up to 40% of patients with AF are frail, and previous studies have shown an overall suboptimal use of oral anticoagulant in these individuals. 1 Nonetheless, limited data are available on OACs in patients with AF who are frail, particularly regarding comparisons among.

different OACs: a 2022 Korean nationwide study showed an overall lower risk of adverse outcomes in patients treated with direct OAC compared with warfarin in patients with AF who are frail, 2 while an analysis of Medicare data found that apixaban was associated with lower rates of adverse events compared with warfarin among patients who are frail. 3 Notwithstanding this previous evidence, more data, particularly on comparisons among different DOACs, are still needed. This study by Lin and colleagues4 analyzed Medicare beneficiaries data to compare patients aged 65 years and older with AF who were treated with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin across frailty status.

After propensity score overlap weighting, Lin et al4 analyzed the association of OACs with different outcomes, including a composite clinical end point of death, thromboembolic events, and major bleeding; health care costs; and the risk of more than 14 days of home time lost, where home time was defined as the number of days in which patients were alive and not in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. During a 1-year follow-up, Lin et al4 found that apixaban was associated with a lower rate of the clinical composite end point and a lower risk of home time lost compared with rivaroxaban and warfarin; these reductions were greater in patients with AF who were frail compared with patients who were not frail. Apixaban was also associated with lower health care costs compared with rivaroxaban; conversely, lower total costs were observed with warfarin, although different results were observed when excluding the OAC cost.

These results expand previous observations and have important clinical implications. Indeed, different from previous studies, Lin et al4 focused not only on clinical end points but also on the impact of OAC choice on health care costs and, more importantly, on a patient-centered outcome that has clear relevance for both patients and their families. The results presented by Lin et al4 are relevant also considering the strong impact of frailty in determining the risk of rehospitalization and nonhome discharge. 5 Indeed, the findings of the study by Lin et al4 provide a head-to-head comparison among apixaban, rivaroxaban and warfarin in.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation… [^115Q6CVj]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac disorder causing stroke and systemic emboli. Atrial fibrillation affects approximately 4 percent of adults in the United States. Because its incidence increases with age, the risk of this disorder will increase as the U. S. population ages. An important aspect of treating atrial fibrillation is preventing systemic emboli and stroke. Nademanee and Kosar summarized the findings of five published studies that examined various treatments of atrial fibrillation, including the use of long-term antithrombotic medications alone, aspirin alone and combination therapy. Patients with atrial fibrillation typically have thrombi in the left atrial appendage that are most likely caused by circulatory stasis. These thrombi can then embolize. Patients with structural heart disease or other risk factors are at much greater risk for emboli.

Identification of the optimal treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation has generated much debate. Treatment with warfarin alone has been shown to decrease embolic vascular complications and stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In fact, the benefits of warfarin appear to increase when the International Normalized Ratio was 2 to 3 in patients with a history of stroke. Aspirin appears to be effective in treating nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in patients younger than 65 years who have no risk factors. However, warfarin remains the treatment of choice in most patients, particularly those who have had a previous transient ischemic attack or a minor stroke. Combination therapy using low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin and aspirin is less effective than adjusted-dose warfarin, especially in patients with high-risk factors.

The authors conclude that the data from these five studies establish the following parameters: the risk of stroke is very high in patients older than 75 years who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and in patients who have other high-risk factors; warfarin is more effective than aspirin in preventing ischemic stroke and systemic emboli; aspirin is effective in younger patients who do not have any other risk factors; and the optimal intensity of warfarin has been established as an INR of 2 to 3. The authors endorse the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on anti-thrombolytic therapy. First, patients younger than 65 years of age with no other risk factors should take aspirin.

However, the presence of even one risk factor in patients in this group warrants the use of warfarin. Second, patients between 65 and 75 years with no risk factors may be treated with either aspirin or warfarin. If one or more risk factors are present, the patient should be treated with warfarin. Third, all patients over 75 years of age should be treated with warfarin. An accompanying symposium between the author of this article and other physicians illustrates the many concerns surrounding the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of any patient with atrial fibrillation is supported by only one study, and many experts doubt the validity of the results. Another question concerns the duration of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Must it be continued for life even if the patient is accurately able to determine the presence or absence of fibrillation.
