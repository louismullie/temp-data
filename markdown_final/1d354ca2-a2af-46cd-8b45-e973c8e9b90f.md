## Question

What can cause edema in hepatic vein

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause edema in the hepatic vein. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise anatomy and whether "edema in the hepatic vein" refers to venous wall edema versus hepatic parenchymal edema from venous congestion. Then, I should verify the major pathophysiologic categories that raise hepatic venous pressure and lead to edema. Next, I will enumerate specific etiologies within each category, including thrombotic, compressive, cardiac, and sinusoidal-level causes. After that, I should review the imaging signatures that help distinguish these entities. Finally, I will consider management principles and highlight key differentiators that guide therapy, making sure I double-check areas where confusion commonly occurs, such as Budd-Chiari versus sinusoidal obstruction syndrome versus congestive hepatopathy.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question. "Edema in the hepatic vein" is most clinically meaningful when interpreted as edema of the liver parenchyma due to raised hepatic venous pressure, rather than edema of the venous wall itself, which is rarely isolated or clinically emphasized; the pathophysiology is increased sinusoidal hydrostatic pressure from impaired hepatic venous outflow, leading to perisinusoidal and centrilobular edema and congestion, with downstream effects including ascites and peripheral edema when severe [^117VQ2WS] [^112UMUww].

> I will now examine the major etiologic buckets. Hold on, let me verify the canonical framework: hepatic venous outflow obstruction spans thrombotic or intrinsic venous disease, extrinsic compression, cardiac causes of elevated right-sided pressures, and sinusoidal-level microvascular injury that mimics venous outflow obstruction; this categorization aligns with contemporary reviews and guidelines and will anchor the differential [^117VQ2WS] [^114GzgTa] [^116epmK1].

> Next, I should review thrombotic and intrinsic venous causes. Budd-Chiari syndrome from hepatic vein and/or IVC thrombosis is a leading cause, often linked to myeloproliferative neoplasms, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, factor V Leiden, antiphospholipid syndrome, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives; I need to ensure I include nonthrombotic luminal narrowing such as webs or membranes, which are more prevalent in some regions, and remember that tumor thrombus from HCC can invade and occlude hepatic veins, producing the same congestive physiology [^117VQ2WS] [^114GzgTa] [^113A22kz].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction from sinusoidal obstruction syndrome because it's easy to conflate them. SOS (formerly VOD) reflects toxic endothelial injury to sinusoids and terminal hepatic venules rather than large-vein thrombosis; it classically follows myeloablative conditioning for HSCT or certain chemotherapies and targeted agents, and while it produces centrilobular congestion and edema, the imaging and management differ from classic BCS, so I should keep that separate even though the clinical end result looks similar [^116epmK1] [^117WvNhm] [^114H7zMt].

> I will now consider extrinsic compression. Large hepatic or adrenal tumors, cysts, and lymphadenopathy can compress hepatic veins or the IVC, and post-transplant surgical factors such as kinking or stricture at the cavohepatic junction can cause outflow obstruction; I should double-check that transplant guidance indeed flags late-onset ascites or edema as a potential sign of IVC or portal venous stenosis, which it does [^113PRtQv] [^111dnRfB].

> Let me think about cardiac and pulmonary vascular causes next. Elevated right atrial pressure from right heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, constrictive pericarditis, or pulmonary hypertension is transmitted retrogradely into the hepatic veins, producing passive hepatic congestion; I need to ensure I note that this congestive hepatopathy can progress to fibrosis if chronic, and that central venous pressure elevation correlates with renal and hepatic dysfunction in heart failure cohorts [^112UMUww] [^1148KFCJ] [^113fz3Eg].

> But wait, what if the "edema" is actually periportal or gallbladder wall edema rather than hepatic parenchymal edema. In SOS and other congestive states, periportal edema and gallbladder wall thickening are common secondary signs of portal hypertension and impaired venous drainage; I should confirm that these are recognized imaging markers in pediatric and adult SOS literature, which they are, and remember that portal vein flow abnormalities and collaterals can accompany these findings [^113EBw5H] [^114H7zMt] [^113duNzp].

> Next, I should review the imaging signatures that help distinguish these entities. In BCS, Doppler ultrasound, CT, or MRI typically shows absent or narrowed hepatic veins, sometimes with thrombus, and a characteristic peripheral hypoperfusion pattern with relative caudate sparing due to its independent drainage; indirect signs include intrahepatic collaterals and ascites, and I should confirm that guidelines endorse imaging-based diagnosis of obstruction or collaterals for BCS, which they do [^114GzgTa] [^112sF17T] [^115aoJVF].

> Hold on, I should verify the SOS imaging pattern so I don't overcall BCS. In SOS, ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging often show heterogeneous patchy enhancement, periportal edema, gallbladder wall edema, and Doppler evidence of damped or reversed portal venous flow in advanced cases; elastography may show elevated stiffness from congestion that can mimic fibrosis, and I need to remember that elastography confounders from inflow/outflow abnormalities can falsely elevate fibrosis estimates [^114H7zMt] [^113EBw5H] [^112shmME].

> I need to check the congestive hepatopathy appearance as well. CT and MRI in cardiac congestion show dilated IVC and hepatic veins with early retrograde venous opacification and a peripheral heterogeneous enhancement pattern; in chronic disease, hyperenhancing regenerative nodules and fibrosis may develop, and MR elastography can help quantify fibrosis burden, though stiffness from congestion alone can confound interpretation [^114cf79m] [^112UMUww].

> Let me reconsider transplant-related outflow issues because they are a distinct, actionable subset. After liver transplantation, hepatic venous or IVC outflow stenosis or thrombosis occurs in a minority but presents with ascites, hepatomegaly, renal dysfunction, and lower extremity edema; Doppler ultrasound, CTV, or MRV are first-line, and endovascular angioplasty or stenting with anticoagulation is often effective, with surgical revision reserved for failures [^113PRtQv].

> Next, I should review management principles and make sure I align them with the underlying cause. For BCS, prompt anticoagulation, evaluation for thrombophilia, and restoration of outflow via angioplasty, stenting, TIPS, or transplant are cornerstone strategies; for SOS, defibrotide is the only approved therapy in moderate-to-severe disease, with supportive care and avoidance of agents with SOS risk; for congestive hepatopathy, the priority is to treat right-sided heart disease and decongest the liver with diuretics while optimizing hemodynamics; for compressive lesions, definitive oncologic or surgical therapy and, when appropriate, endovascular stenting can relieve obstruction and edema [^112kyUBE] [^117WvNhm] [^112UMUww] [^115ZXr4G].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "edema in the hepatic vein" could mean a swollen venous wall, but I should double-check whether that is a recognized entity; on review, the clinically relevant construct is parenchymal edema from impaired hepatic venous outflow rather than primary venous wall edema, so the correct approach is to identify the level and mechanism of outflow obstruction and treat accordingly rather than searching for venous wall edema per se [^117VQ2WS] [^114GzgTa] [^112UMUww].

> In summary, I need to ensure the differential remains organized: thrombotic or intrinsic venous disease such as BCS and tumor thrombus, extrinsic compression from tumors or post-transplant kinking, cardiac causes of passive congestion, and sinusoidal-level injury from SOS are the principal categories that explain "edema in the hepatic vein" as hepatic parenchymal edema from venous congestion; imaging patterns and clinical context distinguish these, and targeted therapy hinges on reversing the specific outflow impediment while providing supportive care for congestion and its complications [^117VQ2WS] [^114GzgTa] [^116epmK1].

Edema in the hepatic vein is most often due to **Budd-Chiari syndrome** (hepatic vein thrombosis) [^117VQ2WS] from hypercoagulable states, malignancy, or trauma [^113fHxoc], and **congestive hepatopathy** from right heart failure or constrictive pericarditis [^112UMUww]. Other causes include **sinusoidal obstruction syndrome** (post-HSCT/chemotherapy) [^117WvNhm], IVC obstruction [^111WBZvp], and hepatic vein stenosis/thrombosis after liver transplantation [^113PRtQv]. Diagnosis relies on Doppler ultrasound, CT/MRI, and sometimes transjugular biopsy [^112AfBoF] [^117DSXm3]; management includes anticoagulation, diuretics, and interventional or surgical procedures for persistent obstruction [^112kyUBE] [^112UMUww].

---

## Pathophysiology

Edema in the hepatic vein reflects **increased hydrostatic pressure** from impaired outflow, causing sinusoidal congestion, hepatocyte hypoxia, and interstitial fluid accumulation [^114GzgTa]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Mechanical obstruction**: Thrombosis, stenosis, or external compression of hepatic veins/IVC increases upstream pressure and edema [^117VQ2WS].
- **Cardiac causes**: Elevated right atrial pressure from right heart failure or constrictive pericarditis transmits backward into hepatic veins, causing passive congestion and edema [^112UMUww].
- **Inflammatory injury**: SOS from endothelial injury increases sinusoidal resistance and edema [^114H7zMt].

---

## Etiological classification

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Thrombotic | - Budd-Chiari syndrome (hypercoagulable states, malignancy, trauma) [^117VQ2WS] <br/> - Hepatic vein thrombosis post-liver transplantation [^113PRtQv] |
| Cardiac | - Right heart failure <br/> - Constrictive pericarditis <br/> - Tricuspid regurgitation [^112UMUww] [^112nXE2e] |
| Inflammatory | - Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (post-HSCT, chemotherapy) [^117WvNhm] |
| Compressive | - Malignant compression (HCC, RCC) [^113A22kz] <br/> - IVC obstruction (tumor, thrombus) [^111WBZvp] |
| Iatrogenic | - Hepatic vein stenosis/thrombosis after liver transplantation [^113PRtQv] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Abdominal pain**: Right upper quadrant discomfort from hepatic congestion [^1162oFES].
- **Hepatomegaly**: Enlarged, tender liver from congestion [^112UMUww].
- **Ascites**: Portal hypertension from impaired outflow [^113PRtQv].
- **Edema**: Lower extremity edema from venous hypertension [^111tew52].
- **Jaundice**: Cholestasis from hepatic congestion [^112UMUww].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging modalities

- **Doppler ultrasound**: First-line for detecting thrombosis, flow reversal, and collateral vessels [^114GzgTa].
- **CT/MRI**: Define obstruction level/extent, parenchymal changes, and collaterals [^115aoJVF].
- **Transjugular biopsy**: When diagnosis is uncertain or to assess fibrosis [^117DSXm3].

---

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests may show **elevated liver enzymes** (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) from congestion or hepatocyte injury [^114NvzTa], and **hyperbilirubinemia** reflecting cholestasis from impaired outflow [^112UMUww].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

Medical management includes **anticoagulation** for thrombotic etiologies (e.g. Budd-Chiari) [^113YQZPr] and **diuretics** for fluid management and symptom relief [^115GytUr].

---

### Interventional and surgical management

Interventional options include **angioplasty/stenting** for hepatic vein/IVC stenosis or thrombosis [^113PRtQv], **TIPS** for refractory cases with severe portal hypertension [^notfound], and **surgical shunting** (e.g. cavoatrial bypass) for extensive obstruction [^1168u7Mc].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology, severity, and timeliness of therapy**. Budd-Chiari syndrome has a 5-year survival of ~70–80% with modern management [^notfound]; SOS mortality ranges from 20–80% depending on severity [^notfound]; and congestive hepatopathy prognosis mirrors the underlying cardiac disease [^112UMUww].

---

Edema in the hepatic vein arises from increased hydrostatic pressure due to thrombotic, cardiac, inflammatory, compressive, or iatrogenic causes; **accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy** are essential to improve outcomes [^115D74yH].

Budd-Chiari syndrome

Hepatic veins are the main venous outflow tract of the liver. Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) represents the acute thrombosis of the hepatic veins and subsequent venous engorgement of the liver. Venous outflow obstruction leads to parenchymal congestion and increased sinusoidal pressure. This venous stasis leads to altered portal flow and these two factors lead to ischemic injury and subsequent parenchymal damage. BCS is a rare vascular disorder of the liver with an estimated incidence of 0.1–0.8/1,000,000 per year and a prevalence of 1.4–2.4/1,000,000 per year in the United States. The clinical symptoms may range from subtle symptoms to fulminant liver failure. Hematologic disorders and thrombotic diathesis account for 75% of all cases and several predisposing factors may also be detected in a single patient. Early diagnosis is critical for planning treatment and preventing complications.

Doppler US is typically the first imaging modality to be used in acute BCS. It can effectively detect the thrombosed hepatic veins but early depiction of venous thrombus may be difficult in patients with difficult body habitus.

CT clearly shows the obstructed hepatic veins and associating parenchymal changes (Fig. 7). Peripheral parenchymal areas are typically more edematous and congested than the central liver and demonstrate decreased contrast enhancement as compared to stronger enhancement of the central parts of the liver parenchyma (Fig. 8). The peripheral liver parenchyma usually appears hypodense on contrast-enhanced CT and hypointense on contrast-enhanced MRI in the arterial phase. This finding is related to elevated post-sinusoidal pressure. Caudate lobe may demonstrate better venous enhancement due to its unique venous drainage pattern. A "flip-flop" pattern may occur in the portal venous phase as the central part of the liver demonstrates low attenuation due to contrast wash-out and gradual increase of the peripheral attenuation.

### Treatment of edema [^115GytUr]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Edema is the result of an imbalance in the filtration system between the capillary and interstitial spaces. The kidneys play a key role in regulating extracellular fluid volume by adjusting sodium and water excretion. Major causes of edema include venous obstruction, increased capillary permeability, and increased plasma volume secondary to sodium and water retention. A systematic approach is warranted to determine the underlying diagnosis. Treatment includes sodium restriction, diuretic use, and appropriate management of the underlying disorder. Leg elevation may be helpful in some patients. Loop diuretics often are used alone or in combination. In patients with New York Heart Association class III and IV congestive heart failure, spironolactone has been found to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. In patients with cirrhosis, ascites is treated with paracentesis and spironolactone. Dihydropyridine-induced edema can be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. Lymphedema occurs when a protein-rich fluid accumulates in the interstitium. Compression garments and range-of-motion exercises may be helpful in patients with this condition.

Complications of portal hypertension after liver transplantation (LT) typically resolve rapidly, and clinical features of liver failure and portal hypertension are not usual after the first 3 months; the exception is splenomegaly, which may persist for years, and variceal hemorrhage is very unusual unless the patient has an occluded portal vein. The late emergence of hepatic encephalopathy in a patient with a functioning liver allograft suggests the development of clandestine cirrhosis or a persistent portosystemic shunt. Late-onset ascites or peripheral edema may indicate stenosis of the inferior vena cava or portal vein anastomosis, and persistent late ascites in a patient with a recurrent HCV infection is a poor prognostic sign.

Contrast-enhanced US

Recently, Trenker et al. have shown in adults undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation that there may be a role for contrast-enhanced US in detecting preclinical sinusoidal obstruction syndrome by means of hypo-enhancement of the liver parenchyma. To our knowledge, no data in children are available yet.

Most of the described US features of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome can be derived from the increased hepatic vascular inflow resistance and hepatic congestion that result from the occlusion of hepatic sinusoids and terminal hepatic venules. Portal vein flow may be increased, normal, or show decreased respiratory velocity variations or increased pulsatility, especially in the early or subclinical stage of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Also, segmental (distal) portal vein flow reversal may precede clinical manifestations. Later, flow velocity can decrease, show a to-and-fro pattern or ultimately reverse completely (Fig. 1). The latter two are, however, infrequently observed. Although a specific sign of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in the appropriate clinical context, portal vein flow reversal occurs generally too late in the disease course to affect early treatment. This is why the recent international expert position statement on sinusoidal obstruction syndrome by Mahadeo et al. stated against using reversed portal flow for diagnosis. Abnormal portal flow characteristics resolve over time with resolution of the clinical sinusoidal obstruction syndrome signs and symptoms. Gallbladder wall edema occurs because of the impaired venous drainage of the gallbladder into the right portal vein. Ascites and gallbladder wall edema were shown to be independent predictors in 70 children with clinically suspected sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Another example is the absence of the characteristic triphasic hepatic venous outflow pattern as a result of congestion-related loss of liver compliance. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the spectrum of US findings related to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in a patient with nephroblastoma and in a patient with neuroblastoma. The latter includes follow-up images and correlation with MRI.

Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) — SOS should be considered in patients in the appropriate clinical setting, typically 1–3 weeks after HSCT with right upper quadrant pain, weight gain attributable to edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites. Ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended as prophylactic therapy for SOS in all patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT; the suggested dose is 12 mg/kg divided in two doses starting the day before conditioning and continuing for 3 months after HSCT, supported by a meta-analysis showing an overall benefit (pooled relative risk, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.17–0.66). Defibrotide is the only FDA-approved treatment for SOS and is recommended for treatment of moderate-to-severe SOS; defibrotide is recommended at a dose of 25 mg/kg/d for at least 21 days and until resolution of the SOS. TIPS is unproven in SOS and cannot be recommended for this indication based on available evidence.

Follow-up

While most imaging abnormalities related to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in children resolve spontaneously, some do not. We have summarized the multi-modality imaging spectrum of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome over time in Table 3. To illustrate the course of liver abnormalities, Fig. 7 shows follow-up images in a 3-year-old girl with stage 2 nephroblastoma, intermediate risk. An intraoperative liver sample in this patient showed confluent areas of acidophilic degenerated hepatocytes in the proximity of the central hepatic veins, a finding that could be in keeping with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or chemotherapy-related toxic damage. After completing postoperative treatment with actinomycin D and vincristine, follow-up MRI and US showed enlargement of the liver and spleen with periportal edema, patchy heterogeneous liver parenchyma, minimal ascites and elevated liver stiffness — findings that could well be in keeping with experienced or ongoing mild sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, although there were no clinical signs or symptoms other than mildly elevated liver transaminases. On follow-up US imaging, all abnormalities normalized except for the heterogeneous liver parenchyma, which still persists after 2 years.

Liver fibrosis

Fibroscan testing and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, the most popular noninvasive transient elastography technologies, have been widely used to assess ongoing hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) determined by Fibroscan correspond with changes in the mechanical properties of the liver. Clinical increases in LSMs are seen in many conditions, including inflammation, fibrosis, congestion, cholestasis, and portal hypertension. The injury to sinusoidal endothelial cells inherent in SOS promotes endothelial cell embolization and sinusoidal obstruction, leading to subendothelial fibrosis of sinusoids and venules, and eventual congestive fibrosis of the liver. Thus, LSM elevations may be useful preclinical and surveillance biomarkers of SOS. Indeed, earlier data suggest a pre-transplant LSMs cut-point of 8 kPa in predicting liver toxicity after HSCT, thus supporting the implementation of quantitative SOS diagnostics. In addition, an animal experiment has indicated that liver shear-wave velocity (SWV), measured by ARFI imaging, bears a close relation to histologic scores of SOS, as well as degrees of hepatic lobular inflammation. Observed SWI outcomes were significantly higher in rats with SOS, as opposed to a matched control group. Finally, hepatic SWV has been used in some studies (with promising results) as a quantitative biomarker to evaluate the treatment responses of patients with SOS.

Signs associated with portal hypertension

Hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, a thickened gallbladder wall, and periportal edema are the chief imaging features of SOS (Fig. 2). Such manifestations are hallmarks of portal hypertension, stemming from obstructed intrahepatic venous drainage, and the events that follow (i.e. congestion of the liver and spleen, loss of liver compliance, and hepatic injury). Because many diseases are similar in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters, Erturk et al. consider narrowed hepatic veins and collateral aspects of portal hypertension to be the features distinguishing SOS from other conditions.

Hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity

Diffuse, patchy, or geographic heterogeneity of hepatic parenchyma, with a scattering of hypodense areas, is typical of SOS (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). Past studies indicate that parenchymal heterogeneity scores positively correlate with SOS clinical severity. In patients with hepatic metastases of colon cancer, the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is impacted by the existing SOS, and the severity of parenchymal heterogeneity is closely associated with a poor tumor response. Among all the heterogeneity features on enhanced CT or MRI images, cloverleaf or claw-like shapes are two classic manifestations of SOS. These manifestations refer to the markedly enhanced area around the main hepatic veins which shows increased blood supply compared to the normal liver parenchyma. The appearance of characteristic shapes perhaps related to the small vascular channels surrounding the main hepatic veins. Because the initial lesion of SOS is located in hepatic sinusoid, which makes central lobular vein and sublobular vein become the first to be involved. As the disease worsens, obvious edema and necrosis of adjacent hepatocytes lead to the decrease of hepatic parenchymal enhancement; however, the small vascular channels adjacent to the main hepatic vein are kept unobstructed and result in the increase of enhancement of the liver parenchyma adjacent to the venules. Recently, the hepatic pseudotumor of SOS has been noted after oxaliplatin treatment. Lesion of this sort is pathologically characterized by sinusoidal dilatation and congestion of hepatocytes with inflammatory cellular infiltration and areas of fibrosis. On liver imaging, pseudotumor of SOS may simulate focal nodular hyperplasia, atypical HCC, or liver metastases because of the variety of enhancement patterns due to the pathological changes in the disease progression (Fig. 5). On contrast-enhanced US, pseudotumor of SOS usually presents as an ill-defined hypoechoic lesion with a uniform and obvious hypervascularity in the arterial phase and a rapid wash-out appearance in the portal phase. On multi-phase dynamic-enhanced CT or MRI, an irregular lesion with peritumoral enhancement and central low attenuation/signal intensity is the most common manifestation of pseudotumor of SOS. For further improving differential diagnostic efficiency between pseudotumor of SOS and malignancy, a qualitative imaging modality, such as diffuse-weighted imaging (DWI) is recommended, which plays a role in the theoretical basis of the cellular density difference.

Edema differential and pathophysiology — Once lymphedema has been excluded, edema is attributed to increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased oncotic pressure. Increased hydrostatic pressure encompasses cardiac (cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, pericardial disease), cirrhosis with portal hypertension, renal failure, and other causes such as venous insufficiency, obstruction, thrombosis, pregnancy, and medications (CCB, NSAIDs, steroids), whereas decreased oncotic pressure reflects reduced protein intake (malnutrition), reduced protein production (cirrhosis), or protein loss (malabsorption, nephrotic syndrome).

### CT features of hepatic veno-occlusive disease: a meta-analysis [^116yhDNe]. Academic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objective

The computed tomography (CT) features of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) could play a role in its diagnosis. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of studies examining the CT features of HVOD.

Methods

Relevant studies published up to May 3, 2017 were searched in major electronic databases. The extracted data included the proportion of various CT features in patients with HVOD. The meta-analysis was conducted using R 3.3.3 with the "meta" package.

Results

Eleven studies were included. The studies involved 326 patients with a mean age range of 50.2–58.9 years, and the proportion of female patients ranged from 20% to 57.5%. The meta-analysis showed the pooled proportion of CT features: hepatic parenchyma with heterogeneous hypoattenuation (81.05%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 56.97%-93.25%), patchy enhancement in the portal venous phase (87.09%, 95% CI: 75.15%-93.77%) with or without a narrow or invisible hepatic vein (71.02% 95% CI: 42.09%-89.20%), gallbladder wall edema (65.51%, 95% CI: 28.98%-89.84%), and patchy heterogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase (44.36%, 95% CI: 29.98%-59.76%) with or without slightly enlarged hepatic artery (56.61%, 95% CI: 40.62%-71.33%).

Conclusion

Hepatic parenchyma with heterogeneous hypoattenuation and patchy enhancement with or without narrowing or an invisible hepatic vein in the portal venous or equilibrium phase may be the most important CT feature for diagnosing HVOD.

Computed tomography

Due to radiation exposure, CT is not the imaging modality of choice for evaluating sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in children. Signs of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome can, however, be a coincidental finding when a CT is performed for a different indication. As with US, ascites, hepatomegaly, periportal edema, gallbladder wall thickening, hepatic vein narrowing, widening of the hepatic artery and the formation of collaterals can be recognized on CT. In addition, heterogeneous hypo-attenuation of liver parenchyma and patchy enhancement have been described (Fig. 5). In a recent meta-analysis, the latter two features with or without narrowing or invisible hepatic veins in the portal equilibrium phase were shown to be the most important CT features for diagnosing sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in adults.

Computed tomography (CT) features of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. A CT scan in a 14-year-old girl (same patient as in Fig. 1c) with stage 4 neuroblastoma was performed a month after high-dose busulfan/melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. She had a history of gallstones. She presented with nausea, right upper quadrant pain and elevated C-reactive protein. a A coronal contrast-enhanced abdominal CT shows enlarged liver, periportal edema (arrow), gallbladder wall thickening (arrowhead) and ascites (asterisk). b A transverse abdominal contrast-enhanced CT shows narrowing of the hepatic veins (arrows). The thickened gallbladder wall was initially interpreted as acute cholecystitis. However, the elevated bilirubin, elevated liver transaminases in combination with liver enlargement, ascites and a recent history of busulfan/melphalan chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation were diagnostic for severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. This patient was treated conservatively at the time and recovered. She has not had symptomatic cholecystolithiasis or cholecystitis since

Regarding diagnostic procedures for hepatic veno-occlusive disease, more specifically with respect to liver biopsy, EASL 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain a transjugular liver biopsy and measurement of portal venous pressures in patients who do not meet clinical criteria of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, or when other diagnoses have to be excluded.

### A case of Budd-Chiari syndrome: Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR findings [^114UGGsZ]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare disorder caused by the obstruction of hepatic venous outflow, leading to sinusoidal congestion, ischemic injury to liver cells and portal hypertension. Long-term survival largely depends on whether hepatocellular carcinoma occurs. A recently available liver-specific contrast medium, gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA), reportedly has high diagnostic capability for detection of malignant liver tumors. However, there has been no report of the sue of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for BCS. We present a case of chronic BCS who underwent both gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Hepatic congestion and edema were seen as slightly hypointense areas on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced hepatobiliary-phase images, although these areas were observed as slightly hyperintense on previously obtained Gd-DTPA-enhanced delayed-phase image. Reduced uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA by hepatocytes in the region of congestion or edema may account for this difference, which should be recognized in image interpretations.

### Diagnostic and interventional radiology for Budd-Chiari syndrome [^115D74yH]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hepatic venous outflow obstruction that involves one or more draining hepatic veins. Its occurrence in populations in the western hemisphere is commonly associated with hypercoagulative states. Clinical manifestations in many cases are nonspecific, and imaging may be critical for early diagnosis of venous obstruction and accurate assessment of the extent of disease. If Budd-Chiari syndrome is not treated promptly and appropriately, the outcome may be dismal. Comprehensive imaging evaluations, in combination with pathologic analyses and clinical testing, are essential for determining the severity of disease, stratifying risk, selecting the appropriate therapy, and objectively assessing the response. The main goal of treatment is to alleviate hepatic congestion, thereby improving hepatocyte function and allowing resolution of portal hypertension. Various medical, endovascular, and surgical treatment options are available. Percutaneous and endovascular procedures, when performed in properly selected patients, may be more effective than medical treatment methods for preserving liver function and arresting disease progression in the long term. In addition, such procedures are associated with lower morbidity and mortality than are open surgical techniques.

Ultrasonography

Ultrasonography allows for the examination of the liver and abdomen in several ways, including conventional high-resolution B-mode, color Doppler and spectral Doppler studies, elastography and contrast-enhanced US.

B-mode and Doppler US

In the literature, conventional (B-mode) US characteristics of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome include hepato(spleno)megaly, ascites, periportal and gallbladder wall edema, increased width of the portal vein, and indistinct borders or narrowing of hepatic veins. Doppler-mode characteristics include portal vein flow demodulation, decreased flow velocity or reversal of portal vein flow, decreased spectral density, increased resistive index and peak systolic velocity of the hepatic artery, congestion index, monophasic reduced flow in the hepatic veins, and visualization of collateral veins (e.g. in the paraumbilical veins). These characteristics are summarized in Table 2. For the Doppler examination, a right intercostal approach is preferred because the Doppler angles for performing velocity measurements and evaluation of flow are optimal. Furthermore, the liver can also be evaluated at the parenchymal segmental level without exercising probe pressure onto the liver, and thereby interacting with sensitive portal venous inflow at this level.

Elastography

Limited data are available on US-based liver stiffness measurements in pediatric sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. One of the first publications dates from 2016, and results are encouraging. An increase of liver stiffness from baseline correlates with the onset of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with stiffness values decreasing as the condition resolves. Liver stiffness has been shown to increase even before other imaging and clinical findings of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome become apparent. Corbacioglu et al. showed that an earlier start of defibrotide treatment of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was associated with a more favorable outcome in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therefore, structural liver stiffness measurements including baseline measurements are now increasingly advocated in patients at risk of developing sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in order to stratify those who could benefit from early defibrotide treatment. Most recently, Chan et al. have summarized the available literature on US elastography in sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.

Two cases of superior vena cava-to-inferior vena cava (IVC) transatrial stent placement to palliate obstruction of the IVC secondary to the intracardiac extension of hepatocellular carcinoma are reported. Both patients presented with debilitating edema of the trunk and lower extremities and varying degrees of hepatic venous obstruction resulting in Budd-Chiari syndrome. One patient required the adjunctive creation of a percutaneous portocaval shunt and the second patient responded to transatrial stent placement alone. Both patients' functional status improved and edema markedly decreased after endovascular therapy.

### Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome [^117VQ2WS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Budd-Chiari syndrome:

- **Definition**: BCS is a liver disease that results from hepatic venous outflow obstruction characterized by a triad of abdominal discomfort, hepatomegaly, and ascites.
- **Pathophysiology**: Etiologies of BCS can be broadly classified into thrombotic causes (primary myeloproliferative diseases, underlying thrombophilia) and non-thrombotic causes (compression due to tumors of adjacent organs, polycystic kidney disease, parasitic liver disease).
- **Disease course**: Obstruction of hepatic veins increases sinusoidal pressure and reduces sinusoidal blood blow, leading to clinical manifestations of acute abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly, or chronic symptoms of long-standing portal hypertension. Disease progression may result in fibrosis and fulminant hepatic failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: 1-year and 5-year mortality rate of treated BCS is 6% and 13%, respectively.

### Encephalopathy assessment in children with extra-hepatic portal vein obstruction with MR, psychometry and critical flicker frequency [^117EKDNe]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Mild cognitive and psychomotor deficit has been reported in patients with extra-hepatic portal vein obstruction. This prospective study was done to ascertain the presence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy by neuropsychological testing and its correlation with diffusion tensor imaging derived metrics, T1 signal intensity, brain metabolites in (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, blood ammonia and critical flicker frequency in patients with extra-hepatic portal vein obstruction.

Methods

Neuropsychological tests, critical flicker frequency, blood ammonia, diffusion tensor imaging, T1 signal intensity and (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy were determined in 22 extra-hepatic portal vein obstruction and 17 healthy children. Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc analysis was done to compare controls with patient groups.

Results

Based on neuropsychological tests, 7/22 patients had minimal hepatic encephalopathy, and significantly increased Glx/Cr ratio, blood ammonia, mean diffusivity and globus pallidus T1 signal intensity with decreased critical flicker frequency in comparison to controls and in those without minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Cho/Cr, mI/Cr ratio and fractional anisotropy were unchanged in patient groups compared to controls. A significant inverse correlation of neuropsychological test with mean diffusivity, Glx/Cr ratio and blood ammonia and a positive correlation among mean diffusivity, blood ammonia and Glx/Cr ratio was seen.

Conclusions

Extra-hepatic portal vein obstruction is a true hyperammonia model with porto-systemic shunting and normal liver functions that results in minimal hepatic encephalopathy in one-third of these children. Hyperammonia results in generalized low grade cerebral edema and cognitive decline as evidenced by increased Glx/Cr ratio, mean diffusivity values and abnormal neuropsychological tests.

### Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated localized extremity edema and erythema [^116wQ7EU]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Our cases exhibit the variability in disease course of localized extremity edema and erythema in the setting of BTK inhibitor therapy. Both cases began with a well-demarcated, irregularly bordered, erythematous-violaceous plaque that presented proximally and progressed distally, but only one case progressed to debilitating edema that persisted despite discontinuation of therapy. Overall, this presentation is quite distinct from typical peripheral edema. Although early findings were clinically suggestive of an inflammatory etiology such as a pigmented purpuric dermatosis, or less likely angiosarcoma, later findings in case 1 were more suggestive of eosinophilic cellulitis or deep vein thrombosis. As histopathology showed no evidence of inflammation or neoplastic cells, imaging was done to evaluate for thrombosis or obstruction that could produce this irregular edema with duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Although age may have contributed to their risk of venous insufficiency, they had no clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal insufficiency or hypoalbuminemia and their clinical presentation was not typical of standard peripheral edema. Awareness of the initial disease presentation, which is clinically suggestive of an inflammatory dermatosis, will allow early initiation of compression therapy, and potentially improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in these patients. Further research into the pathogenesis of this adverse effect is necessary to improve treatment options for these patients.

Budd-Chiari syndrome

This is a rare entity in children caused by a hepatic venous obstruction. It is often idiopathic, but can be associated with hypercoagulable states, congenital venous webs (intrahepatic or caval), neoplasms, trauma and abdominal surgery. Children with Budd-Chiari syndrome usually present with rapid-onset abdominal distension and pain due to hepatomegaly and ascites.

On US the liver may appear heterogeneous with focal hypoechoic areas secondary to haemorrhagic infarction or necrosis (Fig. 19). Later on, fibrosis and scarring may result in hyperechoic regions. The liver is usually enlarged, especially the caudate lobe, and ascites may be seen. The hepatic veins can be partly or completely occluded and US is helpful to identify the level of obstruction (Fig. 19). Markedly reduced or reversed flow in the hepatic veins and/or inferior vena cava can be seen on Doppler evaluation.

Fig. 19

CT and MRI are both accurate but not highly specific in identifying Budd-Chiari syndrome. Typical features include hepatomegaly with an enlarged caudate lobe, heterogeneous liver parenchyma, absent or narrowed hepatic veins, thrombus in the hepatic veins, intrahepatic venous collaterals, thrombosis or compression of the inferior vena cava and ascites (Fig. 19). MRA may demonstrate hepatic venous obstruction and collateral circulation, probably as accurately as Doppler US and angiography.

Cardiohepatic disorders related to HFpEF: congestive hepatopathy

Congestive hepatopathy is a clinical syndrome that refers to the manifestations of chronic, passive congestion of the liver caused by elevation of the central venous pressure in the setting of HF (HFrEF and HFpEF) or other cardiac disease (eg, tricuspid regurgitation). The incidence of congestive hepatopathy among patients with severe HF ranges from 15% to 65%. Any elevation in the pressure of the right heart typically results in an elevation of the central venous pressure and is directly transmitted to the hepatic veins through the inferior vena cava because of their close anatomical relationship. Because of the absence of valves in hepatic veins, the increased pressure in the hepatic veins leads to hepatic congestion, which is characterized mainly by centrilobular congestion and sinusoidal dilation. In acute HF, hepatic congestion is typically coupled with arterial hypoperfusion and hypoperfusion-induced hypoxia, which result in hypoxic hepatitis. Congestive hepatopathy can result in centrilobular liver cell necrosis. This necrotic damage is followed by deposition of connective tissue and fibrosis, ultimately leading to cardiac cirrhosis.

The passive backward hepatic congestion enhances hepatic lymph formation to drain the fluid that accumulates in the interstitial space. However, when the production rate of interstitial fluid exceeds the capacity of the lymphatic system, ascites develops. Furthermore, increased pressure of hepatic sinusoids disrupts the endothelial cells and the tight junctions between hepatocytes, which separate the extravascular space from the bile canaliculus. This disruption results in exposing the bile canaliculus to the sinusoidal blood and thus an increase in the level of serum bilirubin.

Congestive hepatopathy typically manifests with jaundice, ascites, edema, hepatomegaly, hepatojugular reflux, pulsatile liver (when associated with tricuspid valve regurgitation), and a cholestatic laboratory pattern (ie, increased serum γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) with normal or mildly increased transaminases. The severity of cholestasis typically correlates with the severity of HF and implies significant prognostic values; total bilirubin is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and HF hospitalization.

Treatment of congestive hepatopathy focuses on decongesting the liver (using diuretic agents) and optimizing cardiac output and hemodynamic status.

### Budd-Chiari syndrome [^112Sqf5w]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is an uncommon condition characterized by obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow tract. Presentation may vary from a completely asymptomatic condition to fulminant liver failure. BCS is an example of postsinusoidal portal hypertension. The management can be divided into three main categories: medical, surgical, and endovascular. The purpose of this article is to present an overall perspective of the problem, diagnosis, and management.

Conclusion

BCS requires accurate, prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapy. Treatment will vary depending on the clinical presentation, cause, and anatomic location of the problem. Patients with BCS are probably best treated in tertiary care centers where liver transplantation is available.

### A case report of hemothorax due to intrathoracic variceal rupture linked to Budd-Chiari syndrome [^113koGse]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

In 1845, the British doctor George Budd first proposed that the syndrome characterized by clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly was called BCS. But it was not until 1959 that Parker proposed that the pathophysiological mechanism of BCS formation was related to thrombosis conditions. BCS is a rare entity characterized by obstruction of hepatic venous blood flow. In western countries, studies have shown that paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myeloproliferative neoplasms, high homocysteine, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and puerperium are high risk factors for BCS, but the above risk factors are not common in China. The patient in the case had no underlying disease before admission, and no history of tumor, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and other diseases was found after admission. Therefore, it is considered that the patient's disease is mainly due to hypercoagulable state of blood, and the specific cause is not known.

The clinical manifestations of BCS are not specific and may be diverse. Most BCS patients have no obvious manifestations in the early stage of onset. Portal vein pressure rises due to hepatic vein blood flow restriction, forming intrahepatic and extrahepatic collateral circulation. The establishment of intrahepatic and extrahepatic collateral circulation significantly improves patient symptoms. Decompensated liver function can cause portal and inferior vena cava hypertension. Portal hypertension usually causes esophageal and gastric varices, liver damage, splenomegaly, refractory ascites, and periumbilical and abdominal wall vein enlargement. Inferior vena cava hypertension can cause lower extremity edema, varicose veins, even lower extremity skin pigmentation and chronic ulcers. The patient in the case experienced recurring lower limb edema and chest spider nevus before admission. The contrast-enhanced CT in portal venous phase demonstrated tortuous enlargement of splenic, paravertebral, paraumbilical, and abdominal wall veins, consistent with BCS symptoms.

### Budd-Chiari syndrome: in evolution [^112kyUBE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare but potentially life-threatening disorder caused by hepatic venous obstruction, distinct from cardiac causes of hepatic congestion or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (formerly known as veno-occlusive disease). BCS may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on the underlying process. Most cases of primary BCS are due to an underlying hypercoagulable disorder. A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. In most case series, chronic, indolent cases of BCS are more common than acute presentations. Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and direct venography are useful in confirming the diagnosis. Systemic anticoagulation should be started expeditiously, as long as there are no contraindications. The use of systemic thrombolysis remains controversial. However, thrombolysis may prove effective when it is administered locally following hepatic venoplasty with or without stenting. Guidelines for the management of more complex cases and of patients who fail medical management are currently in evolution. Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is potentially life-threatening, depending on the extent and rapidity of hepatic venous obstruction. A high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis, since BCS may be quite indolent or even asymptomatic. Doppler ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually definitive. Systemic anticoagulation should be offered to all patients, unless contraindicated. The role of thrombolysis in BCS remains controversial, and thus it should be reserved for cases undergoing hepatic decompression via percutaneous angioplasty. Guidelines for the management of cases who fail standard medical management are currently in evolution.

### Physiologic effect of stent therapy for inferior vena cava obstruction due to malignant liver tumor [^115ZXr4G]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To understand systemic the influence of stent therapy for inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction due to advanced liver tumor.

Methods

Seven patients with symptomatic IVC obstruction due to advanced primary (n = 4) or secondary (n = 3) liver tumor were subjected to stent therapy. Enrollment criteria included high IVC pressure over 15 mmHg and the presence of edema and ascites. Z-stents were deployed using coaxial sheath technique via femoral venous puncture. Physiologic and hematobiochemical parameters were analyzed.

Results

All procedures were successful, and the stents remained patent until patient death. Promptly after stent placement, the IVC flow recovered, and the venous blood pressure in the IVC below the obstruction level showed a significant decrease from 20.8 ± 1.2 mmHg (mean ± SE) to 10.7 ± 0.7 mmHg (p < 0.01). Transient mild increase of right atrial pressure was observed in 1 patient. During the following week prominent diuresis was observed in all patients. Mean urine output volume in the 3 days before the stent therapy was 0.81 ± 0.09 l/day compared with 2.1 ± 0.2 l/day (p < 0.01) in the 3 days after. The edema and ascites decreased in all patients. The caval pressure change correlated well (r > 0.6) with the urine volume increase, and with the decreased volume of edema and ascites. The urine volume increase correlated well with the decrement of edema, but not with that of ascites. Improvements for various durations in the levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, and platelet count were found (p < 0.05). These hematobiochemical changes were well correlated with each other and with the decrement of ascites. Two patients showed a low blood sodium level of 128.5 mEq/l after intensive natriuresis, and one of them died on day 21 with hepatic failure, which was interpreted as maladaptation aggravation. The mean survival time was 94.1 ± 34.1 days (mean ± SD), ranging from 21 to 140 days after stent treatment.

Conclusion

The stent therapy for IVC obstruction due to malignant liver tumors was followed by a series of physiologic and hematobiochemical consequences, most of them favorable but some possibly unfavorable. Rational interpretations and predictions of sequelae based on physiologic science including cardiology, hepatology, and nephrology would facilitate the best management of stent therapy for malignant IVC obstruction.

### Face lift postoperative recovery [^1177mdoS]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to describe what I have studied and experienced, mainly regarding the control and prediction of the postoperative edema; how to achieve an agreeable recovery and give positive support to the patient, who in turn will receive pleasant sensations that neutralize the negative consequences of the surgery. After the skin is lifted, the drainage flow to the flaps is reversed abruptly toward the medial part of the face, where the flap bases are located. The thickness and extension of the flap determines the magnitude of the post-op edema, which is also augmented by medial surgeries (blepharo, rhino) whose trauma obstruct their natural drainage, increasing the congestion and edema. To study the lymphatic drainage, the day before an extended face lift (FL) a woman was infiltrated in the cheek skin with lynfofast (solution of tecmesio) and the absorption was observed by gamma camera. Seven days after the FL she underwent the same study; we observed no absorption by the lymphatic, concluding that a week after surgery, the lymphatic network was still damaged. To study the venous return during surgery, a fine catheter was introduced into the external jugular vein up to the mandibular border to measure the peripheral pressure. Following platysma plication the pressure rose, and again after a simple bandage, but with an elastic bandage it increased even further, diminishing considerably when it was released. Hence, platysma plication and the elastic bandage on the neck augment the venous congestion of the face. There are diseases that produce and can prolong the surgical edema: cardiac, hepatic, and renal insufficiencies, hypothyroidism, malnutrition, etc. According to these factors, the post-op edema can be predicted, the surgeon can choose between a wide dissection or a medial surgery, depending on the social or employment compromises the patient has, or the patient must accept a prolonged recovery if a complex surgery is necessary. Operative measures which prevent extensive edemas are: avoiding transection of the temporal pedicle, or to realizing platysma plication too tight by using strong aspirative drainage instead of elastic bandages. In the post-op, the manual lymphatic drainage is initiated on the third or fifth day, but must be done by a trained professional, in a method contrary to that specified in the books for non-operated individuals. An aesthetician washes the hair and applies decongestive cold tea on the face the second day, and on the fifth, moisturizes the skin and cosmetically conceals any signs of bruising. The psychological support provided by the staff keeps the patient calm and relaxed. Five years experience with this protocol has enabled us to minimize post-op pain. The edema can be predicted with certain consistency (in which surgery there will be more or less edema) and the proper technique can be selected, permitting the patient to choose the best moment for a FL while the surgeon can avoid intra and postoperative measures that increase the edema. After surgery, the patient receives the daily assistance of the staff, which rapidly and efficiently improves this condition. We can predict and control the post-op recovery and the patient feels fine, unlike the past when recovery was abandoned to its natural evolution. If the patient perceived an intensive, positive support on behalf of the entire staff that kept him or her content, then we have succeeded in doing an excellent marketing. This may encourage others to undergo aesthetic surgery, especially those who are convinced that after surgery they might have to endure considerable suffering.

### Analysis of the clinical characteristics of patients with Kawasaki disease complicated with cholestasis [^115y29bu]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of cholestasis in KD remains unclear, but is presumed to be related to intrahepatic cholangitis or obstruction caused by lymphadenectasis, edema of the gallbladder wall, and inflammation of the liver and gallbladder serous membrane. Hepatic biopsy in patients with KD and cholestasis has revealed fragmented liver tissue with accentuated lobular architecture, bile duct hyperplasia, bile duct cell injury with predominant neutrophilic granulocytes, acidophilic bodies, occasional biliary thrombi around the lumina of bile duct cells with ductular proliferation, and evidence of cholangiocyte injury featuring acute cholangiolitis, causing portal vein dilation and acute cholangitis. In some patients, acute hydrocholecystis suggested that inflammatory damage to bile duct cells may extend from the small to the large bile duct.

Currently, the incidence of obstructive jaundice caused by gallbladder edema in patients with KD is reportedly approximately 13%, with most patients being asymptomatic. In most cases, the effusion resolves spontaneously without surgical intervention (,–). However, because of the onset of abdominal or liver symptoms in the early days of some atypical cases of KD, misdiagnosis as a hepatobiliary or gastrointestinal disease, such as hepatitis or acute gallstone cholecystitis, is common. In a case report by Luzzato et al. a patient with obstructive jaundice had evidence of cholecystectomy hydrops and intrahepatic duct dilation and underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Falcini et al. reported cases in which cholecystectomy was performed in patients with febrile cholestasis and gallbladder effusion. If KD is diagnosed early, invasive measures can be avoided, as gallbladder effusion and liver dysfunction are temporary conditions associated with KD. In the present study, seven patients (8.2%) with cholestasis showed thickening of the gallbladder wall or gallbladder edema on ultrasound. However, after IVIG treatment, the gallbladder effusion absorbed spontaneously.

### Hepatic magnetic resonance T1-mapping and extracellular volume fraction compared to shear-wave elastography in pediatric fontan-associated liver disease [^114Gq5cR]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

We found a close relationship between central venous pressure and MR T1 mapping results. Elevated MR and elastography values might represent congestion, fibrosis, inflammation or a combination of these conditions. It is impossible with elastography to distinguish among these components with certainty. Specific MR sequences, like T2 mapping and T1 rho, might be helpful in discriminating fibrosis from edema in the future. On the other hand, a composite of hepatic congestion and fibrosis measures might be important, clinically, in the longitudinal follow-up of Fontan liver disease.

Multiple factors contribute to fibrosis development, but chronic venous congestion with elevated venous pressure plays a major role. Other potential causes include low cardiac output, reduced oxygen delivery, inflammation and lymphatic stasis. The exact stage of irreversible fibrosis/cirrhosis, and its importance in optimal heart transplantation timing, are under debate. However, advanced-stage fibrosis/cirrhosis with possible hepatic malignancy might exclude cardiac transplantation or require a combined heart–liver transplant. Our young study population had normal splenic MR relaxometry values, which argued against a general inflammatory state and could be interpreted as the absence of splenic congestion/fibrosis. In turn, this finding also indicated normal portal venous pressure, which suggested a less-advanced liver fibrosis stage that might be reversible.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: imaging findings [^113TPVFY]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Ascariasis

Ascaris lumbricoides is the most common and the largest roundworm parasite of the human intestine. A. lumbricoides are transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food. After eggs are dissolved in the stomach to initiate larva formation, the larvae reach the caecum and migrate through the liver via penetrating portal vein branches. They reach hepatic veins via hepatic sinusoids and finally, the right heart and lungs are involved. They travel to bronchi and trachea and may be seen in sputum at this stage. When sputum is swallowed again, they reach the gastrointestinal system where they become adult worms.

Patients with ascariasis are asymptomatic or present with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. Acute abdominal pain may occur due to complications. Small bowel obstruction is an expected complication in the massive infestation. Massive worm aggregates may cause bowel infarction and gangrene. The worms have a predilection for the orifices and the ampulla of Vater is frequently involved. Thus, biliary and pancreatic complications are also common. Biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, recurrent cholangitis, liver abscess, and acute pancreatitis are related complications. Rarely the worm causes gastrointestinal perforation. On sonography, the roundworm may be seen as single or multiple, long, linear, and thick echogenic strips without acoustic shadowing. A central, longitudinal anechoic tube between two parallel echogenic lines, known as "triple line sign", represents the digestive tract of the Ascaris worm. US may reveal the movement of the worm during real-time scanning. Acute intestinal obstruction secondary to ascariasis may present on CT as dilated bowel loops and elongated or rounded filling defects in the contrast filled lumen of the bowel. Ascaris worms manifest as relatively hyperattenuating tubular structures surrounded by less attenuated bile in the setting of bile duct obstruction. Acute pancreatitis caused by Ascaris worms presents on CT as diffusely dilated pancreatic duct and peripancreatic edema. (Fig. 11).

### Hepatocellular carcinoma in fontan-associated liver disease [^1122gBiU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological mechanisms

The development of HCC in FALD arises from a multifaceted interplay of pathophysiological pathways triggered by the chronically altered hemodynamics of the Fontan circulation. While the precise mechanisms remain under investigation, key contributors include the effects of chronic hepatic congestion, cellular-level changes, and ultimately the progression of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Understanding this intricate cascade is crucial for developing targeted FALD-HCC prevention and treatment strategies (Fig. 2).

Figure 2
Pathophysiology of congestive hepatopathies after Fontan surgery

HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma

The hemodynamic abnormalities observed in FALD present a unique pathophysiological challenge. After the Fontan procedure, patients exhibit a paradox: elevated portal and central venous pressures, yet a low hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). This pattern classifies FALD as post-sinusoidal portal hypertension, where complications such as varices, ascites and splenomegaly can appear despite the low HVPG. The root of this paradox lies in the elevated central venous pressure, which reduces the pressure gradient driving portal venous inflow. Compounding this effect is the often-present low cardiac output in Fontan patients. The liver partially compensates via the hepatic arterial buffer response (HBAR), which dilates the hepatic artery to increase blood supply to the liver. However, the HBAR is limited in its effectiveness, especially when portal pressures exceed 20 mmHg. Above this threshold, arterial inflow can decrease, contributing to hepatic ischemia alongside the ongoing challenges of portal hypertension.

This complex mechanism results in the chronic passive hepatic congestion unique to the Fontan patient, since the liver is continuously exposed to non-pulsatile elevated pressure. Passive congestion leads to sinusoidal dilatation, perisinusoidal edema with sinusoidal stretch, and atrophy of hepatocytes near the central hepatic veins. The sinusoidal dilatation causes mechanical stimulation and damage to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and the inter-hepatocytic tight junctions that separate the extravascular space from the bile canaliculus. The resulting stagnant flow leads to thrombus formation within sinusoids, hepatic venules and portal tracts, and results in hepatocyte hypoxia. Additionally, the impaired LSEC function decreases intrahepatic nitric oxide, hampering oxygen and nutrient diffusion while promoting hepatocyte death. LSECs may also secrete cytokines that promote platelet aggregation and microvascular thrombosis. The disrupted endothelial cells also allow exudation of a protein-rich fluid and extravasation of red blood cells, eventually leading to exudative ascites and reddened areas within the hepatic parenchyma, respectively.

### Imaging features of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or veno-occlusive disease in children [^116n5WT8]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, also known as veno-occlusive disease, can occur as a complication of myeloablative chemotherapy, as a result of low-intensity chemotherapy-related liver toxicity or radiotherapy of the liver. Symptoms of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome can range from asymptomatic to liver dysfunction or severe disease with life-threatening acute multi-organ failure. Imaging features can suggest or support this clinical diagnosis. Familiarity with the imaging spectrum of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is therefore important for both radiologists and clinical oncologists. Here, multi-modality radiologic appearances of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in pediatric patients are illustrated, including outcome after follow-up.

### Clofarabine [^114dtLqR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and Capillary Leak Syndrome

Clofarabine injection may cause a cytokine release syndrome (e.g., tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, pulmonary edema) that may progress to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with capillary leak syndrome and organ impairment which may be fatal. Monitor patients frequently for these conditions. In clinical trials, SIRS was reported in two patients (2%); capillary leak syndrome was reported in four patients (4%). Symptoms included rapid onset of respiratory distress, hypotension, pleural and pericardial effusion, and multiorgan failure. Close monitoring for this syndrome and early intervention may reduce the risk. Immediately discontinue clofarabine injection and provide appropriate supportive measures. The use of prophylactic steroids (e.g., 100 mg/m2hydrocortisone on Days 1 through 3) may be of benefit in preventing signs or symptoms of SIRS or capillary leak syndrome. Consider use of diuretics and/or albumin. After the patient is stabilized and organ function has returned to baseline, retreatment with clofarabine injection can be considered with a 25% dose reduction.

5.6 Venous Occlusive Disease of the Liver

Patients who have previously received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at higher risk for veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver following treatment with clofarabine (40 mg/m2) when used in combination with etoposide (100 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (440 mg/m2). Severe hepatotoxic events have been reported in a combination study of clofarabine in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia. Two cases (2%) of VOD in the monotherapy studies were considered related to study drug. Monitor for and discontinue clofarabine injection if VOD is suspected.

### VExUS score: optimizing its use in perioperative and critical care management [^117KeHz8]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Once IVC diameter has been assessed, other venous ultrasound veins should be assessed. Close to the right atrium, the hepatic veins connect liver blood flow to the vena cava and venous return. The shape of the hepatic vein flow is influenced by changes in pressure in the right atrium. But these changes depend on a complex interaction between right atrial function, right ventricular function, and volemia. Given that the hepatic vein Doppler pattern (S/D ratio) is directly influenced by RV contraction and tricuspid valve movement, an abnormal (inverse S/D ratio) pattern primarily reflects RV function rather than hypervolemia per se.

Additionally, portal vein pulsatility is the consequence of a complex interplay between cardiac function, splanchnic capacitance, and volume status. Intrinsic hepatic disease can also alter portal vein waveform patterns independently of cardiac function. This may result from decreased hepatic compliance and/or portal hypertension, which can cause portal vein pulsatility. Interpretation of a high portal pulsatility index may therefore be challenging, as studies have shown that both cardiac function and volume status influence portal flow pulsatility.

Lastly, renal venous flow patterns, while influenced by volume, can be affected by cardiac function and local renal hemodynamics. Local renal hemodynamic factors may include renal interstitial edema, which increases intrarenal pressure and compresses venous outflow; reduced arterial and venous compliance due to sympathetic activation; decreased renal arterial inflow from hypoperfusion, which alters the arterial–venous pressure gradient; or elevated intra-abdominal pressure, which directly compresses the renal vasculature and increases external venous resistance. In addition to these local factors, cardiac function (both diastolic and systolic) can also influence renal venous flow in the setting of hypervolemia, through elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures — a mechanism improved with volume depletion induced by diuretics. Subsequently, a study in the ICU confirmed that portal flow pulsatility and venous renal Doppler may be associated with an appropriate response to diuretic volume depletion. The presence of abnormal venous renal patterns may indicate volume overload that would benefit from diuresis.

### Budd-Chiari syndrome: an update on imaging features [^115aoJVF]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare cause of portal hypertension and liver failure. This condition is characterized by an impaired hepatic venous drainage. The diagnosis of BCS is based on imaging, which helps initiate treatment. Imaging findings can be categorized into direct and indirect signs. Direct signs are the hallmarks of BCS and consist of visualization of obstructive lesions of the hepatic veins or the upper portion of the inferior vena cava. Indirect signs, which are secondary to venous obstruction, correspond to intra- and extrahepatic collateral circulation, perfusion abnormalities, dysmorphy and signs of portal hypertension.

### Starling curves and central venous pressure [^113fz3Eg]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

As the Starling curve shows, elevated CVP can also be an indication that venous return has exceeded the limit of cardiac accommodation. While CVP may be normal in left heart failure and pulmonary edema, an elevated CVP may signify that blood is welling up in the right atrium due to right heart dysfunction or obstruction to right ventricular outflow. CVP elevation, not reduced cardiac index, is the hemodynamic variable that correlates best with renal failure and hepatic dysfunction in congestive heart failure. An elevation of CVP to 4 mmHg is associated with an increased risk of death. Elevated CVP is probably a marker for hepatic and renal congestion in heart failure. An elevated CVP is also the hemodynamic parameter best associated with the development of renal failure in severe sepsis.

CVP elevation (in the absence of elevated juxta-cardiac pressure or tricuspid valve disease) is an important marker of right heart failure due to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. This syndrome is common among critically ill patients and is often due to acute pulmonary emboli or the acute respiratory distress syndrome. A rise in CVP in these situations is arguably a more important finding than pulmonary artery hypertension. As pulmonary vascular resistance rises beyond the limits of right ventricular compensation, the pulmonary artery pressure will fall as cardiac output falls. CVP, however, will continue to rise into double digits as blood wells up in the right side of the heart. The rise in CVP coincides with a rapid increase in right ventricular systolic and diastolic pressure, which can ultimately culminate in a diminution of the coronary perfusion gradient to the right ventricular myocardium.

### Hepatic vein obstruction is the most common type of hepatic venous outflow obstruction regardless of socioeconomic status [^115VBxJD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

One possible reason for this shift in site of obstruction even in the low SES over the years could be a general improvement in standard of living as compared to the poor of a few decades ago. For example, birth facilities, housing, sanitation, food type; prevalence of infectious disease may all be better now despite classification into the lower SES groups.

A limitation of our study is the small number of patients having isolated IVC obstruction. Prothrombotic conditions were not assessed in many patients due to financial constraints. Since ours is a government-funded hospital, a majority of patients belonged to the low SES and this is reflected in the number of patients belonging to the low SES in our study (60/70). There is no reason to believe that the findings will be different in high SES; recent Indian studies have confirmed such a shifting trend. The details of birth weight of patients with HVOTO were based on history provided by parents, and were available for only 26 patients; these data may be affected by recall bias and therefore no definite conclusions can be derived from them. Although there is no etiological correlation of use of anti tuberculosis therapy (ATT) in patients with BCS of different SES, many patients were inappropriately treated with ATT on the basis of high protein ascites prior to diagnosis at primary and secondary level centers. This indicates need for awareness for this disease (BCS) amongst primary and secondary healthcare providers.

In a previous study at our center, we had highlighted the challenges posed in treatment of financially challenged patients with HVOTO and showed that medical therapy alone is effective in a good proportion of patients.

In conclusion, our study shows that, in India, isolated hepatic vein obstruction is now the most common site of obstruction in patients with HVOTO, even among those belonging to low SES. This reflects a change in spectrum over the years. The socioeconomic factors we studied do not appear to influence the site of obstruction.

### Tumor in the veins: an abdominal perspective with an emphasis on CT and MR imaging [^113A22kz]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatic veins

The hepatic veins form the most important outflow tract which eventually drain into the right atrium. Hepatic vein invasion by HCC, unrelated to the size, is a grave prognostic indicator with almost no hope for cure. Therefore, correct identification of this finding is critical for proper patient triaging and treatment. Despite the fact that this finding is generally regarded as a contraindication for surgery, there are some reports suggesting benefit for surgery in select groups. The tumor thrombus may extend into the heart in advanced stage patients. Both CT and MRI may be used with superior precision to detect and evaluate the extent of hepatic vein tumor thrombus (Fig. 5). Sagittal and coronal reformatted images may also provide incremental value for evaluation.

### Imaging of Budd-Chiari syndrome [^114xWniP]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome occurs when venous outflow from the liver is obstructed. The obstruction may occur at any point from the hepatic venules to the left atrium. The syndrome most often occurs in patients with underlying thrombotic disorders such as polycythemia rubra vera, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and pregnancy. It may also occur secondary to a variety of tumours, chronic inflammatory diseases and infections. Imaging plays an important role both in establishing the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome as well as evaluating for underlying causes and complications such as portal hypertension. In this review article, we discuss the role of modern imaging in the evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome.

### WSES classification and guidelines for liver trauma [^116hiKC2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

If despite the fundamental initial maneuvers (hepatic packing, Pringle maneuver) the bleeding persists and evident lesion to a hepatic artery is found, an attempt to control it should be made. If repair is not possible a selective hepatic artery ligation can be considered as a viable option. In case of right or common hepatic artery ligation, cholecystectomy should be performed to avoid gallbladder necrosis. Post-operative angio-embolization is a viable option, when possible, allowing hemorrhage control while reducing the complications. After artery ligation, in fact, the risk of hepatic necrosis, biloma and abscesses increases.

Portal vein injuries should be repaired primarily. The portal vein ligation should be avoided because liver necrosis or massive bowel edema may occur. Liver Packing and a second look or liver resection are preferable to portal ligation.

In those cases where Pringle maneuver or arterial control fails, and the bleeding persists from behind the liver, a retro-hepatic caval or hepatic vein injury could be present. Three therapeutic options exist: 1) tamponade with hepatic packing, 2) direct repair (with or without vascular isolation), and 3) lobar resection. Liver packing is the most successful method of managing severe venous injuries. Direct venous repair is problematic in non-experienced hands, with a high mortality rate.

When hepatic vascular exclusion is necessary, different types of shunting procedures have been described, most of them anecdotally. The veno-veno bypass (femoral vein to axillary or jugular vein by pass) or the use of fenestrated stent grafts are the most frequent type of shunt used by surgeons familiar with their use. The atrio-caval shunt bypasses the retro-hepatic cava blood through the right atrium using a chest tube put into the inferior cava vein. Mortality rates in such a complicated situations are high. Liver exclusion is generally poorly tolerated in the unstable patient with major blood loss.

In the emergency, in cases of liver avulsion or total crush injury, when a total hepatic resection must be done, hepatic transplantation has been described.

The exact role of post-operative angio-embolization is still not well defined. Two principal indications have been proposed: 1) after primary operative hemostasis in stable or stabilized patients, with an evidence at contrast enhanced CT-scan of active bleeding, and 2) as adjunctive hemostatic control in patients with uncontrolled suspected arterial bleeding despite emergency laparotomy.

### Afferent mechanisms of sodium retention in cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome [^111oLnhT]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis induces extra-cellular fluid volume expansion, which when the disease is advanced can be severe and poorly responsive to therapy. Prevention and/or effective therapy for cirrhotic edema requires understanding the stimulus that initiates and maintains sodium retention. Despite much study, this stimulus remains unknown. Work over the last several years has shown that signals originating in the liver can influence a variety of systemic functions, including extra-cellular fluid volume control. We review work on the afferent mechanisms triggering sodium retention in cirrhosis and suggest that the data are most consistent with the existence of a sensor in the hepatic circulation that contributes to normal extra-cellular fluid volume control (that is, a 'volume' sensor) and that in cirrhosis, the sensor is pathologically activated by the hepatic circulatory abnormalities caused by the disease. Detailed analysis of the hepatic circulation in normal conditions and cirrhosis is needed.

### Effect of portocaval shunt on residual extreme small liver after extended hepatectomy in porcine [^112aoCjY]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

When residual liver volume is extremely small after extended hepatectomy, postoperative hepatic failure may ensue. The cause of the hepatic failure is likely associated with the portal hypertension after hepatectomy. We investigated the effects of portocaval shunt on portal hypertension in producing sinusoidal microcirculatory injury after extended hepatectomy in pigs.

Methods

Fourteen pigs were divided into two groups: a group without a shunt, in which extended hepatectomy was carried out (i.e., residual volume was 17% of the whole liver), and a group with a shunt, in which extended hepatectomy was carried out and a portocaval shunt was inserted. The portocaval shunt was placed by side-to-side anastomosis between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava.

Results

In the group without a shunt, all pigs died of hepatic failure within postoperative day 3. In the group with a shunt, all pigs were alive for more than 4 days, and 4 pigs survived longer than 7 days. Portal vein pressure after hepatectomy was 15.9 ± 3.8 mmHg in the group without a shunt and 10.5 ± 0.6 mmHg in the group with a shunt (P < 0.01). The portal vein flow after 83% hepatectomy in the group without a shunt increased significantly more than at laparotomy and in the group with a shunt (P < 0.01). In the group without a shunt, remarkable destruction of the sinusoidal lining and edema of the portal triad and hydropic change of hepatocytes were observed 1 hour after hepatectomy, but these findings were not observed in the group with a shunt.

Conclusions

These results indicate that, after extended hepatectomy, overload of portal flow is one of the most significant risk factors of hepatic failure by sinusoidal microcirculatory injury.

At laparotomy, if no major bleeding is present, compression alone or electrocautery, bipolar devices, argon beam coagulation, topical hemostatic agents, simple suture of the hepatic parenchyma, or omental patching may be sufficient to stop the bleeding.

In case of major hemorrhage, more aggressive procedures including manual compression and hepatic packing, ligation of vessels in the wound, hepatic debridement and finger fracture, balloon tamponade, shunting procedures, or hepatic vascular isolation and exclusion may be used. Of paramount importance is to provide simultaneous intraoperative intensive resuscitation with early institution of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) aiming to maintain organ perfusion and ultimately reverse all trauma-induced physiological derangements.

In case of evident injury to the proper hepatic artery, an attempt to control and repair it should be made. If not effective or not possible, selective hepatic artery ligation should be considered as a viable option. If the injury is on the right or left branches of the proper hepatic artery, selective ligation is advisable. If the right or common hepatic artery must be ligated, cholecystectomy should be performed to avoid gallbladder necrosis. If the patient's condition allows for it, post-operative AE represents a viable alternative allowing hemorrhage control while reducing complications. Hepatic artery ligation increases the risk of hepatic necrosis, abscesses, and biloma formation.

Portal vein injuries should be repaired primarily. Portal vein main branch ligation should not be considered and should be avoided because of the high risk of liver necrosis or massive bowel edema. If no other option exists, ligation can be used, but only in patients with an intact hepatic artery. Liver packing or liver resection should be preferred to ligation in case of lobar or segmental/subsegmental portal venous branch injuries.

Whenever Pringle maneuver or arterial control fails and bleeding persists, the presence of an aberrant hepatic artery should be considered. If the bleeding comes from behind the liver, retro-hepatic caval or hepatic vein injury should be highly suspected. Three viable options exist for the management of retrohepatic caval/suprahepatic venous injuries: (1) tamponade with hepatic packing, (2) direct repair (with or without vascular isolation), and (3) lobar resection. Liver packing is the least risky method to temporarily deal with severe venous injuries. Direct venous repair is difficult especially in non-experienced hands, with high mortality rates.

Abdominal US study demonstrated fresh thrombus in the hepatic veins and hepatomegaly. a Axial plane post-contrast CT image showed reduced perfusion within the periphery of the hepatic parenchyma (asterisks) with relatively normal enhancing central parenchyma (arrowheads). b Axial T2W MR image shows diffuse edema and congestion within the peripheral portion of the liver parenchyma (asterisks) which corresponds to non-enhancing liver parenchyma on CT

The liver appears diffusely hypodense on CT and of low signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images. T2-weighted sequences usually show heterogeneously increased signal intensity in the peripheral liver parenchyma. Ascites may also be detected.

The chronic parenchymal congestion with the formation of focal parenchymal nodules may eventually cause a classical morphological situation also called as the "nutmeg liver".

### Role of radiological imaging and interventions in management of Budd-Chiari syndrome [^112AfBoF]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a clinical condition resulting from impaired hepatic venous drainage, in which there is obstruction to the hepatic venous outflow at any level from the small hepatic veins to the junction of the inferior vena cava and the right atrium leading to hepatic congestion. The diagnosis of BCS is based on imaging, which can be gathered from non-invasive investigations such as ultrasonography coupled with venous Doppler, triphasic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Apart from diagnosis, various interventional radiology procedures aid in the successful management of this syndrome. In this article, we present various imaging features of BCS along with various interventional procedures that are used to treat this diverse condition.

### Idiopathic portal hypertension and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction [^114DQC5p]. Hepatology International (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on extrahepatic portal vein obstruction:

- **Definition**: Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is a vascular liver disorder characterized by variceal dilation, ascites, and portal hypertension.
- **Pathophysiology**: Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is caused by portal vein thrombosis and portal cavernoma.
- **Disease course**: Acute manifestations include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, postprandial fullness, anorexia, general malaise, splenomegaly, and ascites. Progression may lead to variceal bleeding, bowel infarction, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, renal and respiratory failure, shock, and death due to multiorgan failure. Chronic manifestations range from asymptomatic presentation to complications of portal hypertension such as variceal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, jaundice. Other symptoms include transient ascites, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, intestinal ischemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal biliopathy (jaundice, coagulation disturbances, cholangitis, gall stones, hemobilia, and secondary biliary cirrhosis).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year mortality rate for liver transplantation patients with portal vein thrombosis is 15%.

Vascular liver disorders

Hepatic venous outflow obstruction

Liver biopsy is not generally required in the work-up of Budd-Chiari syndrome, as the confirmation of venous outflow obstruction is usually made via hepatic venography. However, biopsy can be carried out during venography to clarify the degree of fibrosis. Occlusion of the hepatic venules can be seen, in addition to sinusoidal dilatation and adjacent hepatocyte atrophy. Erythrocytes may be translocated to the space of Disse (see figure 3). Congestive hepatopathy due to heart failure or constrictive pericarditis can give similar appearances.

Obliterative portal venopathy (idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension)

The nomenclature surrounding non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPHT) is confusing. There is a range of conditions that can cause portal hypertension in the absence of significant fibrosis. However, NCPHT is usually taken to mean idiopathic NCPHT. This is a disease associated with obliterative/sclerotic changes to small portal vein branches, and occurs by definition in the absence of extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis and significant hepatic fibrosis. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is one particular histological appearance associated with the condition (see online supplementary figure 4).

### Hepatic vein obstruction is the most common type of hepatic venous outflow obstruction regardless of socioeconomic status [^113VKn4v]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction (HVOTO) is defined as obstruction to hepatic venous outflow at any site from the right atrium inlet to the small hepatic venules. The Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) results from occlusion of one or more hepatic veins (HV) and/or the inferior vena cava (IVC). In the West, the most common cause is HV occlusion by thrombosis. IVC obstruction, especially by an IVC membrane, has been traditionally believed to be common in India. More recent Indian studies have however shown that isolated HV and combined IVC+HV obstruction are now more common.

Poverty, malnutrition, recurrent bacterial infection (all more common among the lower socioeconomic status, SES), tumors, pregnancy, oral contraceptive pill intake have been suggested as possible reasons for the earlier difference in pattern of anatomy of HVOTO between India and the West. In Nepal, where IVC membrane is predominant, 89% patients with HVOTO are from the lower SES. In the West, a prothrombotic state has been identified in up to 90% of patients with HVOTO Most of these patients have HV thrombosis with or without IVC involvement. Prothrombotic states were reported to be relatively uncommon in HVOTO in earlier Indian studies. Recently, two studies from India for prevalence of JAK2 V617F mutation in patients with HVOTO have shown variable results, 40% in one, and 8.8% in another.

According to one hypothesis, poor hygiene and low SES may be associated with IVC membrane, and improved standards of living may result in lower incidence of IVC membrane. No data exist regarding SES and its etiological role in patients with different types of HVOTO. We therefore compared patients with HV and IVC obstruction to determine if there is any role for socioeconomic factors in the predilection for site of obstruction. We also wanted to assess whether IVC obstruction is still the most common form of HVOTO among Indian patients with low SES.

### Imaging findings of congestive hepatopathy [^114cf79m]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Congestive hepatopathy (CH) refers to hepatic abnormalities that result from passive hepatic venous congestion. Prolonged exposure to elevated hepatic venous pressure may lead to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Liver dysfunction and corresponding clinical signs and symptoms typically manifest late in the disease process. Recognition of CH at imaging is critical because advanced liver fibrosis may develop before the condition is suspected clinically. Characteristic findings of CH on conventional images include dilatation of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins; retrograde hepatic venous opacification during the early bolus phase of intravenous contrast material injection; and a predominantly peripheral heterogeneous pattern of hepatic enhancement due to stagnant blood flow. Extensive fibrosis can be seen in chronic or severe cases. Hyperenhancing regenerative nodules that may retain hepatobiliary contrast agents are often present. Magnetic resonance (MR) elastography can show elevated liver stiffness and may be useful in evaluation of fibrosis in CH because it can be incorporated easily into routine cardiac MR imaging. Preliminary experience with MR elastography suggests its future use in initial evaluation of patients suspected of having CH, for monitoring of disease, and for assessment after therapy. To facilitate appropriate workup and treatment, radiologists should be familiar with findings suggestive of CH at radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, MR imaging, and MR elastography. In addition, knowledge of underlying pathophysiology, comparative histologic abnormalities, and extrahepatic manifestations is useful to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and suggest appropriate additional diagnostic testing.

### Triamterene [^11195Zv3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Triamterene Capsules are indicated in the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver and the nephrotic syndrome; steroid-induced edema, idiopathic edema and edema due to secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Triamterene Capsules may be used alone or with other diuretics, either for its added diuretic effect or its potassium-sparing potential. It also promotes increased diuresis when patients prove resistant or only partially responsive to thiazides or other diuretics because of secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Usage in Pregnancy. The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy woman is inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard. Diuretics do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy, and there is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in the treatment of developed toxemia.

Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathological causes or from the physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Diuretics are indicated in pregnancy (however, see PRECAUTIONS below) when edema is due to pathologic causes, just as they are in the absence of pregnancy. Dependent edema in pregnancy, resulting from restriction of venous return by the expanded uterus, is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities and use of support hose; use of diuretics to lower intravascular volume in this case is illogical and unnecessary. There is hypervolemia during normal pregnancy which is harmful to neither the fetus nor the mother (in the absence of cardiovascular disease), but which is associated with edema, including generalized edema, in the majority of pregnant women. If this edema produces discomfort, increased recumbency will often provide relief. In rare instances, this edema may cause extreme discomfort which is not relieved by rest. In these cases, a short course of diuretics may provide relief and may be appropriate.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116epmK1]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) — a distinct and potentially lethal form of liver injury characterized by toxic/inflammatory damage to sinusoidal endothelial cells — occurs most commonly as a complication of myeloablative chemotherapy regimens used before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), particularly following allogeneic HSCT, with implicated agents including alkylating agents and the platinum complexes, thiopurines, and targeted therapies gemtuzumab and inotuzumab; unrelated to HSCT and cancer chemotherapy, pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in plants or bushes from which tea is made or that contaminate seeds are well-documented causes of SOS. Development can be acute, presenting 1–3 weeks after exposure, and in cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, a transjugular liver biopsy with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement should be performed. The overall mortality rate from SOS averages ~5%, with severity-stratified mortality of 1% in mild presentations (8% of cases), 18% in cases that resolve with therapy (64%), and as high as 67% in severe cases (28%). A small study showed that any previous liver disease independently increased the risk for SOS (OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.71–6.58; P < 0.001). Adjusting the conditioning regimen may reduce SOS risk, and the frequency of SOS has decreased over recent years partially because of the use of less aggressive myeloablative regimens; myeloablative regimens are strongly discouraged in patients with cirrhosis, and before HSCT, workup should focus on excluding cirrhosis.

Treatment of grade 3 ascites — initial management states that for patients presenting with tense ascites, large-volume paracentesis (LVP) combined with hyperoncotic human albumin is the initial treatment of choice, even in the presence of hyponatremia. Patients with massive peripheral edema may require a second paracentesis shortly after the first because a rapid shift of fluid may occur from interstitial to ascitic cavity. After LVP and a significant reduction in the intra-abdominal pressure, diuretics can be instituted, which may eliminate or reduce the frequency of paracentesis.

### Multidetector CT and MRI findings in periportal space pathologies [^113mmvtK]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Periportal region is an anatomic space around portal vein comprising hepatic artery, bile duct, nerves, lymphatics and a potential space. Periportal pathologies may involve any of these structures diffusely or focally with characteristic radiologic findings. Radiologic findings can be helpful in differential diagnosis of pathologies of periportal structures including periportal cavernomatous transformation, hepatic artery aneurysm, biliary diseases, neurofibromatosis, lymphoma, langerhans' cell histiocytosis, periportal fatty infiltration and other causes of periportal halo in adult and pediatric patients. Lobar/segmental intrahepatic involvement can be seen in neurofibromatosis, cavernomatous transformation, fatty infiltration and periportal edema. In this review, we discuss CT and MRI findings of periportal pathologies which can be in the form of diffuse or segmental/lobar involvement.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1148KFCJ]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.

### Clinical implications of hepatic hemodynamic evaluation by abdominal ultrasonographic imaging in patients with heart failure [^111mrTeP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report that the associations between parameters of not only liver congestion (right‐sided HF), but also liver hypoperfusion (left‐sided HF) determined by abdominal ultrasonography and LFTs, RHC, and echocardiography, as well as its prognostic impact in HF.

Cardiohepatic interaction has been reported previously. 6, 9 Systemic venous congestion rises to neurohormonal activation (eg, renin‐angiotensin system), decreases plasma natriuretic peptide, 34, 35 leads to HF progression, may contribute to worsening multiple organ failure, 20, 36, 37 and results in adverse prognosis. 38 HF causes increased right‐sided pressure overload, and leads to LS increase. 20, 39, 40 Liver transient elastography showed increased LS at admission attributable to HF and an improvement at discharge. 18 Increased central venous pressure causes hepatocyte atrophy and perisinusoidal edema in the liver. 6, 8 Increased pressure within the hepatic sinusoid favors bile duct damage by disrupting endothelial cells and the interhepatocytic tight junctions that separate the extravascular space from the bile canaliculus. Further, stagnant flow favors thrombosis within sinusoids, hepatic venules, and portal tracts, thereby contributing to liver fibrosis. 7, 41 Centrilobular liver cell necrosis can extend to peripheral areas if HF persists and worsens and is followed by the deposition and spread of connective tissue bridging one central vein to another, ultimately leading to liver cirrhosis. 7 Concordant with these findings, increased right‐sided pressure (RAP) in the current study was associated with higher levels of total bilirubin, gamma‐glutamyl transferase, and SWE. In addition, high SWE was associated with right and left volume overload (RAP, left atrial volume, mitral E/e′, right atrial end‐systolic area, and inferior vena cava diameter) and high cardiac event rates.

Hepatic AVM

Liver AVMs are relatively common and have a prevalence between 41 and 78% (Buscarini et al.) (Fig. 6). These lesions are typically clinically silent (Buscarini et al; Lerut et al.). Complications from liver AVMs occur in approximately 8% of people with HHT and result from shunting of the hepatic artery to hepatic vein, portal vein to hepatic vein, and/or hepatic artery to portal vein (Buscarini et al.) (Fig. 7). High output cardiac failure is the most common complication of intrahepatic shunting with symptoms generally reported when intrahepatic shunt output is greater than 20% of the cardiac output (Buscarini et al.). Symptoms include dyspnea on exertion, ascites, edema, and even a bruit over the liver (Garcia-Tsao et al.). A shunt that leads to high output cardiac failure involving hepatic artery to hepatic vein and can also cause biliary ischemia due to steal(Lerut et al.). While middle-aged women are the most affected demographic, heart failure can be precipitated by pregnancy due to increased hemodynamic demands and increase in circulating blood volume (Shovlin; Bari and Cohen).

### Cavoatrial bypass for occlusion of the inferior caval vein in a patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome [^1168u7Mc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We report the case of a young man with Budd-Chiari syndrome and occlusion of the inferior caval vein. Peripheral edema was his predominant complaint. Symptoms of portal hypertension were lacking, indicating membranotomy and not portosystemic shunting as the treatment of choice. At operation, membranotomy was not feasible, and a cavoatrial bypass using a 22 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed instead. Shortly after the operation the peripheral edema vanished, diuretic treatment could be withdrawn, and liver function improved. Eighteen months later the bypass remains patent, edema is absent, and liver function is stable. We conclude that cavoatrial bypass is a therapeutic option in patients with occlusion of the inferior vena cava with no clinical symptoms of portal hypertension if transcardiac membranotomy is not feasible.

### Tricuspid regurgitation: a review of current interventional management [^112nXE2e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Physical Examination

The classic murmur of TR is a holosystolic murmur heard best at the right or left midsternal border depending on the degree of right ventricle (RV) remodeling. Any maneuver that increases venous return will augment a TR murmur intensity. Carvallo sign is the increased intensity of the holosystolic murmur with inspiration. Severe TR may not have an appreciable murmur on examination due to equalization of pressures between the RA and RV and loss of turbulent flow.

Lancisi sign references large, systolic, and monomorphic jugular vein pulsations that commonly are mistaken for carotid pulsations. During systole, retrograde blood flows through the incompetent TV into the RA and the internal jugular vein.

In severe TR the liver may be pulsatile, and a systolic murmur may be heard over the liver. Massive and torrential TR may induce a diastolic flow rumble. Signs of right heart failure (HF) are common including peripheral edema. Severe right HF with severe TR can result in significant hepatic and gastrointestinal congestion. The liver is often enlarged and tender due to hepatic venous congestion. Chronic hepatic venous congestion can precipitate hepatic insufficiency. Similarly renal venous congestion can lead to cardiorenal syndrome with poor urine output. Advanced right HF can result in shock due to lesser forward cardiac output, which presents with typical signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock.

### Noninvasive imaging diagnosis of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome: a pictorial review [^112R1DNP]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of SOS

Differential diagnosis of SOS includes graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and other causes of hepatic venous outflow obstruction such as Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS). GVHD is the major complication of Allogeneic-HCST and is the leading cause of early mortality after transplantation. The nature of GVHD is a T cell-mediated immune response. Although some clinical manifestations of GVHD are similar to that of SOS such as toxic reactions, weight gain, and deranged liver function tests; however, the distinctive features of GVHD are more often associated with inflammatory symptoms (e.g. pyrexia) and a series of skin illness (e.g. poikiloderma, nail dystrophy, and alopecia). At present, imaging studies have limitations in the diagnosis of GVHD, although some intestinal CT abnormalities have been found in acute GVHD after HCST in children. BSC is an obstruction from hepatic veins to the superior end of the inferior vena cava (IVC). It is characterized by centrilobular congestion and parenchymal destruction but without the endothelial cell exfoliation of the terminal hepatic vein. The primary causes of BSC include hepatic vein or IVC thrombosis, intraluminal invasion by parasite or malignancy, and extraluminal compression by solid tumor or cyst. Imaging studies play an indispensable role in providing a reliable differential diagnosis between BSC and SOS. Stenosis and obstruction of hepatic veins or IVC and the presence of abnormal blood flow signals of the intrahepatic veins observed in Doppler US show good diagnostic capabilities for BSC, with a specificity of nearly 85%. On contrast-enhanced CT images, a "mottled appearance" along with late enhancement of the perihepatic regions of the liver and around the hepatic veins may help to differentiate SOS from BCS. This type of parenchymal heterogeneity may result from the presence of venous shunts that drain central areas and the caudate lobe of the liver. This is also the reason why an enlarged caudate lobe frequently observed in patients with BCS. MRI improves the diagnostic performance of BSC by showing collateral and a spider-web network pattern of IVC. Moreover, early parenchymal necrosis caused by BSC and abnormal perfusion of affected liver segments could be better displayed by MRI multiple sequence scans.
