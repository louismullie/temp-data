## Question

In ORIF of tibial plateau fractures, what's the standard torque applied to 6.5mm cannulated screws?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the standard torque value is for 6.5 mm cannulated screws during ORIF of tibial plateau fractures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any of the provided sources actually specify a numeric torque value for 6.5 mm cannulated screws in tibial plateau fixation. Then, I should verify whether authoritative guidelines or biomechanical studies offer a practical, evidence-based approach to torque in cancellous bone. Next, I will consider the risks of overtightening and stripping in cancellous bone and how to mitigate them. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable recommendation and note limitations where the evidence is indirect or extrapolated.

> Let me first confirm whether a specific torque number appears in the supplied literature. Wait, let me verify the documents that mention 6.5 mm screws: the FDA recall lists a 6.5 mm cannulated screw product but provides no torque specification, and the skiing case series describes using two or three 6.5 mm screws for posteromedial fragments without stating torque values, so there is no explicit numeric torque in those sources [^e5f435a3] [^13a4ea2b]. I should also check the biomechanical studies on screw torque and pullout; the ovine cortical bone study shows that tightening to about 86% of maximum torque exceeds yield and reduces pullout strength, but it does not give a universal numeric torque value for 6.5 mm screws in cancellous tibial plateau bone [^d2a54169]. The human femoral head cancellous study establishes that yield occurs at roughly 85% of stripping torque, again emphasizing a proportional approach rather than a fixed number [^98c754f4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether any guideline or trial in the packet prescribes a standard torque. The Cochrane reviews and comparative studies of fixation methods focus on outcomes and complications but do not specify screw torque magnitudes, reinforcing that there is no cited standard numeric torque in this corpus for 6.5 mm cancellous screws in tibial plateau fixation [^ca30dfae] [^c3591c48] [^06b6ec49]. The "two-finger tightness" simulation study quantifies torque variability among surgeons and highlights the lack of a standardized torque target, underscoring that subjective tightening is unreliable and that torque-measuring tools may improve consistency, though again no specific 6.5 mm torque value is provided [^f25a20c6].

> I need to check the biomechanical rationale to infer a practical approach. The ovine cortical study demonstrates that tightening to approximately 86% of maximum torque surpasses yield and causes a mean 51% loss in stiffness, implying that clinical tightening should stay below that threshold to avoid iatrogenic bone damage and loss of fixation strength [^d2a54169]. The human cancellous femoral head study shows yield at about 85% of stripping torque, supporting a similar principle of stopping before yield to preserve bone-screw interface integrity [^98c754f4]. Let me consider the implication: a reasonable clinical heuristic is to tighten to something less than about 70–80% of the torque that feels like it is about to strip, recognizing that "feel" is imprecise and bone quality varies [^d2a54169] [^98c754f4].

> But wait, what if bone quality is poor or the screw is in metaphyseal cancellous bone? I should double-check whether torque correlates with pullout in osteoporotic models. In an osteoporotic cancellous surrogate, maximum insertion torque did not correlate with pullout strength, suggesting that chasing a high torque may not improve hold and may increase stripping risk; thus, tactile endpoints in soft bone are particularly unreliable and caution is warranted [^1aa00175]. This strengthens the case for a tactile-but-conservative approach with attention to screw design and thread engagement rather than a fixed torque value [^1aa00175].

> Let me synthesize a clinically actionable answer, while acknowledging the evidence gap. There is no established standard numeric torque value for 6.5 mm cannulated screws in tibial plateau ORIF in the provided sources. The safest, evidence-aligned approach is to tighten to adequate compression while avoiding overtightening that approaches stripping, generally staying below about 70–80% of the torque that feels like it is about to strip, and to adjust for bone quality and screw position; in denser subchondral bone, slightly more torque may be acceptable, whereas in osteoporotic metaphyseal bone, less torque and alternative strategies (such as raft screws, washers, or cement augmentation) should be considered to mitigate stripping and loss of reduction [^d2a54169] [^98c754f4] [^1aa00175] [^f759f506]. I should confirm that surgeons document "two-finger tightness" cautiously, given the large inter-user variability, and consider torque-limiting drivers where available to improve consistency and reduce iatrogenic bone damage [^f25a20c6].

> I should also note limitations and what would change practice. The absence of a definitive numeric torque in this packet means my recommendation is principle-based rather than a specification; if manufacturer guides or society guidelines provided a validated torque range for 6.5 mm cancellous screws in tibial plateau bone, that would supersede heuristic advice. Likewise, prospective studies correlating intraoperative torque with clinical outcomes and stripping rates could refine targets, but such data are not present here [^notfound].

There is **no universally accepted standard torque** for 6.5 mm cannulated screws in tibial plateau ORIF. Clinicians typically tighten to "two-finger tightness" [^f25a20c6] or until the screw is snug, avoiding overtightening that risks stripping in cancellous bone [^98c754f4]. Biomechanical data suggest that tightening to about 70% of the stripping torque balances fixation strength and bone integrity, but stripping torque varies with bone quality and screw position, so **individual judgment is essential** [^d2a54169] [^98c754f4]. No high-quality evidence defines a specific torque value for 6.5 mm screws in tibial plateau fixation, and current practice remains experience-based with emphasis on tactile feedback and fluoroscopic confirmation [^ca30dfae].

---

## Biomechanical considerations

- **Bone quality**: Cancellous bone in the tibial plateau is softer than cortical bone, making it more susceptible to stripping under excessive torque [^98c754f4].

- **Screw design**: 6.5 mm cannulated screws are partially threaded, designed to provide compression and stability in cancellous bone [^notfound].

- **Insertion torque**: Studies in cancellous bone models show that yield torque (the point at which bone begins to deform) is typically around 85% of the stripping torque, indicating a narrow safe window for optimal tightening [^98c754f4].

---

## Clinical evidence and expert consensus

- **Lack of standardization**: There is no universally accepted standard torque value for 6.5 mm cannulated screws in tibial plateau fractures. Most clinical studies and reviews emphasize the importance of achieving stable fixation without specifying exact torque values [^ca30dfae].

- **Two-finger tightness**: Commonly taught and practiced, this method relies on tactile feedback to avoid overtightening. However, studies show significant variability in torque application among surgeons, highlighting the need for caution and experience [^f25a20c6].

- **Manufacturer guidelines**: Implant manufacturers typically provide general instructions to tighten screws until snug, avoiding excessive force that could lead to stripping or bone damage [^notfound].

---

## Biomechanical studies and recommendations

- **Optimal torque range**: Biomechanical studies suggest that tightening screws to approximately 70% of the stripping torque provides a balance between achieving adequate compression and minimizing the risk of bone damage. However, this percentage is a guideline rather than a strict standard, as stripping torque varies with bone quality and screw position [^d2a54169].

- **Torque-limiting devices**: Some surgeons advocate for the use of torque-limiting screwdrivers to standardize insertion torque and reduce the risk of overtightening, although these devices are not universally adopted [^notfound].

- **Clinical judgment**: Given the variability in bone quality and patient-specific factors, clinical judgment remains paramount. Surgeons should rely on tactile feedback, fluoroscopic guidance, and their experience to determine the appropriate torque for each screw [^f25a20c6].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Pre-drilling and tapping**: Pre-drilling and tapping can facilitate screw insertion and reduce the risk of stripping, particularly in denser cancellous bone [^notfound].

- **Gradual tightening**: Screws should be tightened gradually, with frequent assessment of the bone-screw interface to detect early signs of stripping or bone failure [^notfound].

- **Fluoroscopic confirmation**: Intraoperative fluoroscopy should be used to confirm screw placement and ensure adequate reduction and fixation [^e7269855].

- **Postoperative monitoring**: Patients should be monitored for signs of screw loosening, loss of reduction, or other complications that may indicate inadequate fixation or excessive torque application [^82778dc6].

Background

Tibial plateau fractures, which are intra-articular injuries of the knee joint, are often difficult to treat and have a high complication rate, including early-onset osteoarthritis. The most common treatment for complex tibial plateau fractures is surgical fixation. Additionally, orthopaedic surgeons often use bone defect fillers to address bone defects caused by the injury. Currently, there is no consensus on the best method of fixation and on whether bone defect fillers are necessary.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of different surgical interventions and bone defect fillers for treating tibial plateau fractures.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries up to March 2023. We also searched conference proceedings and the grey literature.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing surgical interventions for treating tibial plateau fractures and different types of filler for bone defects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our primary outcomes (and the specific measures we considered most relevant) were generic quality of life (general health score in the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)), patient-reported lower limb function (Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score), and adverse events (frequency of unplanned reoperation). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 15 trials in the review, with a total of 948 adult participants. Nine trials compared different types of fixation, and six trials evaluated different types of bone graft substitutes. All 15 trials were small and at high risk of bias. We considered most available evidence to be of very low certainty, meaning we have very little confidence in the results. Only limited pooling was possible. One trial compared circular fixation combined with insertion of percutaneous screws (hybrid fixation) versus standard open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in 82 people with open or closed Schatzker types V or VI tibial plateau fractures. At 24 months' follow-up, hybrid fixation compared with ORIF may have little or no effect on SF-36 general health score (MD 6 points higher, 95% CI 7.7 points lower to 19.7 points higher; 66 participants), patient-reported lower limb function according to the HSS score (MD 7 points higher, 95% CI 2.4 points lower to 16.4 points higher; 66 participants), or frequency of unplanned reoperation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.32; 83 fractures (82 participants)). However, the evidence for all three outcomes is very uncertain. Three trials (with 242 participants) compared single-plating ORIF versus double-plating ORIF. There may be little to know difference in patient-reported lower limb function (HSS score) at 24 months' follow-up in people who undergo single-plating ORIF compared with those who undergo double-plating ORIF (MD 0.2 points higher, 95% CI 2.12 points lower to 2.52 points higher; 1 study, 84 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. There were no data for quality of life or unplanned reoperation at 24 months' follow-up. Six trials (including 368 participants) compared bone substitute versus autologous bone graft (autograft) for managing bone defects. No trials reported SF-36 general health score, HSS score, or frequency of unplanned reoperation at 24 months' follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to ascertain the best method of fixation or the best method of addressing bone defects during surgery in people with tibial plateau fractures. Further well-designed RCTs with larger sample sizes are warranted.

Background

Fractures of the tibial plateau, which are intra-articular injuries of the knee joint, are often difficult to treat and have a high complication rate, including early-onset osteoarthritis. Surgical fixation is usually used for more complex tibial plateau fractures. Additionally, bone void fillers are often used to address bone defects caused by the injury. Currently there is no consensus on either the best method of fixation or bone void filler.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different surgical interventions, and the use of bone void fillers, for treating tibial plateau fractures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (12 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014 Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1 2014), EMBASE (1974 to 2014 Week 36), trial registries (4 July 2014), conference proceedings and grey literature (4 July 2014).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing surgical interventions for treating tibial plateau fractures and the different types of filler for filling bone defects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Only very limited pooling, using the fixed-effect model, was possible. Our primary outcomes were quality of life measures, patient-reported outcome measures of lower limb function and serious adverse events.

Main Results

We included six trials in the review, with a total of 429 adult participants, the majority of whom were male (63%). Three trials evaluated different types of fixation and three analysed different types of bone graft substitutes. All six trials were small and at substantial risk of bias. We judged the quality of most of the available evidence to be very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about these results. One trial compared the use of a circular fixator combined with insertion of percutaneous screws (hybrid fixation) versus standard open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in people with open or closed Schatzker types V or VI tibial plateau fractures. Results (66 participants) for quality of life scores using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)), Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) scores and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function scores tended to favour hybrid fixation, but a benefit of ORIF could not be ruled out. Participants in the hybrid fixation group had a lower risk for an unplanned reoperation (351 per 1000 people compared with 450 in the ORIF group; 95% CI 197 fewer to 144 more) and were more likely to have returned to their pre-injury activity level (303 per 1000 people, compared with 121 in the ORIF group; 95% CI 15 fewer to 748 more). Results of the two groups were comparable for the WOMAC pain subscale and stiffness scores, but mean knee range of motion values were higher in the hybrid group. Another trial compared the use of a minimally invasive plate (LISS system) versus double-plating ORIF in 84 people who had open or closed bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. Nearly twice as many participants (22 versus 12) in the ORIF group had a bone graft. Quality of life, pain, knee range of motion and return to pre-injury activity were not reported. The trial provided no evidence of differences in HSS knee scores, complications or reoperation entailing implant removal or revision fixation. A quasi-randomised trial comparing arthroscopically-assisted percutaneous reduction and internal fixation versus standard ORIF reported results at 14 months in 58 people with closed Schatzker types II or III tibial plateau fracture. Quality of life, pain and return to pre-injury activity were not reported. There was very low quality evidence of higher HSS knee scores and higher knee range of motion values in the arthroscopically assisted group. No reoperations were reported. Three trials compared different types of bone substitute versus autologous bone graft (autograft) for managing bone defects. Quality of life, pain and return to pre-injury activity were not reported. Only one trial (25 participants) reported on lower limb function, finding good or excellent results in both groups for walking, climbing stairs, squatting and jumping at 12 months. The incidences of individual complications were similar between groups in all three trials. One trial found no cases of inflammatory response in the 20 participants receiving bone substitute, and two found no complications associated with the donor site in the autograft group (58 participants). However, all 38 participants in the autologous iliac bone graft group of one trial reported prolonged pain from the harvest site. Two trials reported similar range of motion results in the two groups, whereas the third trial favoured the bone substitute group.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is insufficient evidence to ascertain the best method of fixation or the best method of addressing bone defects during surgery. However, the evidence does not contradict approaches aiming to limit soft-tissue dissection and damage or to avoid autograft donor site complications through using bone substitutes. Further well-designed, larger randomised trials are warranted.

### What's new in the management of complex tibial plateau fractures? [^c32ef8ca]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

The management of complex tibial plateau fractures is ever evolving. The severity of the injury to the surrounding soft tissues influences the timing and the method of fixation. Minimal invasive techniques continue to dominate our philosophy of reduction and reconstruction whereas augmentation of depressed intra-articular fragments remains an accepted strategy to maintain reduction and prevent secondary collapse. Locking plates, conventional plates and fine wire fixators all have been used successfully with satisfactory outcomes. In this article we report on the latest advances made in the management of these complex injuries.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^bd0ac207]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the management of proximal tibial fractures in LMICs, highlighting the nuanced benefits of CREF over ORIF methods. Although statistical significance was not achieved, CREF demonstrated a favorable trend in outcomes. The CREF group showed promising trends with shorter surgical wait times, reduced blood loss, and a lower incidence of complications, particularly infections — a critical consideration in resource-constrained settings. Functional outcomes, as assessed at the final follow-up, indicated substantial improvement, aligning closely with standards observed in developed countries. Both groups achieved comparable results in terms of radiological and functional outcomes, with a slight preference toward CREF. These findings underscore the potential of CREF as a viable option for optimizing patient outcomes in LMICs, emphasizing the need for tailored perioperative strategies and continued research to further enhance surgical care and patient recovery in these challenging contexts. It is important to note that larger-scale studies are warranted to validate these results comprehensively. Nonetheless, this study lays a foundation for informed clinical decision making in settings where timely and effective interventions are crucial.

### Interference screw technique for arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation of compression fractures of the tibial plateau [^c156a442]. Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) is recommended as state-of-the-art treatment for patients with pure compression fracture of the tibial plateau. We describe a new technique for ARIF of pure compression tibial plateau fractures that uses a cannulated, bioabsorbable interference screw. After a guide pin is placed in the center of the compressed fragment and a tamp is used to elevate the fracture (with bone grafting as desired), the interference screw is advanced over the guide pin, resulting in both elevation and buttressing of the fracture. As compared with previously described techniques in which percutaneous buttress screws were used, ARIF attained with an interference screw via the tibial metaphyseal window allows substantially improved efficiency of surgical steps, improved preservation of the soft tissue envelope, definitive articular reduction under arthroscopic visualization, use of a bioabsorbable implant, and elimination of the need for fluoroscopy.

### Open reduction and internal fixation of high-energy tibial plateau fractures [^5d17fd7c]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Proximal tibial articular fractures are caused by a variety of mechanisms and are characterized by numerous distinct fracture patterns. Surgical treatment for other than minimally displaced or nondisplaced fractures is recommended to restore joint congruity and limb alignment, and to allow early, stable, knee motion.

### Hybrid external fixation for tibial plateau fractures: clinical and biomechanical correlation [^6455143e]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The biomechanical data support the use of tensioned wire fixation to stabilize complex fractures of the proximal tibia. The authors will show that the stability of a four-wire construct is comparable to the gold standard of dual plating internal fixation techniques. Using these techniques, many recent investigators have demonstrated improved clinical results, with average knee scores for most patients ranging from 85 to 90.

### Screw pullout strength: a biomechanical comparison of large-fragment and small-fragment fixation in the tibial plateau [^2b0266ea]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the pullout strengths of 6.5-millimeter diameter partially threaded cancellous screws and 4.5-millimeter diameter fully-threaded cortical screws versus 3.5-millimeter diameter cortical screws in the proximal tibia.

Design

Three screws were inserted in the lateral tibial plateau of each leg of fifteen paired cadaveric tibias. In one tibia, large-fragment fixation was used, consisting of a unicortical 6.5-millimeter screw in the subchondral bone, and bicortical 4.5-millimeter screws in the metadiaphyseal and diaphyseal bone. In the contralateral tibia, small-fragment fixation consisting of three 3.5-millimeter screws was used, placing the screws in the same positions as described above.

Main Outcome Measurements

A materials-testing machine was used to determine axial pullout strengths of each screw. The mean pullout strengths of large-fragment and small-fragment screws in each position were compared.

Results

No significant difference in pullout strengths was found between the large-fragment and small-fragment screws in subchondral and metadiaphyseal bone. A statistically significant difference was found between pullout strengths of large-fragment and small-fragment screws in diaphyseal bone.

Conclusions

In human proximal tibial bone, the data from this study do not suggest that the pullout strength of 3.5-millimeter screws differs from that of 6.5-millimeter screws in subchondral bone, or that the pullout strength of 3.5-millimeter screws differs from that of 4.5-millimeter screws in metadiaphyseal bone. However, the pullout strength of 3.5-millimeter screws is significantly less than that of 4.5-millimeter screws in diaphyseal bone. The authors of the present study believe this supports the use of small-fragment fixation in the treatment of tibial plateau fractures.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^82778dc6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative complications occurred in 13.3% of the CREF group, including superficial site infections (6.7%), septic arthritis (3.3%), and one case requiring a redo procedure because of nonunion (3.3%). In the ORIF group, 23.3% of patients experienced complications, primarily superficial site infections (10.0%) and screw loosening (13.3%). The difference in complication rates between the CREF and ORIF groups was not statistically significant (P value = 0.32).

### Effect of screw torque level on cortical bone pullout strength [^d2a54169]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were 2-fold: (1) to perform detailed analysis of cortical screw tightening stiffness during automated insertion, and (2) to determine the effect of 3 torque levels on the holding strength of the bone surrounding the screw threads as assessed by screw pullout.

Methods

Ten pairs of ovine tibiae were used with 3 test sites spaced 20 mm apart centered along the shaft. One side of each pair was used for measuring ultimate failure torque (Tmax). These Tmax and bone-density values were used to predict Tmax at contralateral tibia sites. Screws were inserted and tightened to 50%, 70%, and 90% of predicted Tmax at the contralateral sites to encompass the average clinical level of torque (86% Tmax). Pullout tests were performed and maximum force values were normalized by cortical thickness.

Results

Torque to failure tests indicated tightening to 86% Tmax occurs after yield and leads to an average 51% loss in stiffness. Normalized pullout strength for screws tightened to 50% Tmax, 70% Tmax, and 90% Tmax were 2525 ± 244, 2707 ± 280, and 2344 ± 346 N, respectively, with a significant difference between 70% Tmax and 90% Tmax groups (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Within the limitations of our study involving the testing of 1 type of screw purchase in ovine tibiae, results demonstrate that clinical levels of lag screw tightening (86% Tmax) are past the yield point of bone. Tightening to these high torque levels can cause damage leading to compromised holding strength. Further research is still required to establish the appropriate level of torque required for achieving optimal fracture fixation and healing.

### What is the patient-reported outcome and complication incidence after operative versus nonoperative treatment of minimally displaced tibial plateau fractures? [^bfb4a96c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Descriptive Data

Patients who received operative treatment for minimally displaced tibial plateau fractures did not differ from nonoperatively treated patients in terms of mean ± standard deviation age (51 ± 15 years versus 54 ± 16 years; p = 0.09), gender (64% [125 of 195] versus 72% [216 of 300] women; p = 0.07), BMI (26 ± 4 kg/m 2 versus 26 ± 5 kg/m 2; p = 0.22), smoking (21% [40 of 195] versus 17% [50 of 300]; p = 0.38), and diabetes (7% [13 of 195] versus 8% [23 of 300]; p = 0.58) (Table 1). Operatively treated fractures consisted of split depression fractures (AO/OTA B3), whereas nonoperatively treated fractures consisted more often of pure split (AO/OTA B1) and pure depression (AO/OTA B2) fractures (p < 0.001). Additionally, operatively treated fractures had slightly more articular segments involved (4 ± 2 versus 3 ± 1; p < 0.001) (Table 1).

### Part I: arthroscopic management of tibial plateau fractures [^7bef554a]. Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Arthroscopy is a valuable tool for the assessment of tibial plateau fractures and is the treatment of choice for associated intra-articular pathology. In addition, (all)-arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) is recommended for type III fractures and is a consideration for types I, II, and IV. Published outcome studies of ARIF of tibial plateau fractures describe results that appear to equal outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation, but these studies suffer from susceptibility bias.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^8e2b4641]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Proximal tibial fractures can disrupt knee joint mechanics, leading to uneven weight distribution and potentially worsening arthritis. Surgeons evaluate the MPTA and postoperative PPTA to ensure optimal alignment and reduce these risks. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the normal anatomical values of Joint Orientation Angles in Lower Extremity. In our study, the CREF group exhibited a slightly higher mean MPTA (87.24°) and a lower mean PPTA (91.41°) compared with the ORIF group, which had mean values of 87.09° and 93.64°, respectively. These differences reflect variations in surgical techniques and fixation methods between CREF and ORIF. Although our MPTA values were within the normal range, the PPTA values exceeded the upper limit of the normal range in both groups. Kulkarnee et al reported a median MPTA value of 86.9, which is similar to our findings, but their PPTA value of 79.8° was significantly better than ours. This underscores the importance of achieving proper anatomical alignment to optimize surgical outcomes.

### Open reduction and internal fixation in a one-stage anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery for the treatment of tibial plateau fractures: a case report and literature review [^7c29a8cf]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of tibial plateau fractures associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries can be challenging. Maintaining the joint surface and axis are two main principles for the management of patients with tibial plateau fractures. Herein, we describe a patient with tibial plateau fracture of Schatzker type VI associated with complete ACL rupture. Although in a two-stage reconstruction surgery for treatment of its rupture seem to be accepted by most orthopaedic surgeons in cases of ACL injuries, we treated our patient with ORIF in a one-stage ACL reconstruction surgery. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient gained full range of motion and was functioning well. We reviewed the literature on performing ORIF in a one-stage ACL reconstruction for the treatment of tibial plateau fractures, which seemed to be a reasonable management approach that supported its use for the treatment of this patient.

### Tibial plateau fracture surgical care using standardized protocols over time: a single center's longitudinal view [^859b13e3]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report on demographics, injury patterns, management strategies, and outcomes of patients who sustained fractures of the tibial plateau seen at a single center over a 16-year period.

Design

Prospective collection of data.

Patients/Participants

716 patients with 725 tibial plateau fractures, were treated by one of 5 surgeons.

Intervention

Treatment of tibial plateau fractures.

Main Outcome Measurements

Outcomes were obtained at standard time-points. Complications were recorded. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: those treated in the first 5 years, those treated in the second 5 years, and those treated in the most recent 6 years.

Results

Six hundred eight fractures were followed for a mean 13.4 months (6–120) and 82% had a minimum 1-year follow-up. Patients returned to self-reported baseline function at a consistent proportion during the 3 time periods. The average knee arc was 125 degrees (75–135 degrees) at latest follow-up and did not differ over time. The overall complication rate after surgery was 12% and did not differ between time periods. Radiographs demonstrated excellent rates of healing and low rates of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and improved articular reductions at healing (0.58 mm in Group 3 compared with 0.94 mm in Group 1 and 1.12 mm in Group 2) (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Most patients regained their baseline functional status after surgical intervention and healing. Over time the ability of surgeons to achieve a more anatomic joint reduction was observed; however, this did not correlate with improved functional outcomes.

### A new fastener with improved bone-to-implant interface shows superior torque stripping resistance compared with the standard buttress screw [^47ab32a5]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The conventional AO buttress screw used for fracture fixation relies on a historic buttress thread design, which is prone to stripping at the bone-implant interface. We hypothesized that a new Bone-Screw-Fastener with an innovative interlocking thread design demonstrates increased resistance to torque stripping forces compared with the buttress screw, without compromising pullout strength.

Methods

A biomechanical model was established in 6 matched pairs of adult human cadaveric tibiae to test torque resistance between the 3.5 mm Bone-Screw-Fastener and the 3.5 mm cortical AO buttress screw until failure. Uniaxial pullout testing of both screw types was performed as an internal control experiment.

Results

The 3.5 mm Bone-Screw-Fastener had a significantly increased resistance to torque failure compared with the standard 3.5 mm AO buttress screw (P = 0.0145). In contrast to the buttress screws, none of the Bone-Screw-Fasteners stripped from the bone but rather failed at the screwdriver-implant interface in terms of a metal-on-metal failure. The internal control experiments revealed no significant difference in axial pullout strength between the 2 implants (P = 0.47).

Conclusions

These data demonstrate the superiority of the new Bone-Screw-Fastener over the conventional AO buttress screw regarding protection from torque stripping forces. In addition, the new thread design that interlocks to the bone does not sacrifice axial pullout resistance conveyed by the buttress screw. Future controlled trials will have to validate the in vivo relevance of these findings in a clinical setting.

### Hoffa-mimicking fracture of the tibial plateau [^65e83224]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We report the case of a teenage male who had a slip and fall from a motorcycle and sustained injury to his left knee. A clinicoradiological evaluation revealed a closed displaced osteochondral fragment of the posterolateral tibial plateau. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation with two cannulated headless screws. The patient recovered uneventfully on follow-up. The Hoffa-like displaced posterolateral tibial plateau fracture with no associated ligament damage is a rare injury. Further, there are very few reported cases on the surgical approach and fixation techniques in this pattern of injury.

### Thread delamination in 4.5 mm AO cannulated screws: a small case series in the pediatric trauma population [^e7c42960]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Cannulated screw systems are self-drilling, self-tapping orthopaedic implants commonly used in fracture care in both the adult and pediatric populations. While no implant is devoid of its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages, the complications associated with cannulated screws are relatively low. Nonetheless, complications have been reported, including fractures of the screw heads and guidewires during both hardware implantation and removal. Furthermore, isolated case reports have described a unique complication in the form of thread failure with screw unraveling.–

Kupperman et al have previously summarized 8 cases of cannulated screws unraveling in a total of 6 published case reports spanning a 23-year period of time. These studies included varying diameter screw sizes from multiple manufacturers implanted in several different anatomic locations. Despite these previous reports, thread delamination can be considered a relatively under-recognized complication in the orthopaedic literature. Multiple recent thread failures at our institution have prompted further investigation into this phenomenon.

The purpose of this study is to report the occurrence of repeated hardware failures through thread delamination in the setting of a commonly used orthopaedic cannulated screw implant in a small cohort involving pediatric fracture care at a single academic level I trauma center.

### Arthroscopic treatment of lateral tibial plateau fractures: a simple technique [^5894c16b]. Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

We present a new technique for arthroscopic-assisted fluoroscopic treatment of external tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker type I, II, III), using custom-made instrumentation. The instrument includes 4 basic elements: 2 cutting guides, a hollow trephine cutter with a saw-toothed tip, and a bone plunger. The lateral plateau is restored from the opposite side. An anteromedial rectangular cortical window in the proximal diaphysis of the tibia is created using the cutting guides. To achieve the reduction, the hollow trephine cutter is introduced into the opening created. The bone plunger is inserted into the hollow trephine cutter until resistance is felt. At this point the cancellous bone is compacted by applying force onto the plunger with the hammer so as to obtain a strong compact bone carrot. The plunger then pushes it under the depressed area, filling it out and pushing it upward, creating an indirect reduction. The arthroscopy comes into play estimating the precise anatomic reduction of the articular surface of the tibia. No graft is necessary and cannulated lag screws fix and strengthen the reduction. This new technique is reproducible, easy, less invasive than others, and ensures a stable cartilage and subchondral support without the need for grafts.

### Thread delamination in 4.5 mm AO cannulated screws: a small case series in the pediatric trauma population [^6c4b1bc5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This small series reports 6 cases of thread delamination in a pediatric population associated with 4.5 mm AO cannulated stainless-steel screws, most commonly in the setting of fixation of medial humeral epicondyle fractures. It is important to note that each case that occurred at our institution generated an occurrence report internally, which according to standard procedure was subsequently entered into a reporting system to the United States Food and Drug Administration. Each case was also submitted for consideration for presentation at our department's morbidity and mortality conference. While previous case reports and a small case series have been reported on this phenomenon,–this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest single study to date involving one specific implant occurring over a relatively short period of time. AO screws remain widely accepted in orthopaedic fracture fixation and this seemingly recent development is therefore concerning.

Although the surgical technique guide for the orthopaedic implant referenced in the current study does include a cannulated tap for use in subjectively denser bone, it is important to emphasize that predrilling and pretapping are unnecessary in the majority of cases as the implants themselves contain self-drilling and self-tapping flutes. This is consistent with the technique utilized in the current study in that none of the cases were predrilled or pretapped over the length of the screw. While it is plausible to suggest that predrilling and pretapping along the entirety of the guidewire may help to avoid this phenomenon, it does not explain why 5 of these cases have occurred within an 18-month period in the current study.

Kupperman et alhave previously summarized 8 cases of cannulated screw unraveling, including 7 cases in 5 previously published studies and 1 single case from their own institution. These cases were of majority male patients (7/8; 88%), included a range of patient ages from 12 to 38 years, as well as involved multiple anatomic locations, including the proximal and distal humerus, proximal and distal tibia and the medial cuneiform. In their review, thread diameters varied from 4.0 to 5.0 mm, involved multiple companies and the majority of cases did not involve predrilling (6/8; 75%). The 2 cases that did perform predrilling only involved the outer cortex. The metal composition (eg, titanium or stainless steel) or thread type (eg, partial, full) of the screws were not reported in all cases.

### Lag screw fixation of medial malleolar fractures: a biomechanical, radiographic, and clinical comparison of unicortical partially threaded lag screws and bicortical fully threaded lag screws [^f2fca577]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Bicortical fully threaded (FT) lag screw fixation (lag by method) is a technique for medial malleolar fixation that may provide advantages to partially threaded (PT) cancellous lag screws (lag by screw design). A direct comparison of the biomechanical properties and the clinical outcomes of these 2 methods of medial malleolar lag screw fixation were undertaken. The null hypotheses were that unicortical PT lag screws and bicortical FT lag screws had similar biomechanical and clinical outcomes.

Design

Biomechanics — Human cadaver biomechanical investigation. Clinical-Retrospective cohort series with control. Settings-Level-1 trauma center.

Patients

One hundred forty-one consecutive patients with closed medial malleolar fractures (OTA 44) treated with lag screw fixation were identified from a prospective orthopaedic trauma database. Thirty-nine were lost to follow-up and 12 were treated with a single screw leaving 46 in the PT group and 46 in the FT group all treated with 2 screws for their medial malleolar fracture.

Intervention

Biomechanics — Human cadavers (n = 3) had bilateral oblique medial malleolar fractures (n = 6) created with an osteotome to simulate a typical medial malleolar fracture amenable to lag screw fixation. Fixation of each side was randomly allocated to either two 4.0-mm PT lag screws (length 45 mm) or two 3.5-mm FT threaded screws [length determined by depth gauge after near cortex overdrilled and far cortex (distal lateral tibia) drilled based on core diameter (2.7 mm)]. Clinical-Either 2 traditional PT (n = 46) or 2 FT screws (n = 46) were used for fixation of medial malleolus fractures.

Main Outcome Measurements

Biomechanics — Peak insertion torque generated during screw insertion. Clinical: Radiographic evidence of screw loosening, clinical non-union, and reoperation.

Results

Biomechanics — The FT lag screw group (n = 6 screws) showed an average maximum torque of 14.4 in-lbf (range 8.0–20.1, SD = 4.4) before screw stripping. This was over 3 times greater than that seen with the PT lag screws (n = 6) (average maximum torque generation = 4.0 in-lbf, range 2.5–6.6, SD = 1.4), P < 0.0002. Clinical-Radiographic screw loosening was evident in one of the 46 patients (2%) in the FT cohort and in 11 of the 46 patients (24%) in the PT cohort, P < 0.003. Two of the patients with screw loosening in the PT cohort required reoperation for removal of symptomatic hardware, whereas no patient from the LT screw group required removal. All patients in the LT cohort healed after the index procedure although 2 in the PT cohort had nonunions.

Conclusions

Screws placed with the lag by method technique that engaged the distal lateral tibial cortex have superior biomechanical, radiographic, and clinical outcomes compared to traditional PT screws for the fixation of medial malleolar fractures.

### Fixation of tibial pilon fractures with percutaneous cannulated screws [^57db1789]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

Closed reduction and internal fixation with percutaneous cannulated screws was performed on seven patients with closed pilon fractures. The mean follow-up was 30.6 months. They were assessed using a subjective scoring system. The average score was 90.8/100. This method of fixation avoids extensive soft tissue dissection and gives excellent results. To our knowledge, this method of closed reduction and stabilisation of pilon fractures solely by percutaneously inserted cannulated screws has not been previously reported.

### Thread delamination in 4.5 mm AO cannulated screws: a small case series in the pediatric trauma population [^1fa611b5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical Technique

The surgeons involved in the current study who collectively performed the involved cases included in this report each utilize a standard surgical technique for implanting 4.5 mm AO cannulated stainless-steel screws. Briefly, a guidewire was inserted across the relevant fracture site, driven toward the far cortex and confirmed using multiplanar fluoroscopy. At this juncture, a 3.2 mm drill bit was introduced to predrill a portion of the proximal screw length. The necessary screw length was then measured, and a 4.5 mm cannulated screw was then inserted using a hand screwdriver over the guidewire with the final position confirmed fluoroscopically. One of the surgeons involved in this study utilizes a washer with final screw placement.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performing using a standard statistical software package (SAS; IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) and de-identified before further analysis. Where applicable, descriptive statistics were calculated, and study variables were reported as a mean and range. Fisher exact test was utilized to compare the rate of thread delamination in the current study to the rate of 1 in 6500 per month worldwide provided by the manufacturer. Time points within our cohort were also compared.

### Morbidity and mortality after surgical management of tibial plateau fractures in octogenarians [^e405e4eb]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Tibial plateau fractures are most common in patients aged 30 to 60 years, often resulting from higher energy mechanisms of injury such as a pedestrian struck, fall from height, or motor vehicle collision. These fractures are often managed operatively except when minimally displaced. Nonsurgical management may also be indicated in the setting of multiple medical comorbidities making surgery too high risk, although this is rare in the younger population that typically sustains this injury. Recently, as the population ages, tibial plateau fractures are becoming more common in the elderly population and make up approximately 8% of all total fractures in those older than 65 years. When displaced, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is the standard of care for these injuries, with the primary goal being restoration of the mechanical axis of the extremity and articular surface congruity. Geriatric tibial plateau fractures present unique challenges when managed operatively because they may exhibit a high degree of comminution, extensive surrounding soft tissue damage, and a bicondylar pattern despite lower energy mechanisms. These more complex injuries lend to longer surgical times, often requiring multiple surgical approaches, which may further increase risk for perioperative complications. Despite the added complexity, literature has shown clinical outcomes to be relatively good in this population. However, the functional and physiological status varies within the geriatric population. A better understanding of the potential complications as they relate to increasing age is critical because these fractures are becoming more common. The purpose of this study was to compare the complications after ORIF of tibial plateau fractures in patients aged 65 to 79 years with those in patients aged 80 to 89 years.

### Open reduction and internal fixation of the tibial plateau through the anterolateral approach [^08cbed25]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

Fractures of the tibial plateau are challenging injuries to treat. The lateral tibial plateau is fractured more commonly than the medial plateau and the workhorse approach for these fractures is the anterolateral approach. This approach allows visualization of the lateral joint, metaphysis, and can be extensile if there is shaft extension. We present our technique for performing the anterolateral approach while treating a Schatzker III tibial plateau fracture. Special attention is given to performing a submeniscal arthrotomy to view the joint surface and judge the reduction. A femoral distractor is placed to assist with elevation the joint surface and visualization of the lateral plateau. A cortical window is created using a triple reamer from the sliding hip screw set. The reduction is performed and supported with cancellous bone chips. Finally, a lateral locking plate with rafting screws is placed. Knowledge of this approach and the strategies needed to address lateral and some bicondlar tibial plateau fractures are crucial to good patient outcomes.

### Two-finger tightness: what is It? Measuring torque and reproducibility in a simulated model [^f25a20c6]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Residents in training are often directed to insert screws using "two-finger tightness" to impart adequate torque but minimize the chance of a screw stripping in bone. This study seeks to quantify and describe two-finger tightness and to assess the variability of its application by residents in training.

Methods

Cortical bone was simulated using a polyurethane foam block (30-pcf density) that was prepared with predrilled holes for tightening 3.5 × 14-mm long cortical screws and mounted to a custom-built apparatus on a load cell to capture torque data. Thirty-three residents in training, ranging from the first through fifth years of residency, along with 8 staff members, were directed to tighten 6 screws to two-finger tightness in the test block, and peak torque values were recorded. The participants were blinded to their torque values.

Results

Stripping torque (2.73 ± 0.56 N·m) was determined from 36 trials and served as a threshold for failed screw placement. The average torques varied substantially with regard to absolute torque values, thus poorly defining two-finger tightness. Junior residents less consistently reproduced torque compared with other groups (0.29 and 0.32, respectively).

Conclusions

These data quantify absolute values of two-finger tightness but demonstrate considerable variability in absolute torque values, percentage of stripping torque, and ability to consistently reproduce given torque levels. Increased years in training are weakly correlated with reproducibility, but experience does not seem to affect absolute torque levels. These results question the usefulness of two-finger tightness as a teaching tool and highlight the need for improvement in resident motor skill training and development within a teaching curriculum. Torque measuring devices may be a useful simulation tools for this purpose.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^28bdb1b7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Complex fractures of the proximal tibia's articular surface known as tibial plateau fractures may also affect the tibia's metaphysis and diaphysis. These can result from various causes such as motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries, falls, and low-energy trauma in older individuals. These fractures correspond to 1% of all fractures and 8% in geriatrics. These fractures are often classified using the Schatzker classification and the AO/OTA classification. Schatzker type V and VI fractures are high-energy fractures often accompanied by other local and systemic injuries. Postoperative complications such as wound healing problems, infections, and secondary degenerative arthritis are quite common.

They present a significant challenge for orthopedic surgeons and are associated with a guarded prognosis. The goal of treating a tibial plateau fracture is to stabilize the knee joint while restoring articular congruency and a pain-free range of motion by fragment-specific fixation. Most patients have significant residual dysfunction even after the completion of treatment.

Tibial plateau fractures present a challenging clinical scenario, with various treatment options available. Standard open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using plates has been the benchmark, but approaches, such as closed reduction and external fixation (CREF) with Ilizarov rings or hybrid fixators, remain an alternative option in many parts of the world particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where safe ORIF is not readily available. However, controversy surrounds the optimal management of Schatzker type V and VI fractures. Despite successful ORIF outcomes in terms of fracture reduction and stability, complications remain a concern, including deep wound infections and unplanned secondary procedures. As an alternative, Ilizarov ring fixation, offers a reasonable approach, although it comes with its own challenges, such as external fixator maintenance and the risk of pin tract infections leading to fracture collapse.

Given the complexity and challenging nature of Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures, understanding the optimal treatment approach is crucial. By evaluating both CREF and ORIF methods, this study aims to provide valuable insights that can enhance patient outcomes and guide clinical decision making. The authors hypothesized that patients treated with the Ilizarov fixator (CREF) would achieve superior outcomes compared with those undergoing ORIF.

Our research contributes novel perspectives to the existing literature, emphasizing practical considerations for orthopedic surgeons in LMICs.

Results

Study selection

Of the 126 articles identified in the search, 104 did not meet the eligibility criteria after abstract review and were excluded; 22 articles underwent full-text review (Fig. 1). Subsequently, 10 articles were excluded and 12 studies were included in the systematic review.

Fig. 1
Flow diagram of study selection

Study characteristics

The key characteristics of the studies included in the systematic review are summarized in Table 1. Of the studies included, five were prospective studies and seven were retrospective studies. The number of patients included in the studies ranged from 10 to 54 (total = 353). The proportion of male patients in the studies ranged from 10.0 to 75.6%, with 7 of 12 studies including a majority (> 50%) of male patients. The mean age of patients ranged from 36 to 72 years, although the mean age of patients was in the 41–49 years 7 of 12 studies. The type of Schatzker fracture classification was variable between studies, although the majority of (or all) patients in most studies had type I–III fractures. All patients in the 2003 study reported by Chan et al. had type V or VI fractures, while the majority (> 50%) of patients in the 2008 study reported by Chan et al. had type IV–VI fractures. Alternative fracture classification systems (Association for Osteosynthesis/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation and AO-Müller/Orthopaedic Trauma Association) were used in the studies reported by Lobenhoffer et al. and Asik et al; the majority (≥ 89%) of patients in these two studies had type B1–B3 fractures. The type of graft material used varied between studies. The method of fixation most commonly used (8 of 12 studies) was screw fixation. The length of follow-up was reported in 11 of the 12 studies and ranged from a mean of 24–87 months. A length of follow-up from 34 to 38 months was reported in five studies.

### Comparable incidence of periprosthetic tibial fractures in cementless and cemented unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fb7128c8]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Periprosthetic tibial fracture types in unicompartmetnal knee arthroplasty (UKA) seen on radiographs. I–II: Fracture line extending from the corner of the tibial resection to the medial cortex, resulting in a large (I) or small (II) medial plateau fracture. These fracture lines were identified on the anteroposterior (AP) view in patients with different implant designs. III: Varus subsidence or anterior subsidence of the tibia component, resulting in a small medial fragment fracture. These fractures were identified on the AP view. IV: Fracture line extending from the screw fixation to the posterior cortex, resulting in a posteromedial plateau fracture. The fracture line could not be identified on the AP view but only on the lateral view in a patient with a cementless fixed-bearing UKA with screw fixation. V: Fracture line extending from the tibial keel to the medial cortex, resulting in a medial plateau fracture. These fracture lines were identified on the AP view in patients with Oxford Partial Knee implants. VI: Two fracture lines extending from the corner of the tibial resection to the medial and lateral cortex after traumatic event six years postoperatively, resulting in a bicondylar plateau fracture. The fracture line was identified on the AP view in a patient with a lateral UKA

Based on information from 167 fractures, 85 (51%) periprosthetic tibial fractures were treated with TKA (with metal augmentation and/or tibial stem extension), 38 (23%) with ORIF, and 44 (26%) with conservative treatment. Authors reported that eight fractures, initially treated conservatively, underwent a subsequent TKA; six fractures, initially treated with ORIF, underwent a subsequent TKA; one fracture, initially treated conservatively, underwent ORIF; and one fracture, initially treated conservatively, underwent ORIF and eventually needed a TKA.

### Comparison of open reduction and internal fixation versus closed reduction and percutaneous fixation for medial malleolus fractures [^a6271701]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Patients

After obtaining institutional review board approval, 490 consecutive patients who underwent fixation for an MM fracture from 2011 to 2015 were retrospectively identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes for open treatment of ankle fractures (MM, 27766; bimalleolar, 27814). Clinical records and radiographs were reviewed to identify those eligible for inclusion. To meet inclusion criteria, patients must have sustained a closed MM fracture that was managed definitively with internal fixation and must have been clinically followed until union occurred or the patient was given the diagnoses of nonunion. Exclusion factors were open fractures, pilon fractures, ipsilateral tibial shaft fractures, pathologic fractures, fractures in children (ie, < 18 years of age), and patients without preoperative clinical and/or radiographic data. After applying exclusion criteria, there were 165 patients included in the study group, consisting of 31 in the CRPF group and 134 in the ORIF group. Group inclusion was determined through reading surgical reports, with the CRPF group including patients with a medial wound or with wounds limited to stab incisions made for hardware insertion only, and the ORIF group including longer incisions that involved direct fracture visualization with either subsequent screw, plate and screw, or tension band fixation.

Injury patterns were assessed on initial injury radiographs; those included were isolated MM fractures, bimalleolar fractures, and trimalleolar fractures. Based on the Orthopaedic Trauma Association fracture classification system (44), the patterns included were groups 44-A2, A3, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3.

Surgical Protocol

All surgeries were performed at an academic tertiary care center in a standard manner by one of five attending orthopaedic surgeons who were fellowship trained in either orthopaedic trauma or foot and ankle surgery. All surgeons performed both CRPF and ORIF techniques. Fixation techniques varied based on surgeons' preference and patient and fracture specifics. For the ORIF technique, an incision was made over the fracture; the MM fracture was débrided and reduced under direct visualization. Fixation was then performed with either screws, a buttress plate, or a tension band construct. For CRPF, no incision was made for fracture reduction. A pointed reduction clamp was applied percutaneously to reduce the fracture. Guidewires were inserted to enable passage of cannulated screws through stab incisions. Fluoroscopy was used in all cases of ORIF and CRPF.

### Should full threaded compression screws be used in adult femoral neck fractures? [^a26c465a]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Operative treatment consisting of fracture reduction and fixation, or arthroplasty to permit early patient mobilization, continues to be the treatment of choice for most femoral neck fractures. Options for internal fixation have included a variety of implants; however most recent reports and textbooks cite parallel multiple cancellous screws as the surgical technique of choice.

Methods

The study was prospective, randomized and IRB approved. Inclusion criteria included skeletal maturity, closed femoral neck fracture without concomitant fractures or injuries with complete charts and adequate radiographs obtained from the initial injury till the last follow-up. Forty-four patients were enrolled in this study during one-year period at two university centers. 22 were randomized to be treated with full threaded, cannulated compression screws (Acutrak 6/7, ACUMED) (Group 1) and the other 22 with 16mm partial threaded, 6.5mm or 7.3mm cannulated screws (SYNTHES) (Group 2). Three or four screws were used in both groups according to fracture type and surgeon's preference. Data evaluated included surgical time, fluoroscopy time, fracture type, radiological outcome, complications and functional status using the Harris Hip Score.

Results

Both groups were comparable in terms of age and gender. There was not a significant difference in terms of surgical time, follow-up period, fracture type, or fluoroscopy time. There were eight complications in Group 1 and two in Group 2 (P = 0.049) Time to union was significantly longer in Group 1 (P = 0.001). However, Hip Scores were not significantly different in both groups (P = 0.20).

Conclusion

When compared with full threaded compression screws, partial-threaded cannulated screws provides a shorter union time and less complication rate while providing equivalent functional results in adult femoral neck fractures.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes following arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures: a systematic review [^14289e24]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tibial plateau fractures, which are typically caused by high-energy trauma or osteoporosis in older adults, comprise approximately 1% of all fractures. These fractures are typically characterized using the Schatzker system, in which fractures are classified as type I–VI, where type I is indicated by pure cleavage of the lateral plateau, type II is indicated by lateral splitting with depression, type III is indicated by pure depression of the lateral plateau, type IV is indicated by medial plateau fracture with or without an intercondylar fracture, type V is indicated by bicondylar fracture, and type VI is indicated by unicondylar or bicondylar tibial plateau fracture with an extension separating the metaphysis and diaphysis. Tibial plateau fractures are often complex (estimates suggest that 30–35% are bicondylar) and commonly occur with associated soft tissue injury. As such, treatment can be very challenging for the surgeon. Unsurprisingly, many different surgical techniques and approaches have been described for the management of tibial plateau fractures; however, there is a lack of clear definitive information in the literature as to which is the most appropriate technique.

As with any fracture, the aim of surgery in the management of tibial plateau fractures is to restore the normal anatomy, repair soft tissue injuries, and facilitate the return to normal physiological functioning. The two major surgical techniques currently employed for tibial plateau fractures are open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and arthroscopic-assisted reduction and internal fixation (AARIF). Being less invasive, AARIF has a clear advantage over ORIF. Evidence suggests that various complications, including pin tract and deep infection, loss of reduction, and septic arthritis are relatively common with ORIF. Of note, overall morbidity has been reported to be lower with AARIF compared with ORIF due to the decreased invasiveness of the approach. AARIF also allows for direct and precise examination of intra-articular lesions. As such, the use of AARIF has been advocated for the management of all tibial plateau fractures.

Over the last 10–15 years, the findings from a number of studies have been published reporting on outcomes following AARIF for the management of tibial plateau fractures. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of clinical outcomes and determine whether this may be a viable technique, a systematic review of the literature on arthroscopic management (all types) of tibial plateau fractures was carried out. Specifically, the review focused on identifying studies reporting clinical and radiological outcomes, as well as the occurrence of postoperative osteoarthritis.

### Less invasive stabilization system (LISS) for fractures of the proximal tibia: indications, surgical technique and preliminary results of the UMC clinical trial [^a9306fc3]. Injury (2003). Low credibility.

The surgical treatment of proximal tibia fractures, with or without intraarticular involvement, is associated with well-described patterns of failure and significant complication rates. Recent surgical advances allow for a minimally invasive approach to such injuries, which may improve healing times, increase union rates, and decrease complication rates. The Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS) for proximal tibia fractures employs a laterally based fixed angled implant, allowing for the placement of locking screws proximal and distal to the fracture, which may be placed percutaneously. This manuscript presents the surgical technique and indications of the Tibia LISS. A preview of the early clinical results of the treatment of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures and proximal tibia diaphysis will also be presented.

### Increased insertion torque delays pin-bone interface loosening in external fixation with tapered bone screws [^25c4df0b]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the null hypothesis that osseomechanical integration is not related to the maximum insertion torque of tapered external fixation pins.

Design

Prospective in vivo study in a functionally loading ovine model. In 12 animals, tapered commercial external fixation pins were inserted at predefined locations with measured insertion torques and extraction torque measured at 10 weeks postoperatively.

Setting

Unrestricted stall activity under veterinary supervision.

Interventions

Under general anesthesia and aseptic conditions, mid-diaphyseal tibial osteotomies were created and a 3-mm gap width stabilized with a custom-made, high-precision, single-sided external fixator, in compliance with United Kingdom government regulations [Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986].

Main Outcome Measurements

Primary pin site stability and interface load were assessed by measuring maximum insertion torque (Nm). At a 10-week postoperative end point, osseomechanical stability was assessed by measuring the extraction torque and a pin performance index determined from the insertion/extraction torque ratio.

Results

A positive correlation was found between extraction torque and insertion torque (R2 = 0.322, P < 10(-6)). All pins with an insertion torque equal to or greater than 7 Nm had a measurable extraction torque, as did 98% of the pins with an insertion torque above 5 Nm. Extraction torque decreased both as a function of pin site position by the postoperative end point. High insertion torques were found to enhance end point stability in both diaphyseal and metaphyseal bone.

Conclusion

The data from this study indicate that tapered external fixation pins should be inserted with a high torque to enhance the long-term integrity of the pin-bone interface.

### Circular external fixation in the treatment of complex tibial plateau fractures [^4739b4b5]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Complex tibial plateau fractures continue to challenge orthopaedic surgeons because of the difficulty in obtaining an anatomic reduction of the joint, axial alignment of the articular segment, while avoiding complications. Despite overall good results, significant complications persist with internal fixation, particularly in cases with compromised soft tissues, open fractures, bone loss, extensive comminution, compartment syndrome, extensor mechanism disruption, or significant osteopenia. Circular external fixation offers advantages in these situations because of its unique biomechanics, adaptability, and percutaneous techniques. The method limits incisions to only those needed to optimize reduction. Fixation of the articular surface and metaphyseal region is by a combination of small-diameter lag screws and olive wires ± half pins. Fixation of the shaft is with half pins from 1 or 2 rings. The articular fixation block can be connected to the distal ring block by threaded rods, trauma struts, or hexapod struts. Extension of the frame across the knee is useful in selected cases to protect injured soft tissue or extensor mechanism, provide distraction, and prevent a flexion contracture. Excellent results have been achieved with this technique and may have a lower complication rate than internal fixation in complex injuries.

### Open reduction and internal fixation of intraarticular tibial plateau nonunions [^bab84297]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

The vast majority of tibial plateau fractures heal uneventfully, and no case series on intraarticular tibial plateau nonunions exists. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the radiographic and clinical outcome of these nonunions following surgical treatment in a single surgeon series. Five patients with tibial plateau nonunions were treated at our institution using a specific treatment protocol consisting of open reduction and debridement, deformity correction, internal fixation including lag screws, bone graft augmentation, and selective knee joint arthrolysis. Patient outcomes were assessed using radiographs and the Knee Society questionnaire scores. Following surgical treatment of the nonunion, all healed at an average of 12.8 weeks, and average follow-up was 44 months. Preoperative coronal plane deformity was corrected in all patients. The final knee motion arc averaged 120 degrees postoperatively. Both the pain and function subscales of the Knee Society Rating scale improved significantly. Four of the five returned to their normal pre-injury activities, but two patients required total knee arthroplasty which was performed successfully after healing of the nonunion. With meticulous surgical technique and a standard protocol, healing may be reliably achieved. Arthrosis occurs frequently, and may occur primarily at the time of injury or from chronic alteration of intraarticular contact forces secondary to development of a nonunion.

### Periarticular raft constructs and fracture stability in split-depression tibial plateau fractures [^bf92dff0]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate relative fracture stability yielded by screws placed above a lateral plate, as well as locking and non-locking screws placed through a plate in a split depression tibia plateau fracture model.

Methods

Cadaver tibia specimens (mean age 74.1 years) were randomised across 3 groups: Groups 1: raft-construct outside the plate, 2: non-locking raft screws through the plate, and 3: locking raft screws through the plate. Displacement of the depressed fragment was recorded with force values from 400N to 1600N in increasing 400N increments. The force required to elicit lateral plateau fragment displacement of 5mm, 10mm, and 15mm was also recorded.

Results

None of the mechanical testing results demonstrated statistical significance with p-values of < 0.05. Cyclic testing of Groups 1, 2, and 3 at 400N revealed displacements of 0.54mm, 0.64mm, and 0.48mm, respectively. At 800N, displacements were 1.36mm, 1.4mm, and 1.4mm, respectively. At 1200N, displacements were 2.4mm, 1.9mm, and 2.1mm, respectively. At 1600N, displacements were 2.8mm, 2.5mm, and 2mm, respectively. Resistance to displacement data demonstrated the mean force required to displace the fracture 5mm in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 250N, 330N, and 318N, respectively. For 10mm of displacement, forces required were 394N, 515N, and 556N, respectively. For 15mm of displacement, forces required were 681N, 853N, and 963N, respectively. Compared to combined groups using screws through the plate, Group 1 demonstrated lower displacement ≤ 800N, but demonstrated greater displacement > 800N. Group 2 demonstrated greatest resistance to plateau displacement of 5mm compared to Group 1 or 3, while Group 3 was most resistant to greater displacement. The combined group using screws through the plate (Groups 2+3) was consistently more resistant than Group 1 at all levels of displacement.

Conclusions

Designs utilising screws through the plate trended towards statistically significant improved stability against plateau displacement relative to utilising screws outside the plate. Our study also suggests that there is no significant benefit of locking screws over non-locking screws in this unicondylar tibia plateau fracture model.

### Plate fixation with hydroxyapatite-coated screws: a comparative loaded study [^fa977d59]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

The authors evaluated whether AO/ASIF screws coated with hydroxyapatite are better fixed than standard screws in a highly loaded plate fixation animal study. Twelve sheep were divided into two groups. The medial tibial middiaphysis was exposed and a 5-mm long bone cylinder was removed. The tibiae were fixed with six-hole dynamic compression plates. Six sheep received standard AO/ASIF stainless steel cortical screws (Group A), and six sheep received AO/ASIF stainless steel cortical screws coated with hydroxyapatite (Group B). Three months after surgery, the sheep were euthanized. The mean screw insertion torque was 4800 ± 768 N/mm in Group A and 4847 ± 450 N/mm in Group B. The mean screw extraction torque was 530 ± 374 N/mm in Group A and 3733 ± 849 N/mm in Group B. Extraction torque of Group A was significantly lower compared with the corresponding insertion torque. In Group B, there were no differences between extraction and insertion torque. Morphologic analyses showed marked fibrous tissue encapsulation in Group A and bone to screw direct contact in Group B. The results confirm that hydroxyapatite-coated AO/ASIF screws prevent deterioration of screw anchorage, even under highly loaded conditions. By using hydroxyapatite-coated screws, complications resulting from inadequate fixation could be avoided.

### Arthroscopy-assisted reduction of posteromedial tibial plateau fractures with buttress plate and cannulated screw construct [^6e53e297]. Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present the radiologic and clinical results of posteromedial fractures treated with arthroscopy-assisted reduction and buttress plate and cannulated screw fixation.

Methods

Twenty-five patients with posteromedial tibial plateau fractures treated by the described technique were included in this study. According to the Schatzker classification, there were 5 type IV fractures (20%), 2 type V fractures (8%), and 18 type VI fractures (72%). The mean age at operation was 46 years (range, 21 to 79 years). The mean follow-up period was 86 months (range, 60 to 108 months). Clinical and radiologic outcomes were scored by the Rasmussen system. Subjective data were collected to assess swelling, difficulty climbing stairs, joint stability, ability to work and participate in sports, and overall patient satisfaction with recovery. Secondary osteoarthritis was diagnosed when radiographs showed a narrowed joint space in the injured knee at follow-up in comparison with the films taken at the time of injury.

Results

The mean postoperative Rasmussen clinical score was 25.9 (range, 18 to 29), and the mean radiologic score was 15.8 (range, 10 to 18). All 25 fractures achieved successful union, and 92% had good or excellent clinical and radiologic results. The 3 fracture types did not significantly differ in Rasmussen scores or rates of satisfactory results (P > .05). Secondary osteoarthritis was noted in 6 injured knees (24%).

Conclusions

Arthroscopy-assisted reduction with buttress plate and cannulated screw fixation can restore posteromedial tibial plateau fractures of the knee with well-documented radiographic healing, good clinical outcomes, and low complication rates.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, therapeutic case series.

### The role of far cortical endosteal fixation for the treatment of medial malleolus fractures: a biomechanical study [^5359cd0e]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The traditional method for fixation of medial malleolus fractures has been with partially threaded (PT) lag screws extending beyond the physeal scar. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical strength of an innovative method of fixation for medial malleolus fractures using a fully threaded (FT) lag screw that extends to the far endosteal cortex. Medial malleolus fractures were simulated in 12 matched cadaver pairs. A single PT 4.0-mm cancellous lag screw was placed in 1 ankle. The contralateral ankle of the same matched pair received an FT 3.5-mm cortical lag screw that extended to the far lateral tibial cortex and achieved endosteal purchase. Final torque of both screw configurations was recorded, and radiographs were taken to confirm appropriate screw placement. Average torque for the PT cancellous screws was 5.02 ± 2.34 in-lb. Average torque for the FT cortical screw was 7.63 ± 3.86 in-lb (p = .002). Visual and radiographic inspections revealed no displacement of the fracture site with use of the FT endosteal lag screw. Our results indicate superior biomechanical torque with far endosteal fixation with use of an FT cortical lag screw versus a traditional PT cancellous lag screw in a cadaver model. Far endosteal fixation is an alternative surgical option for medial malleolus fractures that provides added strength compared with PT lag screws and may obviate downsides associated with bicortical fixation.

### Radiological outcome measures indicate advantages of precontoured locking compression plates in elderly patients with split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau (AO41B3) [^3a98081b]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study revealing superior radiological outcome measures in AO41B3-fractures after ORIF utilizing precontoured LCP compared to conventional implants, in both young and elderly patients. The effects are significant in young and even more pronounced in elderly patients. Strongpoints of the study are exclusively investigating split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau, comparable CT-morphological fracture characteristics (area and maximum depression depth of the joint surface fragments, calculated bony void volume) and void filling rates across the implant-specific subgroups as well as a sufficient statistical power for the separated evaluation in young and elderly patient cohorts.

To date, the literature has shown rather conflicting data on the potential benefit in outcome measures when utilizing LCP in split-depression fractures. The data situation is thereby confounded by studies insufficiently separating the heterogeneous patient subgroups underlying the bimodular age distribution pattern of split-depression fractures as well as by studies investigating mixed tibial plateau fracture entities, even though split-depression fractures often represent the majority of cases. The bimodular age distribution pattern is due to mainly male young patients and predominately female elderly patients. For the present study, this was shown in a larger population of 104 patients with AO41B3-fractures and ORIF prior to applying the exclusion criteria (Figure 2) as well as in the cohorts of finally included patients (Table 3). Comparable observation in populations of mixed tibial plateau fractures entities (Schatzker I-VI) were reported by others. Despite the fact that the prevalence of osteoporosis is significantly higher in elderly patientsand that the proximal tibia represents a predilection site of osteoporosis-associated loss of bone mineral density, trabecular connectivity, and subchondral cortical bone thickness, no significant differences regarding the area of the depressed joint surface fragments, the maximum depression depth, and the calculated bony void volume were detected when comparing the groups of young and elderly patients (Table 3). Furthermore, no significant differences regarding the radiological outcome measures at final follow-up were evident when comparing young and elderly patients prior to implant-specific subgrouping (Figure 3). It is noteworthy in the context that the frequency of void filling during the ORIF was significantly higher in the elderly group (P = 0.02). The frequency of void filling in the treatment of tibial plateau fractures varies considerably cross the available studies. – Due to a lack of well-designed studies, the specific effects of void filling on the outcome after tibial plateau fractures has not yet been precisely determined. Furthermore, a clear consensus and mandatory recommendations regarding the indication for void filling are still missing. Against this background, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of the void filling frequency in the presented groups and subgroups with regards to the radiological outcome.

### Skiers and snowboarders have improved short-term outcomes with immediate fixation of tibial plateau fractures [^3216b1be]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Table 4
Characteristics and short-term outcomes of skiers and snowboarders with high-energy or low-energy isolated tibial plateau fractures by immediate or delayed open reduction internal fixation (n = 119)

Overall, the immediate fixation population had procedures initiated well within the 24-hour window and were performed at a median of 6.9 hours. A post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate our definition of immediate as ≤ 24 hours after injury. We compared ORIF at < 12 hours, 12–24 hours and > 24 hours after injury and found the same differences in outcomes; the < 12 and 12–24 hour groups were not statistically different from one another and had more favorable outcomes than those with ORIF after 24 hours.

### Triplane fracture of the proximal tibia [^d421ead1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
CT scan further defining the injury.

Under general anesthetic, the patient was positioned in the supine position with the thigh in a leg holder, and the foot of the table was dropped. A standard high lateral arthroscopy portal was created, and a diagnostic examination was performed. A large hemarthrosis was initially noted. A shaver was introduced through a medial portal, and after extensive débridement, adequate visualization was achieved. Mild fraying of the white-white zone of the body of the lateral meniscus was noted as well as the fracture line of the tibia in the lateral compartment with 4 mm of gapping and interposed hematoma. There were no other injuries noted in the knee. The frayed meniscus was débrided. Under fluoroscopy, two guidewires for 4.0-mm cannulated screws were inserted from the lateral tibial plateau across the epiphysis, roughly perpendicular to the fracture line. The outer cortex was overdrilled, and two partially threaded 60-mm cannulated screws were advanced over the pins. Orthogonal fluoroscopy demonstrated appropriate transepiphyseal screw position, and the fracture was appropriately reduced under arthroscopic visualization (Figure 3). Postoperatively, the patient was discharged home in a knee immobilizer with instructions for 6 weeks of non–weight bearing on the extremity. At his 6-week follow-up, the fracture was healing in the anatomic position (Figure 4), and he was transitioned to full weight bearing with instructions to avoid sports and other rigorous activities for another 4 weeks. Plans were made to see him back at 6 to 12 months to rule out growth disturbance and to discuss the pros and cons of screw removal.

### "Turn-of-the-nut" method is not appropriate for use in cancellous bone [^98c754f4]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The level to which bone screws are tightened is determined subjectively by the operating surgeon. It is likely that the tactile feedback that surgeons rely on is based on localized tissue yielding, which may predispose the screw-bone interface to failure. A limited number of studies have investigated the ratio between clinical tightening torque and stripping torque. The purpose of this study was to measure, for the first time, the ratio between yield torque (T yield) and stripping torque (T max) during screw insertion into the cancellous bone and to compare these torques with clinical levels of tightening reported in the literature. Additionally, a rotational limit was investigated as a potential end point for screw insertion in cancellous bone.

Methods

A 6.5-mm outer diameter commercial cancellous bone screw was inserted into human femoral head specimens (n = 89). Screws were inserted to failure, while recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head, and rotation angle.

Results

The median, interquartile ranges, and coefficient of variation were calculated for each of the following parameters: T yield, T max, T yield/T max, slope, T plateau, and rotation angle. The median ratio of T yield/T max and rotation angle was 85.45% and 96.5 degrees, respectively. The coefficient of variation was greatest for the rotation angle compared with the ratio of T yield/T max (0.37 vs. 0.12).

Conclusions

The detection of yield may be a more precise method than the rotation angle in cancellous bone; however, bone-screw constructs that exhibit a T yield close to T max may be more susceptible to stripping during insertion. Future work can identify factors that influence the ratio of T yield/T max may help to reduce the incidence of screw stripping.

### Open reduction and internal fixation compared with circular fixator application for bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial [^06b6ec49]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Standard open reduction and internal fixation techniques have been successful in restoring osseous alignment for bicondylar tibial plateau fractures; however, surgical morbidity, especially soft-tissue infection and wound necrosis, has been reported frequently. For this reason, several investigators have proposed minimally invasive methods of fracture reduction followed by circular external fixation as an alternative approach. To our knowledge, there has been no direct comparison of the two operative approaches.

Methods

We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial in which standard open reduction and internal fixation with medial and lateral plates was compared with percutaneous and/or limited open fixation and application of a circular fixator for displaced bicondylar tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker types V and VI and Orthopaedic Trauma Association types C1, C2, and C3). Eighty-three fractures in eighty-two patients were randomized to operative treatment (forty-three fractures were randomized to circular external fixation and forty to open reduction and internal fixation). Follow-up consisted of obtaining a history, physical examination, and radiographs; completion of the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) General Health Survey; and recording of complication and reoperation rates.

Results

There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of demographic variables, mechanism of injury, or fracture severity and/or displacement. However, patients in the circular fixator group had less intraoperative blood loss than those in the open reduction and internal fixation group (213 mL and 544 mL, respectively; p = 0.006) and spent less time in the hospital (9.9 days and 23.4 days, respectively; p = 0.024). The quality of osseous reduction was similar in the groups. There was a trend for patients in the circular fixator group to have superior early outcome in terms of HSS scores at six months (p = 0.064) and the ability to return to preinjury activities at six months (p = 0.031) and twelve months (p = 0.024). These outcomes were not significantly different at two years. There was no difference in total arc of knee motion, and the WOMAC scores at two years after the injury were not significantly different between the groups with regard to the pain (p = 0.923), stiffness (p = 0.604), or function (p = 0.827) categories. The SF-36 scores at two years after the injury were significantly decreased compared with the controls for both groups (p = 0.001 for the circular fixator group and p = 0.014 for the open reduction and internal fixation group), although there was less impairment in the circular fixator group in the bodily pain category (a score of 46) compared with the open reduction and internal fixation group (a score of 35) (p = 0.041). Seven (18%) of the forty patients in the open reduction and internal fixation group had a deep infection. The number of unplanned repeat surgical interventions, and their severity, was greater in the open reduction and internal fixation group (thirty-seven procedures) compared with the circular fixator group (sixteen procedures) (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Both techniques provide a satisfactory quality of fracture reduction. Because percutaneous reduction and application of a circular fixator results in a shorter hospital stay, a marginally faster return of function, and similar clinical outcomes and because the number and severity of complications is much higher with open reduction and internal fixation, we believe that circular external fixation is an attractive option for these difficult-to-treat fractures. Regardless of treatment method, patients with this injury have substantial residual limb-specific and general health deficits at two years of follow-up.

### Bicondylar tibial plateau fractures: a biomechanical study [^57bdd870]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures remains controversial. The current study was designed to answer the following questions: (1) can a lateral fixed angle plate provide similar construct stability to dual plating techniques and (2) does the size of the medial buttress plate used in dual plating techniques have an effect on construct stability? Bicondylar tibial plateau fractures were created, reduced, and instrumented in a matched pair design using a cadaveric simulated bicondylar tibial plateau fracture model. Tibias were instrumented with one of three constructs: a lateral periarticular plate and posteromedial small fragment dynamic compression plate, a lateral periarticular plate and posteromedial (1/3)-tubular plate, or a lateral fixed angle plate. Biomechanical testing was done to determine construct stiffness, maximum load to failure, and medial condylar displacement for each of the three constructs. There was no significant difference measured between the two dual plating constructs and the lateral fixed angle plate for overall construct stiffness or with respect to medial condylar fragment displacement. A lateral fixed angle plate may have clinical applications in the treatment of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures.

### Comparison of open reduction and internal fixation versus closed reduction and percutaneous fixation for medial malleolus fractures [^06930e3f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

When screw fixation alone is used to stabilize MM fractures, the surgeon may choose between partially threaded cancellous screws and fully threaded screws. There is evidence to suggest that fully threaded bicortical screws are superior to partially threaded cancellous screws regarding biomechanical properties, and radiographic loosening. However, partially threaded cancellous screws that lag the fracture by screw design are an accepted standard. In the CRPF treatment group, partially threaded screws were favored at a rate of 67.6%. Although it is possible that weaker pullout strength can result in screw loosening and backout, this did not translate to a higher rate of hardware removal in the percutaneous group of the present study.

No patient variables differed significantly between CRPF and ORIF groups. Koval et aldemonstrated that among elderly patients, the risk of early complications after ankle fracture is 16 times higher when patients are treated surgically. It is possible that in the present study, surgeons used knowledge of potential risk factors (eg, age, comorbidities) to select patients for surgery and mitigate risk, thus limiting the observed differences in variables between the two groups. Provisional external fixation was used more often in the CRPF group although this was not statistically significant. Given that external fixations tend to follow higher energy injuries with increased risk of wound complication, it makes sense to the surgeons who would pursue a treatment that would offer less inherent risk of wound complication when possible. It is also possible that external fixation assisted with reduction, such that surgeons were more comfortable using CRPF without extensive further reduction.

Comminution, however, was more common in the ORIF group (27.6% vs 9.7%; P = 0.04). This finding makes sense, given that comminuted fracture patterns are more difficult to reduce and are more likely to require ORIF for direct visualization and fracture reduction that is not possible with CRPF. Considering the principles of fracture management in conjunction with the findings of the present study, it would follow that patients most appropriate for CRPF may be those without comminution, and possibly in the setting of significant soft-tissue injury (because of concern for wound infection) that necessitates provisional external fixation. In addition to potentially limiting the risk of soft-tissue infection in a higher risk setting, the provisional external fixation may manipulate the soft tissues enough to allow for adequate reduction with percutaneous techniques.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes following arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures: a systematic review [^82f60130]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Although the primary focus of this review was the assessment of clinical and radiological outcomes, information on the occurrence of postoperative osteoarthritis was also retrieved. This complication was reported in the majority of studies included in the present review, although the prevalence was quite variable. Clearly, this potential complication is one that orthopedic specialists must be acutely aware of. Further research is needed to determine the optimal surgical and postoperative means of minimizing the risk of osteoarthritis with AARIF for tibial plateau fracture repair.

This systematic review has a number of limitations that warrant acknowledgment. Firstly, only 5 of the 12 studies included were prospectively designed; hence, the level of evidence currently available is not particularly high. The potential for retrospective studies to be influenced by various bias-inducing factors cannot be ignored. A second limitation is the fact that all of the studies were quite small scale in terms of patient numbers. This clearly reflects the fact that this type of fracture is not overly common. Finally, there was obvious heterogeneity between studies, in terms of fracture type, the age of patients, the graft material(s) used, fixation technique, and the length of follow-up. All of these factors may have affected the outcomes. Clearly, results from larger-scale, prospective studies would be welcomed.

### Thread delamination in 4.5 mm AO cannulated screws: a small case series in the pediatric trauma population [^3bcb5df7]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Six cases of thread delamination among 4 surgeons comprised the overall cohort (Table 1). There were 2 male and 4 female patients and mean age of the overall population was 13.7 years (range: 12 to 15 y). All cases involved 4.5 mm AO cannulated screws, of which 5 utilized partially threaded screws and one was a fully threaded construct. Screw lengths ranged from 34 to 64 mm. Five cases involved open reduction and internal fixation of incarcerated medial humeral epicondylar fragments and the other case was an open reduction and internal fixation of a displaced medial malleolar fracture.

TABLE 1
Patient Characteristics and Procedural Details Associated With the 6 Cases of Thread Delamination

All complications were noted intraoperatively. There were 4 cases of partial, distal thread delamination (Fig. 1). Of these, 2 of the screws were removed intraoperatively and new screws were placed, but the retained threads were lodged within the bone and unable to be retrieved. In the other 2 cases, the delaminated thread was not felt to affect the fixation and was left in situ. There was another case of partial proximal thread delamination; this screw was removed intraoperatively. The thread was unable to be retrieved and a 4.5 mm, partially threaded, noncannulated screw was placed for final fixation. The medial malleolar case involved a complete thread delamination. The delaminated thread penetrated the tibial plafond and unwound into the tibiotalar joint, requiring an anterior ankle arthrotomy to retrieve the thread (Fig. 2). In this case, the thread and screw were able to be removed in their entirety, after which a new screw was placed without complication to achieve final fixation.

### Improvement of the bone-screw interface strength with hydroxyapatite-coated and titanium-coated AO / ASIF cortical screws [^8803e53b]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether coating AO/ASIF screws with osteoconductive materials can improve bone-screw fixation.

Design

Ninety-six AO/ASIF 4.5-millimeter cortical screws were divided into four paired groups and implanted in the femurs and tibiae of six sheep: Group A = standard stainless steel screws; Group B = stainless steel screws coated with highly crystalline hydroxyapatite; Group C = stainless steel screws coated with low crystalline hydroxyapatite; Group D = titanium screws coated with titanium. The screws were implanted according to the standard AO technique to an insertion torque of 2,000 Newton-millimeters. Sheep were killed at one, three, and twelve months after surgery.

Main Outcome Measures

Extraction torque was measured on six screws from each group selected at random at time of each euthanization. Morphologic analysis of the bone-screw interface was performed on the remaining screws.

Results

At each euthanization the extraction torque of Group A was lower than that of the other groups (p < 0.0001). At three and twelve months the extraction torque of Group B was higher than that of Group D (p = 0.002). Morphologic results showed extensive bone-screw gap in Group A. Optimal osteointegration was observed in Groups B and C. Osteointegration of Group D was higher than that of Group A and lower than that of Groups B and C.

Conclusions

It was demonstrated that AO/ASIF screws coated with osteoconductive materials achieve optimal fixation strength, even in the early phase. This fixation strength was significantly higher than that of the standard screws.

### Effect of off-axis screw insertion, insertion torque, and plate contouring on locked screw strength [^1d12b644]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study quantifies the effects of insertion torque, off-axis screw angulation, and plate contouring on the strength of locking plate constructs.

Methods

Groups of locking screws (n = 6–11 screws) were inserted at 50%, 100%, 150%, and 200% of the manufacturer-recommended torque (3.2 Nm) into locking compression plates at various angles: orthogonal (control), 5-degree angle off-axis, and 10-degree angle off-axis. Screws were loaded to failure by a transverse force (parallel to the plate) either in the same ("+") or opposite direction ("-") of the initial screw angulation. Separately, locking plates were bent to 5 and 10-degree angles, with the bend apex at a screw hole. Locking screws inserted orthogonally into the apex hole at 100% torque were loaded to failure.

Results

Orthogonal insertion resulted in the highest average load to failure, 2577 ± 141 N (range, 2413–2778 N), whereas any off-axis insertion significantly weakened constructs (165–1285 N, at 100% torque) (P < 0.05). For "+" loading, torque beyond 100% did not increase strength, but 50% torque reduced screw strength (P < 0.05). Loading in the "-" direction consistently resulted in higher strengths than "+" loading (P < 0.05). Plate contouring of 5-degree angle did not significantly change screw strength compared with straight plates but contouring of 10-degree angle significantly reduced load to failure (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

To maximize the screw plate interface strength, locking screws should be inserted without cross-threading. The mechanical stability of locked screws is significantly compromised by loose insertion, off-axis insertion, or severe distortion of the locking mechanism.

### An acute fixation protocol for high-energy tibial plateau fractures decreases time to fixation and lowers operative costs without affecting wound complications and reoperations [^c779fd46]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether an acute fixation protocol for high-energy tibial plateau fractures increases the rate of wound complications.

Design

Retrospective comparative study.

Setting

Urban level 1 trauma center.

Patients/Participants

One hundred thirty-four patients with high-energy tibial plateau fractures (OTA/AO 41B/C [Schatzker VI/V/VI]) treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).

Intervention

Utilization of an acute ORIF (< 48 hours) versus delayed ORIF protocol.

Main Outcome Measure

Primary outcomes: wound complications (wound dehiscence/necrosis, superficial/deep infections) and reoperations. Secondary outcomes: total operative costs and hospital length of stay.

Results

Overall, 83.9% (26/31) of patients received definitive fixation within 48 hours under the acute ORIF protocol versus 18.4% (19/103) of patients treated under the standard delayed protocol with no observed differences in the rate of wound complications (proportional difference (PD) -4.6%, confidence interval (CI) -17.2% to 11.3%; P = 0.78) or reoperations (PD 2.0%, CI, 13.0% to 12.5%; P = 1.00). The acute ORIF protocol lowered operative costs (median difference (MD) $-2.563.00, CI, 3021.00 to -1661.00; P < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (MD 4.0 days, CI, 6.0–1.0; P = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, wound complications were associated with increasing age (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, CI, 1.01–1.10; P = 0.01) and tobacco use (OR 3.75, CI, 1.19–11.82; P = 0.02).

Conclusion

An acute ORIF protocol for high-energy tibial plateau fractures decreased time to fixation and lowered operative costs without increasing the risk of wound complications or reoperations.

### Cannulated screw and cable are superior to modified tension band in the treatment of transverse patella fractures [^455f96c6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

In the modified tension band group, we bent the upper end of the K-wire into hooks and threaded a 1.2-mm steel wire through the upper hooks and lower end of the K-wire to form a figure-of-eight tension band. We then tightened the steel wire using a wire cutter, hid the upper hooks of the K-wires in the patella, and reobserved reduction of the articular surface by intraoperative fluoroscopy. If the reduction was satisfactory, we cut off the tails of the K-wires and the steel wire.

In the titanium cable-cannulated screw tension band group, one K-wire was first removed and a cannulated screw guide pin was inserted along the pin tract. We drilled along the guide wire with a cannulated bit and, after measuring its depth, screwed a 4.0-mm titanium cannulated compression screw (Synthes Inc, West Chester, PA, USA) along the guide wire. The screw head remained proud of the patella cortex, and the proximal end of the screw should be close to, or embedded within, the patella. We then screwed in the second cannulated screw and alternately tightened the screws. We removed the guide wire and threaded a 1.3-mm-diameter titanium cable (consisting of a total of nine strands; Zimmer Inc, Warsaw, IN, USA) through each of the cannulated screws. We then tightened the titanium cable anterior to the patella to form the tension band, fixed the titanium cable with cable clamps, and cut off the excessive titanium cable (Fig. 1).

### The "Bankart knee": high-grade impression fractures of the posterolateral tibial plateau lead to increased translational and anterolateral rotational instability of the ACL-deficient knee [^de102e95]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies in the literature have investigated the biomechanical influence of these fractures on knee kinematics in the setting of ACL injury. To investigate their impact on the stability of the ACL-deficient joint, cadaveric knee specimens were subjected to simulated clinical tests from near extension to 90° of flexion, with a focus on Lachman, IR and pivot-shift tests. The pivot-shift test corresponding to a combined 4 Nm tibial IR and 8 Nm valgus torque was conducted at 0° and 30° of flexion to investigate the potential influence of these fractures on the ALR stability of the ACL-deprived joint by mimicking the dynamic multiplanar clinical pivot-shift test. Therefore, tibial movement was analyzed for anterolateral translation, defined as maximum translation of the midpoint of the lateral segment of the plateau, and ALR, defined as maximum rotation around the longitudinal axis of the tibia.

The operations were performed via an anterior longitudinal incision. After sectioning the skin and subcutaneous tissue followed by fully exposing the patella and its sides, we confirmed the quadriceps femoris aponeurosis and the ligament patellae were adherent to the patellar surface. We examined the fracture and condition of the bilateral aponeuroses and joint capsule, removed fracture chips or any intraarticular hematoma, and rinsed the articular cavity. In the AO/OTA 34C2 fractures, the longitudinal fracture was fixed by one lag screw inserted perpendicularly to the fracture line. With the knee in extension, we clamped the fragments to reduce the fracture with a large towel clamp. After we observed the reduction of articular surface under intraoperative fluoroscopy, we drilled two K-wires (2.0-mm diameter) in parallel from the lower pole to the superior pole of the patella, with a 2-cm space and a 5- to 10-mm distance from the patellar articular surface. The K-wires penetrated the cortex of the superior patellar pole. The position of the K-wire was determined using intraoperative fluoroscopy.

### Radiological outcome measures indicate advantages of precontoured locking compression plates in elderly patients with split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau (AO41B3) [^2fc4c30d]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Patient Groups

All patients ≥ 18 years of age with tibial plateau fractures and ORIF between January 2010 and December 2016 were retrospectively identified in the hospital's data base. By means of preoperative X-rays and CT-scans, the fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA classification system. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied.

Inclusion criteria: AO41B3-fractures to the lateral tibial plateau as classified according to the AO/OTA; ORIF utilizing either precontoured LCP or conventional dynamic compression plates and lag screws; complete radiological assessment encompassing preoperative X-rays and CT scans as well as X-rays taken immediately postoperatively (1. X-ray), approximately 6–8 weeks postoperatively (2. X-ray) and approximately 12 months postoperatively (3. X-ray). Exclusion criteria: Tibial plateau fractures classified other than AO41B3; polytraumatized patients; patients featuring open fractures, pathologic fractures or chain injuries of the affected limb; incomplete radiological assessment.

Age, gender, date of surgery, void filling, and dates of subsequently conducted postoperative radiological examinations were collected from the patients' records. Initial grouping was conducted regarding the patients' age. Patients between 18 and 49 years of age were attributed as young and patients ≥ 50 as elderly. In order to analyze the implant-specific effect on the radiological outcome, further investigations were carried out after subgrouping both age groups according to the implant utilized (precontoured LCP vs conventional implant).

The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study had been approved by the IRB of the authors' affiliated institutions (detailed information will be provided after acceptance) and informed written consent was obtained from each patient.

Fracture Characteristics

The diagnosis of an AO41B3-fracture was confirmed by 3 senior investigators (WCP, TK, and JF) based conventional X-rays in 2 planes and CT-scans prior to ORIF in all patients included. The analyses of the precise fracture characteristics encompassed determining the extended joint surface destruction. To this end, the following parameters were quantified as published previously. The dimensions of the depressed joint surface fragments were measured in coronal (a) and sagital (b) CT-scan planes; the area (A) of the mainly oval-shaped joint surface fragments was calculated as. The maximum depression depth (c) of the joint surface fragment was measured in sagital CT-scan planes. The approximate bony void volume (V) was calculated asfor the purpose of this study.

Our protocol uses continuous passive motion machine 2 hours twice a day until knee motion achieves 0° to 95° of flexion. Patients increased knee flexion 5° a day until greater than 90° of painless knee motion was achieved. If patients show lack of progress in knee flexion, knee manipulation is considered 4 to 8 weeks postoperatively. Patients were given walking-assisted aids and instructed to be nonweightbearing for 8 to 10 weeks. Outpatient physical therapy is provided until greater than 120° of knee flexion is achieved. Partial weightbearing was generally allowed after 8 weeks (50 lbs); all patients were reevaluated at 10 weeks to assess joint line depression and fixation integrity. Full weightbearing was achieved by 12 weeks and return to full activities by 16 weeks.

### An intact fibula may contribute to allow early weight bearing in surgically treated tibial plateau fractures [^89e16d09]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The role of the proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) in tibial plateau fractures is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess, with finite-element (FE) calculations, differences in interfragmentary movement (IFM) in a split fracture of lateral tibial plateau, with and without intact fibula. It was hypothesized that an intact fibula could positively contribute to the mechanical stabilization of surgically reduced lateral tibial plateau fractures.

Methods

A split fracture of the lateral tibial plateau was recreated in an FE model of a human tibia. A three-dimensional FE model geometry of a human femur-tibia system was obtained from the VAKHUM project database, and was built from CT images from a subject with normal bone morphologies and normal alignment. The mesh of the tibia was reconverted into a geometry of NURBS surfaces. The fracture was reproduced using geometrical data from patient radiographs, and two models were created: one with intact fibula and other without fibula. A locking screw plate and cannulated screw systems were modelled to virtually reduce the fracture, and 80 kg static body weight was simulated.

Results

Under mechanical loads, the maximum interfragmentary movement achieved with the fibula was about 30% lower than without fibula, with both the cannulated screws and the locking plate. When the locking plate model was loaded, intact fibula contributed to lateromedial forces on the fractured fragments, which would be clinically translated into increased normal compression forces in the fractured plane. The intact fibula also reduced the mediolateral forces with the cannulated screws, contributing to stability of the construct.

Conclusion

This FE model showed that an intact fibula contributes to the mechanical stability of the lateral tibial plateau. In combination with a locking plate fixation, early weight bearing may be allowed without significant IFM, contributing to an early clinical and functional recovery of the patient.

### Is the timing of fixation associated with fracture-related infection among tibial plateau fracture patients with compartment syndrome? A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 729 patients [^48c8807c]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tibial plateau fractures with an ipsilateral compartment syndrome are a clinical challenge with limited guidance regarding the best time to perform open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) relative to fasciotomy wound closure. This study aimed to determine if the risk of fracture-related infection (FRI) differs based on the timing of tibial plateau ORIF relative to closure of ipsilateral fasciotomy wounds.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study identified patients with tibial plateau fractures and an ipsilateral compartment syndrome treated with 4-compartment fasciotomy at 22 US trauma centers from 2009 to 2019. The primary outcome measure was FRI requiring operative debridement after ORIF. The ORIF timing relative to fasciotomy closure was categorized as ORIF before, at the same time as, or after fasciotomy closure. Bayesian hierarchical regression models with a neutral prior were used to determine the association between timing of ORIF and infection. The posterior probability of treatment benefit for ORIF was also determined for the three timings of ORIF relative to fasciotomy closure.

Results

Of the 729 patients who underwent ORIF of their tibial plateau fracture, 143 (19.6%) subsequently developed a FRI requiring operative treatment. Patients sustaining infections were: 21.0% of those with ORIF before (43 of 205), 15.9% at the same time as (37 of 232), and 21.6% after fasciotomy wound closure (63 of 292). ORIF at the same time as fasciotomy closure demonstrated a 91% probability of being superior to before closure (RR, 0.75; 95% CrI, 0.38 to 1.10). ORIF after fasciotomy closure had a lower likelihood (45%) of a superior outcome than before closure (RR, 1.02; 95% CrI; 0.64 to 1.39).

Conclusion

Data from this multicenter cohort confirms previous reports of a high FRI risk in patients with a tibial plateau fracture and ipsilateral compartment syndrome. Our results suggest that ORIF at the time of fasciotomy closure has the highest probability of treatment benefit, but that infection was common with all three timings of ORIF in this difficult clinical situation.

### Difference in joint stability between small posterior malleolar fragments with fixation and those without fixation: a biomechanical cadaver study [^74f92e15]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The indication for the surgical treatment of ankle fractures that involve a posterior malleolar fragment remains controversial. This cadaver study assessed the biomechanical results of rotation stiffness of Haraguchi type 1 posterior malleolar fragments with or without cannulated screw fixation. Twelve anatomic lower-extremity specimens from 6 cadavers were tested. Six right legs were subjected to posterior malleolus osteotomy (Haraguchi type I) followed with (group A; n = 3) or without (group B; n = 3) fixation using a cannulated screw. Ankle joint stability was measured under both external rotation force and axial loading, and the passive resistive torque was measured in both groups. The mean torque value in group A was 0.1093 Nm/º, while that in group B was 0.0537 Nm/º. There was a significant intergroup difference (p = .004). In group B, the torque value was further increased in the latter rotation period (about 40–60 degrees). Group A proved more stable under experimental conditions than group B. Fixation in type I posterior malleolar fragments produced improved stability in ankle rotation, even for posterior malleolar fragments involving < 25% of the articular surface, and has been considered an effective aid in treatment.

### A comparison of screw insertion torque and pullout strength [^1aa00175]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pullout strength of screws is a parameter used to evaluate plate screw fixation strength. However, screw fixation strength may be more closely related to its ability to generate sufficient insertion because stable nonlocked plate-screw fracture fixation requires sufficient compression between plate and bone such that no motion occurs between the plate and bone under physiological loads. Compression is generated by tightening of screws. In osteoporotic cancellous bone, sufficient screw insertion torque may not be generated before screw stripping. The effect of screw thread pitch on generation of maximum insertion torque (MIT) and pullout strength (POS) was investigated in an osteoporotic cancellous bone model and the relationship between MIT and POS was analyzed.

Methods

Stainless steel screws with constant major (5.0 mm) and minor (2.7 mm) diameters but with varying thread pitches (1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.75 mm) were tested for MIT and POS in a validated osteoporotic surrogate for cancellous bone (density of 160 kg/m(3) [10 lbs/ft(3)]). MIT was measured with a torque-measuring hex driver for screws inserted through a one-third tubular plate. POS was measured after insertion of screws to a depth of 20 mm based on the Standard Specification and Test Methods for Metallic Medical Bone Screws (ASTM F 543–07). Five screws were tested for each failure mode and screw design. The relationship between MIT and compressive force between the plate and bone surrogate was evaluated using pressure-sensitive film.

Results

There was a significant difference in mean MIT based on screw pitch (P < 0.0001), whereas POS did not show statistically significant differences among the different screw pitches (P = 0.052). Small screw pitches (1.0 mm and 1.2 mm) had lower MIT and were distinguished from large pitches (1.5 mm, 1.6 mm, and the 1.75 mm) with higher MIT. For POS, only the 1-mm and 1.6-mm pitch screws were found to be different from each other. Linear regression analysis of MIT revealed a moderate correlation to the screw pitch (R(2) = 0.67, P < 0.0001), whereas the analysis of POS suggested no correlation to the screw pitch (R(2) = 0.28, P = 0.006). Pearson correlation analysis indicated no correlation between MIT and POS (P = 0.069, r = -0.37). A linear relationship of increased compression between the plate and bone surrogate was found for increasing screw torque (R(2) = 0.97).

Conclusions

These results indicate that the ability of different screw designs to generate high screw insertion torque in a model of osteoporotic cancellous bone is unrelated to their pullout strength. Therefore, extrapolation of results for POS to identify optimal screw design for osteoporotic bone may not be valid. Screw designs that optimize MIT should be sought for fixation in osteoporotic bone.

### Biomechanical analysis of posteromedial tibial plateau fracture fixation in fresh cadaveric bone [^66e814cb]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

This study aims to compare the mechanical strength of three different posterior-based internal fixation methods for posteromedial tibial plateau fractures. The study utilized 12 tibial plateaus harvested from fresh-frozen cadavers, and the posteromedial fracture fragments were created. The bones were then randomly assigned to one of three fixation methods: two posteroanterior lag screws (LS) size 4.0 mm, posterior buttress plate using a 3.5 mm small dynamic compression plate (DCP), or posterior buttress plate using a 3.5 mm T-shaped plate (TP). Biomechanical testing was performed by applying vertical compression force to the center of the posteromedial fracture fragment until the load to failure (displacement ≥ 3 mm) was reached, and displacement of the fragment was measured using a motion sensor. The data exhibited normal distribution, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the load to failure, followed by Fisher post hoc Least-Significant Difference (LSD) to correct for multiple comparisons. The statistical analysis demonstrated significantly higher mean load to failure values in the T-shaped plate group compared to both the small dynamic compression plate group and the lag screw group (p < 0.05). However, after conducting further post hoc analysis, the observed significant differences were solely between the LS and TP groups (p = 0.021). These findings suggest that the T-shaped plate represents the most effective method for internally fixing posteromedial tibial plateau fractures.

### Fibular shaft allograft support of posterior joint depression in tibial plateau fractures [^e7f58e6d]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior depression of the lateral articular surface of the tibial plateau can be difficult to elevate and support with morselized bone graft and internal fixation. Progressive collapse after open reduction and internal fixation has been described and can lead to failure in treatment. A standard anterolateral approach to the tibia may not allow direct reduction and stabilization of posterolateral joint depression given the anatomic barriers of the fibular collateral ligament and the proximal tibiofibular articulation. Posterolateral approaches to the tibial plateau have been described and may allow direct reduction of the articular depression. These approaches, however, require dissection close to the common peroneal nerve, and some approaches also require a proximal fibular osteotomy. The use of an intraosseous fibular shaft allograft as an adjunct to open reduction and internal fixation in select cases of depressed posterolateral tibial plateau fractures allows both reduction of the joint and stabilization of the articular segment through a single approach familiar to many orthopaedic surgeons.

### Thread delamination in 4.5 mm AO cannulated screws: a small case series in the pediatric trauma population [^5a6c7c85]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Thread delamination associated with cannulated screws have been reported but likely represent an under-recognized complication in the orthopaedic literature. The purpose of this study is to report the occurrence of repeated hardware failures through thread delamination in the setting of a commonly used orthopaedic cannulated screw implant in a small cohort involving pediatric fracture care at a single academic level I trauma center.

Methods

Between August 2015 and December 2020, 9 cases of hardware failure associated with 4.5mm arbeitsgemeinschaft für osteosynthesefragen cannulated stainless-steel screws were identified within a pediatric orthopaedic division at a single academic level I trauma center. Three cases were excluded, and 6 cases of thread delamination were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Six cases of thread delamination comprised a cohort of patients with a mean age of 13.7 years (range: 12 to 15y). All cases involved 4.5mm arbeitsgemeinschaft für osteosynthesefragen cannulated screws, including 5 partially threaded and 1 fully threaded screw. Five cases involved open reduction and internal fixation of incarcerated medial humeral epicondylar fragments and the other case was an open reduction and internal fixation of a displaced medial malleolar fracture. Five of these occurred within a recent 18-month period of time. There were 4 cases of partial, distal thread delamination, 1 case of partial proximal thread delamination and another case of complete thread delamination which had unwound into the tibiotalar joint and required an anterior ankle arthrotomy to retrieve the thread. None of the 5 patients in this series who currently harbor a retained thread have experienced symptoms because of this issue.

Conclusions

Thread delamination associated with cannulated screw implantation likely represents an under-reported phenomenon in orthopaedic surgery. In cases where retained, delaminated threads exist, these do not appear to cause short-term concern.

Level Of Evidence

### Cannulated screw and cable are superior to modified tension band in the treatment of transverse patella fractures [^3de8f26c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

The cable-cannulated screw tension band was better than the modified K-wire tension band in fracture reduction. In the modified tension band group, the postoperative interfragmentary gaps were 2 mm in 10 patients and 3 mm in two patients after surgery, whereas no patient's interfragmentary gap was greater than 2 mm in the titanium cable-cannulated screw tension band group. As the support of a tension band, the K-wire itself cannot generate reduction and compression effects on fractured bones. Rather, the reduction and compression effects on the patellar fracture line are generated by tightening the wires from the superior pole to the lower pole. However, the flexibility of K-wires will counteract a part of the force that should act on the fractured bone. When using a cable-cannulated screw tension band the primary pressure is achieved by the two cannulated lag screws and the titanium cable, which is fixed through the cannulated screw and tightened and plays its role as a tension band. Because the acting force generated by the cannulated screws is perpendicular to the fracture, the acting forces on the patellar articular and anterior surfaces are consistent, which is different from a modified K-wire tension band (Fig. 5).

### Editorial commentary: biomechanical studies show lateral hinge screws may increase load to failure after medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy [^4b34e1b9]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Lateral hinge fracture is a common complication after medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy, occurring in up to 32% to 50% of cases. This can lead to delayed union, nonunion, and loss of correction. A larger medial opening gap width is the most consistently identified risk factor, although lateral hinge width, osteotomy level, and uniplanar versus biplanar technique have also been implicated. To mitigate the risk of postoperative lateral hinge fracture, lateral hinge screws, inserted after osteotomy fixation, have been proposed. Biomechanical studies suggest these improve the ultimate strength of the osteotomy construct, with load to failure increasing 30% in response to varus loading and 2- to 3-fold in response to compressive stress. Despite these biomechanical findings, clinical translation remains a critical next step.

### Are 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures a useful addition to understanding fractures for junior surgeons? [^b7946091]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

3D-printed models do not lead to a clinically relevant improvement in interobserver agreement for the AO/OTA classification, Schatzker classification, or the Luo three-column concept, and therefore, they offer no additional value in the classification of tibial plateau fractures compared with conventional radiographs and CT scans. Furthermore, in this study, we did not record any instances of interobserver agreement more than moderate, which suggests that a high number of tibial plateau fractures would be misclassified when using these three classification systems. This could result in incorrect treatment of patients with tibial plateau fractures, more posttraumatic complications, and a longer recovery. Therefore, we cannot recommend the use of models in the classification of tibial plateau fractures.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^8787c737]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Our result analysis indicated middle-aged patients with mean ages were 42.5 years (SD: 15.1) in the CREF group and 41 years (SD: 10.8) in the ORIF group. Both groups had most male patients (27 men and three women each). Road traffic accidents (RTAs) were the predominant cause of injury, with falls from height being the next most common. Most patients in the CREF group had Schatzker type VI fractures, whereas the ORIF group had a higher proportion of type V fractures. The demographics and injury characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Demographic Characteristics of Patients

Perioperative characteristics are summarized in Table 2. As per our data, surgery duration averaged 126 minutes in the CREF group and 146 minutes in the ORIF group (P value = 0.038). The average blood loss was significantly lower in the CREF group at 55 mL compared with 150 mL in the ORIF group (P value = < 0.001). The preoperative waiting period was shorter in the CREF group compared with the ORIF group due to preoperative optimization management needed in some patients.

Table 2
Perioperative Characteristics and Postoperative Outcomes

Table 2 summarizes the postoperative radiological and functional outcomes. Postoperative assessment showed a mean MPTA of 87.24° in the CREF group and 87.09° in the ORIF group, with no significant difference (P value = 0.86). The PPTA was also similar between the groups. Radiological union time averaged 12.20 weeks in the CREF group and 11.33 weeks in the ORIF group, with no significant difference (P value = 0.163). Functional outcomes were measured by the Oxford Knee Score. At the end of 6 months, the scores were ∼40 in the CREF group and ∼40 in the ORIF group (P value = 0.320). The average increased to 45 in the CREF group and 44 in the ORIF group, with no significant difference (P value = 0.496) at the last follow-up, which averaged at 12 months for all the patients. Both groups achieved similar knee flexion, with no reports of extension lag.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^38c13e0f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrated that ORIF and CREF of proximal tibia fractures in LMIC gave similar results in terms of function at one year and overall complication rates. The CREF group had significantly shorter durations for operating time and lower blood loss compared with ORIF. Surgical site infections were the most common complications, and the overall complication rate was lower in the CREF group, although this difference was not statistically significant.

In the developing world, the population is predominantly composed of younger individuals who are frequently on the road. Because of cultural norms and societal roles, this demographic is predominantly male. As a result, our study reflects this distribution. With more men actively on the streets, there is a higher likelihood of exposure to high-energy trauma, such as RTAs. Therefore, the majority male population in our analysis aligns with the increased incidence of RTAs and other traumatic injuries.

Our analysis showed that patients who underwent CREF had shorter preoperative waiting times than those opted for ORIF. In the ORIF group, five patients waited 5 to 7 days presurgery for swelling to subside. High-energy fractures (Schatzker type V and VI) cause significant articular surface damage and soft-tissue edema. Operating on trauma patients in the ORIF group risks exacerbating swelling, as reported in the literature. For instance, Kulkarnee et al observed mean preoperative days ranging from 1 to 16 for ORIF-treated patients. Similarly, Pun et al reported waiting periods of 12 hours to 21 days, whereas Yao et al found a mean time of 7 to 14 days for ORIF-treated patients. By contrast, CREF requires minimal incisions and can be done even under suboptimal skin conditions.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^1ba38778]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology

This retrospective comparative cohort study was conducted within the Orthopedics Section of the Department of Surgery at Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, with ethical approval from the institutional review board.

The study included all patients treated at the hospital from January 2016 to December 2022 who were diagnosed with Schatzker type V or VI tibial plateau fractures, aged 18 to 60 years, of both sexes. A total of 60 patients were included in the study, with 30 patients in each of the CREF and ORIF groups. Exclusion criteria included patients with neurovascular injuries, open fractures, those who underwent redo surgery or were primarily operated outside our center, or those with grade III or IV osteoarthritis of the knee joint (as per the Kellgren and Lawrence grading system). Patients diagnosed with type V or VI fractures were given the choice between ORIF or CREF. The method of selection was entirely patient driven, allowing individuals to choose their preferred treatment option. When both CREF and ORIF were viable, patients received comprehensive counseling on each technique, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of both. By presenting these options and empowering patients to make informed decisions, surgeons performed the chosen procedure based on the patient's preference.

Data were obtained and collected from electronic medical records, radiographs, and surgical notes, including patient demographics (age, sex, comorbidities), injury-related factors (mechanism of injury, fracture classification based on preoperative radiographs), and surgical details. Quantitative variables, such as age, surgery duration, waiting period before surgery, blood loss during surgery, medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), posterior proximal tibial angle (PPTA), radiological union time, Oxford Knee Score (OKS) at 1 year, and knee flexion, were reported as mean and SD. Qualitative factors, such as sex distribution and complications, were summarized using frequency and percentage. Patients with missing data or incomplete follow-ups were excluded.

Clinical functional outcomes were assessed using the OKS, and radiological outcomes were evaluated through postoperative radiographs to assess fracture reduction. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the association between complications and the mode of treatment. Data distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Quantitative outcomes were compared using the Mann-Whitney U -test for non-normally distributed data and the independent t -test for normally distributed data. A significance level of P < 0.05 was used. The means of the two groups were compared to determine statistical significance.

### Percutaneous repair of a schatzker III tibial plateau fracture assisted by arthroscopy [^e7269855]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tibial plateau fractures are articular fractures that sometimes prove difficult to effectively manage and treat. Although fluoroscopy is frequently used to assess the articular reduction in the surgical repair of tibial plateau fractures, this video demonstrates the additional benefit of arthroscopy in assisting with the articular reconstruction of a Schatzker III tibial plateau fracture.

Methods

The goal of operative treatment of tibial plateau is reconstruction of the articular surface followed by reestablishment of tibial alignment. Arthroscopy has been advocated as a possible supplement to the operative treatment of tibial plateau fractures. Arthroscopy-assisted fracture reduction has been shown to provide a significantly improved visualization of fracture fragment displacement when compared with traditional fluoroscopy use in select cases.

Results

This video demonstrates the use of arthroscopy to visualize the articular surface and aid in reduction during fixation of a tibial plateau fracture. Initially, arthroscopic visualization confirms depression of lateral tibial plateau and the elevation of the fractured segment. After fixation with 2 partially threaded cancellous screws, arthroscopy confirms articular reduction and normal relation of lateral meniscus to the articular surface.

Conclusions

Arthroscopic visualization is a reliable technique for assessing articular reduction during surgical repair of a tibial plateau fracture. In addition, this technique enables the surgeon to assess for soft tissue injuries that could potentially go undiagnosed.

### Radiological outcome measures indicate advantages of precontoured locking compression plates in elderly patients with split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau (AO41B3) [^6ee0d2ad]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment is frequently required to restore the articular surface, to provide stability and to re-establish the limb's mechanical alignment. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) thereby often combined with void filling according to the bony defect emerging after elevation of the depressed joint surface fragments. The internal fixation can be carried out utilizing conventional implants or precontoured locking compression plates (LCPs). The general recommendation by the AO/OTA still is the utilization of conventional implants such as dynamic compression plates and lag screws. According to the AO/OTA, the utilization of precontoured LCP should be reserved to cases of extreme osteoporosis. Even though precontoured LCP had especially been developed for osteoporosis-associated fractures with poor bone quality, as the design allows for optimum support of the reduced joint surface fragments and angular stable locking of the screws, these implants may also be beneficial in elderly patients in general or even in young patients. But a lack of evidence and conflicting data in the literature hamper the broad utilization of precontoured LCP in split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau in all age groups.

To date, no study has systematically investigated the age-dependent effect of locking versus nonlocking plating on radiological outcome measures of AO41B3-fractures. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the Rasmussen Radiological Score (RRS) approximately 12 months after ORIF of split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau separately in young and elderly patients. The RRS postoperatively and the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) postoperatively and after 12 months were set as secondary outcome parameters. It was hypothesized that the utilization of precontoured LCP is associated with superior radiological outcome measures in young as well as in elderly patients.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^6ae4d889]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative complications remain a significant concern for both patients and surgeons as they can significantly affect overall morbidity. In our study, the CREF group experienced fewer complications compared with the ORIF group, consistent with findings in the literature. The most prevalent complication was infection (surgical infection), affecting 10% of patients, which is a major contributor to morbidity, particularly in LMICs. - Comparing our results with other studies, our infection rate was significantly lower or similar, and absence of deep surgical site infectionsindicate better perioperative management of the patients. The outcomes and complications are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. This suggests that enhanced perioperative care and vigilant measures may have contributed to better outcomes in infection control in LMICs.

Table 4

This study has several limitations. The small sample size may restrict the applicability of the findings, particularly in LMICs, potentially leading to biases. In addition, the absence of Tscherne grading for soft-tissue swelling limits our ability to assess its effect on treatment outcomes. Moreover, although we chose the Schatzker classification for proximal tibial injuries because of its prevalence and ease of use in LMICs, it may not capture all aspects of injury severity as effectively as the OTA classification. These factors underscore the need for further research with larger, more representative cohorts and standardized assessment methods.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^f61024b0]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Tibial plateau fractures are complex injuries involving the articular surface of the proximal tibia and often accompanied by soft-tissue damage. These fractures are challenging due to their potential to disrupt knee joint stability and function. Schatzker classification is widely used to categorize these fractures globally. Several different treatment modalities, focused on stabilizing the knee joint while restoring pain-free motion, are used for treatment. Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures are treated with two different approaches: open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and closed reduction and external fixation (CREF). The primary objective is to assess and compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of ORIF versus CREF for Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures.

Methods:

This research was done retrospectively at the Aga Khan University Hospital. This study comprised 60 patients with type V and VI tibial plateau fractures who underwent internal fixation or external fixation from 2016 to 2022. Patients were divided into two groups with 30 patients each: the CREF group (patients treated with closed reduction and external fixation using Ilizarov as external fixator), and the ORIF group.

Results:

The CREF group consisted of 1 type V and 29 type VI fractures, whereas the ORIF group included 20 type V and 10 type VI fractures. The Oxford Knee Score was 40 points for each group at the 6-month follow-up. At the last follow-up, the Oxford Knee Score was 45 points for the CREF group and 44 points for the ORIF group.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, our study highlights the benefits of CREF over ORIF for proximal tibial fractures in low- and middle-income countries. CREF showed shorter surgical duration and wait times, reduced blood loss, and fewer complications, particularly infections. Both groups had comparable radiological and functional outcomes, with a slight preference for CREF. These findings emphasize the potential of CREF in resource-constrained settings.

Level of Evidence:

### Thread delamination in 4.5 mm AO cannulated screws: a small case series in the pediatric trauma population [^a5e4efe4]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
One-year postoperative anterioposterior and lateral radiographs of the elbow after open reduction and internal fixation of a medial humeral epicondyle fracture demonstrate that the retained thread from the index procedure remains in situ.

Overall, five hundred and thirty-two 4.5 mm AO cannulated screws were implanted at our institution during the study period and the rate of thread delamination, 1.1% (6/532), was significantly higher than the worldwide rate of 1 in 6500 per month provided by the manufacturer (P < 0.00001). Five of the 6 cases in the current cohort occurred within a recent 18-month period between July 2019 and December 2020; the rate of thread delamination during this period was 3.2% (5/157) and was also significantly higher than the rate provided by the manufacturer (P < 0.00001). In the period before this between August 2015 and June 2019, the rate of thread delamination was 0.2% (1/366) at our institution and this was not significantly different than the rate provided by the manufacturer (P = 0.056). When these 2 periods were compared, the rate of thread delamination at our institution between July 2019 and August 2020 was significantly higher than between August 2015 and June 2019 (P = 0.012).

### Biomechanical analysis of dual versus lateral locked plating in elderly bicondylar tibial plateau fractures: does medial comminution matter? [^acebe17f]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess dual plating versus lateral locked plate fixation of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures in an elderly cadaveric model with and without medial bone loss PARTICIPANTS: 10 pairs of elderly (range 78–93 years of age) fresh frozen tibias.

Intervention

Bicondylar tibial plateau fractures were created reproducing AO/OTA 41 C1 (without medial bone loss) and C2 fractures (with medial bone loss). Cadavers were randomized to 4 different groups. Groups 1 and 2 were 41 C1 fractures and fixated with either dual or lateral plating, respectively. Groups 3 and 4 were fixated in a similar fashion with medial metaphyseal bone loss (41 C2 fracture) with dual plating Group 3 and lateral plating group 4. Lateral plating consisted of a 3.5 mm 5-hole lateral plate (ALPS, ZimmerBiomet) with 6 bicortical locking screws proximally and two diaphyseal screws. Dual plating groups underwent lateral plating and additional 3.5 mm 5-hole posteromedial 1/3 tubular plate (ZimmerBiomet) placed at the apex of the fracture with two shaft screws and one unicortical screw proximally. Specimens were tested in a Mechanical Testing System (MTS) machine loading both condyles.

Outcome Measurements

Specimens were loaded to 300 N and coronal alignment obtained. Specimens were then cycled from 100 N to 700 N for 5000 cycles at 2 Hz. Average axial displacement, maximal displacement, average force and coronal alignment after 5000 cycles were recorded. Lastly, force to failure was recorded at 100 N/sec.

Results

Mean axial displacement was 4.21 mm ranging from 3.12 mm in group 1 to 5.92 mm in group 4 (P = 0.51). Failure force averaged 3340 N ranging from 4342 N in group 1 to 2433 N in group 4 (P = 0.36). Maximal displacement ranged from 3.69 mm in group 1 to 7.37 mm in group 4 (P = 0.21). Change in coronal alignment ranged from 0.98° in group 1 to 1.97° in group 4 (P = 0.45). No statistically significant difference was noted between all four groups for all data points.

Conclusion

The results of this study demonstrate that a lateral locked plate may offer an alternative means of fixation in AO/OTA 41 C1 and C2 fractures.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^e05851c9]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Damage control orthopaedic surgery — priorities, techniques, and indications are outlined: Damage control surgery prioritizes resuscitation and correction of metabolic derangements, coagulopathy, hypothermia, and/ or resolution of soft tissue injuries over early definitive surgical repair, with focus to control hemorrhage, decrease contamination through debridement, and provide bone and soft tissue stabilization to patients unable to undergo definitive repair. External fixation is often used, particularly in femur fractures, to minimize ongoing soft tissue damage, decrease risks of fat embolism, control hemorrhage and contamination, alleviate pain due to fracture motion, and facilitate patient mobilization, and is also used to regain and/ or maintain gross length, rotation, and alignment of extremities with unstable fractures and soft tissue injuries that preclude early internal fixation. After a period of resuscitation, patients are taken back to the operating room for definitive management, and those who could benefit include patients undergoing emergent control of life-threatening injuries by other disciplines or who are reaching the limits of physiologic reserve as determined by hypothermia, coagulopathy, and/or acidosis, or who have severe closed or open soft tissue injuries. Modern orthopaedic approaches to fractures may in many cases be thought of as a soft-tissue injury that contains within it a fractured bone, and severe compromise of this soft-tissue envelope presents another indication for damage control surgery; examples include heavily contaminated open fractures or closed injuries that historically have been shown to do poorly with acute open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), such as pilon fractures and bicondylar tibial plateau fractures, whereas unicondylar plateau fractures are typically amenable to immediate ORIF. Because soft tissue injuries evolve over the hours or days following injury, temporary approaches to skeletal fixation allow the full extent of the soft tissue injury to declare itself before committing to a definitive internal fixation.

### Biomechanical study of three cannulated screws configurations for femur neck fracture: a finite element analysis [^372a0aff]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study provides a biomechanical evaluation of TCS, FCS and BDSF for FNF with different Pauwels type under dynamic loads. Compared to TCS and BDSF, the finite element modeling of FCS shows better stability and lower risk of screw breakage in the treatment of FNF. BDSF shows better biomechanical properties in the Pauwels type III fracture model due to its resistance to shear forces. From the biomechanical perspective, FCS is an ideal screw configuration for the treatment of FNF. And BDSF has shown potential in the treatment of Pauwels type III FNF. The findings of this study provide a reference for the perioperative selection of internal fixations in FNF.

### Radiological outcome measures indicate advantages of precontoured locking compression plates in elderly patients with split-depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau (AO41B3) [^897f4634]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fractures to the tibial plateau account for approximately 1–2% of all fractures in the general population but for up to 8% of all fractures in the elderly. While younger patients predominately suffer traffic accidents, high impact sport injuries, or falls from greater height, elderly patients often mainly suffer simple falls or low velocity traumata resulting in a tibial plateau fracture. The loss of bone mass and the deterioration of the bone microarchitecture with age contribute to this change of causal injury mechanism. The meta-to epiphyseal zone of the proximal tibia represents a predilection site of osteopenia and osteoporosis with loss of bone mineral density comparable to the lumbar vertebrae. The manifestation features a reduced trabecular connectivity in the anterior and posterior aspects of the weight bearing areas of the tibial plateaux and a reduced subchondral cortical bone thickness. Tibial plateau fractures in the elderly are more likely to feature an involvement of the intercondylar eminence. Furthermore, the comorbidity burden and the presence of preexisting degenerative lesions may contribute to higher rates of symptomatic posttraumatic osteoarthritis in elderly compared to young patients. Higher rates of subsequent total knee arthroplasty secondary to reconstructive surgery also are associated with increasing patient age. The incidences of total knee replacement for women and patients above 50 years show a substantial increase during the first 5 years after tibial plateau fracture. And with improved life expectancy, incidences of tibial plateau fractures in elderly patients are probably rising. More than half of all tibial plateau fractures in the elderly are split-depression fractures to the lateral condyle. These injuries are classified as type II according to Schatzkeror as type 41B3 according to the AO/OTA.

### Screws or sutures? A pediatric cadaveric study of tibial spine fracture repairs [^ca8165a5]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tibial spine fractures are common in the pediatric population because of the biomechanical properties of children's subchondral epiphyseal bone. Most studies in porcine or adult human bone suggest that suture fixation performs better than screw fixation, but these tissues may be poor surrogates for pediatric bone. No previous study has evaluated fixation methods in human pediatric knees.

Purpose

To quantify the biomechanical properties of 2-screw and 2-suture repair of tibial spine fracture in human pediatric knees.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Cadaveric specimens were randomly assigned to either 2-screw or 2-suture fixation. A standardized Meyers-Mckeever type 3 tibial spine fracture was induced. Screw-fixation fractures were reduced with two 4.0-mm cannulated screws and washers. Suture-fixation fractures were reduced by passing 2 No. 2 FiberWire sutures through the fracture fragment and the base of the anterior cruciate ligament. Sutures were secured through bony tunnels over a 1-cm tibial cortical bridge. Each specimen was mounted at 30° of flexion. A cyclic loading protocol was applied to each specimen, followed by a load-to-failure test. Outcome measures were ultimate failure load, stiffness, and fixation elongation.

Results

Twelve matched pediatric cadaveric knees were tested. Repair groups had identical mean (8.3 years) and median (8.5 years) ages and an identical number of samples of each laterality. Ultimate failure load did not significantly differ between screw (mean ± SD, 143.52 ± 41.9 7 N) and suture (135.35 ± 47.94 N) fixations (P = 0.760). Screws demonstrated increased stiffness and decreased elongation, although neither result was statistically significant at the .05 level (21.79 vs 13.83 N/mm and 5.02 vs 8.46 mm; P = 0.076 and P = 0.069, respectively).

Conclusion

Screw fixation and suture fixation of tibial spine fractures in human pediatric tissue were biomechanically comparable.

Clinical Relevance

Suture fixations are not biomechanically superior to screw fixations in pediatric bone. Pediatric bone fails at lower loads, and in different modes, compared with adult cadaveric bone and porcine bone. Further investigation into optimal repair is warranted, including techniques that may reduce suture pullout and "cheese-wiring" through softer pediatric bone. This study provides new biomechanical data regarding the properties of different fixation types in pediatric tibial spine fractures to inform clinical management of these injuries.

### Split depression tibial plateau fractures: a biomechanical study [^f759f506]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the biomechanical characteristics of four different fixation constructs for split depression fractures of the lateral tibial plateau (OTA classification 41B3.1).

Design

Laboratory investigation using a cadaveric simulated split depression tibial plateau fracture model.

Setting

Split depression tibial plateau fractures were created, reduced, and instrumented in a matched pair design. Specimens were tested for stiffness using a materials testing machine.

Intervention

Tibias were instrumented with an L-buttress plate, four 3.5-millimeter subchondral raft screws with an antiglide plate, an L-buttress plate with cancellous allograft, or four 3.5-millimeter subchondral raft screws placed through a periarticular plate.

Main Outcome Measurements

Vertical subsidence of the lateral tibial plateau was measured for the entire construct and for the local depression. The relative medial and lateral condylar tilt with central loading was also measured.

Results

There was no significant difference between the four fixation methods for overall longitudinal stiffness of the proximal tibial fracture fixation construct (range, 2,026 to 2,666 newtons per millimeter). The local depression stiffness for the raft-periarticular plate and raft-antiglide plate were 425 newtons per millimeter and 342 newtons per millimeter, respectively, versus 243 newtons per millimeter and 210 newtons per millimeter for the two large fragment buttress constructs. There was no significant difference between the local depression stiffness for the two raft constructs. There was no significant difference between the local depression stiffness for the two buttress plate constructs. Local depression stiffness was found to be significantly greater for the raft-periarticular plate construct when compared with the large fragment buttress plate construct without bone graft (p = 0.0314). Condylar tilt data showed a significant difference between the medial tilt observed in the prefracture specimen and the lateral tilt observed after fixation (p less-than-or-equal 0.017) for all constructs.

Conclusions

There was no significant difference in the overall construct stiffness between the four fixation constructs. Fixation constructs with a raft of subchondral screws were more resistant to local depression loads. This supports the use of a raft construct when a central depression is a significant component of the overall fracture pattern. Condylar tilt data showed a persistent weakness in the postfixation lateral plateau regardless of fixation construct when compared with the intact specimen. This supports the current clinical practice of delayed weight-bearing for ten to twelve weeks.

### The long-term functional outcome of operatively treated tibial plateau fractures [^ca2791aa]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the long-term functional results of the surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures using standard techniques of open reduction and internal fixation.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

University hospital.

Methods

Forty-seven displaced fractures of the tibial plateau in forty-six patients were treated with open reduction, interfragmental screw fixation of the articular fragments, and buttress plate fixation and had a minimum of five years of follow-up. All aspects of their care, including tibial plateau fracture type, operative management and associated injuries, were documented. Preoperative and postoperative follow-up radiographs were analyzed for fracture classification and adequacy of reduction. All patients were contacted and given functional outcome questionnaires using both a generic health status scale (Short Form 36 [SF-36]) (18) and a disability scale relating to knee osteoarthritis (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index [WOMAC]) (1). Data were also collected regarding return to work and sporting activities. Assessment scores were analyzed with respect to age, fracture type and severity, and were compared to standardized age and sex-matched scores for the healthy population. The average age of the patients at the time of injury was forty years and the average follow-up period was 8.3 years. Of the forty-seven fractures studied, twenty-five were classified as Schatzker types I, II, or III, and the remaining twenty-two were types IV, V, or VI (15). All fractures received operative treatment within forty-eight hours and all but five fractures were acceptably reduced.

Results

Compared to the standardized SF-36 categorical and aggregate scores, there was no statistically significant difference between the healthy age-matched population and twenty-four of twenty-six of the under-age-forty group regardless of fracture type. With regard to the over-age-forty group, scores statistically similar to the control population were found in only twelve of twenty-one patients. Although there was a large variance in WOMAC scores for all groups resulting in no statistically significant difference being found, a trend toward higher categorical and aggregate scores was seen with increasing age at presentation. There was no correlation between WOMAC scores and fracture type. Multiple-classifications analysis of all data revealed that presentation age was the most significant source of variation with respect to functional outcome. Fracture type had much less influence and adequacy of reduction had no significant influence on outcome, although the group of patients having an inadequate reduction by the authors' criteria was too small in number to reasonably comment upon.

Conclusions

Open reduction and internal fixation is a satisfactory technique for the treatment of displaced fractures of the tibial plateau, particularly for patients younger than forty years.

### Dynamic stabilization of simple fractures with active plates delivers stronger healing than conventional compression plating [^88d2cd9f]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Animal Model

The ovine tibia osteotomy model was used as it represents the most prevalent large animal model for evaluation of fracture healing. The study was approved by the pertinent animal care committee and was consistent with previous studies on locking plate dynamization to facilitate comparability. Twelve skeletally mature female Swiss Alpine sheep (2.6 ± 0.1 years old, 67 ± 8 kg weight) were randomized into the CP and ACTIVE groups. Under general anesthesia, an approximately 8-cm long medial incision was made over the tibia of one hind leg, whereby surgery was randomized between right and left hind legs. All 6 screw holes were drilled in the intact tibia with a custom drill template. A transverse osteotomy was performed with a 0.6-mm thick saw blade under constant irrigation. To ensure anatomic reduction, the distance between the central screw holes in plates was 0.6 mm shorter than in the drill template.

Osteotomies were stabilized with plates applied to the medial tibial shaft in a periosteum-sparing biological fixation technique to preserve periosteal perfusion. In the CP group, plates were applied with 6 eccentrically inserted 4.5-mm cortical screws to achieve absolute stability and interfragmentary compression. In the ACTIVE group, plates were applied with six 5.0-mm bi-cortical locking screws to achieve direct apposition and dynamic stabilization. A standard postoperative medication protocol was followed. Prophylactic antibiosis with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, and analgesia with carprofen (4 mg/kg BW) and buprenorphine were initiated preoperatively and were continued for 4 days postoperatively. After surgery, a cylindrical cast was applied over a soft padding layer proximal to the hoof and extending to the knee joint. In the ovine osteotomy mode, this routine prophylactic measure is essential to prevent tibial fracture caused by bending loads while allowing axial load-bearing and ambulation immediately postsurgery.,

Planar Radiography

Radiographs were obtained immediately postoperative and in weekly intervals, starting at postoperative week 3 to quantify periosteal callus formation. At each timepoint, an anteroposterior radiograph and 2 lateral oblique radiographs (± 10 degrees) were obtained to visualize the anterior, posterior, and lateral cortices without obstruction by the medially applied plate. Projected callus areas were measured using validated custom software developed to objectively quantify periosteal callus size. This software used known plate dimensions as length standards for dimensional scaling. After automated demarcation of cortical boundaries, it derived consistent gray-scale thresholds for callus area extraction by accounting for cortex and background intensities.

### A comparative biomechanical study of alternative medial collateral ligament reconstruction techniques [^de25d0f3]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Kinematics rig with reflective marker arrays mounted on the femur and tibia for optical tracking. The 2 hanging weights attached to the central pulley induce tibial rotation, and the weight and pulley system attached to the proximal tibia induces anterior tibial translation. Raising the frame with the femur mounted on it causes the knee to extend.

After placement of the specimen in the kinematics rig, 3 digitizing screws were placed into both the tibia and femur. The tibial screws were at the most prominent medial and lateral points near the tibial plateau, plus a distal anterior screw. The femoral medial and lateral digitizing screws were placed 10 mm proximal to the epicondyles to protect the collateral ligament attachments and avoid the MCL graft tunnel, plus a proximal screw. These screws defined the coordinate system during kinematic measurement.

Knee Loading Parameters

Kinematic parameters of anterior tibial translation (ATT) and posterior tibial translation, ER-IR, valgus, and varus rotation, and combined ATT + ER movement (AMRI loading), were monitored. Tibial ATT/posterior tibial translation displacing forces were imposed using 88-N hanging weights with ropes led over pulleys to 2 semicircular metal hoops mounted around the tibia using a transverse Steinmann pin 40 mm below the joint line. The load levels were based on data from clinical examinations. This mechanism allowed the transmission of anteroposterior forces without inhibition of IR-ER. The tibia was loaded to 5 N·m IR-ER torque using a 250-mm pulley fixed on the distal tibial extension rod, with hanging weights. Similarly, varus-valgus moments of 8 N·m were imposed by pulling medially and laterally at the distal end of the rod, again with hanging weights and pulleys (Figure 1).

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^9855535b]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tibial plateau fractures are complex injuries involving the articular surface of the proximal tibia and often accompanied by soft-tissue damage. These fractures are challenging due to their potential to disrupt knee joint stability and function. Schatzker classification is widely used to categorize these fractures globally. Several different treatment modalities, focused on stabilizing the knee joint while restoring pain-free motion, are used for treatment. Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures are treated with two different approaches: open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and closed reduction and external fixation (CREF). The primary objective is to assess and compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of ORIF versus CREF for Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures.

Methods

This research was done retrospectively at the Aga Khan University Hospital. This study comprised 60 patients with type V and VI tibial plateau fractures who underwent internal fixation or external fixation from 2016 to 2022. Patients were divided into two groups with 30 patients each: the CREF group (patients treated with closed reduction and external fixation using Ilizarov as external fixator), and the ORIF group.

Results

The CREF group consisted of 1 type V and 29 type VI fractures, whereas the ORIF group included 20 type V and 10 type VI fractures. The Oxford Knee Score was 40 points for each group at the 6-month follow-up. At the last follow-up, the Oxford Knee Score was 45 points for the CREF group and 44 points for the ORIF group.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study highlights the benefits of CREF over ORIF for proximal tibial fractures in low- and middle-income countries. CREF showed shorter surgical duration and wait times, reduced blood loss, and fewer complications, particularly infections. Both groups had comparable radiological and functional outcomes, with a slight preference for CREF. These findings emphasize the potential of CREF in resource-constrained settings.

### Finite element analysis of cannulated screws as prophylactic intervention of hip fractures [^36448744]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study assesses the performance of cannulated hip screws as a prophylactic intervention of proximal hip fracture due to a lateral fall. The results suggest that implanting 2 or 3 screws in an inverted triangle formation strengthen the femoral neck during a lateral fall without translating the failure to another region. Further biomechanical testing is required to confirm these results before clinical use is considered.

### Outcomes of nonunion surgery following tibial plateau fractures: a case series of 28 patients [^3e8d92c8]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate outcomes of tibial plateau fracture nonunion surgery, including rates of final radiographic healing, additional surgery, and conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods

Design: Retrospective case series.

Setting

Two Level I academic trauma centers.

Patients

Adult patients who underwent nonunion surgery following open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of tibial plateau fractures (OTA/AO 41B-C) between 2000 and 2024 were included.

Outcome Measures and Comparisons

The primary outcome was final radiographic healing. Secondary outcomes included additional surgery and conversion to TKA.

Results

Twenty-eight patients were included (median age 55 years (IQR: 38–61), 57% male). The median follow-up from the date of the nonunion surgery was 19 months (IQR:13–33). Twenty-one (75%) fractures were classified as Schatzker VI. Nonunion surgery involved revision ORIF in 23 (82%) cases, bone grafting alone (with or without hardware removal) in three (11%) cases, screw augmentation in one (3.6%) patient, and one patient (3.6%) underwent multistage treatment, ending with definitive treatment using an Ilizarov frame for six months. Overall, 54% of patients received bone grafting to address bone defects. Radiographic healing was achieved in 24 patients (86%). All four (14%) patients with a persistent nonunion had Schatzker VI fractures. Of these, three (75%) ultimately underwent conversion to TKA while one had no further surgery until the last follow-up 12.4 months after the initial procedure. Overall, thirteen (46%) patients required additional surgery, of which five (18%) underwent TKA at a median of 3.1 years (IQR: 1.68–6.74).

Conclusion

In the current study of patients who underwent tibial plateau fracture nonunion surgery, 86% of patients ultimately achieved radiographic healing, with 71% healed after the index nonunion surgery. Close to half of the patients required additional surgery, with 14% who underwent further procedures to achieve healing, and 18% ultimately required conversion to total knee arthroplasty. These findings can help surgeons counsel patients and guide expectations following surgery for tibial plateau fracture nonunion.

### Outcomes of headed and headless cannulated screws fixation in nondisplaced femoral neck fracture [^f4510f5b]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study showed that risk of operation failure in the fixation of non-displaced femoral neck fracture was the least when using two HCSs and one CCS in an inverted triangle configuration, although no significant differences were shown between different combinations of HCS and CCS in that configuration. Age was shown to be the only factor directly associated with operation failure.

When treating femoral neck fractures with cannulated screw systems, the stability of the fixation construct has been shown to be affected by several factors, including screw type, screw number, screw thickness, along with position, direction and the configuration of screws. Besides, age is identified as a critical factor in femoral neck fracture outcomes; patients ≥ 80 years have a 69% complication rate with cannulated screw fixation, suggesting endoprosthetic procedures should be preferred in this group. A total of 61% of patients experience worsened mobility postoperatively, emphasizing the need for improved surgical selection and postoperative management. A meta-analysis also echoed that internal fixation, the cannulated screw, carries a high failure and reoperation rate, making it appropriate only for young patients with good bone quality. Surgical decisions should be individualized based on age, mobility, and comorbidities, with a multidisciplinary approach to optimize outcomes. Besides, most biomechanical studies agree with the idea that using three screws with diameters larger than 6 mm is ideal. In the present study, three cannulated screws were used in an inverted triangle configuration to achieve the required stability.

### Split-depressed lateral tibial plateau fractures: a comparison of augmented percutaneous screws versus augmented plate and screw construct in a cadaveric model [^a2aefeac]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the strength of fixation of percutaneous screw versus plate/screw fixation in a paired cadaver model of OTA 41-B3 (Schatzker type II) split-depression fractures of the lateral tibial plateau.

Methods

Six matched pairs of cadaveric knees were acquired. An OTA 41-B3 (Schatzker type II) split-depression fracture was created in all specimens using a standardized method. One specimen from each matched pair of knees was fixed with percutaneous screws, and the other was fixed with a plate/screw construct. All specimens underwent augmentation of the central metaphyseal defect with calcium phosphate. Mean residual displacement (depression) was measured on thin-slice high-resolution computed tomography using a standardized methodology following 3 experimental conditions: (1) after they were fixed, before loading; (2) unloaded cycling (simulating postoperative range of motion exercises); and (3) loaded cycling (simulating postoperative weight-bearing). Load to failure was also compared.

Results

After adjustment for baseline measurements, there was no significant difference in mean residual depression of the lateral tibial plateau between treatments groups after unloaded or loaded cyclic testing. Mean residual depression was less than 1 mm in both the treatment groups. Load to failure was statistically equivalent between treatment groups.

Conclusions

In our cadaveric study, in combination with calcium phosphate augmentation for both methods, percutaneous screw fixation conferred comparable strength of fixation compared with plate/screw constructs for treatment of OTA 41-B3 (Schatzker type II) tibial plateau fractures.

### Correlation of interference screw insertion torque with depth of placement in the tibial tunnel using a quadrupled semitendinosus-gracilis graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [^b0a42889]. Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the insertion torque of a soft-tissue interference screw in relation to depth of insertion into the tibial tunnel when used for fixation of a quadrupled semitendinosus-gracilis autograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Type Of Study

Biomechanical cadaver study.

Methods

Ten quadrupled semitendinosus-gracilis grafts were harvested from fresh-frozen cadaver knees and fixed in donor proximal tibias using 10-mm bioabsorbable interference screws (Arthrex, Naples, FL). A cannulated torque screwdriver was used to measure screw insertion torque at 3 depths in the tibial tunnel: the outer cortex (distal third), the articular surface (proximal third), and between these 2 points (middle third).

Results

The mean insertion torques for the distal third, middle third, and proximal third were 8.7, 4.7, and 4.3 in/lb, respectively. The insertion torque was significantly higher at the outer cortex (distal third) than the middle third and proximal third (joint line of the tibial tunnel) (P < .05).

Conclusions

Our results indicate a correlation between insertion torque and depth of placement of bioabsorbable interference screws used for fixation of a semitendinosus-gracilis graft. Lower insertion torque at the articular surface, resulting in lower peak load or pullout strength, may outweigh the proposed benefits of joint-line fixation of a semitendinosus-gracilis graft used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Clinical Relevance

Studies have suggested that anatomic proximal fixation of ACL grafts in the tibial tunnel produces stability similar to intact knees. The results of our study indicate that lower insertion torque at the articular surface results in lower peak load and pullout strength of the graft, which may outweigh the proposed benefits of joint-line fixation.

### Moore I postero-medial articular tibial fracture in alpine skiers: surgical management and return to sports activity [^13a4ea2b]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Over the past 10 years, like many authors, we observed an increasing number of Moore I tibial plateau fractures related to alpine skiing for which the surgeon may face difficult choices regarding surgical approach and fixation means. Some authors have recently been suggesting a posterior approach associated to open reduction and osteosynthesis by a buttress plate. But in our knowledge there is no specific study on sports activity recovery after Moore I tibial fractures. The aim of this work was to assess sports activities and clinical outcomes after surgically treated Moore I tibial plateau fractures in an athletic population of skiers.

Methods

We conducted a prospective case series between 2012 and 2014. This included fifteen patients aged 39.6 ± 7 years whom presented with a Moore I tibial plateau fracture during a skiing accident. 12 cases (80%) presented with an associated tibial spine fracture. Treatment consisted of a standard antero-medial approach, with a medial para patellar arthrotomy to allow direct visualisation of articular reduction and spinal fixation. Two or three 6.5mm long cancellous bone screws were placed antero-posteriorly so as to ensure perfect compression of the fracture site. Radiological and functional results were assessed by an independent observer (Lysholm-Tegner, UCLA, KOOS scores) at the longest follow-up.

Results

Mean follow-up was 18.2 ± 6 months (12–28). An immediate postoperative anatomical reduction was achieved in all cases and remained stable in time. At last follow-up Lysholm mean score was 85 ± 14 points (59–100), UCLA score was 7.3 ± 1.6 (4–10) and Tegner score was 4.6 ± 1.3 (3–6). Mean KOOS score was 77 ± 15 (54–97). 87% of patients had resumed their skiing activity and 93% were satisfied or very satisfied from their post-operative surgical outcome. We observed no pseudarthrosis or secondary varus displacement.

Conclusion

In our series 87% of patients had resumed back to their sporting activities. Surgical management of Moore I tibial plateau fractures by isolated antero-posterior screwing provides excellent clinical and radiological results. The anteromedial incision has a dual advantage of anatomical reduction, tibial spine fixation (in 80% of our cases) and posteromedial fragment reduction.
