## Question

Are there any specific guidelines for the management of postoperative wound infections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are specific guidelines for the management of postoperative wound infections, and if so, what they recommend. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how postoperative wound infections are defined and classified. Then, I should verify which major guidelines directly address management rather than just prevention. Next, I will extract the core management principles, including source control, when to use antibiotics, and how to choose agents. After that, I should consider special scenarios like prosthetic material, device-related infections, and high-risk wounds. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and note evidence gaps and implementation considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and classification, because management hinges on getting the category right. Postoperative wound infections are encompassed by surgical site infections, which are categorized as superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space, with timing thresholds of 30 days after the operation and up to 1 year if a prosthesis is present, which frames both surveillance and treatment decisions [^112XpKn6].

> Wait, let me verify which guidelines actually provide management recommendations rather than prevention-only advice. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2014 update directly addresses diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections, including surgical site infections, and is the most consistently cited source for treatment principles in the provided materials, whereas WHO and CDC guidelines primarily focus on prevention with limited management directives, and specialty guidelines like AAOS and WSES add procedure-specific nuances but still lean heavily on IDSA's foundational approach [^116h4h1g] [^113UgEif] [^1122bqge] [^113J7ax2] [^1161DBKU].

> I will now examine the cornerstone of therapy, because I need to ensure we do not jump to antibiotics without source control. The most important treatment for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; antibiotics are adjuncts, not substitutes, for adequate drainage and debridement when purulence or necrosis is present [^111Lq8tE] [^1134cfnd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics for everyone; I should confirm when they are indicated. Systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated for uncomplicated superficial SSIs after adequate incision and drainage, but a brief course is reasonable when there is a significant systemic response, such as erythema extending beyond 5 cm from the wound edge, fever greater than 38.5°C, heart rate above 110 beats per minute, or leukocytosis above 12,000 cells/μL, with typical durations on the order of 24–48 hours if improving clinically [^113Etuia] [^112wHZ8g] [^111Lq8tE].

> Next, I should review empiric antibiotic selection by surgical site and likely flora, and I need to double-check that I align with IDSA's site-specific guidance. For clean operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities with systemic signs, cefazolin or vancomycin for MRSA risk are appropriate; for axillary, gastrointestinal, perineal, or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, agents active against gram-negatives and anaerobes are recommended, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone combined with metronidazole, or a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or carbapenem, with MRSA coverage added when risk is present; culture-directed de-escalation is essential once results return [^115R1LHt] [^115EaHeA] [^111Lq8tE].

> But wait, what if there is prosthetic material or a device involved? I should confirm how that changes management. When hardware or prostheses are present, many guidelines advise retaining stable implants if possible while aggressively debriding infected tissue, obtaining cultures, and tailoring antibiotics; device-related infections, such as neuromodulation hardware, often require device removal despite improving salvage strategies, and orthopedic joint infections frequently necessitate a two-stage exchange paradigm with organism-specific therapy and surgical source control [^114rJm28] [^1171HuwG].

> Let me consider high-risk wounds and adjunctive strategies, and I should verify where the evidence is strongest. For contaminated or high-risk incisions, especially in colorectal and abdominal surgery, negative pressure wound therapy can be considered to reduce wound complications, though recommendations are generally conditional and patient selection matters; similarly, advanced silver or antimicrobial dressings are not routinely recommended for clean or clean-contaminated wounds after colorectal surgery, reinforcing that standard dressings and meticulous local care suffice in most cases [^1161DBKU] [^114QUCWT] [^115io4Pr].

> I need to ensure I address early postoperative fever and the timing of SSI suspicion, because misattribution leads to unnecessary antibiotics. Fever within the first 48 hours is unlikely to be SSI unless there are local signs or purulence, in which case opening the wound, obtaining a Gram stain to assess for streptococci or clostridia, and proceeding with drainage and targeted therapy is appropriate; after 48 hours, SSI becomes a more likely source of fever and warrants a lower threshold for local evaluation and source control [^116Jp3d7] [^112XpKn6].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach, and I should double-check that each step aligns with guideline principles. First, confirm the diagnosis and classify the SSI depth and timing. Second, assess systemic severity and obtain cultures if drainage is present. Third, perform incision and drainage with debridement of devitalized tissue and leave the wound open to heal by secondary intention. Fourth, reserve systemic antibiotics for patients with systemic inflammatory response or specific high-risk sites, choosing empiric therapy by surgical site and local resistance patterns. Fifth, reassess clinically at 24–48 hours, de-escalate based on cultures, and continue local wound care until healed [^111Lq8tE] [^113Etuia] [^115R1LHt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought WHO might have detailed management recommendations, but I should correct that impression. WHO's 2016 and 2018 documents focus predominantly on prevention across the pre-, intra-, and immediate postoperative periods and do not provide a comprehensive management algorithm for established SSIs, which reinforces that IDSA remains the primary management guideline to rely upon in this context [^113UgEif] [^114MaF5d].

> I should also acknowledge evidence gaps and implementation realities, because practice variation can undermine outcomes. Postoperative wound care routines vary widely across centers and specialties, and many practices lack robust evidence, highlighting the need for standardized, procedure-specific protocols and adherence to core principles like timely source control and judicious antibiotics; nonetheless, the absence of universal postoperative management protocols does not negate the existence of clear, condition-specific guidance from IDSA and specialty societies that clinicians can apply consistently [^116TYsL6] [^114cbvjb] [^115R1LHt].

> In summary, yes, there are specific, evidence-based guidelines for managing postoperative wound infections, chiefly articulated by IDSA 2014, with supportive specialty guidance from AAOS, WSES, and others. The unifying principles are prompt source control with incision and drainage, selective rather than routine systemic antibiotics based on systemic signs and surgical site flora, and culture-driven de-escalation, with adjuncts such as NPWT or device management reserved for defined high-risk scenarios and tailored to patient and procedural context [^115R1LHt] [^113J7ax2] [^1161DBKU].

Postoperative wound infections are managed with a **standardized approach** that includes prompt recognition, source control, and targeted antimicrobial therapy. The key steps are: **open and drain the wound** [^113Etuia], debride necrotic tissue [^111jEtWA], and send cultures for microbiology [^111jEtWA]; start empiric antibiotics based on surgical site and local resistance patterns, then narrow to culture results [^115EaHeA]; and provide wound care with appropriate dressings and close follow-up [^114cbvjb]. Routine postoperative antibiotics are not recommended after clean procedures [^111YJ4Yq], and advanced dressings are not superior to standard dressings for preventing SSI [^114cbvjb] [^115io4Pr]. Management should be individualized by infection severity, patient comorbidities, and surgical context, with escalation if systemic signs develop or if there is no improvement [^112wHZ8g].

---

## Diagnosis and initial assessment

Early recognition and accurate assessment are critical. Diagnosis is based on **clinical signs** — erythema, warmth, swelling, pain, purulent discharge, and systemic signs such as fever, tachycardia, or leukocytosis [^112XpKn6]. Infections are classified as superficial, deep, or organ/space according to CDC criteria [^112XpKn6]. Early postoperative fever (< 48 hours) is often noninfectious; after 48 hours, infection becomes more likely [^112XpKn6].

---

## General principles of management

- **Source control**: Open the wound, drain pus, and debride necrotic tissue [^111jEtWA]; this is the most important step [^111Lq8tE].

- **Microbiological evaluation**: Obtain cultures to guide targeted therapy [^111jEtWA].

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: Start based on surgical site, contamination level, and local resistance patterns, then narrow to culture results [^111jEtWA].

- **Wound care**: Use appropriate dressings, maintain a moist environment, and change dressings as needed [^114cbvjb].

- **Monitoring**: Track clinical response and adjust therapy accordingly [^111jEtWA].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

### Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated when any of the following are present: **systemic signs** — fever > 38.5°C, tachycardia > 110 bpm, leukocytosis > 12,000/μL, or erythema extending > 5 cm from the wound edge [^113Etuia]; **deep or organ/space infections**; or **immunocompromised patients** [^112ijepN].

---

### Empiric antibiotic selection

| **Surgical site** | **Recommended empiric antibiotics** |
|-|-|
| Clean procedures (trunk, head, neck, extremities) | - Cefazolin <br/> - Or vancomycin if MRSA risk [^116h4h1g] |
| GI, perineum, female genital tract | - Cephalosporin + metronidazole <br/> - Or fluoroquinolone + metronidazole <br/> - Or carbapenem [^116h4h1g] |
| MRSA risk | Add vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin [^111Lq8tE] |

---

### Duration of antibiotic therapy

Superficial infections should be treated for **5–7 days** after source control, whereas **deep or organ/space infections** require 10–14 days, with longer courses if response is slow or if hardware is present.

---

## Wound care and dressings

- **Standard dressings**: Appropriate for most wounds; keep dressings intact for ≥ 48 hours unless leakage occurs [^114cbvjb].

- **Advanced dressings**: Silver or antimicrobial dressings are not routinely recommended for clean or clean-contaminated wounds [^114cbvjb].

- **Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)**: Consider for high-risk wounds or dehisced wounds [^1161DBKU].

---

## Special considerations

- **Prosthetic material**: If infected, often requires removal or exchange [^1171HuwG].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May need broader empiric coverage and longer therapy [^111jEtWA].

- **Multidrug-resistant organisms**: Tailor therapy to culture and susceptibility results [^111jEtWA].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **perioperative measures**, including appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis [^1122bqge], skin antisepsis, and maintaining normothermia and glycemic control [^1122bqge]. Postoperative strategies include meticulous wound care, early detection, and prompt management of complications [^114cbvjb].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular clinical assessments should track wound healing and detect complications early. Patient education should emphasize **signs of infection** and when to seek care. Escalate therapy if there is no improvement or if systemic signs worsen [^112wHZ8g].

---

Postoperative wound infection management centers on **source control**, targeted antibiotics, and structured wound care, with therapy tailored to infection severity, patient factors, and surgical context.

### New WHO recommendations on preoperative measures for surgical site infection prevention: an evidence-based global perspective [^114MaF5d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most preventable health-care-associated infections and are a substantial burden to health-care systems and service payers worldwide in terms of patient morbidity, mortality, and additional costs. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery. No international guidelines are available and inconsistencies in the interpretation of evidence and recommendations of national guidelines have been identified. Given the burden of SSIs worldwide, the numerous gaps in evidence-based guidance, and the need for standardisation and a global approach, WHO decided to prioritise the development of evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSIs. The guidelines take into account the balance between benefits and harms, the evidence quality, cost and resource use implications, and patient values and preferences. On the basis of systematic literature reviews and expert consensus, we present 13 recommendations on preoperative preventive measures.

Section 1: Rationale and statements of concern

Burden of outcomes associated with SSI

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are common complications in acute-care facilities. SSIs occur in ~1%–3% of patients undergoing inpatient surgery, depending on the type of operative procedure performed. In total, 21,186 SSIs were reported to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in 2021 from a total of 2,759,027 operative procedures. Additional data on ambulatory and outpatient surgeries are needed. Overall, many of these procedures are lower risk by virtue of procedure type and patient selection, and some may involve minimally invasive techniques that have a lower risk of infection. It is important to mention, however, that both inpatient and ambulatory operating rooms need to adhere to strict infection prevention standards. SSIs now are one of the most common and most costly HAIs. -
Up to 60% of SSIs are preventable using evidence-based guidelines.
When not prevented, SSIs can result in a significant increase in postoperative hospital days and many also require reoperation, both during the initial surgical admission and during hospital readmission.-
Patients with an SSI have a 2–11 times higher risk of death compared to operative patients without SSI. Also, 77% of deaths in patients with SSI are directly attributable to SSI.
Attributable costs of SSI vary depending on the type of operative procedure, medical implants, and the type of infecting pathogen.- Overall, it is estimated that the cost of care for patients who develop an SSI is 1.4–3 times higher than for patients who do not develop an SSI. Deep-incisional and organ-space SSIs are associated with the highest cost. All studies evaluated in a systematic review reported some economic benefit associated with SSI prevention, but there is significant heterogeneity in the literature related to cost accounting. In the United States, SSIs are believed to account for $3.5 billion to $10 billion annually in healthcare expenditures.
Finally, data reported to the CDC NHSN show that SSIs can be caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli. These infections can be more difficult to manage and can be caused by pathogens that are resistant to standard empiric antibiotics.

### Systematic review of surgical site infection prevention guideline recommendations for maintenance of homeostasis in the perioperative period [^112bCJzZ]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections are common, result in increased patient morbidity and mortality, and increase the economic burden to society. Anesthesiologists play a key role in perioperative infection prevention, with data suggesting that evidence-based measures can significantly reduce the incidence of these infections. This systematic review aimed to identify and compare current recommendations for the maintenance of homeostasis in surgical site infection prevention guidelines. Eight surgical site infection prevention guidelines published in the past 10 yr were identified. There was broad consensus regarding the importance of optimizing intraoperative homeostasis to reduce infections. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in both the studies cited and the specific recommendations provided regarding maintenance of oxygenation, normovolemia, normothermia and glycemic targets. High-quality randomized controlled trials are required to close existing knowledge gaps, with adaptive platform trials likely to play a key role in improving the current evidence base for preventing surgical site infection.

### Wound dehiscence rates decreased in reconstructive surgery of anorectal malformations after introduction of a standardized postoperative treatment program [^113n12Re]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The study's results regarding an implied halving of overall wound dehiscence rates, and a decreased frequency of deep dehiscence cases, when implementing the proposed standardized post-PSARP treatment program, seem to support the continuous use of it. However, the issue regarding the use of broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics remains and needs to be the focus for further discussions and evaluations on a global perspective. In addition, the definition of superficial wound dehiscence versus only skin infection may differ between centers, making comparisons of different studies difficult.

In order to identify and evaluate the most successful elements of perioperative care in PSARP procedures, preferably through randomized controlled multicenter trials, there is a need for international uniform definitions of post-PSARP complications. This could only be established through international collaborations and consensus.

We propose a study to collect information about various centers' post-PSARP treatments, results of bacterial cultivations of wound complications, and their definitions of post-PSARP wound infection and dehiscence. This could stand as a foundation for future, preferably multicenter studies regarding postoperative complications and their management after reconstructive surgery of ARM. All contributing factors to uncomplicated wound healing after reconstructive surgery of ARM are yet to be revealed and further studies on this common but still quite unresearched clinical problem are warranted in order to establish internationally viable, state-of-the-art, post-PSARP treatment guidelines.

In conclusion, wound dehiscence rates could be reduced by following a standardized post-PSARP treatment program, including meticulous perineal wound management and antibiotic prophylaxis covering Enterococci. Additional multicenter studies are needed to establish wound complication definitions, better understand contributing factors to uncomplicated wound healing following reconstructive surgery of ARM and to assess the benefits and risks associated with broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^115UbQ2t]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

E. Wound drains — antibiotic prophylaxis duration with drains is uncertain: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the early discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with wound drains (Grade of Recommendation: I [Insufficient Evidence]). In a retrospective comparative study, postoperative-dose group patients (n = 1133) received antibiotics for five to seven days after surgery while no postoperative dose group patients (n = 464) received antibiotics only on the day of surgery with antibiotics given 30 minutes before skin incision and an additional dose administered every three hours; the overall rate of surgical site infection was 0.7% with 0.8% (9/1133) in the postoperative-dose group and 0.4% (2/464) in the no postoperative-dose group and the difference between the two was not significant; resistant strains of bacteria were found in five (83.3%) of six postoperative-dose patients whereas none was cultured in the no postoperative-dose group; suction drains were left in place in fusions for two to three days; the study provides Level III therapeutic evidence that preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis plus intraoperative redosing every three hours is as effective as postoperative dosing during drain management, and accordingly, multidosing of antibiotics until drains are removed may not be beneficial.

### Alternatives to antibiotics for prevention of surgical infection [^111cGF6k]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical-site infection (SSI) is still the second most common healthcare-associated infection, after respiratory tract infection. SSIs are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates, and result in enormous healthcare costs. In the past decade, several guidelines have been developed that aim to reduce the incidence of SSI. Unfortunately, there is no consensus amongst the guidelines, and some are already outdated. This review discusses the recent literature regarding alternatives to antibiotics for prevention of SSI.

Methods

A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE was performed to retrieve data on the prevention of SSI. The focus was on literature published in the past decade.

Results

Prevention of SSI can be divided into preoperative, perioperative and postoperative measures. Preoperative measures consist of showering, surgical scrubbing and cleansing of the operation area with antiseptics. Perioperative factors can be subdivided as: environmental factors, such as surgical attire; patient-related factors, such as plasma glucose control; and surgical factors, such as the duration and invasiveness of surgery. Postoperative measures consist mainly of wound care.

Conclusion

There is a general lack of evidence on the preventive effectiveness of perioperative measures to reduce the incidence of SSI. Most measures are based on common practice and perceived effectiveness. The lack of clinical evidence, together with the stability of the high incidence of SSI (10 per cent for colorectal procedures) in recent decades, highlights the need for future research.

### Delphi prioritization and development of global surgery guidelines for the prevention of surgical-site infection [^114QBWU6]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines produce evidence‐based recommendations that aim to standardize patient care by identifying best practice. Implementation of clinical guidelines into routine practice has the potential to reduce complications, mortality and costs 1, 2, 3, 4. Despite an increasing trend in clinical guideline production by a variety of bodies 4, there remains a lack of national or international clinical guidelines designed to meet the needs of patients and health services in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) 5. Frequently LMIC clinicians have no alternative to using clinical guidelines published in high‐income countries (HICs) by authors with limited experience of the pathologies and challenges faced in lower‐resource settings. Consequently, guideline implementation in LMICs is inconsistent and the potential benefits are not fully realized.

To increase the likelihood of guidelines being adopted internationally, particular consideration needs to be given to the specific resource and logistical challenges LMIC health systems may face in implementing recommendations 5. Additionally, given that many existing clinical guidelines include large numbers of recommendations, there is a need for streamlined guidelines which can inform prioritization of implementation of key practical measures.

The aim of this study was to prioritize topics for future global surgery guidelines and then to develop a guideline for the top ranked topic. Development of new clinical guidelines is expensive and time‐consuming. Rather than commissioning entirely new guidelines, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Global Health Research Unit on Global Surgery (GSU) network aimed to build on existing HIC guidelines by adapting these to LMIC settings.

### Negative pressure wound therapy in high-risk gastrointestinal surgery: a retrospective cohort study on postoperative complications [^116Mkiin]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a substantial source of postoperative morbidity in colorectal surgery due to the inherently contaminated nature of these procedures and the elevated risk of wound-related complications. Despite the widespread use of conventional wound care strategies, including standard dressings aimed at minimizing infection and promoting wound healing, SSIs continue to occur at a high rate. These infections are associated with extended hospitalization, increased healthcare expenditures, and poorer clinical outcomes for patients.

In recent years, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has emerged as an advanced modality for managing surgical wounds. By enhancing tissue perfusion, reducing interstitial edema, and effectively controlling wound exudate, NPWT has demonstrated promising results in accelerating wound healing and reducing infection rates. Its utility has been particularly noted in high-risk surgical populations and in managing complex or contaminated wounds. Nonetheless, the adoption of NPWT as a standard prophylactic measure in colorectal surgery remains inconsistent, and its routine use has not been universally endorsed by clinical guidelines.

This study aims to compare the effectiveness of NPWT with that of conventional wound care in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The primary outcomes included the incidence of SSIs and wound healing parameters. The secondary outcomes included postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence, evisceration, seroma formation, and incisional hernia development. Furthermore, patient-specific factors, including age, body mass index (BMI), comorbid conditions, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, were analyzed to identify variables that may influence the efficacy of NPWT. The overarching goal of this investigation is to provide robust clinical evidence supporting the integration of NPWT into standard postoperative care protocols for colorectal surgery, with the aim of enhancing patient outcomes and minimizing wound-related complications.

### Surgical site infections [^112Mgd7V]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in postsurgical care. Risk for surgical site infection is multifactorial and includes a host of microbial, patient-related, and procedure-related factors. Prevention of surgical infection relies on optimization of patient factors and use of a variety of evidence-based pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures. At the forefront of these measures is antimicrobial prophylaxis, which has been shown to be effective at reducing risk of surgical site infection. As guidelines for prevention of surgical site infection become increasingly complex and nuanced, surgical infection outcomes are increasing tied to quality outcome and performances measures.

### It is time to define an organizational model for the prevention and management of infections along the surgical pathway: a worldwide cross-sectional survey [^117R7aFf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Preventing SSIs is a priority for all surgical departments around the world. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. SSIs are among the most common HAIs, making SSI prevention especially important. SSIs are associated with longer post-operative hospital stays, and higher attributable morbidity and mortality. SSIs prevention requires integrating a range of measures before, during, and after surgery. Both the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published guidelines for preventing SSIs. The 2016 WHO Global guidelines for preventing SSIs are evidence-based, including systematic reviews presenting additional information supporting actions to improve practice. The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the pre-operative period and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery, ranging from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery, effective skin disinfection for patients and surgical teams, guidance on when and for how long to use prophylactic antibiotics, and which sutures to use. According to the WHO Global guidelines, the use of alcohol-based solutions for the surgical site preparation is a strong recommendation and may be considered an important process indicator for SSIs prevention. In our survey, 68.7% of participants stated that alcohol-based solutions for surgical site preparation were used in all wards, while 12.2% in some wards, and 19.1% stated that alcohol-based solutions were not used.

The availability of guidelines is essential to provide a robust framework to support good clinical practice. Guidelines for the prevention of HAIs, including SSIs, have been published in recent years. Despite the clear evidence, compliance is uniformly poor, and significant difficulties arise when introducing evidence and clinical guidelines into routine daily practice.

Notably, guidelines alone are not sufficient to ensure adoption and the implementation of their principles and findings. Local adaptation is a prerequisite for successful guideline adoption and adherence. One way to engage HCWs in guideline development and implementation is to translate recommendations into a protocol or pathway that specifies and coordinates responsibilities for particular actions and timing among multidisciplinary team members in an acute care facility. Surveillance and outcomes assessment are crucial to monitor adherence with guideline recommendations. The results of our survey demonstrated that a protocol on HAIs prevention was in place in all hospital wards in the vast majority of acute facilities (85.9%), and only in 6.2% a protocol on HAIs prevention was not in place.

### Perioperative management of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for patients undergoing elective spine surgery: a systematic review [^113EXieR]. European Spine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In preparation for surgery, patients being treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are recommended to either continue or withhold therapy perioperatively. Some of these drugs have known effects against bone healing, hence the importance of adequately managing them before and after surgery.

Objective

We aim to assess the current evidence for managing conventional synthetic and/or biologic DMARDs in the perioperative period for elective spine surgery.

Methods

A systematic review of four databases was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The included manuscripts were methodically scrutinized for quality, postoperative infections, wound healing characteristics, bone fusion rates, and clinical outcomes.

Results

Six studies were identified describing the management of conventional synthetic and/or biologic DMARDs. There were 294 DMARD-treated patients described undergoing various spine surgeries such as craniovertebral junction fusions. Three of the studies involved exclusive continuation of DMARDs in the perioperative window; one study involved exclusive discontinuation of DMARDs in the perioperative window; and two studies involved continuation or discontinuation of DMARDs perioperatively. Of patients that continued DMARDs in the perioperative period, 13/50 patients (26.0%) had postoperative surgical site infections or wound dehiscence, 2/19 patients (10.5%) had delayed wound healing, and 32/213 patients (15.0%) had secondary revision surgeries. A fusion rate of 14/19 (73.6%) was described in only one study for patients continuing DMARDs perioperatively.

Conclusions

The available published data may suggest a higher risk of wound healing concerns and lower than average bone fusion, although this may be under-reported given the current state of the literature.

### Wound management in disaster settings [^112g9tUu]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Few guidelines exist for the initial management of wounds in disaster settings. As wounds sustained are often contaminated, there is a high risk of further complications from infection, both local and systemic. Healthcare workers with little to no surgical training often provide early wound care, and where resources and facilities are also often limited, and clear appropriate guidance is needed for early wound management.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review focusing on the nature of wounds in disaster situations, and the outcomes of wound management in recent disasters. We then presented the findings to an international consensus panel with a view to formulating a guideline for the initial management of wounds by first responders and subsequent healthcare personnel as they deploy.

Results

We included 62 studies in the review that described wound care challenges in a diverse range of disasters, and reported high rates of wound infection with multiple causative organisms. The panel defined a guideline in which the emphasis is on not closing wounds primarily but rather directing efforts toward cleaning, debridement, and dressing wounds in preparation for delayed primary closure, or further exploration and management by skilled surgeons.

Conclusion

Good wound care in disaster settings, as outlined in this article, can be achieved with relatively simple measures, and have important mortality and morbidity benefits.

Surgical site infections — management recommendations: Suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections with a significant systemic response such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5° C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/μL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following clean operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low). For infections following operations on the axilla, gastrointestinal tract, perineum, or female genital tract, agents active against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone in combination with metronidazole, are recommended (strong, low).

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^111xkrNx]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prevention and management of infections across the surgical pathway should always focus on collaboration among all healthcare professionals with shared knowledge and widespread diffusion of best practices.

Leading international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), acknowledge that collaborative practice is essential for achieving a concerted approach to providing care that is appropriate to meet the needs of patients, thus optimizing individual health outcomes and overall service delivery of healthcare.

Question 11. Which are the principles of antibiotic prophylaxis?

Statement 11.1. Prolonging antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery is generally not associated with better clinical results.

Statement 11.2. There is no universally recognized intervention for improving the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery. These interventions must be tailored to the type of surgeon and team to which they are addressed.

Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) has been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to reduce the risk of SSIs across different types of surgical procedures.

Given the evidence, systemic PAP is considered to be a key component of perioperative infection prevention bundles. Although compliance with appropriate timing and spectrum of PAP has improved as a result of quality improvement initiatives, there remain significant deficiencies in compliance with other aspects of PAP such as duration of postoperative antibiotics. Given that approximately 15% of all antibiotics in hospitals are prescribed for surgical prophylaxis, perioperative antibiotic prescribing patterns can be a major driver of some emerging infections (such as C. difficile) and selection of antibiotic resistance, increasing healthcare costs.

Although appropriate PAP plays a pivotal role in reducing the rate of SSIs, other factors that impact SSI rates should not be ignored. PAP should never substitute for good medical practices, such as those of IPC. Perioperative SSI prevention strategies should include attention to basic IPC strategies, surgical technique, hospital and operating room environments, instrument sterilization processes, and perioperative optimization of patient risk factors.

The key elements of appropriate surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis prescribing include the correct antimicrobial indication, drug dose, route, the timing of administration, and duration.

Joint guidelines for PAP in surgery were revised and updated in 2013 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Surgical Infection Society, and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. These guidelines focus on the effective and safe use of AP. Therapeutic serum and tissue concentrations of antimicrobial agents should be present during the period of potential contamination. Additional antibiotic doses may need to be administered intraoperatively for prolonged procedures or for agents with short half-lives. In order to be safe, PAP should have no or few adverse effects and should have the narrowest spectrum of activity necessary to prevent postoperative infections.

What is new in the prevention of SSIs? What are the principles of SSI prevention?

Recent global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs can support healthcare workers to develop or strengthen infection prevention and control programs, with a focus on surgical safety, as well as antimicrobial resistance action plans. We recommend that all healthcare workers adopt these evidence-based recommendations in their clinical practice (recommendation 1C).

SSIs are the most common healthcare-associated infections among surgical patients. It is obviously important to improve patient safety by reducing the occurrence of SSIs. Preventing SSIs is a global priority. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, making SSI prevention even more important nowadays.

SSIs are a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and overall direct and not-direct costs worldwide. Despite progress in prevention knowledge, SSIs remain one of the most common adverse events in hospitals. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery.

Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently published guidelines for the prevention of SSIs. The 2016 WHO Global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infection are evidence-based including systematic reviews presenting additional information in support of actions to improve practice.

The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the pre-operative period, and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery, appropriate way for surgical teams to clean their hands, guidance on when to use prophylactic antibiotics, which disinfectants to use before incision, and which sutures to use.

The proposed recommendations are as follows:
"Strong" – Expert panel was confident that benefits outweighed risks, considered to be adaptable for implementation in most (if not all) situations, and patients should receive intervention as course of action.
"Conditional" – Expert panel considered that benefits of intervention probably outweighed the risks; a more structured decision-making process should be undertaken, based on stakeholder consultation and involvement of patients and healthcare professionals.

Antibiotic use in pilonidal disease — perioperative, postoperative, and topical findings are mixed: In a randomized prophylactic trial for excision with primary closure, antibiotics showed no benefit for wound infection (32% vs 36%) or 4‑week healing (69% vs 64%). In a small randomized perioperative study, wound infections at 4 weeks were lower with antibiotics (12% vs 44%), but a comparison of short versus longer perioperative courses showed no difference in healing after excision and primary closure (77% vs 73%). For topical therapy, packing with an absorbable, gentamicin‑impregnated, collagen‑based sponge plus primary closure reported higher wound‑healing rates (86% vs 35%; p < 0.001), yet a systematic review found a nonsignificant trend toward fewer wound infections and no significant influence on wound healing or disease recurrence. Adjunctive use should be considered in the setting of severe cellulitis, underlying immunosuppression, or concomitant systemic illness despite limited evidence in this specific venue.

Background

To provide recommendations on risk mitigation, diagnosis and treatment of infectious complications associated with the practice of regional anesthesia, acute and chronic pain management.

Methods

Following board approval, in 2020 the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA Pain Medicine) commissioned evidence-based guidelines for best practices for infection control. More than 80 research questions were developed and literature searches undertaken by assigned working groups comprising four to five members. Modified US Preventive Services Task Force criteria were used to determine levels of evidence and certainty. Using a modified Delphi method, > 50% agreement was needed to accept a recommendation for author review, and > 75% agreement for a recommendation to be accepted. The ASRA Pain Medicine Board of Directors reviewed and approved the final guidelines.

Results

After documenting the incidence and infectious complications associated with regional anesthesia and interventional pain procedures including implanted devices, we made recommendations regarding the role of the anesthesiologist and pain physician in infection control, preoperative patient risk factors and management, sterile technique, equipment use and maintenance, healthcare setting (office, hospital, operating room), surgical technique, postoperative risk reduction, and infection symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Consensus recommendations were based on risks associated with different settings and procedures, and keeping in mind each patient's unique characteristics.

Conclusions

The recommendations are intended to be multidisciplinary guidelines for clinical care and clinical decision-making in the regional anesthesia and chronic interventional pain practice. The issues addressed are constantly evolving, therefore, consistent updating will be required.

### Adherence to guidelines for the administration of intraoperative antibiotics in a nationwide US sample [^111jG19D]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are currently the leading cause of health care–related infections and unplanned hospital readmissions among surgical patients. Surgical site infections affect about 125 000 surgical cases annually, accounting for nearly 1 million excess hospital days and approximately $1.6 billion in annual incremental health care costs. Reduction of SSIs continues to be a major priority area in health care improvement because these events take a substantial toll on public health and health care resources. It is estimated that half of SSIs are preventable, and efforts directed at the prevention of SSIs have been declared a priority objective by the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, over the past several years, SSI rates have remained stagnant despite the introduction of specific measures and surveillance programs geared toward SSI reduction.

The etiology of SSIs is multifactorial, and although not all risk factors are modifiable, the inappropriate administration of perioperative antibiotics has the potential to contribute to the problem. Importantly, antibiotic management represents a potentially modifiable risk factor. The critical role of appropriate perioperative antibiotics in preventing SSIs has been well established, and has been among the key initiatives of the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP). The SCIP guidelines primarily focus on timing of antibiotics prior to surgery and antibiotic choice for a subset of selected surgical procedures. Whereas the SCIP antibiotic metrics have been a major focus of quality improvement efforts, little information has been reported regarding adherence to additional recommendations contained in the more extensive guidelines endorsed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Surgical Infection Society, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. The salient features of these guidelines for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis include choice of antibiotics tailored to type of surgery, weight-based antibiotic dose adjustment, completion of antibiotic administration prior to skin incision, and intraoperative redosing at specific intervals. The primary objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of guideline adherent practices for antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery among centers participating in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) consortium, a large research and quality improvement consortium based at the University of Michigan.

### Wound care practices after orthopaedic trauma surgery are highly variable and not evidence based [^116TYsL6]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Given the tremendous medical, social and financial costs of surgical site infections, the pressure to minimize these complications has been mounting. There remains a substantial gap in evidence-based practice for postoperative wound care after orthopaedic trauma surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine what standards are currently in practice for postoperative wound management.

Methods

A 16-question web-based survey was published on the Orthopaedic Trauma Association website and disseminated to members through the association's quarterly email. The survey gathered data on postoperative wound care practices; specifically, when wound checks are performed, and when providers allow patients to get the incisions wet.

Results

102 Orthopaedic surgeons completed the survey. Ninety-one percent were trauma fellowship trained, and 95% worked at either a Level I (76%) or Level II (19%) trauma center. There were over 100 different proposed protocols captured by the survey. The majority of surgeons (54%) perform a wound check within the first three days after surgery. Additionally, half of surgeons (50%) do not permit patients to get their incisions wet until sutures and staples are removed.

Conclusion

Wound care routines following surgical management of orthopaedic trauma injuries are highly variable. Diverse protocols are performed at the discretion of the treating surgeon without scientific basis. This study defines immense variability in one aspect of peri-operative care that could play an important role in surgical site infections and provides a foundation for future studies to explore the potential influence of standardized wound care routines on post-operative infections and wound healing.

### Postoperative wound care protocol prevents surgical site infection after craniotomy [^111d2xGe]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 50,000 craniotomy procedures are performed annually in the United States. Surgical site infections (SSIs) after craniotomy cause substantial morbidity and mortality, often requiring extended hospital stays and additional operations. –

Approximately 70% to 95% of SSIs are caused by endogenous flora colonizing the head, neck, and shoulder area. Most SSI prevention strategies involve preoperative chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing, incisional skin antisepsis, appropriate hair removal, antibiotic prophylaxis, intraoperative vancomycin powder and irrigation solution, various closure methods and/or materials, and managing postoperative hyperglycemia. – Some also include screening for and decolonizing Staphylococcus aureus carriers.

In contrast to preoperative and perioperative SSI prevention guidance, postoperative craniotomy SSI prevention efforts have not been standardized. Evidence-based guidelines do not recommend a specific postoperative wound care protocol. Although various publications for postoperative wound management after craniotomy have included options for advanced dressingsand prophylactic topical antibiotic application to the incision, studies focusing on care for postoperative incisional wounds and adjacent hair are lacking.

Post-craniotomy incisional care is complicated by local wound factors, including the high vascularity of the face and scalp (which contributes to clot formation), the high microbial colonization of the sebaceous scalp and head, and the presence of hair, as some neurosurgeons prefer to minimize hair clipping along the incision line. Hair not only causes physical contamination of the incision, but it raises questions about how to keep the area clean and keep adhesive dressings in place.

The objectives of this study were to design an effective postoperative wound care protocol for cleaning craniotomy incisions as well as the surrounding hair, and to evaluate the impact on SSI.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^114cbvjb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Appropriate surgical wound and incision management in the postoperative time period is imperative to prevent SSIs. The term "surgical wound" used in this document refers to a wound created when an incision is made with a scalpel or other sharp cutting device and then closed in the operating room by suture, staple, adhesive tape, or glue and resulting in a close approximation of the skin edges. It is traditional to cover such wounds with a dressing, which acts as a physical barrier to protect the wound from contamination from the external environment until it becomes impermeable to microorganisms.

To assess the effects of wound dressings compared with no wound dressings, and the effects of alternative wound dressings, in preventing SSIs in surgical wound healing by primary intention, a Cochrane review was published in 2016. The authors concluded that it is uncertain whether covering surgical wound healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove. Most studies in this review were small and at a high or unclear risk of bias. Based on the current evidence, decision-makers may wish to base decisions about how to dress a wound following surgery on dressing costs as well as patient preference.

The WHO Global Guidelines for the Prevention of SSIs suggest not using any type of advanced dressing over a standard dressing on primarily closed surgical wounds for the purpose of preventing SSI. Low-quality evidence from ten RCTs shows that advanced dressings applied on primarily closed incisional wounds do not significantly reduce SSI rates compared to standard wound dressings. Postoperative care bundles recommend that surgical dressings be kept undisturbed for a minimum of 48 h after surgery unless leakage occurs.

Question 20. How can we engage surgeons in appropriate infection prevention and management?

Statement 20.1. Active education techniques, such as academic detailing, consensus building sessions and educational workshops, should be implemented in each hospital worldwide according to its own resources.

Statement 20.2. Surgeons with satisfactory knowledge in surgical infections should be involved in the infection control team and recognized as "champions" by the hospital's administration.

### Review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections – are they applicable today? [^117Hg2MC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has complicated the antibiotic selection process. Several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis. New empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

Wound site infections are a major source of postoperative illness, accounting for approximately a quarter of all nosocomial infections. National studies have defined the patients at highest risk for infection in general and in many specific operative procedures. Advances in risk assessment comparison may involve use of the standardized infection ratio, procedure-specific risk factor collection, and logistic regression models. Adherence to recommendations in the 1999 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines should reduce the incidence of infection in surgical patients.

### Intraoperative surgical site infection control and prevention: a position paper and future addendum to WSES intra-abdominal infections guidelines [^116oU2u6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical site infections (SSI) represent a considerable burden for healthcare systems. They are largely preventable and multiple interventions have been proposed over past years in an attempt to prevent SSI.

We aim to provide a position paper on Operative Room (OR) prevention of SSI in patients presenting with intra-abdominal infection to be considered a future addendum to the well-known World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infections.

Methods

The literature was searched for focused publications on SSI until March 2019. Critical analysis and grading of the literature has been performed by a working group of experts; the literature review and the statements were evaluated by a Steering Committee of the WSES.

Results

Wound protectors and antibacterial sutures seem to have effective roles to prevent SSI in intra-abdominal infections. The application of negative-pressure wound therapy in preventing SSI can be useful in reducing postoperative wound complications.

It is important to pursue normothermia with the available resources in the intraoperative period to decrease SSI rate.

The optimal knowledge of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of antibiotics helps to decide when additional intraoperative antibiotic doses should be administered in patients with intra-abdominal infections undergoing emergency surgery to prevent SSI.

Conclusions

The current position paper offers an extensive overview of the available evidence regarding surgical site infection control and prevention in patients having intra-abdominal infections.

### Measures to prevent surgical site infections: what surgeons (should) do [^112Jcxi4]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The present study was designed to evaluate surgeons' strategies and adherence to preventive measures against surgical site infections (SSIs).

Materials and Methods

All surgeons participating in a prospective Swiss multicentric surveillance program for SSIs received a questionnaire developed from the 2008 National (United Kingdom) Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines on prevention and treatment of SSIs. We focused on perioperative management and surgical technique in hernia surgery, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and colon surgery (COL).

Results

Forty-five of 50 surgeons contacted (90%) responded. Smoking cessation and nutritional screening are regularly propagated by 1/3 and 1/2 of surgeons, respectively. Thirty-eight percent practice bowel preparation before COL. Preoperative hair removal is routinely (90%) performed in the operating room with electric clippers. About 50% administer antibiotic prophylaxis within 30 min before incision. Intra-abdominal drains are common after COL (43%). Two thirds of respondents apply nonocclusive wound dressings that are manipulated after hand disinfection (87%). Dressings are usually changed on postoperative day (POD) 2 (75%), and wounds remain undressed on POD 2–3 or 4–5 (36% each).

Conclusions

Surgeons' strategies to prevent SSIs still differ widely. The adherence to the current NICE guidelines is low for many procedures regardless of the available level of evidence. Further research should provide convincing data in order to justify standardization of perioperative management.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — strength of recommendation is interpreted as the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation and how possible it is that it will be overturned by future evidence; recommendations based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect are very difficult to overturn, whereas those derived from a few small retrospective comparative studies are much more likely to be overturned, so the former are given a "strong" strength of recommendation and the latter are presented as options to be considered by the clinician with either a "limited" strength or, if no supporting or only conflicting evidence exists, a "consensus" strength.

### Surgical technical evidence review for elective total joint replacement conducted for the AHRQ safety program for improving surgical care and recovery [^1132j5zS]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Intraoperative Management

Drains

Rationale

Prophylactic drain placement may reduce hematoma formation and prevent wound infection.

Evidence

The literature search identified 212 articles, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria and were specific to total joint replacement: 2 SRs, 3 RCTs, and 7 observational studies. A Cochrane SR in 2007 for patients undergoing major orthopedic operations, including TKA/THA, found no difference in wound infections, hematoma, dehiscence, or reoperations with the routine placement of closed suction drains. A recent SR in patients undergoing TKA found no difference in LOS, postoperative function, or postoperative hemoglobin levels. These findings have been corroborated in additional RCTs, and observational studies. – The AAOS guidelines found strong evidence against the routine use of drains.

Summary and recommendations

There is no evidence supporting the routine use of drains in patients undergoing elective joint replacement.

Postoperative Management

Early mobilization/ambulation

Rationale

Early mobilization may improve postoperative outcomes but potentially at the expense of wound disruption.

Evidence

The literature search identified 283 articles, of which 2 met the inclusion criteria and were specific to total joint replacement: 1 SR and 1 RCT. One SR/MAcompared patients undergoing TKA/THA mobilized on postoperative day 0 (4 of 5 studies) or day 1 compared to controls (day 2 or later). Early mobilization reduced LOS by 1.8 days, with secondary outcomes (function, QOL, adverse events, patient satisfaction) no different or favoring early mobilization. One additional RCTrandomized 119 THA patients to day of surgery mobilization versus day after surgery. This study was limited to nonobese, limited complexity (ASA score 2 or less) patients under the care of a single surgeon. They found an increased proportion of intervention patients were discharged at 48 or 72 hours, but no difference in mean LOS. Neither the SR nor the RCT explicitly describes the effect of early mobilization on rates of wound disruption. The AAOS guidelines found moderate (THA) and strong (TKA) evidence in favor of early mobilization for improving LOS and function.

Summary and recommendations

Mobilization of patients on postoperative day 0 appears to be effective and safe. For the majority of patients, mobilization should begin within 24 hours of surgery unless a significant contraindication exists.

### Intraoperative surgical site infection control and prevention: a position paper and future addendum to WSES intra-abdominal infections guidelines [^1149dEFD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We conceived this position paper to offer an extensive overview of available evidence regarding OR prevention of surgical site infection in emergency surgery as a potential addendum to WSES guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infections.

The use of triclosan-coated suture significantly reduces SSI prevalence compared with the non-coated sutures.

The use of wound protectors has protective effects in reducing incisional SSI, in particular, the use of dual-ring constructed wound protectors appears to be superior to single-ring devices in preventing SSI.

The application of negative-pressure wound therapy in preventing SSI may be effective in reducing postoperative wound complications and it may be an option to take into consideration especially in patients with a high risk of infection.

Intraoperative normothermia decreases the rate of SSI, and the use of active warming devices in the operating room is useful to keep normothermia.

Perioperative supplemental oxygenation does not reduce SSI.

There is no strong evidence that delayed primary skin closure may reduce the incidence of SSI but it may be a valid option to primary skin closure in highly contaminated or "dirty" abdominal operations, especially in patients at high risk of infection.

The optimal knowledge and use of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of antibiotics are important to evaluate when additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively in patients with intra-abdominal infections undergoing emergency surgery.

Surgical site infection — procedural management and systemic therapy indicate that suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections associated with a significant systemic response, such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5°C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/mL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low).

### Challenges and management of surgical site occurrences [^113jZ4HC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Postoperative complications such as surgical site infections, dehiscence, seromas, and hematomas prolong wound care and impose significant cost increases to patients and healthcare providers. Clinicians aiming to reduce the incidence of these complications should be aware of risk factors associated with surgical type, procedures used, patient characteristics, and postoperative care. Today, improved guidelines and general practices for managing surgical incisions have reduced the incidence of complications to historic lows. In addition to these standard care options, advanced wound care approaches have been extensively studied and exist as options for clinicians to provide adjunctive postoperative support and facilitate wound healing. These systems include advanced wound dressings and closed-incision negative-pressure therapy. Advanced wound care is not appropriate in all settings, and healthcare providers must assess each case for specific needs to be addressed by the available incision management plans. Emerging therapies that are intended to improve the continuum of postoperative care should continue to be evaluated in controlled clinical trials to determine their effectiveness under different circumstances and to support the creation of more robust guidelines for their use.

### Optimal perioperative management of the geriatric patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society [^113z37kq]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis — older adult surgical patients: The relationship between appropriately dosed preoperative antibiotics and reduced risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) is well-established, and studies have also suggested a mortality benefit at 60 days for older patients who receive preoperative antibiotics within at least two hours of incision. Older patients may have compromised renal function and, as such, may require particular attention to dosing. The risk of SSI is highly dependent on the type of surgery, and procedures at particularly high risk of infection include abdominal operations, operations requiring bowel anastomosis, contaminated or dirty procedures, procedures for cancer, and prolonged, complex, or emergent procedures. Preoperative antibiotics should be given based on procedure, risk factors, and the hospital's unique pathogen profile within 60 minutes before surgical incision.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for colorectal surgery [^111nNCu2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Research shows that administration of prophylactic antibiotics before colorectal surgery prevents postoperative surgical wound infection. The best antibiotic choice, timing of administration and route of administration remain undetermined.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical wound infection in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Specifically to determine:1. whether antimicrobial prophylaxis reduces the risk of surgical wound infection;2. the target spectrum of bacteria (aerobic or anaerobic bacteria, or both);3. the best timing and duration of antibiotic administration;4. the most effective route of antibiotic administration (intravenous, oral or both);5. whether any antibiotic is clearly more effective than the currently recommended gold standard specified in published guidelines;6. whether antibiotics should be given before or after surgery.

Search Methods

For the original review published in 2009 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid). For the update of this review we rewrote the search strategies and extended the search to cover from 1954 for MEDLINE and 1974 for EMBASE up to 7 January 2013. We searched CENTRAL on the same date (Issue 12, 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotic use in elective and emergency colorectal surgery, with surgical wound infection as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted and reviewed by one review author and checked by another only for the single, dichotomous outcome of surgical wound infection. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE methods.

Main Results

This updated review includes 260 trials and 68 different antibiotics, including 24 cephalosporins and 43,451 participants. Many studies had multiple variables that separated the two study groups; these could not be compared to other studies that tested one antibiotic and had a single variable separating the two groups. We did not consider the risk of bias arising from attrition and lack of blinding of outcome assessors to affect the results for surgical wound infection. Meta-analyses demonstrated a statistically significant difference in postoperative surgical wound infection when prophylactic antibiotics were compared to placebo/no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.41, high quality evidence). This translates to a reduction in risk from 39% to 13% with prophylactic antibiotics. The slightly higher risk of wound infection with short-term compared with long-term duration antibiotic did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30). Similarly risk of would infection was slightly higher with single-dose antibiotics when compared with multiple dose antibiotics, but the results are compatible with benefit and harm (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.10). Additional aerobic coverage and additional anaerobic coverage both showed statistically significant improvements in surgical wound infection rates (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.68 and RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71, respectively), as did combined oral and intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis when compared to intravenous alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.74), or oral alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76). Comparison of an antibiotic with anaerobic specificity to one with aerobic specificity showed no significant advantage for either one (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.36). Two small studies compared giving antibiotics before or after surgery and no significant difference in this timing was found (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.15). Established gold-standard regimens recommended in major guidelines were no less effective than any other antibiotic choice.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has found high quality evidence that antibiotics covering aerobic and anaerobic bacteria delivered orally or intravenously (or both) prior to elective colorectal surgery reduce the risk of surgical wound infection. Our review shows that antibiotics delivered within this framework can reduce the risk of postoperative surgical wound infection by as much as 75%. It is not known whether oral antibiotics would still have these effects when the colon is not empty. This aspect of antibiotic dosing has not been tested. Further research is required to establish the optimal timing and duration of dosing, and the frequency of longer-term adverse effects such as Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis.

### Progress in the prevention of surgical site infection [^113s1y49]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review summarizes some of the key papers on the prevention of surgical site infections (SSI) published in 2008.

Recent Findings

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published guidelines on the prevention and management of SSI. These guidelines follow a similar format to those published previously. There are, however, some important differences to previous recommendations and these are outlined in this current article. Other publications have provided additional evidence that suggests certain antiseptic agents are more efficacious than others for surgical hand antisepsis. Staphylococcus aureus decolonization has also been studied and noted to be of benefit for the prevention of SSI. Other research studies have focused on patient homeostasis, including the use of supplemental perioperative oxygen, which has resulted in mixed findings. Finally, the use of surveillance to evaluate the efficacy of 'care bundles' has been reported, which brings together many different approaches for the prevention of SSI.

Summary

Several evaluations of pre, peri and postoperative strategies for the prevention of SSI have been published in 2008, some of which have raised some fundamental questions.

### Centers for disease control and prevention guideline for the prevention of surgical site infection, 2017 [^1122bqge]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The human and financial costs of treating surgical site infections (SSIs) are increasing. The number of surgical procedures performed in the United States continues to rise, and surgical patients are initially seen with increasingly complex comorbidities. It is estimated that approximately half of SSIs are deemed preventable using evidence-based strategies.

Objective

To provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI.

Evidence Review

A targeted systematic review of the literature was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from 1998 through April 2014. A modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence and the strength of the resulting recommendation and to provide explicit links between them. Of 5759 titles and abstracts screened, 896 underwent full-text review by 2 independent reviewers. After exclusions, 170 studies were extracted into evidence tables, appraised, and synthesized.

Findings

Before surgery, patients should shower or bathe (full body) with soap (antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial) or an antiseptic agent on at least the night before the operative day. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered only when indicated based on published clinical practice guidelines and timed such that a bactericidal concentration of the agents is established in the serum and tissues when the incision is made. In cesarean section procedures, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered before skin incision. Skin preparation in the operating room should be performed using an alcohol-based agent unless contraindicated. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, additional prophylactic antimicrobial agent doses should not be administered after the surgical incision is closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. Topical antimicrobial agents should not be applied to the surgical incision. During surgery, glycemic control should be implemented using blood glucose target levels less than 200 mg/dL, and normothermia should be maintained in all patients. Increased fraction of inspired oxygen should be administered during surgery and after extubation in the immediate postoperative period for patients with normal pulmonary function undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Transfusion of blood products should not be withheld from surgical patients as a means to prevent SSI.

Conclusions and Relevance

This guideline is intended to provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI and should be incorporated into comprehensive surgical quality improvement programs to improve patient safety.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111jEtWA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

An incisional SSI should be sampled if there is a clinical suspicion of infection. Lack of standardized criteria for diagnostic microbiology of SSIs present a challenge to monitor the global epidemiology of surgical site infection. Emergence of antibiotic resistance has made the management of SSIs difficult. Moreover, rapidly emerging nosocomial pathogens and the problem of multidrug resistance necessitates periodic review of isolation patterns and their sensitivity.

Adequate treatment of incisional SSIs should always include:
Surgical incision and drainage of abscess.
Debridement of necrotic tissue, if present.
Appropriate wound care.
Resuscitation to improve perfusion when sepsis is present.
Adequate empiric antibiotic therapy when indicated.
De-escalation when antibiogram is available.

Incisional SSIs should always be drained, irrigated, and if needed, opened and debrided. If fascial disruption is suspected, drainage should always be performed. Percutaneous drainage, wound irrigation, and negative pressure-assisted wound management are new and effective options that reduce the need for open management of wound infections. In cases where open management is needed, once the infection has cleared, the wound can be closed.

Superficial incisional SSIs that have been opened can usually be managed without antibiotics.

In patients with incisional SSIs with the presence of any systemic inflammatory response criteria or signs of organ failure such as hypotension, oliguria, decreased mental alertness, or in immunocompromised patients, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment should be started with coverage for Gram-positive cocci and/or the expected flora at the site of operation. Definitive antibiotic treatment is guided by the clinical response of the patient and, when available, results of gram stain, wound culture, and antibiogram.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112XpKn6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections — incidence, classification, and timing: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common adverse events affecting hospitalized surgical patients, with an average incidence of SSI of 2.6%, accounting for 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. SSIs are divided into the categories of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ/space SSI. Superficial incisional SSIs involve only the subcutaneous space between the skin and underlying muscular fascia, occur within 30 days of the surgery, and are documented with at least 1 of the following: purulent incisional drainage; positive culture of aseptically obtained fluid or tissue from the superficial wound; local signs and symptoms of pain or tenderness, swelling, and erythema after the incision is opened by the surgeon; or diagnosis of SSI by the attending surgeon or physician. A deep incisional infection involves the deeper soft tissue and occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if a prosthesis was inserted, and an organ/space SSI has the same time constraints and evidence for infection and may involve any part of the anatomy other than the original surgical incision. Flat, erythematous skin changes can occur around or near a surgical incision during the first week without swelling or wound drainage, most resolve without any treatment, and the cause may relate to tape sensitivity or other local tissue insult not involving bacteria. Antibiotics begun immediately postoperatively or continued for long periods after the procedure do not prevent or cure this inflammation or infection; therefore, the suspicion of possible SSI does not justify use of antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis and measures such as opening the wound. SSIs rarely occur during the first 48 hours after surgery and are almost always due to S. pyogenes or Clostridium species when they do; after 48 hours, SSI is a more common source of fever and, by 4 days after surgery, a fever is equally likely to be caused by an SSI or by another infection or other unknown sources.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^112vEQE9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are potentially life-threatening infections of any layer of the soft tissue compartment associated with widespread necrosis and systemic toxicity. Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidence-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The multifaceted nature of these infections has led to a collaboration among surgeons, intensive care and infectious diseases specialists, who have shared these guidelines, implementing clinical practice recommendations.

### Updated recommendations for control of surgical site infections [^116ZraiQ]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to provide updated guidelines for the prevention of surgical wound infections based upon review and interpretation of the current and past literature.

Background

The development and treatment of surgical wound infections has always been a limiting factor to the success of surgical treatment. Although continuous improvements have been made, surgical site infections continue to occur at an unacceptable rate, annually costing billions of dollars in economic loss caused by associated morbidity and mortality.

Methods

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided extensive recommendations for the control of surgical infections in 1999. Review of the current literature with interpretation of the findings has been done to update the recommendations.

Results

New and sometimes conflicting studies indicate that coordination and application of techniques and procedures to decrease wound infections will be highly successful, even in patients with very high risks.

Conclusions

This review suggests that uniform adherence to the proposed guidelines for the prevention of surgical infections could reduce wound infections significantly; namely to a target of less than 0.5% in clean wounds, less than 1% in clean contaminated wounds and less than 2% in highly contaminated wounds and decrease related costs to less than one-half of the current amount.

### The role of postoperative factors in surgical site infections: time to take notice [^112HdDS8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) continue to occur, in many instances despite high compliance with best practice measures primarily revolving around pre- and intraoperative periods. Postoperative factors have traditionally been considered to play a relatively minor role in the causation of SSIs. An increasing body of evidence, however, suggests that many SSIs occur as a result of pathogens gaining access to surgical wounds either hematogenously, through drains, or through slowly healing wounds due to systemic anticoagulation or other factors, particularly in the setting of high compliance with standard perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Evidence also supports frequent acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) during the postoperative period. These findings, coupled with lack of clear efficacy of various pre- and intraoperative interventions such as MRSA decolonization and use of vancomycin for prophylaxis against this organism, should force us to consider the important role that postoperative factors may play in the causation of SSIs in the current era.

### Delphi prioritization and development of global surgery guidelines for the prevention of surgical-site infection [^116YVfar]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

SSI is the commonest postoperative complication in abdominal surgery 12, 13, 14. Initiatives to reduce it should be prioritized worldwide, but the need is greatest in LMICs, where up to one‐quarter of patients develop an SSI after gastrointestinal surgery 13. Antimicrobial resistance is significantly more common in LMICs than HICs 13, 15. The current guideline offers a potential pathway to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the high healthcare costs incurred by SSI 16, in particular by providing clear guidance regarding the selection, timing and route of administration of prophylactic antibiotics. This guideline implements research findings which may reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure at a population level, for example by reducing the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis 17, 18. This will support antibiotic stewardship initiatives aimed at curbing antimicrobial resistance.

The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist has been disseminated widely, and has been demonstrated to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality 19, 20, 21. Some health systems have embedded an SSI bundle in local versions of the checklist to ensure that all patients receive key interventions to reduce infection risk. Surgical colleges and associations should work with healthcare providers to produce local Surgical Safety Checklists that incorporate this guideline's key recommendations. Given that the checklist is used in only half of emergency abdominal procedures in middle‐income countries and a third of procedures in low‐income countries 22, implementation of these guidelines should be performed alongside broader initiatives to increase uptake of the checklist 23. There remain significant evidence gaps in the prevention of SSI, highlighted by the four research recommendations made in this guideline. In order to inform policy in LMICs, it is essential that future trials incorporate health economic evaluation 24.

Stage 3: in‐person meeting of guideline panel

An international guideline panel met in person on 17 June 2019 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The panel included senior surgeons and methodologists. The panel's deliberations were led by the same individuals who had co‐chaired discussion in stage 1. The results of the voting in stage 2 informed the guideline panel's discussions. For each draft recommendation the panel formed a consensus on which of the following decisions to take:
To accept it with its current wording.
To accept it after rewording aimed at either reducing its ambiguity, or maximizing its relevance. When appropriate, the panel combined separate draft statements into single recommendations.
To change it to a research recommendation. Research recommendations were made if relevant ongoing trials were identified, and the panel agreed that the outcome of these trials should be awaited before making a recommendation. In addition, if the panel agreed that it was not possible to make a decision based on the existing evidence base, a recommendation was made regarding the need for future research.
To eliminate it entirely.

Finalized recommendations were additionally stratified as: essential – the panel agreed that these recommendations are baseline measures required for safe surgery and should be implemented as a priority across all hospitals performing surgery; or desirable – the panel recognized that at present some hospitals lack resources to implement these recommendations, but agreed that all hospitals performing surgery should plan their future implementation.

### Outcomes of different perioperative management strategies of patients on chronic anticoagulation in elective total hip and knee arthroplasty: a systematic review [^117L4VSG]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are currently different management guidelines for patients undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that are on long-term anticoagulation. The timing of discontinuation and restarting the anticoagulation is challenging during the postoperative care, which often involves general practitioners and physiotherapists.

Methods

The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines and included 3 databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science Core Collection. It was registered in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PROSPERO) under the registration number: CRD42023408906. The risk of bias assessment was performed using the Methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) criteria.

Results

Six retrospective studies involving 727 patients with therapeutic anticoagulation (1,540 controls) for elective THA, TKA and revision arthroplasty have been included. The follow-up ranged from 30 days to 1 year postoperatively. All studies evaluated outcomes of warfarin therapeutic anticoagulation versus prophylactic dosages of one or more of the following: warfarin, aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated low-dose heparin (UFH). One study did not discontinue therapeutic anticoagulation. Two studies reported no significant differences in complications between groups, whilst 3 studies had significantly higher rates of superficial wound infections, revision surgeries, postoperative haematomas, and prosthetic joint infections (PJI).

Conclusion

Different anticoagulation-related perioperative management strategies achieve different outcomes following elective arthroplasty in patients with therapeutic chronic anticoagulation. There is contradictory evidence regarding the need for the discontinuation of therapeutic warfarin. Retrospective data showed that individual risk stratification with multi-modal prophylaxis resulted in minimal complications.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

### Postoperative wound infections of the spine [^114rJm28]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Postoperative spinal wound infections occur in 1 to 12% of patients. The rate of infection is related to the type and duration of the procedure, comorbidities, nutritional status, and various other risk factors. Antibiotic prophylactic therapy has been clearly shown to decrease the rate of infection dramatically after lumbar surgery. These infections typically manifest with signs and symptoms of wound swelling, erythema, and drainage. Laboratory-detected values such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein can be elevated beyond what is normal for the uncomplicated postoperative course following lumbar surgery, and combined with the clinical symptoms should alert the physician to the possibility of infection. When detected, these infections should be managed aggressively with operative debridment and irrigation, including the deep subfascial layer in all cases except those with clearly demarcated superficial infection. The choice of one versus multiple debridments can be made based on the appearance of the wound, patient factors, and nutritional status. Hardware and incorporated bone graft can be left in place in the majority of cases, adding to stability. Outcomes following aggressive treatment of this complication can be excellent, with no long-term loss of function and complete eradication of the infection.

### Intraoperative wound irrigation for the prevention of surgical site infection after laparotomy: a randomized clinical trial by CHIR-net [^112wKrdV]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

According to the GlobalSurg Collaborative, postoperative surgical site infection is the most common type of hospital-acquired infection across all income and development settings after gastrointestinal surgery. Surgical site infections prolong the length of hospital stay and increase costs and morbidity and mortality rates. While European surveillance datashow surgical site infection rates of 10.1% after open colorectal surgery, randomized clinical trials, have demonstrated an incidence of 15% to 30%, depending mainly on the intraoperative level of contamination according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2). Most patient-related risk factors for surgical site infection, such as age, obesity, diabetes, and comorbidities, are hardly modifiable. Therefore, the optimization of surgery-related factors to reduce intraoperative contamination by using sterile techniques and application of antiseptic or antibiotic substances has been the focus of current research. Intraoperative wound irrigation of the surgical incision at the end of surgery is widely practiced, and a multitude of antiseptic irrigation solutions are available, although evidence-based recommendations are inconsistent. While the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline (2019) recommends against intraoperative wound irrigation due to lack of evidence, the World Health Organization (2016) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017) guidelines recommend consideration of intraoperative wound irrigation with aqueous iodophor (povidone-iodine) solution for surgical site infection prevention, (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement 2). Most abdominal surgery clinical trials are outdated (1970 to 1990) and demonstrate high risk of bias. A large systematic review and meta-analysisincluded all kinds of surgery and compared, nonantibacterial, antiseptic, and antibiotic irrigation solutions to no irrigation. The mean odds ratio of surgical site infection was significantly lower for antibiotic and antiseptic irrigations, and no irrigation was comparable to nonantibacterial irrigation.

### Delphi prioritization and development of global surgery guidelines for the prevention of surgical-site infection [^113tsV4j]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Delphi prioritization of guideline topics

A total of 56 surgeons from across 15 LMICs proposed 34 guideline topics. The top 12 topics were shortlisted, and these were then prioritized in an online vote by 736 participants representing 82 LMICs. The overall top ranked topic (Fig. 1) was prevention of surgical‐site infection (SSI); this was ranked in the top two guideline topics across all country‐income strata (Table S3, supporting information). The steering committee refined the scope for this guideline to focus on preoperative and intraoperative interventions aimed at reducing SSI risk in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Postoperative interventions and the management of SSI were not planned to be included in the guideline.

Overall ranking of top 12 shortlisted guideline topics across all low‐ and middle‐income country settings

Stage 0: preparation of initial draft recommendations

In keeping with the planned methodology, a search was completed on 12 September 2018 to identify existing guidelines relevant to the prevention of SSI. Five eligible guidelines 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 for the prevention of SSI were identified. A total of 160 recommendations were extracted from the guidelines. Following consolidation of identical recommendations across different guidelines, 124 recommendations remained. Of these, 56 recommendations were eligible according to the criteria of being supported by at least two separate guidelines, with moderate to strong supporting evidence. Similar recommendations were synthesized and refined, producing a shortlist of 31 draft recommendations (Table S2, supporting information). The flow of recommendations through the guideline development process is summarized in Fig. 2.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery cardiac society turnkey order set for surgical-site infection prevention: proceedings from the American Association for Thoracic Surgery ERAS conclave 2023 [^115kXkBM]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Surgical-site infections (SSIs) after cardiac surgery increase morbidity and mortality, consume health care resources, impair recovery, and diminish patients' quality of life. Numerous guidelines and expert consensus documents have been published to address the prevention and management of SSIs. Our objective is to integrate these documents into an order set that will facilitate the adoption and implementation of evidence-based best practices for preventing and managing SSIs after cardiac surgery.

Methods

Subject matter experts were consulted to translate existing guidelines and literature into a sample turnkey order set for SSI reduction. Orders derived from consistent class I, IIA, or equivalent recommendations across referenced guidelines and consensus manuscripts appear in the turnkey order set in bold type. Selected orders that were inconsistent class I or IIA, class IIB or otherwise supported by published evidence, were also included in italicized type.

Results

Preventative care begins with the preoperative identification of both modifiable and nonmodifiable SSI risks by health care providers. Assessment tools can be used to assist in identifying patients at a high risk of SSI. Preoperative recommendations include screening for and treating Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage. Intraoperatively, tailored prophylactic intravenous antibiotics and maintaining blood glucose levels below 180 mg/dL are essential elements. Postoperative care includes maintaining normothermia, glucose control and patient engagement.

Conclusions

Despite the well-documented advantages of a multidisciplinary care pathway for SSI in cardiac surgery, there are inconsistencies in its adoption and implementation. This article provides an order set that incorporates recommendations from existing guidelines to prevent SSI in the cardiac surgical population.

### New WHO recommendations on intraoperative and postoperative measures for surgical site infection prevention: an evidence-based global perspective [^113UgEif]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common health-care-associated infections in developing countries, but they also represent a substantial epidemiological burden in high-income countries. The prevention of these infections is complex and requires the integration of a range of preventive measures before, during, and after surgery. No international guidelines are available and inconsistencies in the interpretation of evidence and recommendations in national guidelines have been identified. Considering the prevention of SSIs as a priority for patient safety, WHO has developed evidence-based and expert consensus-based recommendations on the basis of an extensive list of preventive measures. We present in this Review 16 recommendations specific to the intraoperative and postoperative periods. The WHO recommendations were developed with a global perspective and they take into account the balance between benefits and harms, the evidence quality level, cost and resource use implications, and patient values and preferences.

### Device evaluation, treatment, and explantation recommendations (DETER): review and best practices for managing neuromodulation device infections [^1171HuwG]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Infections related to neuromodulation devices such as spinal cord stimulators (SCS) and intrathecal pumps (ITPs) present complex challenges due to potential complications such as localized infections, deep infections, sepsis, and neurological injury. Prompt diagnosis requires patients and providers to be educated on wound management and sepsis symptoms for immediate medical attention. Antibiotic therapy and duration vary based on infection severity, with deep infections often requiring device removal despite recent improvements in salvage rates with aggressive initial intervention. Deep infections necessitate timely diagnosis through imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), followed by device removal and culture-guided antibiotic therapy, often in collaboration with infectious disease specialists and spine surgeons. ITP infections pose similar challenges along with the risk of meningitis and may require careful management of medication withdrawal symptoms during emergent pump removal. Lab monitoring may aid treatment assessment, although negative cultures can occur due to post-antibiotic exposure. Postoperative recommendations stress standardized guidelines, patient education, and vigilant surveillance, with close follow-up crucial for early infection detection and intervention. Managing device-related infections demands a multi-specialty approach to minimize complications and optimize outcomes. This paper outlines best practices for diagnosing, managing, and treating neuromodulation device infections, focusing on guiding clinical decision-making from the onset of infection through treatment and potential reimplantation.

Wound infection algorithm — fever > 4 days after operation with wound findings is stratified under erythema and/or induration: Temp < 38 °C WBC < 12 000 erythema < 5 cm leads to dressing changes, no antibiotics, whereas Temp > 38 °C WBC > 12 000 erythema > 5 cm from incision with induration or any necrosis leads to begin antibiotics and dressing changes. For site-specific management, clean wound, trunk, head, neck, extremity is treated with start cefazolin or vancomycina until MRSA ruled out, while wound of perineum or operation on GI tract or female genital tract is treated with start cefoxitin or cefotetan or levofloxacin+metronidazole or carbapenem; if the wound normal to exam, seek other sources of fever.

### Selection and administration… [^111gGzpE]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

This translates to an additional $1. 5 billion in health care costs annually. 2 The occurrence of wound infection requires a local inoculum sufficient to overcome host defenses and establish growth. The process is complex and depends on the interaction of various host, local tissue and microbial virulence factors. Measures intended to prevent wound infection typically attempt to modify the host and local tissue factors and include, for example, preoperative optimization of comorbid illness, control of the operative environment, proper cleansing of the skin and use of aseptic surgical technique. Antibiotic prophylaxis is only one relatively minor effort among numerous preventive measures, but the efficacy and impact of antimicrobial prophylaxis has clearly been demonstrated to be significant. 3, 4. The duration of an adequate tissue level of the antibiotic need not exceed the operative period.

The duration of administration is extended only in special circumstances, such as gross contamination secondary to a ruptured viscus or severe trauma. The available data provide no evidence for the efficacy of extending coverage to 24 to 48 hours in such contexts.
17. Cutaneous and Superficial Soft Tissue Procedures Prophylaxis is not indicated for cutaneous and superficial soft tissue procedures. For patients with two or more significant risk factors, prophylaxis is acceptable but not strongly indicated. Traumatic wounds require consideration of the status of the patient's tetanus vaccination. Although a single dose of antibiotic is acceptable, mechanical cleansing and adherence to guidelines for open management of wounds created more than 12 hours before treatment are the essential elements of prophylaxis. Head and Neck Procedures For procedures entailing entry into the oropharynx or esophagus, coverage of aerobic cocci is indicated.

Prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of severe wound infection by approximately 50 percent. 18, 19 Either penicillin or cephalosporin-based prophylaxis is effective. Cefazolin is commonly used. Prophylaxis is not indicated for dentoalveolar procedures, although prophylaxis is warranted in immunocompromised patients undergoing these procedures. 26, 27 Therefore, additional prophylaxis is recommended. Options include either intraluminal prophylaxis directed at aerobic and anaerobic bacteria or the parenteral administration of similarly active antibiotics immediately before the operation. 28 In general, the addition of intraluminal antibiotics reduces the risk of infection to approximately 9 percent or less, similar to the risk associated with parenteral administration alone.

### Best practices for postoperative management of posterior sacroiliac joint fusion [^111LBRCk]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Tobacco Use

The use of tobacco can increase postoperative complications including impaired wound healing, augmented infection, and delayed and/or impaired arthrodesis. One systematic review and meta analysis study demonstrated a relative risk reduction of 41% for prevention of postoperative complications. Each week of cessation increased the magnitude of effect by 19%. Therefore, tobacco use should be avoided to decrease the incidence of postoperative complications.

Antibiotics

Antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) plays an important role in reducing surgical site infections, especially if patient-related risk factors for infection are present. Guidelines for implementing antibiotics for surgical procedures vary by type of surgery, surgical wound classification and patient risk factors and comorbidities. National quality improvement efforts have focused on reduction of surgical site infections and have developed initiatives for improved antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery. As mentioned earlier, the posterior SIJ fusion is considered a class 1, clean, non-contaminated surgical procedure, with less than 2% infection risk, as classified by the CDC. Antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients undergoing clean procedures is not well established and generally not recommended, however, there is stronger support and evidence for prophylactic antimicrobial treatment when implanted hardware or foreign materials are involved in orthopedic procedures, or spinal procedures with or without instrumentation or hardware. This is especially true for the intraoperative phase and administration of the prophylactic agent should start within 30 minutes from the surgical incision. Duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis should not exceed 24 hours for most surgical procedures. Tan et alconducted a systematic review and found that in the presence of intraoperative and pre-incisional antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative antibiotics for surgical site infection reduction did not show evidence of reduced infection rates in lumbar spinal surgery patients. Therefore, postoperative administration of prophylactic antibiotics after posterior SIJ fusion surgery is not supported.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^1131mAPf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 1. How can you implement global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs)?

Statement 1.1. Recent global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs can support healthcare workers to develop or strengthen infection prevention and control programs, with a focus on surgical safety, as well as AMR action plans. All healthcare workers should adopt these evidence-based recommendations in their clinical practice.

Statement 1.2. A safer surgical care requires a range of precautions aimed at reducing the risk of SSIs before, during and after surgery.

Statement 1.3. To support local implementation of guidelines for the prevention of SSIs, 5 steps of a multimodal strategy, including system change, training and education, evaluation and feedback, communications for awareness raising and institutional safety climate and culture are suggested.

Improving behavior in infection prevention and control (IPC) practices remains a challenge. Despite progress in preventive knowledge, SSIs remain the most common HAI among surgical patients and one of the most frequent adverse events in hospitals. They represent a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and overall direct and not direct costs worldwide. It is obviously important to improve patient safety by reducing the occurrence of SSIs. Preventing SSIs is a global priority, also because bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, making SSI prevention even more important nowadays. On the other hand, SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery.

Both WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published guidelines for the prevention of SSIs. The 2016 WHO Global guidelines for the prevention of SSI are evidence-based including systematic reviews presenting additional information in support of actions to improve practice. The first-ever global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs were published on November 3, 2016, then were updated in some parts and published in a new edition in December 2018. The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the preoperative period and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery, appropriate way for surgical teams to clean their hands, guidance on when to use prophylactic antibiotics, which disinfectants to use before incision, and which sutures to use.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1151PCTJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.
