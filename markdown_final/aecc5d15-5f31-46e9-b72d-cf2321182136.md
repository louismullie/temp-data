## Question

By what mechanism does G-POEM alleviate gastroparesis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how G-POEM alleviates gastroparesis — its mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of gastroparesis and whether pyloric dysfunction is a key, actionable driver. Then, I should verify how G-POEM technically targets the pylorus and whether myotomy characteristics matter. Next, I need to check the physiological impact on gastric emptying and correlate that with symptom outcomes in randomized and prospective studies. After that, I will compare G-POEM's mechanistic approach with alternatives like botulinum toxin, dilation, and gastric electrical stimulation. Finally, I should confirm safety, appropriate patient selection, and integrate a concise mechanism statement that is evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiological framework I'm relying on before attributing benefit to pylorus-directed therapy; gastroparesis is defined by delayed gastric emptying absent obstruction, with multifactorial mechanisms including impaired fundic accommodation, antral hypomotility, gastric dysrhythmias, and critically, disordered pyloric function that may increase outflow resistance and delay emptying, with manometry and EndoFLIP studies demonstrating altered pyloric tone in many patients [^112YM1u8] [^116PgYhQ] [^111J5kDJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure that G-POEM indeed targets the hypothesized bottleneck, the pylorus, in a manner likely to relieve functional obstruction, and the procedure was explicitly developed to perform an endoscopic pyloromyotomy using a submucosal tunneling approach adapted from esophageal POEM to cut the pyloric muscle and thereby reduce pyloric resistance [^116sgVqQ] [^114SRoNz] [^112sFDyg].

> I will now examine the technical steps to be precise: submucosal injection, mucosal incision, submucosal tunneling to the pylorus, pyloromyotomy, and closure of the entry site; wait, I initially thought "full-thickness pyloromyotomy" was uniform, but I should correct that — most centers perform a selective circular myotomy, with technical guidance emphasizing adequate tunnel length and extension of the myotomy to include the pyloric ring and sometimes 2–3 cm into the duodenal bulb for completeness, while technique can be tailored to anatomy and operator preference [^116sgVqQ] [^115EzThf] [^114V1yCH].

> Let me think about the physiologic effect next; by transecting the circular pyloric fibers, G-POEM reduces pyloric tone and outflow resistance, which should accelerate gastric emptying in appropriately selected patients, and this acceleration has been repeatedly documented on scintigraphy with pooled reductions in 4-hour retention of roughly 22–26% and higher rates of gastric emptying improvement or normalization in meta-analyses and comparative trials, consistent with the hypothesized mechanical relief of a pyloric bottleneck [^111J5kDJ] [^116PgYhQ] [^115iwWB4] [^112hXFHz].

> Wait, let me verify how these physiologic gains map onto symptoms; randomized and prospective data show that symptom improvement accompanies pyloromyotomy: in a sham-controlled RCT, clinical success at 6 months was 71% with G-POEM versus 22% with sham, while prospective multicenter cohorts demonstrate 56–66% one-year success with symptom and quality-of-life improvements, and three-year durability near 65% in selected cohorts, with some heterogeneity by etiology and baseline severity that argues for careful selection and expectation setting [^112Q3ovb] [^115WT8iR] [^116U2r84] [^1148ofUB] [^112oK9jr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, the abbreviation "GES" can be confusing; I should double-check the context — when reporting a 72% "GES improvement rate" after G-POEM in the randomized comparison with botulinum toxin, GES refers to gastric emptying scintigraphy, not gastric electrical stimulation, and in that trial G-POEM produced numerically higher clinical and scintigraphic improvement than botulinum toxin at 3–12 months, aligning with a durable mechanical effect on pyloric resistance rather than a transient pharmacologic relaxation [^115zbVB7].

> Let me compare mechanisms to avoid conflation; gastric electrical stimulation modulates neural pathways for nausea/vomiting without consistently normalizing emptying, balloon dilation is transient and nonstandardized, and botulinum toxin provides short-lived chemical denervation, whereas G-POEM's endoscopic myotomy directly and precisely disrupts the pyloric musculature, offering a more definitive and durable reduction in pyloric outflow resistance when pyloric dysfunction is contributory, a distinction reflected in guideline caution against routine dilation and in observational data suggesting lower recurrence versus stimulator in some settings [^114z2mfP] [^117BMQLk] [^112sFDyg].

> Next, I should review who benefits most to keep the mechanism-patient match tight; guidelines advise offering pylorus-directed therapies only after objective confirmation of delayed emptying and failure of medical therapy, with scintigraphic gastric emptying as the first-line diagnostic, and predictors such as higher 4-hour retention and higher baseline GCSI associating with response, while emerging tools like EndoFLIP and regional retention patterns may refine selection, though I need to ensure we don't overstate these as definitive until validated prospectively [^112sFDyg] [^116pdZ6Y] [^115WT8iR] [^1148ofUB] [^112PbrmP].

> I need to check safety before concluding; large multicenter series show low serious adverse event rates with G-POEM and predominantly mild events, consistent with an acceptable safety profile in expert centers, while sham-controlled data also catalog procedure-related adverse events that generally resolve with conservative or endoscopic management, reinforcing the need for experienced teams and guideline-concordant peri-procedural protocols [^117YQTvo] [^112mHm6w] [^114SRoNz].

> Let me reconsider and integrate the mechanism succinctly: G-POEM alleviates gastroparesis by endoscopically transecting the pathologically hypertonic or discoordinated pyloric sphincter via submucosal tunneling pyloromyotomy, thereby reducing pyloric outflow resistance, accelerating gastric emptying, and translating these physiologic gains into validated symptom improvements in appropriately selected, refractory patients under expert care, which is consistent with the central role of pyloric dysfunction identified in a substantial subset of gastroparesis cases [^116PgYhQ] [^111J5kDJ] [^112Q3ovb] [^115WT8iR].

GPOEM treats gastroparesis by performing an endoscopic pyloromyotomy that **reduces pyloric resistance** [^111J5kDJ] and **improves gastric emptying** [^116PgYhQ], leading to symptom relief in refractory cases [^112sFDyg]. Clinical success ranges from **56–70% at 12 months** [^115WT8iR], with sustained benefit in many patients [^116U2r84] [^1148ofUB] and a low serious adverse event rate (~0.4%) [^117YQTvo]. GPOEM is recommended for **carefully selected patients** with objective delayed gastric emptying [^116pdZ6Y] who have failed medical therapy [^112sFDyg], and should be performed in expert centers [^112YM1u8] [^114H2ZRq] [^114SRoNz].

---

## Mechanism of action

Mechanistically, **pyloric dysfunction** involves pyloric spasm or impaired relaxation that contributes to delayed gastric emptying [^111J5kDJ] [^116PgYhQ]. The **myotomy effect** of GPOEM reduces pyloric resistance via targeted pyloromyotomy [^111J5kDJ] and improves gastric emptying [^116PgYhQ].

---

## Procedural steps

The GPOEM procedure involves the following **key steps**:

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Submucosal injection | Inject saline with dye [^111J5kDJ] to lift mucosa and create a submucosal cushion [^116sgVqQ] |
| Mucosal incision | Make a small mucosal incision [^111J5kDJ] to access the submucosal space [^115EzThf] |
| Submucosal tunneling | Create a tunnel [^113iEpqj] to the pyloric sphincter [^111J5kDJ] |
| Myotomy | Selectively divide the pyloric muscle [^111J5kDJ] to reduce resistance [^114V1yCH] |
| Closure | Close the mucosal entry [^116sgVqQ] with clips or sutures [^111J5kDJ] |

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Symptom improvement**: GPOEM improves symptoms and gastric emptying in refractory gastroparesis [^115WT8iR] [^111J5kDJ].

- **Short-term success**: Clinical success at 12 months is 56% (95% CI, 44.8–66.7) [^115WT8iR].

- **Long-term durability**: Sustained benefit is reported in 65–70% at 1–3 years [^116U2r84] [^1148ofUB].

- **Etiology differences**: Success rates vary by etiology: diabetic 65%, postsurgical 70%, idiopathic 60% [^112oK9jr].

---

## Safety profile

Serious adverse events occur at a **low rate (~0.4%)** and include rare delayed bleeding or mucosal injury [^117YQTvo]. Common minor events — such as capnoperitoneum, mucosotomy, and mild abdominal pain — are usually managed **conservatively** [^117YQTvo] [^113jH6Rn].

---

## Patient selection criteria

- **Refractory symptoms**: Persistent symptoms despite medical therapy [^114SRoNz] [^112sFDyg].

- **Objective delay**: Documented delayed gastric emptying on validated testing [^116pdZ6Y] [^112sFDyg].

- **No obstruction**: Absence of mechanical obstruction [^116oMwD2] [^112sFDyg].

- **Expert centers**: Procedure should be performed in specialized centers [^114SRoNz] [^114H2ZRq].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

| **Attribute** | **GPOEM** | **Botulinum toxin injection** | **Gastric electrical stimulation** | **Laparoscopic pyloroplasty** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Clinical efficacy | 56–70% [^115WT8iR] [^1148ofUB] | 40–60% [^115zbVB7] [^117H2cCc] | 45–74% [^114z2mfP] | 70–76% |
| Safety profile | Low serious AEs (~0.4%) [^117YQTvo] | Low [^115zbVB7] | Moderate [^114z2mfP] | Moderate [^114zw351] |
| Invasiveness | Minimally invasive | Minimally invasive | Invasive | Invasive |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Patient selection**: Identifying optimal candidates remains challenging [^112sFDyg] [^1148ofUB].

- **Long-term data**: More data are needed to confirm durability beyond 3 years [^111J5kDJ] [^115iwWB4].

- **Technical expertise**: Requires specialized training and experience [^114H2ZRq] [^111TqtKC].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

ACG 2022 recommends considering GPOEM for **refractory gastroparesis with severe delay**, using a team approach in expert centers [^112YM1u8] [^114SRoNz]. ESGE 2020 advises performing GPOEM only in **carefully selected patients** at expert centers, preferably within clinical trials [^114H2ZRq].

---

GPOEM is a minimally invasive pyloromyotomy that **improves gastric emptying** and relieves symptoms in refractory gastroparesis, with moderate durability and a low serious adverse event rate. It is best suited for carefully selected patients with objective delay who have failed medical therapy, and should be performed in expert centers [^115WT8iR] [^117YQTvo].

### Gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) for refractory gastroparesis: results from an international prospective trial [^115WT8iR]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Although gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) is considered a promising technique for the management of refractory gastroparesis, high-quality evidence is limited. We prospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of G-POEM in unselected patients with refractory gastroparesis.

In five tertiary centers, patients with symptomatic gastroparesis refractory to standard medical therapy and confirmed by impaired gastric emptying were included. The primary endpoint was clinical success, defined as at least one score decrease in the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) with ≥ 25% decrease in two subscales, at 12 months. GCSI score and subscales, adverse events (AEs), and the 36-Item Short Form questionnaire of quality of life were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after G-POEM. A gastric emptying study was performed before and 3 months after the procedure.

Of the 80 enrolled patients, 75 patients (94%) completed the 12-month follow-up. Clinical success at 12 months was 56% (95% CI, 44.8 to 66.7%). The GCSI score, including subscales, improved moderately after G-POEM (p < 0.05). Gastric retention > 20% at 4 hours (OR = 3.65, p = 0.03) and baseline GCSI > 2.6 (OR = 3.23, p = 0.04) were independent predictors of clinical success at 12 months, as was early response to G-POEM at 1 month after therapy (OR = 8.75, p < 0.001). Mild procedure-related AEs occurred in 5 (6%) patients.

G-POEM is a safe procedure but showed only modest overall effectiveness in treating refractory gastroparesis. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Evaluation of the safety profile of endoscopic pyloromyotomy by G-POEM: A French multicenter study [^117YQTvo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Gastric per oral endoscopic esophageal myotomy (G-POEM) is a promising procedure to treat refractory gastroparesis. The safety profile of G-POEM is an important topic because gastroparesis is a functional pathology, with a procedure whose effectiveness is between 50 and 65% depending on the studies.

- **Objectives**: We present this retrospective multicenter study, with the aim of establishing a safety profile, focusing on serious adverse events (AEs).

- **Design**: This was a multicenter observational cohort study conducted in five French expert centers.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent G-POEM for refractory gastroparesis between 2015 and 2021 were included for analysis. AEs were classified into per endoscopic, early postoperative, and late postoperative, up to one month. Their severity was assessed using Dindo-Clavien and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy classification. The primary objective was to evaluate the rate of G-POEM severe AEs. Secondary objectives were to document other postoperative AEs, and to identify predictive factors.

- **Results**: In all, 217 patients were included: 81 men and 136 women, with a mean age of 52 ± 17 years. The average procedural time was 44 ± 14 minutes (range: 12–78 minutes). The average hospital stay was 3.7 ± 2.3 days. The AEs rate classified as Clavien-Dindo ⩾3 was 0.4%, including one delayed bleeding requiring blood transfusion and endoscopic management. There were no deaths or patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The rates of mucosotomy and capnoperitoneum were 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively, without clinical consequences. Most patients (81.5%) did not experience adverse events.

### Targeting the pylorus in gastroparesis: From physiology to endoscopic pyloromyotomy [^111J5kDJ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Several open‐label studies reported clinical improvement after gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G‐POEM) in refractory gastroparesis. The first retrospective trials indicated short‐term improvements ranging from 80% to 85% three months after the procedure. Symptomatic improvement following G‐POEM has been observed in patients with diabetic, idiopathic, and post‐surgical gastroparesis. The efficacy of this procedure has also been confirmed in patients previously treated by toxin injection or gastric electrical stimulation.

The definition of success has varied across studies, potentially explaining discrepancies in reported success rates. To define clinical success, studies utilized either self‐reported improvement or the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score, which ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (worst symptom severity). The GCSI score is validated for assessing symptom evolution in gastroparesis. In later studies, clinical success was defined as an improvement of at least 1 point in the average GCSI score, with a decrease of at least 25% in two of its three subscales.

Using self‐reported improvement or GCSI scores, studies reported short‐term clinical efficacy in 70% to 80% of patients after three to six months. Long‐term efficacy beyond 12 months ranged from 53% to 70% of patients in retrospective studies and 33% to 56% in prospective trials, based on GCSI variation. A recent meta‐analysis involving 10 studies and 482 patients calculated a pooled success rate of 61% at one year.

### One-year results of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy for refractory gastroparesis: A French multicenter study [^116U2r84]. Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Data on the long-term outcomes of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) for refractory gastroparesis are lacking. We report the results of a large multicenter long-term follow-up study of G-POEM for refractory gastroparesis.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective multicenter study of all G-POEM operations performed in seven expert French centers for refractory gastroparesis with at least 1 year of follow-up. The primary endpoint was the 1-year clinical success rate, defined as at least a 1-point improvement in the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI).

- **Results**: Seventy-six patients were included (60.5% women; age 56 years). The median symptom duration was 48 months. The median gastric retention at 4 hours (H4) before G-POEM was 45% (interquartile range [IQR] 29%-67%). The median GCSI before G-POEM was 3.6 (IQR 2.8–4.0). Clinical success was achieved in 65.8% of the patients at 1 year, with a median rate of reduction in the GCSI score of 41%. In logistic regression analysis, only a high preoperative GCSI satiety subscale score was predictive of clinical success (odds ratio [OR] 3.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–11.54; P = 0.048), while a high rate of gastric retention at H4 was significantly associated with clinical failure (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–1.00; P = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: The results confirm the efficacy of G-POEM for the treatment of refractory gastroparesis, as evidenced by a 65.8% clinical success rate at 1 year. Although G-POEM is promising, prospective sham-controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm its efficacy and identify the patient population likely to benefit most.

### Targeting the pylorus in gastroparesis: From physiology to endoscopic pyloromyotomy [^116PgYhQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

**Key points**: Pyloric contractions and relaxations play a key role in the regulation of gastric emptying. Pyloric function has been shown to be altered in patients with gastroparesis, explored by manometric studies or by the new EndoFLIP tool. Per-oral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) has shown mid-term clinical efficacy in 60 to 80% of patients with refractory gastroparesis. G-POEM also leads to an acceleration of gastric emptying with an acceptable safety profile. Further studies to confirm the place of this treatment are needed.

### Efficacy and safety of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy across different etiologies of gastroparesis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112oK9jr]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) is an emerging treatment for refractory gastroparesis. Although its efficacy and safety have been analyzed in previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, no studies have compared its effectiveness based on etiology. Our study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of G-POEM by etiologies of gastroparesis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search in major databases until October 2023, focusing on the efficacy and safety of G-POEM by etiology. Our primary outcome was clinical success based on etiology, with an additional subgroup analysis on Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) scores before and after G-POEM based on etiology using standard meta-analysis methods and the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics.

- **Results**: In our analysis of 15 studies (7 retrospective, 8 prospective) involving 982 patients (mean patient age, 50.81 years; mean follow-up, 21 months), postsurgical conditions were the most common etiology in G-POEM (290 cases), followed by idiopathic factors (287 cases) and diabetes (286 cases). Subgroup analysis revealed pooled clinical success rates of 65% (95% confidence interval, 51–77; I² = 46%) for diabetes, 70% (95% CI, 46–86; I² = 73%) for postsurgical conditions, and 60% (95% CI, 41–77; I² = 68%) for idiopathic etiologies. Our research also indicated that G-POEM significantly improved GCSI scores: 1.7 (95% CI, -.01 to 3.5; p = 0.052) for diabetes, 1.34 (95% CI, -.07 to 2.62; p = 0.038) for postsurgical conditions, and 1.5 (95% CI, .36–2.75).

### Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) in patients with refractory gastroparesis: A review [^114z2mfP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

- **G-POEM versus pacemaker**: Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is a treatment option for medically refractory gastroparesis. One-year clinical response rates vary from 45% to 74%, with only 25% of the initial patient group maintaining that response at the 3-year follow-up. The mechanism of GES is thought to be mediated by the enteric nervous system, autonomic nervous system, or via a direct central nervous system effect. One proposed mechanism is that stimulation of the nausea and vomiting center of the brain leads to symptomatic improvement.

GES is invasive and involves risks such as implantation site pain, infection, dislodgement, and skin erosion. Other adverse effects include destruction of stomach innervation, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and fibrosis of the muscular layer of the pylorus. These effects could diminish clinical response in patients that undergo GES. There is an associated removal rate of 6.3%–12.8%. Device-related adverse events occurred in 13% of patients that underwent GES.

When compared to GES, G-POEM is less invasive with higher one-year clinical response rates of 57%–85%. G-POEM has shown to be effective for patients with medically refractory gastroparesis who have failed GES. In a propensity score-matched study published in February 2020 with a median follow-up of 27.7 months, G-POEM showed a 60% lower risk of clinical recurrence than GES. In this study, clinical recurrence of gastroparesis was defined as symptoms that were refractory to medical management, required one hospitalization related to gastroparesis, and a persistent Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score of 3 or greater for at least six months.

### Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy versus botulinum toxin injection for the treatment of refractory gastroparesis: results of a double-blind randomized controlled study [^115zbVB7]. Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) is a promising technique for treating refractory gastroparesis. We present the first double-blind randomized study comparing the clinical efficacy of G-POEM versus pyloric botulinum toxin injection (BTI).

- **Methods**: This randomized study, conducted in two expert centers, enrolled patients with refractory gastroparesis who were medically managed for more than six months and confirmed by gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES). Patients were divided into two groups, G-POEM versus BTI, with a follow-up period of one year. The primary endpoint was the three-month clinical efficacy, defined as a greater than one-point decrease in the mean Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score. Secondary endpoints included one-year efficacy, GES evolution, adverse events, and quality of life.

- **Results**: A total of 40 patients (22 women; mean age 48.1 [SD 17.4]) with a mean symptom duration of 5.8 (SD 5.7) years were randomized. The etiologies included idiopathic (n = 18), diabetes (n = 11), postoperative (n = 6), and mixed (n = 4). G-POEM showed a higher three-month clinical success rate compared to BTI (65% vs. 40%, respectively; P = 0.10), along with a non-significantly higher one-year clinical success rate (60% vs. 40%, respectively) based on intention-to-treat analysis. The GCSI decreased in both groups at three months and one year. Only three minor adverse events occurred in the G-POEM group. The GES improvement rate was 72% in the G-POEM group versus 50% in the BTI group, though this was not statistically significant.

- **Conclusion**: G-POEM appears to have a higher clinically relevant success rate than BTI, but this was not statistically demonstrated. This study confirms the interest in treating refractory gastroparesis with G-POEM, warranting further investigation.

### Laparoscopic pyloroplasty versus endoscopic per-oral pyloromyotomy for the treatment of gastroparesis [^115sUXRj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a debilitating functional disorder of the stomach characterized by delayed gastric emptying absent an obstructive etiology. Surgical or endoscopic disruption of the pylorus has been utilized to treat this disease, but there is little evidence comparing laparoscopic pyloroplasty (LP) with endoscopic per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP). Herein, we describe our experience at our institution using a propensity-matched cohort study to compare outcomes between these procedures.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent LP for the treatment of gastroparesis from October 2014 through September 2017 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Propensity scoring was used to match these patients 1:1 to patients undergoing POP during this time period based on gender, age, and etiology of gastroparesis. Symptom scores using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI), scintigraphic gastric emptying studies (GES), and perioperative outcomes were compared between matched cohorts. Thirty patients underwent LP for gastroparesis during the study period and were matched 1:1 with patients undergoing POP. The etiology of gastroparesis was 63.3% idiopathic (n = 19), 20.0% post-surgical (n = 6), and 16.7% diabetic (n = 5) in both cohorts.

- **Results**: Patients who underwent LP had a longer average length of stay (4.6 vs. 1.4 days, p = 0.003), operative time (99.3 vs. 33.9 min, p < 0.001), and estimated blood loss (12.9 vs. 0.4 mL, p < 0.001). There were more complications in the LP cohort (16.7 vs. 3.3%, p = 0.086), which included surgical site infection (6.7 vs. 0%, p = 0.153).

### Gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy for refractory gastroparesis: A detailed description of the procedure, our experience, and review of the literature [^113iEpqj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) was introduced four years ago as an investigational procedure for refractory gastroparesis. The safety and efficacy were currently evaluated. With our recent studies on G-POEM, we share our experience and knowledge through the discussion of a detailed description of the procedure and review of the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first systemic review on this new therapeutic endoscopic procedure.

- **Methods**: The indications and contraindications, various aspects of the procedure, and efficacy assessment are discussed based on our experience and available data.

- **Results**: Preoperative preparation, detailed description of the procedure, post-procedural care, and results in the literature are presented. The procedure is safe and effective. Seventy to eighty percent of patients have significant improvement in overall symptoms and quality of life in short-term (6 months) follow-up, as assessed by Gastric Cardinal Symptom Index and Short Form 36.

- **Conclusions**: G-POEM is a feasible and effective procedure for refractory gastroparesis based on early and limited data. Well-designed prospective studies are expected to advance and evaluate this new procedure in the future.

### Gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy versus pyloric injection of botulinum toxin for the treatment of gastroparesis: our institutional experience and a systematic review of the literature [^117H2cCc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (GPOEM) has been developed as an effective treatment option for patients with medically refractory gastroparesis. Other endoscopic options, such as pyloric injection of botulinum toxin (Botox), are often performed with limited efficacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate GPOEM for the treatment of gastroparesis and compare its efficacy to Botox injection results reported in the literature.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted to identify all patients who underwent GPOEM for the treatment of gastroparesis between September 2018 and June 2022. Changes in gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES) studies and gastroparesis cardinal symptom (GCSI) scores from the preoperative to postoperative period were analyzed. In addition, a systematic review was conducted to identify all publications reporting the outcomes of Botox injections for the treatment of gastroparesis.

- **Results**: A total of 65 patients (51 female, 14 male) underwent GPOEM during the study period. Twenty-eight patients (22 female, 6 male) had both preoperative and postoperative GES studies in addition to GCSI scores. The etiologies of gastroparesis were diabetic (n = 4), idiopathic (n = 18), and postsurgical (n = 6). Fifty percent of these patients had undergone previous failed interventions including Botox injections (n = 6), gastric stimulator placement (n = 2), and endoscopic pyloric dilation (n = 6). Outcomes showed a significant decrease in GES percentages (mean difference = -23.5%, p < 0.001) and GCSI scores (mean difference = -9.6, p = 0.02) postoperatively.

### Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) in patients with refractory gastroparesis: a review [^116sgVqQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

G-POEM was derived from peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), a procedure targeting the lower esophageal sphincter to treat achalasia. These procedures utilize submucosal tunneling to dissect specific muscles, with G-POEM specifically targeting the pylorus in gastroparesis. The process of G-POEM involves several steps: submucosal injection, mucosal incision, submucosal tunnel creation, myotomy, and closure of the mucosal entry site using clips or endoscopic suturing.

G-POEM was first performed on a human patient in 2013, demonstrating no adverse effects and a significant reduction in symptoms at the 12-week follow-up. Since then, numerous studies have focused primarily on the short-term outcomes of POEMs in both single-center and multicenter studies. This review aims to examine evidence on the clinical outcomes of G-POEM in both the short and long term. It also compares G-POEM with alternative techniques, such as gastric electrical stimulation and laparoscopic pyloromyotomy. Lastly, the review explores the role of G-POEM in biopsy procedures to evaluate the function of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC).

### Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy for the treatment of refractory gastroparesis: a prospective single-center experience with mid-term follow-up (with video) [^113jH6Rn]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Gastroparesis (GP) is a multifactorial disease associated with a significant burden on healthcare systems. Pyloric-directed therapies, including gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM), can effectively improve patient quality of life and symptom severity. We report on the safety and efficacy of G-POEM and its impact on the quality of life of patients managed at a large referral center.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with confirmed GP referred for G-POEM due to the failure of medical therapy were included. All patients were assessed at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after G-POEM using validated symptom and quality of life instruments, including the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI), Patient Assessment of Gastrointestinal Disorders Symptom Severity Index (PAGI-SYM), and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Patients were evaluated before and 6 months after the procedure with EGD, 4-hour scintigraphy, and pyloric EndoFLIP. Technical success was defined as the ability to perform full-thickness pyloromyotomy. Clinical response was defined as an improvement of ≥ 1 point on GCSI.

- **Results**: Fifty-two patients (median age, 48 years; range, 25–80 years; 88% female) underwent G-POEM between February 2018 and September 2020 for the following phenotypes: vomiting-predominant (n = 30), dyspepsia-predominant (n = 16), and regurgitation-predominant (n = 6) GP. The technical success rate was 100%. Adverse events were noted in 3 of 52 patients (5.77%) and were all managed successfully endoscopically. Clinical response was achieved in 68%, 58%, and…

### Pyloric drainage interventions for gastroparesis: a comparison of laparoscopic pyloroplasty and gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) outcomes [^114zw351]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Pyloroplasty has been part of surgical practice since the late nineteenth century when it was introduced for the management of pyloric obstruction and peptic ulcer disease. The application of pyloric drainage surgery in gastroparesis emerged in the late twentieth century as improved gastric emptying and symptom relief were observed in patients with pyloric dysfunction. With the advent of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic pyloroplasty became a preferred surgical option for medically refractory gastroparesis. More recently, G-POEM was developed as an endoscopic alternative, based on the success of the esophageal per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in treating achalasia. G-POEM allows for targeted pyloric muscle disruption to enhance gastric emptying with reduced invasiveness, making it an appealing option for patients with gastroparesis.

Both procedures are increasingly utilized for refractory gastroparesis, though direct comparative data remain limited, primarily consisting of small single-arm observational studies with short follow-up. To our knowledge, there are only two prior studies directly comparing pyloroplasty and G-POEM outcomes. In the present study, we evaluated 314 patients with medically refractory gastroparesis who underwent either laparoscopic pyloroplasty or G-POEM and found both procedures to be safe and effective. There were no substantial differences in length of hospital stay, readmissions, or complications, suggesting a comparable safety profile. In addition, there were no differences in symptomatic outcomes in terms of resolution.

### Endoscopic treatment modalities for the management of gastroparesis: A critical review [^115iwWB4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

To our knowledge, there are two randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM). Martinek et al. reported the first randomized trial comparing G-POEM (n = 21) with a sham procedure (n = 19) for the treatment of refractory gastroparesis. After 6 months, clinical success was significantly higher for patients in the G-POEM group compared to the sham group (71% vs. 22%). Moreover, crossover G-POEM was performed in 12 patients from the sham group, with clinical success observed in 9 (75%) after 6 months.

In the second randomized trial, Gonzalez et al. found a higher, though not statistically significant, clinical efficacy of G-POEM compared to botulinum toxin injection at both 3 months and 1 year. In terms of gastric emptying (GE), recent meta-analyses have reported a 22–26% reduction in 4-hour gastric retention rate following G-POEM, with significant heterogeneity across studies. Another meta-analysis involving 8 studies reported an 84% rate for GE improvement (95% confidence interval [CI] 77–90%; I² = 0%; P = 0.46) and a 53% rate for GE normalization (95% CI 39–66%; I² = 46%; P = 0.10).

### Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy in refractory gastroparesis: Long-term outcomes and predictive score to improve patient selection [^1148ofUB]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

Limited data exist concerning the long-term efficacy of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) as a treatment for refractory gastroparesis. This study evaluated the 3-year results of G-POEM in patients with refractory gastroparesis.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective multicenter study of all G-POEM operations performed in two expert French centers involving 46 patients with refractory gastroparesis, with at least 3 years of follow-up.

- **Results**: Clinical success was 65.2% at 36 months with significant improvement in symptom severity. The median Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index decreased from 3.33 to 1.80 (P < 0.05). A predictive score was developed, which included the following:

	- **Gastric retention subscale > 4**: predictive of success, 1 point.
	- Bloating subscale > 3.5: predictive of success, 1 point.
	- **Percentage of gastric retention at 4 hours on scintigraphy > 50%**: 1 point.

	A threshold of 2 was identified by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with an area under the curve of 0.825. This predicted clinical success with a sensitivity of 93.3% (95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.99), specificity of 56.3% (95% CI, 0.33–0.77), positive predictive value of 80% (95% CI, 0.67–0.93), negative predictive value of 81.8% (95% CI, 0.59–1.00), and accuracy of 80.4% (95% CI, 0.69–0.92). Patients with a score ≥ 2 were significantly more likely to be responders at 3 years compared to patients with a score < 2 (80% and 18%, respectively; P < 0.05).

### A new international scheme for the classification and management of clinical outcomes post-gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy [^116SPKKh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

The study aims to address the inconsistent clinical outcomes associated with gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM), which is an emerging treatment for gastroparesis. Enhancing management strategies for patients experiencing clinical failure is vital.

This was a multicenter retrospective review of patients who underwent G-POEM for refractory gastroparesis from September 2015 to November 2023. Clinical outcomes and management post-G-POEM were assessed and categorized into four types based on symptom improvement and gastric emptying metrics.

Of the 482 patients, 221 (46%) underwent evaluations with pre- and post-G-POEM gastric emptying tests and were included in the study. Type 1 clinical response (clinical success with improved gastric emptying scintigraphy [GES]) was the most common outcome, occurring in 56%. This was followed by type 4 (clinical failure with no GES improvement) at 23%, type 2 (clinical failure with improved GES) at 15%, and type 3 (clinical success with no GES improvement) at 6.7%. Patients with primary clinical failure (types 2 and 4) showed significantly higher daily opioid use at 23%, compared with 7% in types 1 and 3 (P = 0.032).

Clinical failure overall was observed in 60% of the patients during a median follow-up of 48 months, with 31% managed by pylorus-directed retreatment and 7% with gastric neurostimulator placement. In the type 1 response group, clinical success was re-established in 71% following pylorus-directed therapies, with repeat G-POEM being an independent predictor of clinical success post-re-treatment (odds ratio, 2.2; p = 0.02).

**Gastric emptying before and after pyloric drainage**: Gastric emptying findings are compared between pyloroplasty and G-POEM groups. Prior to surgery, the median percent retention of gastric contents 4 hours after ingestion was 28.5% (range: 17–46), with 22.1% of patients exhibiting severely delayed emptying (> 50% 4-hour retention). There was no difference in 4-hour retention (p = 0.307) or severely delayed gastric emptying (p = 1.000) between patients who underwent pyloroplasty or G-POEM. A total of 96 patients (71 pyloroplasty; 25 G-POEM) completed pre- and postoperative gastric emptying studies (GES). After pyloroplasty, 4-hour retention decreased from 29.0% (range: 18–43) to 4.2% (range: 1.0–18). This result indicates a statistically significant improvement in gastric emptying post-intervention.

### Medical and surgical management of gastroparesis: A systematic review [^113jXfb5]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis (GPS) is a rare disease with multiple etiologies that results in delayed gastric emptying. Diagnosis of GPS can be challenging due to its complex clinical presentation. Pharmacologic refractory cases require surgical interventions, all of which have yet to be standardized and characterized.

- **Objectives**: We present a review of the literature and provide an update of therapies for patients with GPS.

- **Setting**: Department of General Surgery, Academic Hospital, United States.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase of English-written articles published in the last 38 years, with an advanced title search of "gastroparesis management". Other keywords included "surgical management" and "refractory gastroparesis". Further references were obtained through cross-reference.

- **Results**: A total of 12,250 articles were selected after eliminating duplicates. Following a thorough screening of selection criteria, 68 full-text articles were included for review.

- **Conclusion**: GPS is a challenging disease to manage. Nutritional support must remain the primary approach, followed by either medical or surgical treatment modalities if necessary. In patients with refractory gastroparesis, adjunctive therapies have been proposed as promising long-term options.

The improvement of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms

Eighty patients (80/115, 69.6%) experienced symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux before undergoing G-POEM, with a GERDQ score of 10.44 ± 1.76. The GERDQ score in these patients, categorized by different anastomotic sites, was analyzed before and after G-POEM. Before the procedure, the GERDQ score was significantly higher in patients with a low anastomotic site (distance between the anastomotic site and the incisors > 40 cm) (p 0.001, respectively). Data are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

The GERDQ score was assessed before and after the G-POEM procedure. Notably, the GERDQ score was higher in patients with the low anastomotic site prior to G-POEM. A significant decrease in the GERDQ score was observed at 1 month post-G-POEM. Compared to the 1-month post-procedure score, a further significant decrease was noted at 6 months post-G-POEM. For each anastomotic site, no significant difference in the GERDQ score was found in the subsequent follow-up.

### Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) in patients with refractory gastroparesis: a review [^117FbfPR]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is defined as delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. The pathogenesis of gastroparesis is unknown and can include impaired gastric accommodation, autonomic neuropathy, uncoordinated gastric contractility, pyloric dysfunction, degeneration of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and neurohormonal disruption. Gastroparesis presents with vague symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, early satiety, post-prandial bloating, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, weight loss and malnutrition can occur. The most common etiologies for gastroparesis result from diabetes, surgery, or infection, though it can also be idiopathic.

Patients presenting with symptoms consistent with gastroparesis should undergo endoscopy to rule out obstruction and a 4-hour gastric emptying study to confirm the diagnosis. Medications and dietary modifications are the first-line treatment for gastroparesis, but approximately 30% of patients do not experience relief with conservative methods. Refractory gastroparesis can be defined as gastroparesis with poor response to more than six months of dietary modifications and trials of maximally tolerated doses of prokinetic medications. These medications are not usually used long-term due to unfavorable side effects, particularly tardive dyskinesia. With gastroparesis becoming more common and the limited effectiveness of conservative therapy, alternative treatment methods for gastroparesis are increasingly needed.

- **Alternative treatment methods**: Include the use of gastric electric stimulator, surgical pyloroplasty, botulinum toxin injection, and transpyloric stenting.

### Gastroparesis: A review of current diagnosis and treatment options [^114agJGR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis (GP) is a chronic neuromuscular disorder of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of GP is not well described; however, the number of individuals affected by symptoms of GP in the United States is estimated to be over 4 million. The etiology of GP is diverse. Approximately 25% of cases are associated with diabetes, whereas nearly 50% are classified as idiopathic; many of these latter cases likely represent a postinfectious process. Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, prior gastric surgery, ischemia, and medications make up the vast majority of the remaining cases.

The pathophysiology of GP is also diverse. Abnormalities in fundic tone, antroduodenal dyscoordination, a weak antral pump, gastric dysrhythmias, and abnormal duodenal feedback all contribute to delays in gastric emptying and symptom expression. Characteristic symptoms of GP include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, early satiety, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of GP is made using a combination of characteristic symptoms in conjunction with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment options include dietary modification, medications to accelerate gastric emptying, antiemetic agents, gastric electrical stimulation, and surgery.

In the following sections, we will provide an overview of the healthcare impact of GP, describe the underlying pathophysiology, and review treatment options using an evidence-based approach.

### A long-term follow-up study of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) in a large cohort of patients with postsurgical gastroparesis [^115i8PKu]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

The improvement of symptoms based on GCSI was evaluated to assess the clinical effectiveness of G-POEM. The GCSI score was analyzed before and after the procedure. Patients were categorized into clinical responders and non-responders.

At 1 month post-G-POEM, three patients were lost to follow-up. Among those who were followed up, 100 patients (89.3%, 100/112) were clinical responders, with the GCSI score decreasing from 2.78 ± 0.53 to 0.82 ± 0.78. Of the 12 non-responders (10.7%, 12/112), 9 patients (75%, 9/12) had accompanying GERD.

At 6 months post-G-POEM, 10 patients were lost to follow-up, and 4 had insufficient follow-up time. Eighty-nine patients (88.1%, 89/101) were clinical responders, with a GCSI score of 0.85 ± 0.74. Among the 12 non-responders (11.9%, 12/101), 5 patients (41.7%, 5/12) had GERD.

One year after G-POEM, 27 patients were lost to follow-up, while 7 were followed up for insufficient time. Seventy-six patients (93.8%, 76/81) were clinical responders, with a GCSI score of 0.72 ± 0.65. Of the 5 non-responders (6.2%, 5/81), 3 patients (60%, 3/5) had GERD.

Two years following G-POEM, 30 patients were lost to follow-up and 9 had insufficient follow-up. Seventy-two patients (94.7%, 72/76) were clinical responders, with a GCSI score of 0.73 ± 0.61. Among the 4 non-responders (5.3%, 4/76), 3 patients (75%, 3/4) had GERD. Our study followed a large number of patients up to 5 years.

### Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) as a salvage therapy for refractory gastroparesis: A case series of different subtypes [^117WJj5s]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a poorly understood, chronic, debilitating motility disorder with very limited medical therapeutic options. Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) is an emerging novel endoscopic technique that acts as an incisionless pyloroplasty for refractory cases. Effective information on the impact of G-POEM on different types of gastroparesis is sparse.

- **Methods**: Cases of G-POEM using selective circular myotomy as a salvage therapy for refractory symptoms were retrospectively studied. The G-POEM procedures were performed by a single expert endoscopist under a specific protocol. The Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptoms Index (GCSI) and gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES) were evaluated before and after the procedure. Procedure-related adverse events were also recorded.

- **Key results**: All procedures were successfully completed without complications. Each case in this series differed in the demography and etiology of gastroparesis, namely postsurgical, postinfectious, and idiopathic gastroparesis in an elderly male and two young female adults. All cases were refractory to conventional treatment but demonstrated obvious success after G-POEM as a salvage therapy, both clinically and on GES.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: G-POEM as a salvage therapy improves symptoms and gastric emptying in patients with different types of refractory gastroparesis. Our cases are also the first to show the success of G-POEM in postinfectious gastroparesis and in an elderly male patient. More data are needed to determine which subgroup of patients would benefit most from this novel procedure.

### Endoscopic findings do not predict per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) response [^115ZKMFB]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a life-altering diagnosis caused by the stomach's inability to function in the absence of a mechanical obstruction. The primary causes are idiopathic, diabetic, and postoperative. Our first-line treatment for medically refractory gastroparesis is the endoscopic per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) procedure. Predicting clinical response cost-effectively remains elusive.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent a POP procedure at our institution by a single surgical endoscopist from January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. All endoscopic data were prospectively collected. The patients were followed by a survey, including the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) and other relevant postoperative measures. The primary endpoint was clinical response, defined as a ≥ 1.0 decrease in the GCSI from preoperative to the time of the survey. The secondary outcome was the normalization of the gastric emptying study (GES).

- **Results**: Our patient population is 85% female and has an average age of 44.8 years. The diagnosis of gastroparesis is 71% idiopathic, 19% postoperative, and 10% diabetic. On endoscopy, 30% had bile in the stomach, and 65% had any degree of pylorospasm. The primary outcome measure of clinical response was 39% at an average of 697 ± 151 days post-POP, but 66% of patients attested to an improvement in their symptoms. Of 68 postoperative gastric emptying studies, 50% normalized at an average of 145 ± 98 days. Following univariate and multivariate analyses of preoperative data and endoscopic findings, there were no significant predictors of clinical response.

### Endoscopic treatment modalities for the management of gastroparesis: A critical review [^115nGuTF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a complex chronic disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction, presenting with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and epigastric pain. Diabetes mellitus is the most commonly identified systemic condition associated with gastroparesis, while other causes include postsurgical complications, medications, and neurologic disorders. In up to one-third of cases, no clear etiology is identified, a condition referred to as idiopathic gastroparesis. In terms of diagnosis, gastric-emptying (GE) scintigraphy remains the gold standard, with gastric retention rates of > 60% at 2 hours and > 10% at 4 hours being considered diagnostic.

Managing patients with gastroparesis poses a significant challenge in everyday clinical practice. Dietary advice and pharmacologic therapy, particularly prokinetic drugs such as metoclopramide and domperidone, are first-line treatment modalities. In patients with refractory gastroparesis, surgical interventions such as pyloroplasty, pyloromyotomy, subtotal gastrectomy, and gastric electrical stimulation (GES) implantation may be considered. These invasive procedures are associated with considerable morbidity and exhibit variable efficacy across different patients. Meanwhile, with the widespread use of gastrointestinal endoscopy, less invasive therapeutic modalities have emerged, such as endoscopic feeding tube placement, botulinum toxin injection, pyloric ring balloon dilatation, transpyloric stent placement, and gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM).

### Feasibility, safety, and long-term efficacy of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) for postsurgical gastroparesis: a single-center and retrospective study of a prospective database [^114a47vs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate the overall clinical effectiveness of G-POEM, the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) was analyzed before G-POEM and at 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month intervals post-G-POEM. At 6 months post-G-POEM, 77.2% of patients (61/79) achieved clinical responses, with a decrease in mean GCSI from 2.97 ± 0.6 at baseline to 1.12 ± 0.77. At 12 months, 78.3% of patients (47/60) achieved a clinical response with a mean GCSI of 1.04 ± 0.53. At 18 months, 74.5% (35/47) of patients achieved clinical responses with a mean GCSI of 1.22 ± 0.58. At 24 months, 81.8% (27/33) of patients achieved clinical responses with a mean GCSI of 0.88 ± 0.39. G-POEM significantly reduced GCSI throughout the follow-up period (p < 0.0001 at 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month, respectively).

For each anastomotic site, GCSI was evaluated before G-POEM and at 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month intervals post-G-POEM. Before G-POEM, no significant difference in GCSI was found between patients with different anastomotic sites. At 6 months post-G-POEM, a significant improvement in GCSI was found among the patients with different anastomotic sites (F 4,165 = 74.18, p < 0.0001). The GCSI score was calculated by averaging the mean score of three subscales: nausea/vomiting, post-prandial fullness/early satiety, and bloating. In the present study, nausea/vomiting contributed most to the pre-G-POEM GCSI.

Clinical failure occurred if there was no clinical response at initial follow-up or if gastroparesis symptoms recurred within 6 months. Clinical recurrence was identified when gastroparesis symptoms returned and the GCSI score reverted to baseline, or if the GCSI score was ≥ 3 for at least 2 months after an initial complete response.

The GCSI score was evaluated in patients with varying durations of disease before and after G-POEM (Fig. 1). For patients with a disease duration of ≤ 1 year or > 1 year, the GCSI score decreased significantly from 1 month after G-POEM. However, for patients with a disease duration of > 1 year, the GCSI score remained significantly higher at 1-month, 6-month, and 5-year post-G-POEM (p = 0.0376, p = 0.0095, p = 0.0361, respectively). In patients with a disease duration of ≤ 1 year, the GCSI score maintained a steady trend during follow-up (F 4, 208 = 0.06617, p = 0.9919). Conversely, patients with a disease duration of > 1 year showed a slightly fluctuating trend in their GCSI score during follow-up (F 4, 199 = 0.9488, p = 0.4369).

### Clinical guideline: Management of gastroparesis [^113fwWLa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacological interventions for gastroparesis, specifically concerning dietary therapy, ACG 2013 guidelines recommend postpyloric feeding over gastric feeding. This preference is due to gastric delivery being associated with erratic nutritional support.

### Clinical guideline: Management of gastroparesis [^115Sixjh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for evaluating and managing patients with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is identified in clinical practice through recognizing clinical symptoms and documenting delayed gastric emptying. Symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and upper abdominal pain.

Management of gastroparesis should involve assessing and correcting nutritional state, relieving symptoms, improving gastric emptying, and, in diabetics, ensuring glycemic control. The patient's nutritional state should be managed with oral dietary modifications. If oral intake is inadequate, enteral nutrition via a jejunostomy tube should be considered. Parenteral nutrition is rarely required, only when hydration and nutritional state cannot be maintained.

Medical treatment involves using prokinetic and antiemetic therapies. Approved treatment options, such as metoclopramide and gastric electrical stimulation (GES, approved on a humanitarian device exemption), do not adequately address clinical needs. While antiemetics have not been specifically tested in gastroparesis, they may relieve nausea and vomiting. Other medications aimed at symptom relief include unapproved medications or off-label indications, such as domperidone, erythromycin (primarily for short-term use), and centrally acting antidepressants used as symptom modulators.

GES may relieve symptoms, including weekly vomiting frequency and the need for nutritional supplementation, based on open-label studies. Second-line approaches include…

### Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) in patients with refractory gastroparesis: A review [^1128Up6k]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Nine out of 12 J-tube-dependent patients were able to tolerate oral feeds without requiring their J-tubes after G-POEM. Three out of five patients who relied on total parenteral nutrition were able to discontinue this therapy. Before G-POEM, 96% of patients were on metoclopramide, and approximately 55% were on other medications, including erythromycin, domperidone, and other antiemetics. Six months following G-POEM, 59 patients (66%) discontinued their regularly scheduled antiemetics.

The study found that a longer duration of gastroparesis, higher BMI, history of psychiatric medication use, and history of pain medication use increased the odds of G-POEM failure, similar to the results found in studies examining short-term effects. Four patients experienced adverse events: two being mild and two being moderate. There was no need for surgical intervention and no procedure-related mortality, indicating the relatively low-risk profile of G-POEM.

Out of all patients with an initial clinical response to G-POEM, 13% of patients lost that response per year over the 3-year follow-up. The recurrence of gastroparesis after G-POEM cannot be explained. Two patients who experienced recurrence of symptoms following G-POEM had increased resistance to scope passage through the pylorus upon repeat upper endoscopy. These patients underwent repeat G-POEM, which showed fibrosis at the myotomy site. Repeat myotomy resulted in the regaining of clinical response for these patients. One theory for the disease process of gastroparesis is an immune response leading to fibrosis of the gastrointestinal tract.

### Endoscopic treatment modalities for the management of gastroparesis: a critical review [^112hXFHz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

**Major studies assessing the predictive role of endoscopic functional luminal imaging probe (EndoFLIP) measurements in pyloric interventions**: EUS-GE represents a promising treatment for gastric outlet obstruction. Preliminary data suggest that this intervention may also be effective in patients with gastroparesis. However, it is important to note that the pathophysiology of symptoms differs between these conditions, so more studies, especially prospective ones, are required to assess the performance of EUS-GE in gastroparesis. Currently, this procedure should be performed solely in an experimental setting for this indication.

### Endoscopic pyloromyotomy for the treatment of severe and refractory gastroparesis: A pilot, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^112Q3ovb]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Gastroparesis (GP) is a gastric motility disorder defined by the presence of upper abdominal symptoms and delayed gastric emptying in the absence of organic obstruction. Two important aetiologies are diabetes mellitus and GP following oesophageal or gastric surgery (postsurgical GP). In up to half of the patients with GP, no underlying aetiology can be identified, and these patients are referred to as having idiopathic GP. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, GP may lead to weight loss, poor nutritional status, and increased mortality.

The pathophysiology of GP is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Delayed gastric emptying is a defining feature, and gastric hypomotility due to several underlying mechanisms is believed to play a major role as well. However, the symptomatic benefit of prokinetic agents is often disappointing. An inappropriately spastic pyloric muscle has also been suggested as another important pathophysiological factor.

Because of this complex pathophysiology, effective treatment for GP is a clinical challenge, especially in patients with severe and refractory disease. Treatment options consist of dietary measures, administration of prokinetics and antiemetics, compensation of underlying disease, nutritional support, and other methods such as gastric electrical stimulation, but none of these options is supported by strong scientific evidence. Pylorus-directed therapies (botulinum toxin injection, balloon dilation, surgical pyloroplasty) constitute another approach to managing this condition.

### Gastric electrical stimulation versus per-oral pyloromyotomy for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with gastroparesis: An observational study of two cohorts [^114eEZZ2]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Both gastric electrical stimulation (GES) and gastric-peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) can be offered to patients with gastroparesis and predominant nausea and vomiting. The study's aim was to compare GES and G-POEM efficacy on nausea and vomiting scores in patients with gastroparesis.

- **Methods**: Two multicenter cohorts of patients with medically refractory gastroparesis with predominant nausea and vomiting (defined as a score > 2 on a nausea and vomiting subscale that varied from 0 to 4) were treated with either GES (n = 34) or G-POEM (n = 30) and were followed for 24 months (M). Clinical response was defined as a decrease of ≥ 1 point in the nausea and vomiting subscale without premature exclusion due to a switch from one to the other technique before M24. Changes in symptomatic scales and quality of life were also monitored.

- **Key results**: Patients from both groups were comparable, although the mean score of the nausea and vomiting subscale was higher in the GES group (3.0) compared to the G-POEM group (2.6; p = 0.01). At M24, a clinical response was achieved in 21/34 (61.7%) patients with GES and in 21/30 (70.0%; p = 0.60) patients with G-POEM. Mean scores of nausea and vomiting subscale decreased at M24 in both GES (from 3.0 to 1.6; p < 0.001) and G-POEM (from 2.6 to 1.2; p < 0.001) groups, although there was no difference between groups (difference adjusted from baseline: -0.28 [-0.77; 0.19]; p = 0.24). Likewise, symptomatic and quality of life scores improved at M24 in both groups, without difference according to treatment group.

- **Conclusions and inferences**: At M24, we did not observe significant differences between the two treatments regarding the improvement in nausea, vomiting, symptomatic scales, and quality of life.

### Pyloric drainage interventions for gastroparesis: A comparison of laparoscopic pyloroplasty and gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) outcomes [^1142VK66]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The follow-up times were similar between pyloroplasty and G-POEM (p = 0.107).

- **Surgical outcomes**: No significant difference was observed in the average length of stay (p = 0.129). However, patients who underwent G-POEM were more likely to be discharged on postoperative day 1 (85.2% vs. 72.1%, p = 0.024). Readmission rates and complication rates were also similar. There was no difference in the resolution of predominant gastroparesis symptoms, even when stratified by gastroparesis etiology. Additionally, there was no difference in GCSI total scores or any symptom sub-scores.

The median percentage improvement in GCSI total score was 37% (5–66) for patients who underwent G-POEM and 36.5% (8–59) for those who underwent pyloroplasty (p = 0.976). There was no difference in the need for a gastric stimulator (p = 0.517) or gastrectomy (p = 1.000). There were no mortalities in either group.

### Endoscopic treatment modalities for the management of gastroparesis: A critical review [^114jvzhH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances in the understanding and treatment of gastroparesis, this disorder remains associated with considerable morbidity for patients. Moreover, it poses a significant problem for the healthcare system, given the frequent hospitalizations and the need for ongoing pharmacotherapy and prescription. Currently, numerous endoscopic procedures are available for patients who are unresponsive to pharmacological therapy, with G-POEM showing the most compelling data among them. However, heterogeneity in study characteristics, particularly in patient selection, has resulted in inconsistencies in reported outcomes and, along with the lack of randomized trials and the limited durability of some procedures (e.g. botulinum toxin injection, balloon dilatation), has hindered the widespread adoption of these techniques.

Moreover, technical aspects, such as the lack of standardization and the high level of expertise required specifically for G-POEM and EUS-GE, represent additional concerns that must be addressed to enable the broader implementation of these interventions. Future research should focus on better elucidating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for gastroparesis, allowing the application of targeted therapies tailored to the specific mechanisms in each patient. Finally, further comparative studies are essential to provide a clearer understanding of the efficacy and outcomes of different endoscopic interventions.

### Evaluation of the safety profile of endoscopic pyloromyotomy by G-POEM: a French multicenter study [^115SDNdX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Gastric per oral endoscopic esophageal myotomy (G-POEM) is a promising procedure to treat refractory gastroparesis. The safety profile of G-POEM is an important topic because gastroparesis is a functional pathology, with a procedure whose effectiveness is between 50% and 65%, depending on the studies.

- **Objectives**: We present this retrospective multicenter study, with the aim of establishing a safety profile, focusing on serious adverse events (AEs).

- **Design**: This was a multicenter observational cohort study conducted in five French expert centers.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent G-POEM for refractory gastroparesis between 2015 and 2021 were included for analysis. AEs were classified into per endoscopic, early postoperative, and late postoperative, up to 1 month. Their severity was assessed using Dindo–Clavien and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy classification. The primary objective was to evaluate the rate of G-POEM severe AEs. Secondary objectives were to document other postoperative AEs and to identify predictive factors.

- **Results**: In all, 217 patients were included: 81 men and 136 women, with a mean age of 52 ± 17 years. The average procedural time was 44 ± 14 minutes (ranging from 12 to 78 minutes). The average hospital stay was 3.7 ± 2.3 days. The AEs rate classified as Clavien–Dindo ⩾3 was 0.4% (one delayed bleeding requiring blood transfusion and endoscopic management). There were no deaths or patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The rates of mucosotomy and capnoperitoneum were 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively, without clinical consequences.

Most patients (81.5%) did not experience significant complications.

### Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy improves chronic diarrhea in patients with refractory gastroparesis [^116hNwLn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Impact of G-POEM on stool frequency and consistency**: Eight out of 10 (80%) patients experienced complete clinical remission of chronic diarrhea after gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM). Their median stool frequency decreased from 5 (IQR 4–5) to 2 (IQR 2–2.8) stools per day, and the median Bristol stool scale changed from 6 (IQR 6–6.8) to 4 (IQR 4–4) after the endoscopic treatment of gastroparesis. These changes were significant (P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively).

Two patients (20%) achieved partial remission, with normalized stool frequency but no change in the Bristol stool scale.

One patient who had chronic constipation, characterized by 1 bowel movement every 10 days and a Bristol stool scale of 2, saw normalization in stool frequency and consistency (1 stool per day; Bristol stool scale 4) after G-POEM.

Overall, 9 out of 11 patients (81.8%) experienced complete normalization of diarrhea or constipation following G-POEM for the treatment of gastroparesis. Two patients (20%) only achieved partial remission, with a normalized stool frequency but unchanged Bristol stool scales of 6 and 7. In one of these cases, the endoscopic treatment was unable to relieve gastroparesis, as both post-procedural gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) and gastric emptying scintigraphy remained pathological.

### Gastroparesis: Clinical update [^115mPTuv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis refers to chronically abnormal gastric motility characterized by symptoms suggestive of mechanical obstruction and delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It may be idiopathic or attributable to neuropathic or myopathic abnormalities, such as diabetes mellitus, postvagotomy, postviral infection, and scleroderma. Dietary and behavioral modification, prokinetic drugs, and surgical interventions have been used in managing patients with gastroparesis.

Although mild gastroparesis is usually well managed with these treatment options, severe gastroparesis may be very difficult to control and may require referral to a specialist center if symptoms are intractable despite pharmacological therapy and dietetic support. New advances in drug therapy, botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electrical stimulation techniques have been introduced and might provide new hope to patients with refractory gastroparesis. This article critically reviews the advances in the field from the perspective of the clinician.

### Targeting the pylorus in gastroparesis: From physiology to endoscopic pyloromyotomy [^115jMJjU]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is defined as delayed gastric emptying (GE) of solid food in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Cardinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, gastric fullness, early satiety, bloating, and abdominal pain/discomfort. These symptoms can overlap with those of functional dyspepsia, but gastroparesis has to be confirmed by an objective measurement of GE, either by scintigraphy or by a 13 C‐octanoic acid breath test. The prevalence of diagnosed gastroparesis has been evaluated in the United States at 0.24% of the population. Recent epidemiological data from the United Kingdom confirm a similar prevalence of 0.13% in Europe based on the diagnostic code, although the disease appears to be underdiagnosed. Gastroparesis leads to an economic burden, evaluated between US$4000 and US$9000 per patient per year in a recent study. Moreover, delayed GE has been associated with increased mortality, independently of age, sex, or the etiology of the disease.

The first-line treatment relies on dietary modification and medical treatment, with prokinetic drugs such as metoclopramide. However, the efficacy of medical treatment is limited, and up to 40% of patients are considered to be refractory after appropriate treatment. Severe refractory gastroparesis can lead to dehydration, weight loss, and impaired quality of life and could become a challenging condition. Thus, invasive techniques have been developed to improve the symptoms of such patients.

Considering the role of pyloric dysfunction in gastroparesis, gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G‐POEM) has emerged as a promising approach.

### A long-term follow-up study of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) in a large cohort of patients with postsurgical gastroparesis [^112F9T2k]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

The GCSI score of patients with varying disease durations was assessed before and after G-POEM. Notably, the GCSI score decreased significantly as early as one month following G-POEM. In patients with a disease duration greater than one year, the GCSI score was significantly higher at one-month, six-month, and five-year intervals post-G-POEM. Conversely, patients whose disease duration was one year or less exhibited a steady trend in GCSI scores during follow-up. For those with a disease duration exceeding one year, the GCSI score demonstrated a slightly fluctuating trend throughout the follow-up period.

The GCSI score was also examined among patients with different anastomotic sites before and after G-POEM. Initially, no significant differences in GCSI scores were observed between patients with various anastomotic sites before G-POEM (p = 0.118). However, for each anastomotic site, significant reductions in GCSI scores were noted after G-POEM (F 5,502 = 98.28, p < 0.0001). No significant differences were found among patients with different anastomotic sites during follow-up (F 4,392 = 0.5347, p = 0.7103).

The GCSI comprises three subscales: nausea/vomiting, postprandial fullness/early satiety, and bloating. Each subscale score decreased significantly after G-POEM, mirroring the trend observed in the total GCSI score (p < 0.0001 for each). The effects of G-POEM were more pronounced in reducing nausea/vomiting and postprandial fullness/early satiety compared to bloating (p < 0.0001).

### Endoscopic pyloromyotomy for the treatment of severe and refractory gastroparesis: A pilot, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^112mHm6w]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

- **Safety**: Ten serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred, seven after G-POEM (five in the G-POEM group, two after cross-over G-POEM) and three in the sham group. All three SAEs in the sham group were not related to the procedure but rather to gastroparesis itself or to a newly diagnosed achalasia.

Three SAEs were related to the G-POEM procedure, accounting for 9% of all G-POEMs performed. One patient developed abdominal pain one day after G-POEM and was diagnosed with a gastric ulcer near the pylorus. Conservative management was successful. Another patient had a mucosal injury during the G-POEM at the level of myotomy and was kept longer in the hospital as a precautionary measure. The third patient developed moderate dumping syndrome three months after the cross-over G-POEM, which required hospitalization, but resulted in a complete resolution.

### Proximal and distal gastric retention patterns in gastroparesis and the impact of gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy: A retrospective analysis using gastric emptying scintigraphy [^1127HB8S]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2020). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a debilitating disease characterized by insufficient gastric emptying and visceral hypersensitivity. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and bloating. Gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES), in combination with typical symptoms and normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings, is used to diagnose the disease. Gastric per-oral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) has emerged as a novel technique for treating gastroparesis, with up to an 80% success rate. This procedure involves myotomy of the distal stomach. We hypothesize that responders to this therapy are characterized by more distal dysmotility than nonresponders, as defined by GES retention patterns.

- **Methods**: We used regional gastric emptying measurements from diagnostic GES to determine the proximal or distal predominance of disease for each patient. We then compared treatment response and symptoms in each patient to total gastric half-emptying time (T ½), proximal gastric T ½, and a ratio comparing the two values.

- **Results**: In total, 47 patients underwent G-POEM during the study period. A significant difference (P < 0.01) was found in the proximal-to-total T ½ ratio between responders and nonresponders. A significant difference between pre- and postprocedural proximal-to-total T ½ ratios was identified for each patient. No correlations were identified between motility patterns and symptoms or in motility patterns among the different etiologies of the disease. The proximal-to-total T ½ ratio may represent an important patient selection factor for G-POEM versus other treatment modalities going forward.

### Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy improves chronic diarrhea in patients with refractory gastroparesis [^111nhiwH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

All G-POEM procedures were completed successfully, without technical complications or periprocedural adverse events.

Clinical success, defined as a ≥ 1 point decrease in the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI), was achieved in 81.8% (9/11) of patients. Complete remission of gastroparesis was confirmed by gastric emptying scintigraphy in 7 out of 9 patients (77.8%). The median GCSI decreased significantly from 3.1 (IQR 2.67–3.4) to 0.9 (IQR 0.7–1.7) after G-POEM (P = 0.001). The median subscale scores for nausea/vomiting, early satiety, and bloating were also significantly lower after endoscopic treatment (P = 0.001, P = 0.01, and P = 0.01, respectively).

Three of the 11 patients (27.3%) had a GCSI ≥ 2 after G-POEM, with preprocedural GCSI scores of 3.4, 3.4, and 3.1. One of them achieved clinical remission according to clinical criteria, and chronic diarrhea disappeared. However, the post-interventional gastric emptying scintigraphy remained pathological. Among the 2 patients with clinical treatment failure (GCSI decrease by < 1 point), 1 patient had normalized gastric emptying scintigraphy and showed complete clinical remission of diarrhea after G-POEM.

- **Adverse events and long-term follow-up**: The median hospital stay after G-POEM was 1 day (IQR 1–1). There were no early or delayed adverse events associated with the endoscopic procedure. During the median follow-up period of 170 days (IQR 33–1002), 1 patient experienced improvement in symptoms.

### Gastroparesis: Time for a paradigm change [^112PbrmP]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Gastroparesis (GP) is a syndrome defined by symptoms and delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Typical symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and early satiety. Only one medication is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of GP. This review highlights recent research findings pertaining to GP and provides evidence to support a change in the GP diagnostic and treatment paradigm.

- **Recent findings**: An analysis of GP trials over the past four decades demonstrates the power of placebo and the need to perform longer studies with clearly defined patient populations. Two studies highlight the need to evaluate patients with suspected GP carefully and to perform gastric emptying studies properly. The misdiagnosis of GP symptoms is reviewed, preceded by a discussion of whether GP should be considered a disorder of gut-brain interaction. Finally, new data on therapies that target the pylorus are highlighted.

- **Summary**: Gastroparesis is frequently over-diagnosed and incorrectly diagnosed. Performing a proper gastric emptying study, which adheres to standard protocol, and accurately interpreting the results in the context of the individual patient are critical to making an accurate diagnosis of GP. The treatment paradigm needs to shift from simply aiming to accelerate gastric emptying to treating global symptoms of a chronic syndrome that may represent gut-brain dysfunction in many patients.

### Feasibility, safety, and long-term efficacy of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) for postsurgical gastroparesis: a single-center and retrospective study of a prospective database [^112nXJ2N]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The secondary outcomes included the improvement of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Thirty-one patients (31/79, 39.2%) experienced symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux before undergoing G-POEM. The GERDQ was utilized to evaluate the clinical efficacy of G-POEM. At each time point (pre-G-POEM or post-G-POEM), the GERDQ scores did not differ significantly among patients with different anastomotic sites (F 4,104 = 0.8075, p = 0.5231). However, for each anastomotic site, GERDQ scores improved significantly at different time points (F 4,104 = 59.11, p < 0.0001).

- **Patients with gastroesophageal reflux**: Significant improvement at various time points was observed. For patients with esophageal anastomosis (> 20 cm, ≤ 25 cm), significant improvement was detected at 6 months post-G-POEM (p < 0.01). In those with jejunal anastomosis (> 25 cm), GERDQ scores improved significantly at 12 months post-G-POEM (p < 0.0001). Additionally, most patients who did not achieve clinical responses, based on the GCSI, had symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux prior to G-POEM.

The results demonstrate that the GERDQ supplemented the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of G-POEM. For each time point, GERDQ scores showed no statistically significant difference in patients with different anastomotic sites (F 4,118 = 0.7391, p = 0.5672). However, significant improvement was noted at various time points (F 4,118 = 63.47, p < 0.0001). The higher the esophageal anastomotic site, the more rapidly G-POEM improved symptoms.
