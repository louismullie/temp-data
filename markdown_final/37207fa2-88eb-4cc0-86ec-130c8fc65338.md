## Question

How does pulmonary vascular disease affect gas exchange in the lungs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how pulmonary vascular disease impairs gas exchange in the lungs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiology of alveolar–capillary gas exchange and the ventilation–perfusion relationship. Then, I should categorize the principal vascular mechanisms that disrupt gas exchange in pulmonary vascular disease. Next, I will map these mechanisms to specific pathophysiological consequences, including diffusion limitation, V/Q mismatch, shunt, and dead space. After that, I should integrate how these abnormalities translate into clinical gas exchange derangements and dyspnea. Finally, I will consider disease-specific patterns, diagnostic implications, and therapeutic consequences, including oxygen and selective vasodilators, while double-checking guideline nuances and exceptions like PVOD/PCH and CTEPH.

> Let me first confirm the normal physiology baseline. Gas exchange in the lung depends on adequate alveolar ventilation matched to perfusion, a thin alveolar–capillary diffusion barrier, and sufficient capillary surface area and transit time for oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide elimination; the pulmonary circulation receives the entire cardiac output at low pressure, which keeps the right ventricle unloaded and preserves capillary patency for efficient diffusion and V/Q matching [^1118dSCW].

> Now, I need to identify the principal vascular mechanisms that derange gas exchange. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that the major axes of injury include structural remodeling with loss of vessels, vasomotor dysregulation including hypoxic vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction, and mechanical obstruction from thromboembolism or extrinsic compression, all of which can coexist and vary by disease phenotype [^116J59dp] [^113cJc3e].

> I will now examine structural remodeling and capillary rarefaction. Chronic hypoxia, inflammatory injury, and shear stress trigger muscularization and proliferation in small arteries and arterioles, and destroy alveolar–capillary units in emphysema or fibrosis, reducing diffusing capacity and creating regions of high V/Q where ventilation exceeds perfusion; wait, let me verify the diffusion metric — yes, DLCO is typically reduced in parenchymal lung disease with vascular involvement and correlates with gas exchange impairment [^114n5UcC] [^115cRWMZ].

> Next, I should review vasomotor dysregulation. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a protective reflex that diverts blood from poorly ventilated alveoli, but in diffuse vascular disease it can overcompensate and worsen overall perfusion heterogeneity; endothelial dysfunction with reduced NO and prostacyclin and excess endothelin-1 increases basal tone and blunts flow redistribution, while HPV inhibition by vasodilators can paradoxically worsen V/Q mismatch in lung disease–associated PH, so I need to be cautious here [^116J59dp] [^116vvbsC].

> Let me consider mechanical obstruction and thrombosis. In CTEPH, organized thrombi and webs create segmental perfusion defects with low V/Q units and increased dead space. In acute PE, sudden macrovascular occlusion acutely increases pulmonary vascular resistance, reduces perfusion to entire lung regions, and can precipitate right ventricular failure with further circulatory compromise and hypoxemia, so I should confirm that V/Q scintigraphy and CT patterns reflect this mismatch physiology [^116C49Mc] [^111Z5NEY].

> I will now map mechanisms to pathophysiological consequences. Diffusion limitation emerges when capillary surface area falls or the diffusion path lengthens, as in emphysema or fibrosis, lowering DLCO and causing exercise-induced desaturation. V/Q mismatch arises when perfusion is misdistributed relative to ventilation, producing hypoxemia that is typically responsive to supplemental oxygen. Shunt physiology occurs with right-to-left intrapulmonary or extracardiac shunts or with completely unventilated but perfused units. Dead space ventilation increases when perfusion to ventilated alveoli is absent, worsening CO2 elimination and ventilatory inefficiency, especially in CTEPH and during pulmonary hypertensive crises [^114n5UcC] [^111GBdLE] [^116XEQmt].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical gas exchange signatures. Hypoxemia is the hallmark, often with a widened alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient, and in severe disease hypercapnia may emerge from increased dead space and ventilatory limitation. Dyspnea reflects both chemoreceptor stimulation from hypoxemia and hypercapnia and mechanical constraints from increased work of breathing and right ventricular afterload, so I should confirm that ABG and CPET are central to quantifying these abnormalities [^114n5UcC] [^115kv5Ld] [^116XEQmt].

> Next, I should review disease-specific patterns. In COPD with PH, emphysematous destruction lowers DLCO, HPV and dynamic hyperinflation worsen V/Q mismatch, and dead space rises with exercise. In ILD, fibrosis thickens the diffusion barrier and destroys capillaries, yielding severe V/Q mismatch and diffusion limitation. In CTEPH, discrete perfusion defects and high dead space dominate. In PAH, DLCO is often reduced and V/Q heterogeneity is present even without parenchymal disease, which I should keep in mind when interpreting imaging and PFTs [^114n5UcC] [^116C49Mc] [^115cRWMZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic implications. Quantitative imaging and functional tests can map regional V/Q heterogeneity and diffusion defects: PET-derived V/Q distributions, HP 129Xe MRI for barrier uptake and RBC transfer, and SPECT V/Q scanning each provide complementary windows on mismatch and shunt; concurrently, PFTs with DLCO, ABG, and echocardiography are recommended in the initial evaluation of suspected PH to correlate structure with function and hemodynamics [^1143yPya] [^111rLLLt] [^113ReYpj] [^1178SkEX] [^115ZdU8U].

> I need to ensure therapeutic consequences are aligned with mechanism. Long-term oxygen reverses HPV, lowers PVR, and improves V/Q matching in hypoxemic patients, with guidelines recommending LTOT when PaO2 is persistently below 60 mmHg. However, I should double-check the caveat that routine PAH vasodilators can worsen gas exchange in lung disease–associated PH by inhibiting HPV, so the axiom is "treat the lung, not the pressure", with exceptions like carefully monitored use in PVOD/PCH or CTEPH after surgical consideration [^117CRRym] [^111SfUgw] [^115KKg3d] [^117HykgC].

> But wait, what about selective pulmonary vasodilators in specific contexts. Inhaled nitric oxide improves oxygenation in PPHN and postoperative PH by redistributing perfusion to better-ventilated units, improving V/Q matching and reducing shunt; I should confirm that this benefit is context-specific and not generalizable to stable COPD, where iNO can worsen gas exchange, underscoring the importance of matching therapy to the underlying mismatch physiology [^111z8XEf] [^115tgqH9] [^114y2CXA].

> Let me reconsider the overarching pathophysiology to ensure coherence. Pulmonary vascular disease impairs gas exchange through a triad of structural loss, vasomotor dysregulation, and mechanical obstruction, producing diffusion limitation, V/Q mismatch, shunt, and dead space in varying proportions; clinically this manifests as hypoxemia with or without hypercapnia and dyspnea, and management hinges on correcting hypoxemia, treating the underlying lung or vascular disease, and using selective vasodilators only when the physiology predicts benefit and with close monitoring of gas exchange [^114n5UcC] [^111SfUgw] [^116C49Mc].

Pulmonary vascular disease impairs gas exchange primarily by **ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) mismatch** [^114n5UcC] and **diffusion limitation** [^1178SkEX], leading to hypoxemia and, in advanced disease, hypercapnia. V/Q mismatch arises from **reduced perfusion to ventilated alveoli** (e.g. vasoconstriction, thromboembolism, vascular remodeling) [^116J59dp] and **shunting of blood past non-ventilated alveoli** (e.g. pulmonary edema, atelectasis) [^111GBdLE], while diffusion limitation results from capillary loss, wall thickening, and interstitial fibrosis [^1154Zb7E] that impair oxygen transfer [^1154Zb7E]. These abnormalities are quantified by ABG, DLCO [^1178SkEX], and V/Q imaging [^1143yPya], and management focuses on correcting hypoxemia, treating the underlying disease, and avoiding vasodilators that worsen V/Q mismatch [^116vvbsC].

## Mechanisms of impaired gas exchange

### Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) mismatch

- **Reduced perfusion to ventilated alveoli**: Vasoconstriction, thromboembolism, or vascular remodeling reduce blood flow to ventilated regions, causing high V/Q and wasted ventilation [^116XEQmt].

- **Shunting of blood past non-ventilated alveoli**: Intrapulmonary shunts (e.g. edema, atelectasis) allow blood to bypass ventilated alveoli, causing low V/Q and severe hypoxemia [^115tgqH9].

- **Heterogeneous V/Q distributions**: Disease creates regional V/Q heterogeneity, with some areas high V/Q and others low V/Q, reducing overall gas exchange efficiency [^111NPoxe].

---

### Diffusion limitation

- **Capillary loss and wall thickening**: Emphysema and fibrosis reduce surface area and increase diffusion distance, impairing oxygen transfer [^1154Zb7E].

- **Interstitial fibrosis**: Thickening of the alveolar–capillary membrane limits diffusion, especially during exercise [^1154Zb7E].

- **Reduced diffusing capacity**: DLCO is typically decreased in pulmonary vascular disease, reflecting impaired diffusion [^116C49Mc].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Hypoxemia is the **primary manifestation**, initially exertional and progressing to resting hypoxemia as disease advances [^notfound]. Hypercapnia may occur in **advanced disease** with significant V/Q mismatch and diffusion limitation [^114n5UcC]. Dyspnea results from hypoxemia, increased work of breathing, and right ventricular dysfunction [^115kv5Ld].

## Assessment of gas exchange impairment

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Findings in pulmonary vascular disease** |
|-|-|-|
| Arterial blood gas (ABG) | Measures PaO2, PaCO2, pH | - Low PaO2 <br/> - Normal or low PaCO2 early <br/> - Elevated PaCO2 in advanced disease [^115cRWMZ] |
| Pulse oximetry | Non-invasive oxygen saturation | Low SpO2, especially during exercise [^114rE9jZ] |
| Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) | Assesses diffusion capacity | Decreased DLCO [^116C49Mc] |
| Ventilation–perfusion scan (V/Q scan) | Detects V/Q mismatch | Mismatched defects indicating V/Q mismatch [^116C49Mc] |
| Hyperpolarized xenon MRI | Regional ventilation, perfusion, and gas transfer | - Ventilation defects <br/> - Perfusion abnormalities <br/> - Reduced gas transfer [^111rLLLt] |

---

## Management strategies

- **Supplemental oxygen therapy**: Improves arterial oxygenation and reduces hypoxic vasoconstriction; indicated when PaO2 < 60 mmHg or SpO2 < 90% [^117CRRym].

- **Treatment of underlying disease**: Addressing the cause (e.g. thromboembolism, inflammation, hypoxia) improves gas exchange [^115KKg3d].

- **Avoidance of vasodilators**: Non-selective vasodilators can worsen V/Q mismatch and are generally avoided in lung disease-associated PH [^116vvbsC].

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves exercise capacity and oxygenation through enhanced ventilation and perfusion matching [^114sXmpq].

---

Pulmonary vascular disease impairs gas exchange through **V/Q mismatch and diffusion limitation**, causing hypoxemia and, in advanced disease, hypercapnia. Management centers on **oxygen therapy**, treating the underlying cause, and avoiding agents that worsen V/Q mismatch [^111SfUgw].

Pulmonary endothelial barrier function — regional variability and assessment methods — states that barrier function varies across the pulmonary circulation, with arteries and arterioles providing a relatively restrictive barrier, alveolar capillaries providing per surface area the most restrictive barrier to fluid and macromolecule flux, and venules being the most permeable and highly sensitive to mediators that increase permeability; interpretation should consider that different stimuli affect different vascular segments and that barrier integrity is defined by interactions with adjacent cells and underlying matrix; assessment distinguishes structural integrity from functional measurement of molecule flux, using techniques such as transendothelial electrical resistance and Transwell tracer penetration assays; measurement is feasible in animal models and in humans, each with specific considerations, caveats, and limitations.

Paediatric intensive care — therapy of acute pulmonary hypertension: Intravenous prostanoids should be considered to treat children with severe PH, and iNO may be considered for treatment of postoperative PH in mechanically ventilated patients to improve oxygenation and reduce the risk of pulmonary hypertensive crises. Concomitant sildenafil should be administered to prevent rebound PH in patients who have signs of increased PAP on withdrawal of iNO and require gradual weaning, and intravenous sildenafil may be considered for treatment of PH in critically ill patients, especially those with an unsatisfactory response to iNO. Inhaled iloprost may be as effective as iNO in children with postoperative PH, and in children who develop signs of low cardiac output or profound pulmonary failure despite optimal medical therapy, extracorporeal life support may be considered.

Assessing lung parenchyma with MRI-derived metrics notes that conventional 1H MRI measures tissue signal intensity using short–echo time and ultrashort echo time methods but with longer acquisition times and lower spatial resolution than CT, and that MRI is advantageous when radiation exposure is to be avoided or iodinated contrast is contraindicated (e.g., in pediatrics, pregnancy, or serial assessment of disease progression). Inhalation of an HP noble gas with MRI provides spatial information about ventilation and perfusion heterogeneity with higher resolution than PET and nuclear imaging techniques, with unique capabilities for measuring alveolar–capillary gas diffusion and lung microstructure; in hyperpolarization nuclear spins of gas atoms are aligned in a small magnetic field outside of the scanner, and when inhaled the spatial distribution of magnetized xenon gas can be tracked using specialized receiver coils.

13N-nitrogen positron emission tomography (PET) tracer kinetics — relationships for specific ventilation (sV) and perfusion (Q) are outlined: In a single-compartment voxel, the washout plateau at first appearance is proportional to regional perfusion; tracer washout is proportional to regional sV and the slope of washout is equal to –1/sV; the area under the curve is proportional to the Q/sV ratio. In two-compartment behavior, compartment 1 has high sV and compartment 2 low sV; during washout there is a steep initial slope in compartment 1, total blood flow in the voxel (Q1 + Q2) is reflected in the plateau, and the plateau is apportioned between compartments based on the back-extrapolated point to the onset of washout in compartment 2.

Paediatric pulmonary hypertension — lung function testing should be performed at diagnosis in children able to cooperate to rule out underlying or coexisting airway or parenchymal disease (obstructive, restrictive or combined); static and dynamic parameters should be obtained to assess presence and degree of restrictive or obstructive disease; in significant obstructive airway disease, symptomatic relief may be obtained from additional bronchodilator treatment; significant restrictive lung disease warrants detailed evaluation for interstitial lung disease, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) or pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis (PCH), as pulmonary vasodilator therapy can actually have adverse effects and may be contraindicated in PCH and PVOD; certain drugs (eg, inhaled iloprost) have been shown to cause bronchospasm in some children, and thus lung function testing should be performed prior to the start of any inhalative PH therapy.

Anesthesia and anesthetic management in pulmonary hypertension (PH) specify that the decision about the anesthetic method is determined by a combination of the planned surgery, severity of pulmonary vascular disease/right ventricular failure (RVF) and other comorbidities, as well as patient preference. Choosing an anesthetic technique that optimizes airway patency and gas exchange is essential in patients with co-morbid respiratory conditions such as chronic hypoxia from intrinsic lung disease, obesity, or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We highly recommend avoiding general anesthesia (GA) in patients with significant PAH when adequate alternative anesthetic methods exist due to the hemodynamic risks related to mechanical ventilation and anesthetic agents; however, this must be balanced with the potential risk of hypoxemia and/or hypercarbia or oxygen supply/ demand issues related to conscious sedation or insufficient pain control.

Severe pulmonary hypertension in respiratory disease — Pulmonary hypertension complicating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is usually associated with an mPAP below 35–40 mm Hg and a normal cardiac output; however, some outliers have PH with mPAP greater than 35–40 mm Hg. In association with underlying lung disease(s), PH has worse survival than the lung disease alone. The phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil has been studied in small groups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients without and with PH, and ventilation–perfusion mismatch has been reported in addition to decreased PVR; a controlled trial of sildenafil revealed improved oxygenation in patients with severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Studies are needed to discover biomarkers to identify individuals susceptible to out-of-proportion PH and to determine effective therapies for this phenotype.

Endothelial bioenergetics and experimental modifiers — Mitochondria participate in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism essential for optimal cell function, with the tricarboxylic acid cycle as the central hub, and mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-established mediator of multiple acute and chronic disease processes. The section notes that bioenergetics drives adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and plays a critical role in health and disease, and that endothelial cells flexibly shift metabolic pathways in response to environmental stimuli while in vitro settings contain numerous potential modifiers of metabolism. Reported modifiers include isolation-associated transitions to a nonproliferative state, cell density effects that alter mitochondrial function and structure and other metabolic profiles, alterations from multiple passaging by trypsinization that affect proteins regulating metabolism and mitochondrial electron transport, high passage number linked to cell senescence contributing to mitochondrial damage, antibiotics that can cause mitochondrial damage and/or modify membrane potential along with cell death signals from failed transfection that affect mitochondrial function and the proliferative phenotype of surviving cells, media components such as serum, supplemental growth factors, hormones, and metabolic substrates including glucose that have potential effects on mitochondrial function, oxygen and carbon dioxide as important modifying factors in pulmonary vascular disease models that can directly or indirectly alter mitochondrial function, concerns about ischemia-reperfusion when mitochondrial assays occur outside of a hypoxia chamber, and the common practice of freezing and thawing in maintaining cell lines.

Pediatric pulmonary hypertensive crisis pathophysiology — cardiopulmonary cascade and gas-exchange consequences are described as follows: Pulmonary hypertensive crisis develops with an acute increase of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), driving an increase in right ventricle (RV) pressure and volume with interventricular septal shift that reduces left ventricle (LV) volume; rising ventricular filling pressures with compensatory tachycardia and systemic hypotension compromise coronary perfusion, resulting in low cardiac output and metabolic acidosis; increased PAP also decreases pulmonary blood flow with dynamic airway obstruction from distended small intrapulmonary arteries and lung oedema; consequently dead space ventilation increases and, with ventilation–perfusion mismatch, leads to hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.

11.4. PAH-specific drug therapy of acute postoperative PH — the therapeutic goal and role of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) are outlined, stating that the primary goal is pulmonary vasodilation and enhancing RV function and cardiac output while avoiding adverse effects such as systemic hypotension and hypoxia; management involves early identification and close monitoring of high-risk patients and avoiding or mitigating vasoconstrictive triggers with pulmonary vascular–specific therapies; because of its advantages, iNO has become an accepted standard therapy for postoperative PH and at low doses improves ventilation-perfusion matching, decreases intrapulmonary shunt fraction, and often improves systemic arterial oxygenation; in an RCT of children after cardiac surgery, iNO treatment reduced episodes of PHC and shortened time to reach criteria for extubation, although the duration of mechanical ventilation was not different with iNO therapy.

Paediatric pulmonary hypertension — acute therapy in the intensive care unit includes the following guidance: Oxygen should be given when transcutaneous oxygen saturation < 95% in children with PH and normal cardiac anatomy. Intravenous prostanoids should be considered to treat children with severe PH. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) may be considered for treatment of postoperative PH in mechanically ventilated patients to improve oxygenation and reduce the risk of pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Concomitant sildenafil should be considered to prevent rebound PH in patients who have signs of increased PAP on withdrawal of iNO, and require re-start of iNO despite preceding gradual weaning of iNO. Intravenous sildenafil may be considered for treatment of PH in critically ill patients, especially those with an unsatisfactory response to iNO. Inhaled iloprost may be as effective as iNO in children with postoperative PH. In children who develop signs of low cardiac output or profound pulmonary failure despite optimal medical therapy, extracorporeal life support may be considered.

Paediatric pulmonary hypertension — oxygen therapy in the ICU: Oxygen is indicated for ventilation–perfusion mismatch "based on arterial oxygen saturations of less than 95% (figure 2)". In children with systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, "supplemental oxygen augments pulmonary overcirculation with the risk of worsening cardiac and pulmonary function". In cyanotic heart disease or deep cyanosis, "arterial oxygen saturations of 75–85% are generally accepted as sufficient".

Consequences of untreated hypoxemia — pulmonary circulation and pulmonary hypertension (PH) risks in pediatric lung disease are highlighted, and oxygen's physiologic benefits with a saturation target are noted. Chronic alveolar hypoxia elicits pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to pulmonary hypertension (PH), particularly in children with respiratory disorders, such as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and SCD. The correction of the hypoxemia in neonates with BPD and PH using supplemental oxygen can ameliorate physiologic complications, with HOT resolving right ventricular hypertrophy when Spo2 is maintained above 94–95%.

Pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are characterized by structural abnormalities in the airways, alveoli and pulmonary circulation that alter ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distributions, identified as the main mechanism of abnormal pulmonary gas exchange leading to arterial hypoxemia with or without hypercapnia; parenchymal destruction from emphysema reduces lung diffusing capacity (DLco), gas exchange generally worsens as disease progresses, and, rarely, reduced ventilatory drive from sedatives or hypnotic drugs can cause hypercapnic respiratory failure and acidosis.

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and oxygen targets in PPHN — iNO is presently recommended for infants with PPHN, with oxygenation improving in approximately 50% of recipients. Usual iNO concentrations range from 5 to 20 ppm with a typical starting dose of 20 ppm, but as a preventive measure for the development of PPHN iNO has not proven effective and cannot be recommended to prevent mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants with respiratory failure. Oxygen should be provided to target arterial saturations between 92% and 97% in PPHN, and iNO may be considered for bridging to transfer and can be considered for bridging to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) when oxygenation index > 25 or saturation differences > 10%, although no beneficial effects could be shown for this patient cohort; the oxygenation index (OI) is defined as FiO2×%MAP/pO2.

Imaging in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indicates that chest radiography is generally performed initially to exclude other diseases and establish concomitant respiratory diseases, is frequently normal in early COPD, shows lung hyperinflation and hyperlucent areas with peripheral trimming of vascular markings when abnormal, and is not performed during routine follow-up of a stable patient; computed tomography (CT) can estimate the degree and distribution of emphysema and identify bronchial wall thickening and gas trapping, correlates with lung function but has substantial interpreter variability, and quantitative techniques have not become routine clinical practice due to analytic complexity, software/algorithm differences, segmentation requirements, and lack of standardized protocols or agreement on complex measurements; CT can also help differentiate structural causes of airflow limitation, identify phenotype-associated abnormalities, and detect pulmonary and nonpulmonary comorbidities including lung cancer, with lung cancer risk increased in COPD but inversely related to the degree of airflow obstruction, and the presence of airflow obstruction should raise awareness of this risk and patients with COPD are considered good candidates to be screened for lung cancer.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Immediate postoperative congenital heart disease–pulmonary arterial hypertension (CHD-PAH) — Perioperative endothelial injury can heighten pulmonary vascular reactivity in the immediate postoperative phase, precipitating increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with acute right-sided heart failure, low cardiac output, systemic hypotension, metabolic acidemia, right-sided ischemia, airway edema/bronchoconstriction, gas-exchange impairment, alveolar edema, and potential cardiovascular collapse; crises tend to occur in patients with more "dynamic" and less "fixed" resistance and are more commonly reported in children than in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD).

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in COPD is defined by an elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg assessed by right heart catheterization and is organized into five groups (pulmonary arterial hypertension [group 1], PH associated with left heart disease [group 2], PH associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxia [group 3], chronic thromboembolic PH [group 4], and PH with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms [group 5]), and all groups can be diagnosed in patients with COPD. Diagnosis requires careful analysis of mechanisms leading to elevated mPAP to identify treatable traits; for example, chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH), a treatable cause of PH occurring more frequently in patients above the age of 40 years, can be detected in patients with COPD. Mild PH is frequent in COPD, with epidemiological estimations that 25–30% of all COPD patients present with elevated mPAP, and most are classified as group 3 PH or group 2 PH if significant left heart disease is present. The 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines define severe PH‑COPD by an increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 5 WU; severe PH‑COPD is rare, affecting around 5% of COPD patients, and patients with severe PH‑COPD frequently present with mild‑to‑moderate airflow limitation, no or very mild hypercapnia, and a low DLco < 45% predicted with a circulatory exercise limitation. Echocardiography is the best non‑invasive tool to estimate the probability and severity of PH, and elevated NT‑proBNP and an increased PA:Ao ratio on HR‑CT are associated with the presence of PH‑COPD; the diameter of the pulmonary artery has also been associated with the risk of COPD exacerbations. Patients with PH‑COPD should be referred to a PH center with experience in respiratory diseases for right heart catheterization and multidisciplinary assessment to guide treatment decision, and long‑term oxygen therapy is recommended in hypoxemic patients.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — oxygen therapy guidance states that although O2 administration has been demonstrated to reduce the PVR in patients with PAH, there are no randomised data to suggest that long-term O2 therapy is beneficial; guidance may be based on patients with COPD such that when arterial blood O2 pressure is consistently < 8 kPa (60 mmHg; alternatively, < 91% of arterial O2 saturation) patients are advised to take O2 to achieve an arterial blood O2 pressure > 8 kPa, and ambulatory O2 may be considered when there is evidence of symptomatic benefit and correctable desaturation on exercise; there are data showing that nocturnal O2 therapy does not modify the natural history of advanced Eisenmenger syndrome.

Endothelial cell mitochondrial function — assay modalities and limitations: Assessment of bioenergetics can be performed in whole organisms, cells, or mitochondria, using indirect calorimetry to quantify oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide release, Seahorse technology to investigate real-time cell respiration and glycolytic function by measuring oxygen and proton concentration in media, high-resolution respirometry that can be used in mitochondria or permeabilized cells, flow cytometry to assess mitochondrial mass, reactive oxygen species, and membrane potential, and targeted metabolomics via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, with best-practice guidelines available. Important limitations are noted: Seahorse measurements rely on indirect oxygen consumption measures, culture systems can be hampered by time-resolved readouts, bulk heterogeneity, and endothelial cell choice, and in vivo or ex vivo disease modeling does not currently allow an integrative or dynamic assessment of mitochondrial states; advances from frozen biologic samples and single-cell platforms for in vivo flux are cited as potential solutions. A sole focus on a modality does not offer a comprehensive data set, costs and technical expertise are barriers to using multiple modalities, and harmonizing methods in parallel may reveal insights into mitochondrial metabolism and its cellular and disease-specific consequences.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^115J3JsK]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Quantitative imaging (QI) of pulmonary pathophysiology — modeling is used to integrate multimodal data beyond registration, because statistical associations can be limited in mechanistic insight and a "single unifying biophysical model to relate physiological measurements to imaging" can be applied. A realistic pulmonary perfusion model has duplicated an ASL MRI experiment to guide thresholds for removing large-vessel signals that do not represent capillary perfusion. Imaging-based metrics rely on assumptions; for example, 1H MR–based SVI uses O2 as a contrast agent, and modeling that includes tissue mechanics, ventilation, perfusion, and gas exchange can simulate the distribution and exchange of O2 during SVI, control vessel signal to assess effects on heterogeneity and perfusion gradient, and generate voxelized virtual image data with simulated "ground truth" O2 distributions in circulation and tissue. Several imaging-based vascular metrics — ratio of PA to ascending aorta diameter, diameter and volume of proximal arteries, volume of small arteries, and microvascular blood flow and heterogeneity — are emerging as potential biomarkers for disease severity, and biophysical models, although time consuming, when well-designed and appropriately used, provide a sophisticated tool to complement imaging. Conclusions emphasize that QI continues to evolve with hardware and software advances, that effective use depends on robust study design and unbiased sampling, and that computational modeling plays an important role in elucidating mechanisms underlying imaged perturbations.

### Peripheral vascular disease in the lungs… [^111wBJ42]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although there has been extensive study of the changes in the peripheral vessels of the systemic circulation when affected by disease either primarily or secondarily, medical literature contains relatively few references to diseases of the peripheral pulmonary vessels. By roentgenologic examination, there is available a window through which one may view the pulmonary circulation in a manner which cannot be utilized in the study of the blood vessels of the rest of the body. It would seem useful, then, to review our knowledge of the conditions which may affect the small vessels of the lung and examine the pathologic and roentgenologic manifestations of them.

In an excellent series of monographs, Brenner1 has indicated that the arterioles, capillaries and venules of the lung may be subject to degenerative, infectious and neoplastic diseases similar to those encountered in the peripheral vessels of the systemic circulation, but accompanied by entirely dissimilar clinical BARDEN RP, COOPER DA.

Hyperpolarized 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (HP 129Xe MRI) — ventilation and acinar air–tissue–blood diffusion metrics are detailed: HP 129Xe MRI permits breath-hold imaging of inhaled gas distribution in airspaces and its uptake in interstitial tissues and plasma with transfer to pulmonary capillary red blood cells (RBCs). It can image acinar diffusion, and unique 129Xe resonant frequencies combined with novel acquisition strategies allow distribution in each compartment to be 3D encoded during a breath-hold while signal is constrained to arise primarily from the alveolar–capillary gas exchange interface and not larger vessels. 129Xe reports on structure and function at much smaller length scales than image resolution, noted as micrometers versus 3–5 mm isotropic. Additional spectroscopic sampling of the alveolar–capillary unit every 15 ms provides metrics of blood oxygenation and hemodynamics. HP 129Xe MRI is fast and well tolerated, allowing visualization of gas distribution, alveolar barrier integrity, and capillary RBC transfer.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5) — diagnostic and treatment principles: PH in unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms includes several disorders with multiple patho-aetiologies; the mechanisms are poorly understood and may include pulmonary vasoconstriction, proliferative vasculopathy, extrinsic compression, intrinsic occlusion, high-output cardiac failure, vascular obliteration and left heart failure as causes. These patients need careful diagnosis, with treatment tailored for that diagnosis and treatment of PH as secondary, following the axiom 'Treat the lung not the pressure'. There are no RCTs regarding the use of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-approved drugs in group 5 disorders, and some diseases may have a venous component (PVOD) that could be made worse by the use of pulmonary arterial vasodilators.

Travel and altitude — during air travel at normal cabin pressures corresponding to altitudes up to 2438 m, the PaO2 decreases to that of an inspired O2 fraction of 15.1% at sea level, and evidence suggests that short-term (less than 1 day) normobaric hypoxia is generally well tolerated in clinically stable patients with PAH. In-flight oxygen administration is advised for patients using oxygen at sea level and for those with PaO2 < 8 kPa (60 mmHg) or SaO2 < 92%; an oxygen flow rate of 2 L/min will raise in-flight oxygen pressure to values as at sea level, and patients already using oxygen at sea level should increase their oxygen flow rate. As the effects of moderate to long-term hypoxia remain largely unexplored in PAH, patients should avoid altitudes > 1500 m without supplemental oxygen, although day trips to 2500 m have been tolerated in patients not hypoxaemic at sea level.

Assessing regional ventilation–perfusion mismatch — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantification of regional V̇A/Q̇ matching combines three proton MRI sequences: specific ventilation imaging (SVI), perfusion measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL), and proton density; proton density is used to assess the air compartment of the voxel as (1 – density) and, when multiplied by local SVI, gives the volume of fresh gas/breath used to calculate regional V̇A; alternately, regional partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) can be quantified from 3He MRI by acquiring a back-to-back image series and analyzing regional changes in signal intensity with time, with regional V̇A/Q̇ ratio estimated from the measured PO2 using mass balance equations for respiratory gases.

### Chronic dyspnea: diagnosis and evaluation… [^116nScno]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

6 A study of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease found dyspnea to be as good as or better than forced expiratory volume in one second for predicting all-cause mortality. 7 A systematic review of 10 longitudinal studies concluded that as a symptom, dyspnea predicts mortality and is a useful proxy for determining the presence of underlying disease, usually involving the heart or lungs.
8. Diseases of the pulmonary parenchyma, such as interstitial fibrosis and sarcoidosis, usually have a slow and progressive course with worsening dyspnea and impairment over time. Symptoms associated with illnesses affecting the airways, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, or bronchiectasis, may wax and wane with an increase in coughing and sputum production during flare-ups.

Pulsus paradoxus is associated with severe COPD, asthma, large bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary embolism, and subacute cardiac tamponade. 23 Neck examination may reveal a shift of the trachea, adenopathy, jugular venous distention, or an enlarged thyroid gland causing tissue congestion or mass effect giving rise to the sensation of dyspnea. Cyanosis, wheezing, diminished breath sounds, and distant heart sounds are consistent with a diagnosis of COPD, as are use of accessory muscles for respiration, a barrel chest, and decreased breath sounds with pursed lip breathing. Rales, a positive hepatojugular reflex, hepatomegaly, and an S3 gallop, ascites, and jugular venous distention suggest heart failure as an underlying cause. An irregular rhythm on auscultation may indicate arrhythmias causative of chronic dyspnea.

Supplemental oxygen has long been used in patients with COPD with severe resting hypoxia. 37, 38 A recent meta-analysis suggests that supplemental oxygen may relieve dyspnea in mildly hypoxic or nonhypoxic patients but that further evidence was needed. 39 A recent study of the use of supplemental oxygen in patients with stable COPD and moderate desaturation, with or without exertion, did not show prolongation in time to death or hospitalization. Nor were there any measurable benefits in quality of life, lung function, or improvements in walking distances. 40.

Pulmonary hypertension pathobiology by group — Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has a multifactorial pathobiology, with increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) related to vasoconstriction, proliferative and obstructive remodelling, inflammation, and thrombosis; endothelial dysfunction reduces vasodilator and antiproliferative mediators such as NO and prostacyclin with overexpression of thromboxane A2 and endothelin-1. Group 2 PH due to left heart disease involves passive backward transmission of pressure (post-capillary passive PH), whereas some cases show greater elevation of PAP than PWP with increased PVR (post-capillary reactive or 'out of proportion' PH). Group 3 PH due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia involves hypoxic vasoconstriction, mechanical stress of hyperinflated lungs, loss of capillaries, inflammation, toxic effects of cigarette smoke, and an endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor–vasodilator imbalance. Group 5 PH has unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms.

Pulmonary quantitative imaging — key conclusions and recommendations indicate that imaging modalities (CT, PET, SPECT, and MRI) offer innovative quantitative information on lung structure and function, including regional air and tissue volumes, airway and vascular dimensions, lung mechanics, regional alveolar ventilation, perfusion, ventilation–perfusion matching, and alveolar–capillary diffusion. Assumptions and limitations of state-of-the-art techniques should be clearly stated to avoid misinterpretation of results, and acquisition conditions should be documented and standardized when possible and considered in data interpretation. Quantitative analysis of imaging data should follow basic principles of unbiased study design and sampling, and measurements should be related to a well-defined anatomical or volumetric reference space and normative data when appropriate; methodology should be clearly described, and established guidelines and characterized reference standards should be followed to maximize reproducibility among sessions, scanners, and modalities. Automated exhaustive voxel-by-voxel image analysis increases precision but not necessarily accuracy, and high-precision measurements may exacerbate systematic bias and reduce the accuracy of results. Care should be taken to select appropriate physiological parameters for correlation with imaging metrics, terminology describing gas-exchange functions inferred from imaging should be precise to avoid confusion, and functional lung imaging remains emergent with many techniques lacking rigorous validation or gold standards; there is a need for more studies using robust animal models of disease to directly validate conclusions on the basis of in vivo imaging against quantitative structural analysis. Computational models of physiological processes, grounded in the laws of physics, may be combined with imaging metrics to aid the prediction, validation, and mechanistic interpretation linking the imaged findings to function.

Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease — therapy: Currently there is no specific therapy for PH associated with lung diseases. Long-term O2 administration has been shown to partially reduce the progression of PH in COPD, whereas in interstitial lung disease the role of long-term O2 therapy on PH progression is less clear. Treatment with conventional vasodilators such as CCBs is not recommended because they may impair gas exchange due to the inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and because of their lack of efficacy after long-term use. Published experience with targeted PAH drug therapy is scarce, and so far there is no evidence from RCTs suggesting that PAH drugs result in improved symptoms or outcomes in patients with lung disease. In summary, patients with lung disease and PH who are hypoxaemic should receive long-term O2 therapy, treatment of the underlying lung disease should be optimized, and the use of drugs approved for PAH is not recommended for patients with PH due to lung disease.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^111DvKXf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — exercise assessment and mechanisms of exercise limitation in chronic respiratory disease are outlined as follows: Before starting an exercise training program, an exercise assessment is needed to individualize the exercise prescription, evaluate the potential need for supplemental oxygen, help rule out some cardiovascular comorbidities, and help ensure the safety of the intervention. This patient assessment may also include a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess the safety of exercise, to define the factors contributing to exercise limitation, and to identify a suitable exercise prescription, and analyzing the output from a cardiopulmonary exercise test may uncover otherwise hidden exercise-related issues such as hypoxemia, dysrhythmias, musculoskeletal problems, or cardiac ischemia. Exercise intolerance in individuals with chronic respiratory disease may result from ventilatory constraints, pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities, peripheral muscle dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, or any combination of the above. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ventilatory requirements during exercise are often higher than expected because of increased work of breathing, increased dead space ventilation, impaired gas exchange, and increased ventilatory demand, with expiratory airflow obstruction and dynamic hyperinflation further limiting maximal ventilation and contributing to increased work of breathing, mechanical constraints on the respiratory muscles, and an intensified sense of dyspnea. Hypoxia directly increases pulmonary ventilation through augmenting peripheral chemoreceptor output and indirectly through stimulation of lactic acid production, whereas supplemental oxygen therapy during exercise, in hypoxemic and even in nonhypoxemic patients with COPD, allows for higher intensity training. The cardiovascular system is affected by chronic respiratory disease, with an increase in right ventricular afterload from elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to combinations of hypoxic vasoconstriction, vascular injury and/or remodeling, and erythrocytosis, and other cardiac complications include tachyarrhythmias and elevated right atrial pressure that may further compromise cardiac function during exercise. Lower limb muscle dysfunction is frequent in individuals with chronic respiratory disease and is an important cause of exercise limitation, and in COPD increased lactic acid production for a given exercise work rate increases ventilatory requirement, with a tendency to retain carbon dioxide during exercise further increasing acidosis and ventilatory burden. Despite adaptations, patients with COPD often have static and dynamic hyperinflation that places respiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage, and both functional inspiratory muscle strength and inspiratory muscle endurance are compromised.

### Nitric oxide (Genosyl) [^1159ruNM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	 Mechanism of Action

Nitric oxide relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature, and because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin, has minimal effect on the systemic vasculature.

GENOSYL appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better ventilated areas of the lung, redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from lung regions with low ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios toward regions with normal ratios.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effects on Pulmonary Vascular Tone in PPHN

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs as a primary developmental defect or as a condition secondary to other diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, sepsis, hyaline membrane disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and pulmonary hypoplasia. In these states, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high, which results in hypoxemia secondary to right-to-left shunting of blood through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. In neonates with PPHN, nitric oxide gas for inhalation improves oxygenation (as indicated by significant increases in PaO2).

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111Z5NEY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) responses to pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are marked by rapid increases in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that are poorly tolerated, with the RV failing and developing conduction abnormalities, and both large PE and severe ARDS resulting in uncoupling of the RV from the pulmonary circulation and subsequent inefficient forward flow. The primary insult with PE comes from macrovesel occlusions, whereas ARDS results from microvessel occlusion with widespread but heterogeneous alveolar consolidation and elements of acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Both conditions shift the pulmonary vasoconstrictor–dilator balance toward an increase in arterial load and result in chemokine and cytokine release, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and production of reactive oxygen species. LV diastolic dysfunction may arise after acute PE and persist despite PH resolution but likely is not a main contributor to symptoms. Approximately 4% of acute PE survivors develop chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH), and CTEPH has a high index of recovery after intervention. RVF is an independent cause of increased mortality in ARDS.

Pulmonary hypertension — pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases (ABG) show that patients with PAH usually have decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, typically 40–80% predicted, with mild to moderate reductions in lung volumes; at rest, arterial oxygen tension is normal or slightly reduced and arterial carbon dioxide tension is decreased from alveolar hyperventilation; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)–related hypoxic PH is diagnosed by irreversible airflow obstruction with increased residual volumes, reduced diffusion capacity and normal or increased carbon dioxide tension; concurrent decreases in lung volume and diffusion capacity suggest interstitial lung disease.

Table 5 — Single-ventricle thresholds and follow-up catheterization timing — In patients with single ventricle physiology, a transpulmonary gradient (TPG) ≥ 6 mm Hg indicates elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and presence of pulmonary vascular disease and may be considered as indication for vasodilator therapy; repeat cardiac catheterization in children with PH/PAH should be considered in case of clinical deterioration and for assessment of treatment effect, detection of early disease progression, and listing for lung transplantation; intervals for repeat catheterizations should be based on clinical judgment but are mainly determined by clinical worsening, significant pharmacotherapy changes, or failure to reach treatment goals, and it may be reasonable for a stable patient on PAH-targeted therapy to undergo cardiac catheterization every 12–24 months after a full non-invasive evaluation.

ESC/ERS 2022 pulmonary hypertension (PH) guidelines — Table 14 — outline group‑specific diagnostic patterns across PH forms. In Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), clinical presentation may include young, predominantly female patients; oxygen requirement is uncommon except with low diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) or right‑to‑left shunting, and DLCO is normal or mild‑to‑moderately reduced, with low DLCO in SSc‑PAH, PVOD, and some IPAH phenotypes. In Group 3 PH associated with lung disease, patients are mostly elderly with male predominance; oxygen requirement is common with often profound hypoxaemia in severe PH, and DLCO is often very low (< 45% predicted). In Group 4 PH associated with pulmonary artery obstructions (CTEPH), a history of VTE may be present but CTEPH can occur without a VTE history; ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scintigraphy shows mismatched perfusion defect, chest radiography shows RA/RV/PA enlargement with reduced number and size of peripheral vessels and occasional pulmonary infarction signs, and chest CT shows intravascular filling defects, mosaic perfusion, and enlarged bronchial arteries. Across groups, echocardiography demonstrates signs of PH (increased sPAP, enlarged RA/RV).

### Evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension-consensus statement from the ISHLT [^116XEQmt]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) — interpretive features in CTEPH note that CPET provides important insights into the pulmonary vascular reserve and imparts additional understanding into the cause of patient limitations. CTEPH has specific features on CPET characterized by a dramatic reduction in ventilatory efficiency, which can be helpful to assess patients after acute PE as well as before and after PEA. Ventilatory efficiency is quantified by an increase in ventilation relative to CO2 production (VE/VCO2) and higher physiologic dead space fraction (VD/VT). The degree of dead space ventilation and ventilatory efficiency have been associated with exercise impairment and survival in CTEPH. In comparison to other forms of PH, patients with CTEPH appear to have a lower heart rate response, and the degree to which abnormalities in exercise response during CPET can inform treatment choice for patients with CTEPH remains to be studied.

### Noxivent 101 [^112EtWda]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Nitric oxide relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature, and because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin, has minimal effect on the systemic vasculature.

Noxivent™ appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better ventilated areas of the lung, redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from lung regions with low ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios toward regions with normal ratios.

### Xenon (xenon, Xe-133) [^111Qrr9b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Xenon Xe 133 is a readily diffusible gas which is neither utilized nor produced by the body. It passes through cell membranes, freely exchanges between blood and tissue, and tends to concentrate more in body fat than in blood, plasma, water or protein solutions. In the concentrations recommended for diagnostic studies, it is physiologically inactive. Inhaled Xenon Xe 133 Gas will enter the alveolar wall and the pulmonary venous circulation via capillaries. Most of the Xenon Xe 133 Gas that enters the circulation from a single breath is returned to the lungs and exhaled after a single pass through the peripheral circulation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effects on Pulmonary Vascular Tone in PPHN

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs as a primary developmental defect or as a condition secondary to other diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, sepsis, hyaline membrane disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and pulmonary hypoplasia. In these states, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high, which results in hypoxemia secondary to right-to-left shunting of blood through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. In neonates with PPHN, INOmax improves oxygenation (as indicated by significant increases in PaO2).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of nitric oxide has been studied in adults.

Absorption and Distribution

Nitric oxide is absorbed systemically after inhalation. Most of it traverses the pulmonary capillary bed where it combines with hemoglobin that is 60% to 100% oxygen-saturated. At this level of oxygen saturation, nitric oxide combines predominantly with oxyhemoglobin to produce methemoglobin and nitrate. At low oxygen saturation, nitric oxide can combine with deoxyhemoglobin to transiently form nitrosylhemoglobin, which is converted to nitrogen oxides and methemoglobin upon exposure to oxygen. Within the pulmonary system, nitric oxide can combine with oxygen and water to produce nitrogen dioxide and nitrite, respectively, which interact with oxyhemoglobin to produce methemoglobin and nitrate. Thus, the end products of nitric oxide that enter the systemic circulation are predominantly methemoglobin and nitrate.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111ywPuJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular function assessment in pulmonary vascular disease — trial incorporation and measurement standards are outlined as follows: Measurements of RV function should be routinely incorporated into observational studies and clinical trials in pulmonary vascular disease, even if not as the primary endpoint. Several long-held endpoints in pulmonary arterial hypertension, such as 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) and hemodynamics, are inadequate surrogates for short-term events, and a significant proportion of the treatment effect (50–75%) on clinical outcome should be explained by the effect of the intervention on the surrogate endpoint. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is accurate and reproducible, allows detecting small changes in RVs (~3%) in modest samples, and is considered the standard of measure for RV morphology and function; CMR has greater sensitivity and reproducibility than ultrasound and thus can rapidly detect an efficacy signal with a small sample size in a short period of time, potentially minimizing cost and avoiding a trial futility, although its routine use in clinical trials needs further validation.

Pulmonary endothelial phenotypes — culture effects, remodeling, and disease associations — are characterized by substantial divergence from in vivo states, as "41% of proteins expressed in vivo were not detected in cultured microvascular endothelial cells (54)". Culture conditions influence phenotype because "serial passaging has wide-ranging phenotypic effects on proliferation, survival, morphology, and function (55, 56)" and patient-derived cells may retain disease traits yet drift, as "pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension continue to exhibit a hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, and proinflammatory phenotype in vitro (57)" while "these endothelial cells will simultaneously tend to converge to a 'common' in vitro phenotype that is determined by the specific culture conditions rather than the donor's disease state (58)". Structural transitions such as "vasculogenesis, which is the de novo formation of a primitive vascular network… or angiogenesis, which is the growth and/or expansion of an existing vascular network by sprouting… fission, intussusception… or coalescence — reflects endothelial phenotypic transitions", and rigorous assessment "requires the use of stereological methods on two-dimensional histological sections or three-dimensional visualization techniques (63, 64)". Endothelial phenotype change is described in diseases "including The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and pulmonary hypertension… collagen vascular diseases such as scleroderma… emphysema… and airway diseases", yet "none of the currently available markers of phenotypic change are specific to the pulmonary circulation, and none are specific to a known type of lung endothelial cell".

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^115kv5Ld]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea — physiological mechanisms and example causes are organized into increased respiratory drive (e.g., interstitial lung disease, pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular disease, congestive heart failure) and chemoreceptor stimulation with conditions leading to acute hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and/or acidemia; additional categories include increased dead space and/or acute hypercapnia, impaired ventilatory pump (e.g., muscle weakness, airflow obstruction), metabolic acidosis, renal disease, decreased oxygen carrying capacity (e.g., anemia), decreased release of oxygen to tissues (e.g., hemoglobinopathy), decreased cardiac output, pregnancy, and behavioral factors (hyperventilation syndrome, anxiety disorders, panic attacks). Impaired ventilatory mechanics are listed separately and include airflow obstruction (asthma, COPD, laryngospasm, aspiration of foreign body, bronchitis), muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre, spinal cord injury, myopathy, post-poliomyelitis syndrome), and decreased compliance of the chest wall (severe kyphoscoliosis, obesity, pleural effusion). Notes indicate that in most cardiopulmonary disease states a combination of increased respiratory drive and impaired mechanics will be present, and that heart failure includes both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with differing symptom patterns and potential contributions from metaboreceptors.

### Chronic cor pulmonale… [^115JP3pd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Cor pulmonale is right ventricular enlargement secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Although most often caused by parenchymal lung disease, derangements of the ventilatory drive, the respiratory pumping mechanism, or the pulmonary vascular bed may also result in right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation. Arterial hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis all contribute to the increased afterload on the right ventricle. Diagnosis is often difficult, since pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale have few specific manifestations, especially early in their evolution. Treatment is primarily directed at the underlying pulmonary or ventilatory disorder, rather than at the right ventricular failure per se. Supplemental oxygen is essential to avoid hypoxia; corticosteroids, anticoagulants, vasodilators, and other specific therapies are used as indicated to treat the underlying pulmonary disorders.

When medical therapies fail, lung or heart-lung transplantation has become a possibility for selected patients. Palevsky HI, Fishman AP. Chronic Cor Pulmonale: Etiology and Management. JAMA. 1990; 263: 2347–2353.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112mpWWw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Blood flow, oxygen delivery, and extraction — COPD limb muscle fatigue: During strenuous exercise, peripheral vasoconstriction related to the high demand for respiratory muscle blood flow appears to compromise limb muscle perfusion and consequently enhance muscle fatigue, and in COPD a redistribution of blood flow toward respiratory muscles may occur with strategies that reduce respiratory muscle work hypothesized to alleviate limb muscle fatigue by restoring limb blood flow. Reduced muscle capillarity could limit blood and oxygen delivery and increase susceptibility to muscle fatigue, with reduced capillarity observed in patients with COPD who developed quadriceps fatigue after cycling exercise; exercise training improved capillarity in COPD, suggesting augmenting capillarity may offer a route to reduce fatigability. Enhanced muscle fatigability can also occur when left ventricular function is compromised and this may be relevant in subsets of patients with COPD, including those with cardiac comorbidities and pulmonary hypertension, in whom altered cardiac output and oxygen delivery have been reported.

Acute exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) — cardiovascular risk during and after episodes increases significantly, likely related to worsening of systemic inflammation, abnormal pulmonary gas exchange, gas trapping and lung hyperinflation. Cardiovascular mechanisms that can influence lung function also worsen during ECOPD. As a result, during ECOPD the risk of acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and stroke increases further, particularly in severe episodes requiring hospitalization. The risk remains high during the first few weeks after hospital discharge, and it can still remain significantly increased even one year after discharge.

### Comparing chest images from MRI to CT in patients with cystic… [^115YV35K]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

Study Overview The purpose of this research is to learn more about the heart and blood vessels in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. This study will include approximately 36 children and adults with CF and 12 children and adults without CF. The study will involve one magnetic resonance imaging. The research also includes blood samples to look at inflammation and lung tests called spirometry and Lung Clearance Index determined by Multiple Breath Washout test. Cystic Fibrosis, the most common inherited disease in Caucasians, is characterized by chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive loss of gas exchange units that eventually results in respiratory failure. There is strong evidence that in CF abnormally low vascular perfusion carries a high risk of death independent from the presence of pulmonary hypertension. However, the evolution of pulmonary vascular disease in CF and how it might contribute to the rate of decline in lung function is not known.

Knowledge remains limited to the results of old observational studies which concluded that the major causes of pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypertension in CF are hypoxic respiratory failure and destruction of lung tissue. Recent data obtained by state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the pulmonary circulation, challenges the existing paradigm. Studies demonstrate that in the absence of hypoxia, significant changes in pulmonary perfusion and in surrogate measures of vascular resistance as well as in collateral blood flow begin early in the course of CF. The newly developed therapeutics in the last decade which altered dramatically the course of patients suffering from pulmonary vascular disease provide opportunities to understand the role of pulmonary vasculature in CF lung disease.

This pilot study will assess the relationships between pulmonary perfusion, serum markers of pulmonary inflammation and vascular remodeling, and hemodynamic measures consistent with pulmonary hypertension. This study will establish MRI as a readily obtainable modality to be used in the CF population to obtain measurements of pulmonary perfusion; pulmonary arterial hemodynamic, dimension, and flow measures; and ventricular mass and function measures. The primary goal of this study is to improve the understanding of pulmonary vascular disease in CF by examining pulmonary perfusion abnormalities and their association with markers of pulmonary inflammation and pulmonary vascular remodeling, the severity of obstructive airways disease, and pulmonary hemodynamic abnormalities in CF.

PAH occurs most commonly in women (threefold increased risk) and across the age spectrum, and although therapies developed over the past two decades improve clinical function and survival for many patients, PAH remains a disease with high morbidity and mortality and no cure. Diagnosis and early initiation of treatment in PAH is currently based on exclusion of other diseases that may cause pulmonary hypertension, and clinical testing for diagnosis includes echocardiography, CT, nuclear medicine perfusion scanning, pulmonary arteriography, and pulmonary function testing, with right heart catheterization also required to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension and exclude cardiac etiologies.

### Pulmonary hypertension associated with acute or chronic lung diseases in the preterm and term neonate and infant. the European paediatric pulmonary vascular disease network, endorsed by ISHLT and DGPK [^114YcBT9]. Heart (2016). Medium credibility.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and preterm PH — PPHN often complicates acute respiratory failure in the first 1–2 weeks after birth; since inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are effective in the majority of these cases and only limited evidence of the efficacy of oral or intravenous medications for PPHN is available, additional 'PH specific' medication requires definition in this cohort. In preterm infants, PH is rare in the first 4 weeks of postnatal life but may develop along with nCLD/BPD; management of PH in developmental lung diseases is mainly focused on the optimisation of systemic oxygenation. A thorough evaluation of PH and its underlying mechanics is mandatory before targeted PH therapy on a case-by-case basis, and long-term outcome related to PPHN and PH associated with developmental lung diseases remains mostly unknown, pointing to the need for prospective and controlled studies in population-based cohorts.

Oximetry and arterial blood gas measurement — use in COPD: Pulse oximetry can be used to evaluate arterial oxygen saturation and need for supplemental oxygen at the point-of-care and should be used to assess all patients with clinical signs suggestive of respiratory failure or right heart failure. If peripheral arterial oxygen saturation is ≤ 92%, arterial blood gases should be measured due to the imperfect correlation between oximetry and arterial blood gas. Pulse oximetry does not provide information on PaCO2 or pH, which may have potential therapeutic implications.

Pulmonary rehabilitation exercise training — role and mechanisms notes that exercise capacity in chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is impaired and often limited by dyspnea, which is usually multifactorial due to peripheral muscle dysfunction, dynamic hyperinflation, increased respiratory load, or defective gas exchange. Considered to be the cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation, exercise training is the best available means of improving muscle function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and even patients with severe chronic respiratory disease can often sustain training intensity and duration sufficient for skeletal muscle adaptation; improvements in skeletal muscle function after training lead to gains in exercise capacity despite the absence of changes in lung function.
