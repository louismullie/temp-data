## Question

A prostate gland measuring 3.5 × 3.1 × 3.1 with a volume of 17.7ml considered normal or large in size?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a prostate measuring 3.5 × 3.1 × 3.1 cm with a calculated volume of 17.7 mL is considered normal or enlarged, and what that means in a clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how prostate volume is typically calculated and whether 17.7 mL is consistent with those dimensions. Then, I should verify the guideline-based size categories that define small, average, large, and very large prostates. Next, I will consider how age affects what is considered "normal". After that, I should review the clinical significance of this size, including thresholds for medical therapy and procedural planning. Finally, I will double-check measurement accuracy and any caveats before concluding with a clear answer and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the volume calculation. Using the standard ellipsoid formula (length × width × height × 0.52), 3.5 × 3.1 × 3.1 × 0.52 equals approximately 17.5 mL, which matches the reported 17.7 mL within rounding error, so the math checks out and the reported volume is internally consistent with the dimensions provided.

> Now, I need to place this volume in guideline categories. The AUA 2023 BPH guideline explicitly defines prostate size categories as small less than 30 g, average 30–80 g, large greater than 80 to 150 g, and very large greater than 150 g, noting that grams and milliliters are interchangeable because the specific gravity of prostate tissue is about 1.05 g/mL, so 17.7 mL is equivalent to roughly 17.7 g and clearly falls in the "small" category [^114BEDvX] [^1119aH6s] [^115XF8zA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "normal" without considering age. I initially thought "normal adult prostate is about 20–25 mL", but wait, I should verify that against population data. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the median prostate volume in community-dwelling men without cancer was 28 mL, and many men had volumes in the teens, so a 17.7 mL prostate is within the range of normal for some adults, especially younger men, even though it is below the population median [^114w57Kr]. Let me reconsider: "normal" is age dependent; a 17.7 mL prostate would be typical for a man in his 30s–40s and still within normal for older men, albeit on the smaller side of average [^116hKygb].

> Next, I should review clinical significance. I need to ensure whether this size has implications for BPH therapy or procedural selection. The AUA recommends 5‑alpha reductase inhibitor therapy primarily when there is demonstrable prostatic enlargement, typically operationalized as prostate volume greater than 30 g, PSA greater than 1.5 ng/mL, or palpable enlargement on exam, so at 17.7 g this gland would not meet the size threshold for 5‑ARI monotherapy or combination therapy based on size alone [^117CdENi] [^112sThPz]. For procedural planning, many minimally invasive surgical therapies and device trials have focused on prostates in the 30–80 g range, and simple prostatectomy is generally considered when volume exceeds 80 mL, so a 17.7 mL prostate is far below those intervention-oriented size ranges [^117X5zFB] [^115ZFW48].

> I should double-check measurement accuracy and method. Transrectal ultrasound is the preferred modality for prostate volume estimation, and the ellipsoid coefficient 0.52 is standard, though some studies suggest a slightly higher coefficient (about 0.66) may better approximate true volume in certain contexts; even if a different coefficient were used, 17.7 mL would remain in the small category, so the categorical conclusion is robust to modest formula differences [^112CY6n1] [^111bbxJC] [^114rnpok]. But wait, what if the dimensions were over- or underestimated? TRUS can misestimate dimensions by small percentages, yet even a 10–20% error would still leave this gland under 30 g, preserving the "small" classification [^112RbJ5Q] [^113S3GSQ].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. A prostate volume of 17.7 mL is not enlarged by guideline criteria and is best categorized as small; whether it is "normal" depends on age and individual variation, but it sits within the range of normal for many men and is well below thresholds that typically drive BPH treatment decisions or procedural selection, so there is no evidence of benign prostatic enlargement based on size alone here [^114BEDvX] [^115XF8zA] [^116eHnQn].

> Clinically, I need to ensure we don't overinterpret size in isolation. Management of lower urinary tract symptoms should be guided by symptom burden, uroflow, postvoid residual, and other factors rather than size alone; if the patient has bothersome LUTS, evaluate with IPSS and targeted testing, and if PSA is elevated or there are risk factors for cancer, integrate PSA density and appropriate imaging and biopsy strategies rather than relying on gland size to infer malignancy risk [^112sThPz] [^112peXCu] [^111dU3Am].

---

The prostate volume of 17.7 mL is **normal for a young adult male** (20–30 years) and **borderline small for older men** (≥ 50 years), as prostate size typically increases with age [^116eHnQn] [^114w57Kr]. It is **not considered enlarged** by clinical standards, which define enlargement as > 30 mL [^114BEDvX]. Clinical context — such as age, symptoms, and PSA — should guide any further evaluation or management [^114iWikc].

---

## Normal prostate volume by age

Prostate volume varies with age; **younger men have smaller glands**, and volume increases with age [^116eHnQn]:

| **Age group** | **Normal prostate volume (ml)** |
|-|-|
| 20–30 years | 15–25 mL |
| 30–50 years | 20–30 mL |
| 50–70 years | 30–50 mL |
| > 70 years | 35–60 mL |

---

Thus, 17.7 mL is **normal for ages 20–30** and **borderline small for ≥ 50 years**.

---

## Clinical significance of prostate volume

Prostate volume is **clinically significant** and guides diagnosis and management of BPH and other prostate conditions [^117X5zFB]. Enlargement is typically defined as > 30 mL, and larger glands are more likely to cause urinary symptoms and complications [^117CdENi] [^1119aH6s] [^116zSRHg]. A volume of 17.7 mL is **not considered enlarged** and is unlikely to cause significant urinary symptoms or complications.

---

## Factors influencing prostate size

Several factors influence prostate size, including:

- **Age**: Prostate size increases with age due to hormonal changes and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^116eHnQn].
- **Hormonal levels**: Androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play a significant role in prostate growth [^1127wzht].
- **Genetics**: Family history and genetic predisposition can influence prostate size [^1127wzht].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Obesity and diet may influence prostate size [^115YKaBX].

---

## Clinical implications of a 17.7 mL prostate volume

A prostate volume of 17.7 mL has **minimal clinical implications**:

- **BPH symptoms**: Unlikely to cause significant urinary symptoms or complications [^notfound].
- **PSA levels**: Typically associated with normal PSA levels, although PSA can vary based on individual factors [^notfound].
- **Cancer risk**: Does not significantly increase the risk of prostate cancer, although regular screening is still recommended based on age and risk factors [^1141Y7sE].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

Given a prostate volume of 17.7 mL, **routine monitoring and screening** are recommended:

- **Regular PSA testing**: Based on age, risk factors, and clinical guidelines [^notfound].
- **Digital rectal examination (DRE)**: To assess prostate consistency and detect any abnormalities [^112sThPz].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management to maintain overall prostate health [^111nWBZB].

---

## Conclusion

A prostate volume of 17.7 mL is **normal for younger men** and borderline small for older men. It is **not considered enlarged** and is unlikely to cause significant urinary symptoms or complications. Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are recommended to maintain prostate health.

Prostate ultrasound examination specifications — The transrectal approach to ultrasound of the prostate is the method of choice because image quality is superior to transabdominal or transperineal examinations; if the transrectal approach is not possible, a transperineal ultrasound examination may be used to direct a biopsy procedure, and a transabdominal approach can be useful to obtain an estimate of prostate size in some settings. The prostate should be imaged in its entirety in at least two orthogonal planes, sagittal and axial or longitudinal and coronal, from the apex to the base of the gland. An estimated volume is determined from measurements in three orthogonal planes (volume = length × height × width × 0.52), the volume of the prostate may be correlated with the PSA level, and alternatively, prostate volume can be calculated using prostate planimetry.

### Integrative multiplatform molecular profiling of benign prostatic hyperplasia identifies distinct subtypes [^1127wzht]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on benign prostatic hyperplasia:

- **Definition**: BPH is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland that affects aging men.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BPH is complex and not fully understood. However, androgenic hormones, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a significant role in the growth and maintenance of the prostate gland. Dihydrotestosterone is synthesized from testosterone by the action of 5-alpha reductase enzymes, and both normal and pathological growth of the prostate is dependent on dihydrotestosterone synthesis.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of BPH/LUTS in men is estimated at 15,000 per 1,000 person-years. The reported prevalence of BPH ranges from 8–14% in men aged 40–49 years to 21–43% in men aged 60–69 years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BPH include advancing age, familial predisposition, obesity, and the presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and CVD.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, BPH is primarily diagnosed based on a diverse array of progressive LUTS. These symptoms include increased urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, weak urinary stream, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BPH is variable. It is a progressive condition but is not necessarily life-threatening.

Section 1: clinical use of MRI

Multi-parametric MRI

Recommended use of MRI in prostate cancer consists of multi-parametric (mp-MRI). This includes a combination of high-resolution T2-weighted images (T2WI), and at least two functional MRI techniques, as these provide better characterisation than T2WI with only one functional technique. Within an mp-MRI examination, the relative clinical value of its component techniques differs. In addition to T2WI MRI, which mainly assesses anatomy, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) add specificity to lesion characterisation, while dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) has a high sensitivity in cancer detection.

Clinical use of MRI

If PSA is elevated (> 3–4 ng/mL) or DRE indicates suspected tumour, TRUS-guided biopsy will be performed to detect potential cancer, and assess its extent, volume and aggression. But, PSA has low specificity (36%), thus increased PSA is not equivalent with tumour. Also, normal PSA does not exclude tumour. Finally, TRUS biopsy underestimates the extent and grade of prostate cancer.

Based on PSA findings, DRE results and histopathological findings at TRUS biopsy, treatment is determined. Localised prostate cancer can be stratified into three groups based on the likelihood of tumour spread and recurrence:
Low-risk: PSA < 10 ng/mL, and biopsy Gleason score ≤ 6, and clinical stage T1–T2a
Intermediate-risk: PSA 10–20 ng/mL, or biopsy Gleason score 7, or clinical stage T2b or T2c
High-risk: PSA > 20 ng/mL, or Gleason score 8–10, or clinical stage > T2c.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^113tykeX]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Early detection of prostate cancer — atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP): clinicians should perform additional testing (Expert Opinion). ASAP is synonymous with a small focus (or foci) of atypical glands suspicious, but not definitive, for a diagnosis of carcinoma. An ASAP finding alone on needle biopsy is associated with a 30% to 50% risk of prostate cancer detection on repeat biopsy, with approximately 10% to 20% of these being GG2+ cases. Given these risks, additional testing should be considered following an ASAP diagnosis, which may include repeat systematic needle biopsy with consideration of mpMRI ± targeted biopsy, PSA, as well as urine, or serum biomarkers; patients with ASAP plus other biopsy cores showing invasive prostate cancer should be managed in accordance with the definitive carcinoma component.

Case presentation 1

In January 2015, a 66-year-old male presented at the Urology ward of the LangeLand Hospital with a serum PSA of 6.4 ng/ml which was elevated compared to the upper limit of normal serum PSA of 4.5 ng/ml of men of his age. The patient had no paternal history of PCa and had no urinary complaints. The physical examination of the prostate gland (DRE) by the physician was normal. Prostate volume by TRUS was 35 cm³ and TRUS findings were normal. TRUS-Bx was performed (5 left and 5 right). Biopsies were negative for malignancy.

In June 2015, the serum PSA increased to 7.2 ng/ml and there was no sign of a urinary tract infection. Therefore, the physician used ERSPC RC4 with TRUS or DRE containing PSA, DRE (normal/abnormal), TRUS (normal/abnormal), TRUS-assessed volume and biopsy history. This model can be used for biopsy-naïve men and for men that have had a previous biopsy with a benign result. After entering the available data, the risk of having PCa or high-grade PCa is displayed. The ERSPC RC4 showed that this man's risk for PCa and high-grade PCa was 17 and 3%, respectively. Prostate biopsy is indicated when the ERSPC RC4 risk for PCa is > 20% and if the risk for PCa is between 12.5 and 20%, in combination with a risk for high-grade disease of > 4%. Biopsy is not indicated when the risk for PCa on biopsy is < 12.5%. Based on this outcome, patient and physician elected for PSA follow-up.

Study illustration

The secondary objective was to assess whether the location or clinical significance of cancerous lesions had any impact on size differences between imaging and histopathology.

Tumour size measurements of the prostate lesions were carried out by 2 radiologists with at least 5 years' experience. Any discrepancies between the two were resolved by consensus. Following a literature review of several previous studies that reported measurement differences between cancers on imaging and histopathology, the difference in lesions size of ≤ 1 mm was considered as concordant. The lesion was considered overestimated or underestimated in both imaging modalities if the size differences of the tumour on imaging were > 1 mm larger or smaller than the pathologic lesion size, respectively. We used the same size definition for both mpMRI and USWE.

Measurement of cancerous lesions

The longest diameter of malignant prostate lesions (maximum linear extent) seen and classified as PI-RADS 3 or more on T2W MRI or seen in the colour map of USWE was measured (Fig. 2). A similar method was used for histopathological lesions seen in the prostate sections using imaging-based 3D-printed patient-specific whole-mount moulds. Comparison of size and accuracy detection of tumours between the two imaging modalities was carried out in different locations of prostate gland from base to apex.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1172iUNV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indications and use include that MRI can be performed with and without the administration of IV contrast material, and pelvic resolution can be augmented using a phased array/endorectal coil. Standard MRI techniques can be used for examination of the pelvis and/or abdomen for initial evaluation and as part of workup for recurrence or progression. MRI may be considered in patients after RP when PSA does not fall to undetectable levels or when an undetectable PSA becomes detectable and increases on ≥ 2 subsequent determinations, or after RT for increasing PSA or positive DRE if the patient is a candidate for additional local therapy; MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy may improve the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥ 2) cancers. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) can be used in the staging and characterization of prostate cancer and is defined as images acquired with at least one sequence in addition to anatomical T2-weighted images, such as DWI or dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images. mpMRI may be used to better risk stratify patients considering active surveillance, may detect large and poorly differentiated prostate cancer (Grade Group ≥ 2) and extracapsular extension (T staging), and is preferred over CT for abdomen/pelvis staging; mpMRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT scan for pelvic lymph node evaluation. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Accurate prostate volumes from manual calculations – A comparison of PI-RADS v2 and v2.1 measurement techniques [^116LRpcm]. Academic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is a theoretical risk of volume overestimation if prostate AP dimension is taken on axial imaging given the anatomic obliquity of the gland on axial plane. This is analogous to slicing a salami sausage diagonally rather than perpendicularly to obtain larger slices. The most recent PI-RADS update (v2.1) now recommends obtaining the anterior-posterior measurement on sagittal imaging to mitigate the theoretical risk of the so called "salami effect" when using the ellipsoid formula for volume calculations. The authors of the recent article Comparison of PI-RADS Versions 2.0 and 2.1 for MRI-based Calculation of the Prostate Volume found the theoretical "salami effect" may not be as significant as originally thought, and perhaps slight overestimation of the AP diameter on axial measurements may yield more accurate volume estimates. Future validation studies are needed for to validate their findings. In this contemporary study, there is excellent interreader agreement among radiologist' three dimensional measurements-confirming manual calculation can be reliably replicated in practice settings where of software-based segmentation tools are not available.

### Challenge of prostate MRI segmentation on T2-weighted images: inter-observer variability and impact of prostate morphology [^116ykYnq]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

The prostate gland is a complex organ with varied size, shape and appearance. Morphological differences may contribute to segmentation variability. We found that the smaller the prostate, the higher the segmentation variability was (p < 0.001). Hyperplasia of the TZ leading to prostate hypertrophy is the most common change attributed to aging. We hypothesized that the increase in size of TZ was associated with sharper contours (surgical capsule) which are then easier to draw, whereas in small volume prostate without prostatic hyperplasia, the glandular tissues of the transition and peripheral zone are histologically identical and therefore more difficult to differentiate. In our cohort, 42.5% of MRIs had a PI-RADS score > 2 with lesions in both the PZ and the TZ that may alter the appearance of anatomical structure under segmentation. The presence or absence of a PI-RADS score > 2 lesion did not translate into an increase in segmentation variability (p = 0.53). However, the variability increased with a lower PZ to TZ contrast ratio (p -value = 0.01) which can be explain by poor contrast at boundary between zones.

Introduction

Prostate cancer size assessment with preoperative imaging is crucial for the staging of disease. Size of the primary tumour is also a major prognostic indicator and is one of the three parameters used in the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) cancer staging; although T does not represent the precise size of the tumour, this does indicate the location and extent of the tumour in the prostate gland. The size of cancers seen on imaging is not only used for staging but also for risk stratification, particularly in localised prostate cancer. Mathematical modelling and survival data in other sites show cancers displaying a direct correlation between the size of cancer and its lethality, irrespective of the methods of detection.

In prostate cancer, preoperative size assessment is achieved by Digital Rectal Examination (DRE), ultrasonography or MR imaging. In general, the ability of DRE and B mode transrectal ultrasonography to quantify the size of cancerous lesions remains poor, however, with the introduction of ultrasound shear wave elastography (USWE), measurement of cancerous lesions has become possible and the interest in the role of ultrasound has been further explored. The accuracy of mpMRI for the determination of tumour size using PI-RADS classification has been reported by various methods in different studies, citing a range of degrees of correlation between mpMRI and histopathology.

There are, however, a few issues with the reported literature on this topic. Firstly, the studies failed to account for the consideration that conventional prostate gland histopathology sectioning with the posterior side down, the cutting plane may not match the imaging plane. Moreover, imaging coils, surgical resection and histopathology tissue processing can deform the prostate's shape and cancerous lesions, even when using image analysis software. The variability in the sectioning of radical prostate specimens can be confounded with the histopathological location relative to imaging modalities. Thus, whole-mount pathology slides may show distinct depths angles and shapes of the prostate much different to clinical images. In order to improve registration accuracy, guides or templates were used to obtain uniform sections or slices, but these methods do not ensure the correct orientation of the specimens. Secondly, the reported results for size determination on imaging are mixed. Some research shows that mpMRI gives an overestimation of tumour size, whereas others showed that mpMRI underestimated the actual tumour size. Almost all previous studies have defined the relationship between mpMRI and pathology as reliant on imprecise methods, such as volume approximation manual registration, and two-dimensional measurements.

Prostate cancer — active surveillance selection and outcomes in favorable intermediate-risk disease are characterized as follows: Prospective cohorts including intermediate-risk patients had prostate cancer-specific survival rates of 94% to 100% for the full cohorts. With extended follow-up, the Toronto group reported inferior metastasis-free survival in intermediate-risk disease, with 15-year metastasis-free survival for cases of Gleason 6 or less with PSA < 10 ng/mL, 94%; Gleason 6 or less with PSA 10–20 ng/mL, 94%; Gleason 3+4 with PSA 20 ng/mL or less, 84%; and Gleason 4+3 with PSA 20 ng/mL or less, 63%. The panel interpreted these data to show that a subset of patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy greater than 10 years may be considered for active surveillance, while noting that inclusion and follow-up protocols need refinement and that a significant proportion of those clinically staged as favorable intermediate-risk may have higher risk disease. Particular consideration to active surveillance may be appropriate for those with a low percentage of Gleason pattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, and/or low genomic risk, but it should be approached with caution, include informed decision-making, and use close monitoring for progression.

### How would you manage this patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^116pYjr5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in older patients assigned male sex at birth, regardless of gender identity, and treatment of these symptoms is therefore common in primary care practice. In 2021, the American Urological Association published guidelines for management of BPH. They recommend using a standardized scoring system such as the International Prostate Symptom Score to help establish a diagnosis and to monitor the efficacy of interventions, α-blockers as the first-choice pharmacotherapy option, and 5α-reductase inhibitors for patients with prostate size estimated to be at least 30 cc. Tadalafil is another option regardless of erectile dysfunction. Combination therapies with α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, or β 3 -agonists are effective options. A surgical referral is warranted if the BPH results in chronic kidney disease, refractory urinary retention, or recurrent urinary tract infections; if there is concern for bladder or prostate cancer; or if symptoms do not respond to medical therapy. In this article, a general internal medicine physician and a urologist discuss the treatment options and how they would apply their recommendations to a patient who wishes to learn more about his options.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® lower urinary tract symptoms-suspicion of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116c3xS8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic enlargement have a high prevalence in men over 50 years of age. Diagnosis is made with a combination of focused history and physician examination and validated symptom questionnaires. Urodynamic studies can help to differentiate storage from voiding abnormalities. Pelvic ultrasound may be indicated to assess bladder volume and wall thickness. Other imaging modalities, including prostate MRI, are usually not indicated in the initial workup and evaluation of uncomplicated lower urinary tract symptoms from an enlarged prostate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Can prostate cancer be prevented?

Epidemiologic evidence indicates that the most effective way to reduce prostate cancer incidence is to decrease PSA testing, raise thresholds used to define an abnormal PSA result (fig 1), and lower the number of tissue core samples obtained in men undergoing a prostate biopsy. In men who receive a PSA test, use of risk calculators that take other clinical parameters (age, prostate volume, free to total PSA ratio) into account or a triage test may help identify men who could avoid a prostate biopsy and detection of clinically insignificant disease, while still detecting potentially lethal disease that requires intervention.

The only other strategy shown to reduce prostate cancer incidence involves 5-α reductase inhibitors (5ARI), which are approved for treating symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and a systematic review have shown that 5ARI reduces prostate cancer incidence but may increase the detection of high risk cancers. These drugs are not approved for prostate cancer prevention. RCTs indicate that antioxidants, particularly vitamin E and selenium, do not reduce prostate cancer incidence and should not be used. Other widely used options including aspirin, statins, low fat or soy based diets, and aerobic or weight based exercise are not clearly effective.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for benign prostatic hyperplasia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, AUA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider assessing the prostate size and shape via transrectal or abdominal ultrasound, cystoscopy, or cross-sectional imaging (MRI/CT), if available, before interventions for LUTS secondary/attributed to BPH.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^116zSRHg]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) terminology and pathophysiology — BPH can lead to an enlargement of the prostate called benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), yet not all men with BPH will develop any evidence of BPE. The prostate gland may cause obstruction at the bladder neck termed benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), and BPO is a subset of BOO. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) increase in frequency and severity with age and are divided into storage and voiding/emptying categories, and male LUTS may be caused by conditions including BPE and BPO. The enlarged gland has been proposed to contribute to male LUTS via at least two routes: direct BOO/BPO from a mechanical static component and increased smooth muscle tone and resistance within the gland (dynamic component).

PSA density

Serum PSA is a non-specific test for prostatic disease. Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer is, however, associated with a higher serum PSA rise per unit volume than Gleason score 6 cancer and benign prostatic tissue. This ratio between serum PSA and prostate volume (PSA density) is therefore a better marker for Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer than serum PSA alone.PSA density can be used for selecting men with an unsuspicious or equivocal prostate MRI for biopsy. Men with a moderately raised PSA value, an unsuspicious MRI and a PSA density < 0.1 ng/mL/cm³ are not more likely to have a Gleason score ≥ 7 prostate cancer than men in the general population.

Other biomarkers

Conventional serum PSA tests measure both free and complexed forms. Assays detecting free PSA, the subfractions intact PSAor −2 proPSA, or the closely related hK2 proteinmay be used to improve test specificity, either alone or in combination such as in the Prostate Health Index (PHI) and 4Kscore tests.

Two statistical models based on biomarker measurements in serum with or without clinical data have been evaluated in large screening populations: the Stockholm-3 test and 4Kscore test. The Stockholm-3 test measures total and free serum PSA, hK2, microseminoprotein-β, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1, a polygenic risk score calculated from single-nucleotide polymorphisms, age, first-degree family history and previous biopsy. The Stockholm-3 test may reduce unnecessary systematic biopsies by 44% and detection of Gleason score 6 cancer by 17%, compared with a systematic biopsy for all men with PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL. The test may also be used to select men for MRI, which in a randomised trial reduced the need for MRI by 36%. The Stockholm-3 test has not been externally validated and there has been some variation in the cut-offs and test components.

The 4Kscore test is based on measuring free, intact, total PSA and hK2 in blood and information about age, digital rectal examination and prior biopsy. Use of the 4Kscore test decreases unnecessary biopsies by 30%–50% while maintaining > 90% detection of Gleason score ≥ 7 and > 97% of Gleason score ≥ 4+3 = 7 cancer. Furthermore, the 4Kscore predicts a 10–20-year risk of lethal prostate cancer among healthy middle-aged men with 'normal' or moderately high PSA values.

The panel states that such cancer poses little threat to individuals with a life expectancy of less than 20 years, with PSA early-detection lead time bias ranging from an estimated 12.3 years at age 55 to 6 years at age 75. The NCCN Panel consensus is that active surveillance is preferred for all patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy greater than 10 years.

### The weight of the prostate gland is an excellent surrogate for gland volume [^116Wbr2i]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Prostate gland volume is generally assessed by transrectal ultrasound examination or magnetic resonance imaging at the time of prostatic biopsy or pre-brachytherapy planning. The volume is most commonly measured using the formula, prostate volume = height × width × length × π/6, which is derived considering the gland as ellipsoid. There are conflicting data regarding the accuracy of this method, with most studies comparing this calculated volume with that measured radiologically using planimetry with summation of sequential area measurements. The aim was to determine the relationship between prostate gland volume and weight.

Methods and Results

The accuracy of prostate gland volume calculated from three-dimensional measurements of the gland in 20 radical prostatectomy specimens relative to the true gland volume determined using water displacement was prospectively evaluated. Since volume measurement by water displacement is not practical in routine practice, the relationship between prostate weight and volume was also evaluated. Our findings indicate that the calculated gland volume consistently underestimates the true volume. The volume of the prostate gland (in cm³) very closely correlates with its weight (in g).

Conclusions

The weight of the prostate gland (without the seminal vesicles) is an excellent surrogate for prostate volume. The prostate gland in radical prostatectomy specimens should be weighed after transecting the seminal vesicles at the base.

### Prostate specific antigen density and clinically-significant prostate cancer: the influence of prostatic volume [^112mW9cS]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate specific antigen density (PSAd) is one of the strongest predictors of clinically-significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in risk calculators. There is little evidence on the effect of prostate volume on the diagnostic performance of PSAd. Our aim was to define the diagnostic accuracy of PSAd for predicting csPCa across prostate volumes.

Methods

548 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy were included in this retrospective study. Patients were grouped by prostate volume; small (≤ 30mL), medium (> 30 to < 50mL), large (≥ 50mL). Sensitivity and specificity of PSAd were assessed at thresholds of ≥ 0.10, ≥ 0.15, and ≥ 0.20ng/mL/mL for two definitions of csPCa.

Results

At all PSAd thresholds and for both definitions of csPCa, there was a statistically significant and clinically-relevant difference in diagnostic performance across prostate volume groups. Sensitivity was highest in small glands, lowest in large glands; the opposite being true for specificity. Using a PSAd threshold of ≥ 0.15ng/mL/mL, sensitivity for ISUP grade ≥ 2 PCa was 83.1%, 63.6%, and 33.3% for small, medium and large prostates (p ≤ 0.001) with specificities of 48.5%, 67.5% and 79.3%, respectively (p = 0.005).

Conclusions

Diagnostic performance of PSAd varied significantly by prostate volume, and by applying a single PSAd threshold across all prostate volumes risks missing csPCa in men with larger glands, whilst performing unnecessary biopsies in those with smaller glands. Defining PSAd thresholds according to prostate volume categories can therefore improve its use as a risk predictor for csPCa.

### Is tumour volume an independent predictor of outcome after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer? [^114cdfqr]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations to the current study need to be considered. The potential bias intrinsic to single centre retrospective analyses needs to be acknowledged. Inconsistencies in TV measure may also be relevant. Unsurprisingly computed planimetry has been shown to yield better associations than visual estimation methods. Yet both total TV and volume of the primary lesion alone have been shown to be directly correlated. Finally, our cohort of patients underwent heterogenous investigation protocols reflective of the developments in prostate cancer diagnostics. Potentially these may have contaminated the analysis of the preoperative investigations. Follow up to 10 years was also reduced however analysis shows evidence that the models offer consistent results in the very long term.

This study aimed to evaluate the role of TV for risk stratification in high-risk prostate cancer. Survival analysis has shown that TV has a prognostic value, but does not offer additional information in addition to pGG and pT stage. Of note TV was measured from the histopathalogical specimen; ongoing advances in imaging offer the possibility of accurately measuring TV preoperatively. TV measured on preoperative mpMRI has been shown to correlate with postoperative histological specimens although current techniques are limited by tendency to underestimate size. Even TRUS has been shown to predict TV and soon we believe that advances in prostate MRI incorporating radiomics analysis and machine learning methods offer the potential for accurate preoperative TV segmentation. Consequently, TV may emerge as an accurate pre-operative marker for prognostication and risk stratification alongside prostate biopsy and other current tools.

### Does prostate size predict the development of incident lower urinary tract symptoms in men with mild to No current symptoms? Results from the REDUCE trial [^116iWSCg]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It has been shown that increased prostate size is a risk factor for lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) progression in men who currently have LUTS presumed due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Objective

To determine if prostate size is a risk factor for incident LUTS in men with mild to no symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study, which contained a substantial number of men (n = 3090) with mild to no LUTS (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] < 8).

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Our primary outcome was determination of the effect of prostate size on incident LUTS presumed due to BPH defined as two consecutive IPSS values > 14, or receiving any medical (α-blockers) or surgical treatment for BPH throughout the study course. To determine the risk of developing incident LUTS, we used univariable and multivariable Cox models, as well as Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test.

Results and Limitations

Among men treated with placebo during the REDUCE study, those with a prostate size of 40.1–80ml had a 67% higher risk (hazard risk 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.23–2.26, p = 0.001) of developing incident LUTS compared to men with a prostate size 40.0ml or smaller. There was no association between prostate size and risk of incident LUTS in men treated with 0.5mg of dutasteride. The post hoc nature of our study design is a potential limitation.

Conclusions

Men with mild to no LUTS but increased prostate size are at higher risk of incident LUTS presumed due to BPH. This association was negated by dutasteride treatment.

Patient Summary

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a very common problem among older men, which often manifests as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and can lead to potentially serious side effects. In our study we determined that men with mild to no current LUTS but increased prostate size are much more likely to develop LUTS presumed due to BPH in the future. This association was not seen in men treated with dutasteride, a drug approved for treatment of BPH. Our study reveals that men with a prostate size of 40.1–80ml are potential candidates for closer follow-up.

### Volume-specific cutoffs are necessary for reproducible application of prostate-specific antigen density of the transition zone in prostate cancer detection [^1158kCgH]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effect of prostate volume on the specificity of prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) and PSAD of the transition zone (PSA-TZ) in the detection of prostate cancer.

Methods

Between February 1994 and April 1998, transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsies were performed in 235 men with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL. The PSAD and PSA-TZ specificities were calculated at 95% sensitivity cutoff levels generated from the whole group, as well as from cohorts stratified by transition zone index or prostate volume.

Results

Statistical significance was noted between the benign (n = 176) and prostate cancer (n = 59) groups for all tested PSA parameters. At 95% sensitivity, PSA-TZ carried a specificity of 37.5% compared with 29.6% for PSAD. When applying a single 95% sensitivity cutoff derived from the entire group to individual volume-stratified cohorts, the specificity decreased to 0% in glands less than 30 g in size. A 95% sensitivity PSA-TZ cutoff generated individually for volume-stratified cohorts of glands less than 30, 30 to 40, and 40 to 60 g resulted in more consistent specificity of 28.2%, 35.2%, and 45.7% for each cohort, respectively.

Conclusions

Unlike whole group-derived cutoffs, the use of volume-specific PSA-TZ cutoffs allows consistently high specificity in all volume-stratified cohorts. The discrepancies in the PSA-TZ and PSAD specificities in published reports are likely due to the application of published cutoffs to populations of differing prostate volumes. The use of volume-specific cutoffs results in reproducible specificity in populations with differing prostate volume distribution, and thereby definitively resolves the differences in PSA-TZ specificity reported in published reports.

### Which measurement method should be used for prostate volume for PI-RADS? A comparison of ellipsoid and segmentation methods [^111uMs9X]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Prostate volume and PSA density (PSAd) are important in the risk stratification of suspected prostate cancer (Pca). PI-RADS v2.1 allows for determining volume via segmentation or ellipsoid calculation. The purpose of our study was to compare ellipsoid and segmentation volume calculation methods and evaluate if PSAd diagnostic performance is altered.

Methods

We retrospectively assessed 397 patients (mean age/standard deviation: 63.7/7.4 years) who underwent MRI and prostate biopsy or prostatectomy, with Pca classified by Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 and ≥ 4 + 4 disease. Prostate total volumes were determined with ellipsoid calculations (TVe) and with semi-automated segmentation (TVs), along with inter-rater reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). PSAd was calculated for TVe and TVs and ROC curves were created to compare performance for Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 and ≥ 4 + 4 disease.

Results

TVe was significantly higher than TVs (p < 0.0001), with mean TVe = 55.4 mL and TVs = 51.0 mL. ROC area under the curve for PSAd derived with TVe (0.63, 95%CI:0.59–0.68) and TVs (0.64, 95%CI:0.59–0.68) showed no significant difference for Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 disease (p = 0.45), but PSAd derived with TVs (0.63, 95%CI: 0.58–0.68) significantly outperformed TVe (0.61, 95%CI: 0.57–0.67) for Gleason ≥ 4 + 4 disease (p = 0.02). Both methods demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability with TVe with ICC of 0.93(95%CI: 0.92–0.94) and TVs with ICC of 0.98(95%CI: 0.98–0.99).

Conclusion

Traditional ellipsoid measurements tend to overestimate total prostate volume compared to segmentation, but both methods demonstrate similar diagnostic performance of derived PSA density for PI-RADS clinically significant disease. For higher grade disease, PSAd derived from segmentation volumes demonstrates statistically significant superior performance. Both methods are viable, but segmentation volume is potentially better.

Prostatic urethral lift (PUL) patient selection and prostate size evidence emphasize anatomic verification and size-related uncertainty. Clinicians should verify prostate morphology and volume, and the Panel limited the statement to patients with a prostate lacking an obstructive middle lobe; an observational cohort (n = 45) with an obstructive middle lobe showed improvements but was excluded from formal efficacy analysis due to nonrandomized historic controls.

NCCN Prostate Cancer — candidacy for active surveillance in NCCN low-risk: Active surveillance is the preferred management approach for patients with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy ≥ 10 years. The Panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity across this risk group. Factors associated with an increased probability of near-term grade reclassification include high PSA density (≥ 0.15), increased number of positive cores, higher body mass index (BMI), and faster PSA kinetics. Conversely a negative biopsy following diagnosis is associated with a decreased probability of grade reclassification. The Canary PASS risk calculator can be used for more precise estimates of upgrading probability on active surveillance. Higher risk features alone do not necessitate immediate treatment, but should be used as part of a shared-decision making discussion and in tailoring the intensity of active surveillance.

### Definition of insignificant tumor volume of gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 (grade group 1) prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy-is it time to increase the threshold? [^112FzK6C]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We investigated the tumor volume of insignificant Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 (Grade Group 1) prostate cancer with contemporary grading.

Materials and Methods

We studied 439 consecutive radical prostatectomies with Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 (Grade Group 1) cancer entirely submitted for histological examination.

Results

A total of 407 cases (92.7%) were organ confined (pT2), 17 (3.9%) had a positive margin at the apex (pT2+) and 15 (3.4%) had extraprostatic extension (pT3a). Extraprostatic extension was focal in 10 cases and nonfocal in 5. pT2 and pT3 cases did not differ by age or gland weight. When total tumor volume was less than 0.5 cm³, 6 of 311 tumors (1.9%) had extraprostatic extension and 6 of 311 (1.9%) had tumor at the margin at the apex for a total of 12 significant cancers (3.8%). Tumor volumes between 0.5 and 1.0 and 1.0 and 2.0 cm³ had a similar incidence of significant cancers. Of 108 cases with a tumor volume of 0.5 to 2.0 cm³ 5 (4.6%) had extraprostatic extension and 7 (6.5%) had pT2+ at the apex for a total of 12 significant cancers (11.1%). The incidence of significant cancer increased further with tumor volumes greater than 2.0 cm³.

Conclusions

Only 3.8% of less than 0.5 cm 3 Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 (Grade Group 1) cancers had extraprostatic extension or extended apically where surgical removal was not possible. In contrast, 11.1% of 0.5 to 2.0 cm 3 cancers had these adverse features and would not have been tumors amenable to active surveillance. Our data indicate that increasing the threshold above 0.5 cm 3 is associated with a significantly increased likelihood of extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margins. This should be considered in future studies of the prognostic value of tumor volume and in studies of active surveillance criteria.

Prostate cancer — ultrasound applications summarize standard, Doppler, and endorectal uses. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to image small regions of the body, standard ultrasound imaging provides anatomic information, and vascular flow can be assessed using Doppler ultrasound techniques. Endorectal ultrasound is used to guide transrectal biopsies of the prostate, and endorectal ultrasound can be considered for patients with suspected recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) to guide prostate bed biopsy. Advanced ultrasound techniques for imaging of the prostate and for differentiation between prostate cancer and prostatitis are under evaluation.

### Correlation between serum prostate-specific antigen and cancer volume in prostate glands of different sizes [^116XKCE7]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To further evaluate the relationship of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with prostate size and tumor volume in a contemporary surgical series. Although early studies showed a strong correlation between PSA and tumor volume, it has been suggested that PSA is no longer a valid marker for prostate cancer and only correlates with prostate size.

Methods

From 2003 to 2009, 1234 men with data on prostate weight and total tumor volume underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon. Prostate size was classified into tertiles: small (≤ 41.2 g), medium (41.3–54.5 g), and large (≥ 54.6 g). Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship of PSA with prostate size and tumor volume across different prostate sizes.

Results

Median preoperative PSA was 4.9 ng/mL (standard deviation ± 4.6), mean prostate size was 51.7 g, and mean tumor volume was 5.6 cm³. PSA had a significant correlation with prostate size only at a prostate weight ≥ 54.6 g (P = 0.02). Regardless of prostate size, PSA had a more robust significant correlation with tumor volume than with prostate size (all P < .0001).

Conclusions

PSA was significantly correlated with prostate size only in the largest prostate glands, but was significantly associated with tumor volume in small, medium, or large prostates. Thus, PSA continues to be a better marker for tumor volume than for prostate size.

### Prostate volume changes over time: results from the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging [^114w57Kr]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

According to a 1944 publication by Swyer benign prostatic hyperplasia develops in some men after age 45 with further prostatic growth whereas in other men prostate size remains stable or decreases with advancing age. Although there is an abundance of literature describing prostatic enlargement in association with benign prostatic hyperplasia, less is known about the phenomenon of prostate atrophy.

Materials and Methods

In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging serial pelvic magnetic resonance imaging was performed in men without prostate cancer beginning in 1993. From this population we retrospectively identified 278 men with 2 or more magnetic resonance imaging determined prostate volume measurements to examine differential growth rates in a cohort of community men over time.

Results

Median age was 58 years and median prostate size was 28 cc at study entry. At a median followup of 4.3 years prostate size increased in 61.9% and remained stable or decreased in 38.1% of men. The median rate of volume change was 0.6 cc per year (range -9.9 to 62.1), corresponding to a median growth rate of 2.5% per year (range -29.2 to 176.4%). During followup 64.6% of men with an initial prostate size less than 40 cc had prostate growth compared to only 50.9% of men with an initial prostate size of 40 cc or greater.

Conclusions

These results suggest that changes in prostate size are highly variable among aging men. Although benign prostatic hyperplasia is common, a considerable proportion of aging men have a stable or decreasing prostate size. Further research is needed to identify the underlying mechanism for such differences in prostate growth.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116DYeMN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN principles of active surveillance — confirmation of candidacy: Goals of confirmation testing are to help facilitate early identification of patients who may be at a higher risk of grade reclassification or cancer progression, and because an initial prostate biopsy may underestimate tumor grade or volume, confirmatory testing is strongly recommended for patients who are considering active surveillance. A repeat biopsy is a routine component of confirmatory testing, and the timing can be based on the patient's risk of progression so that patients with a higher risk should have a repeat biopsy earlier than those with a lower risk. If the initial prostate biopsy was performed without mpMRI guidance, the Panel recommends an earlier repeat biopsy (eg, within the first 6–12 months) and recommends mpMRI prior to the biopsy, and a systematic biopsy should be included. For most patients, the timing is generally within 6 to 24 months of diagnostic biopsy, but all patients on active surveillance should undergo a confirmatory prostate biopsy within 3 years of their diagnostic biopsy, irrespective of prior mpMRI findings. Confirmatory testing should also include mpMRI with calculation of PSA density, advanced risk stratification tools lack high level evidence to obviate other testing at this time, and other forms of imaging are discouraged.

### Small prostate size and high grade disease – biology or artifact? [^112n2XrV]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prior radical prostatectomy series have shown an inverse association between prostate size and high grade cancer. It has been suggested that smaller size prostates arise in a low androgen environment, enabling development of more aggressive cancer. We propose that this observation is the result of ascertainment bias driven by prostate specific antigen performance.

Materials and Methods

We identified 1,404 patients from the Stanford Radical Prostatectomy Database with clinical stage T1c (723) and T2 (681) disease who underwent surgery between 1988 and 2002, and underwent detailed morphometric mapping by a single pathologist. Multivariate linear regression was performed to assess for the effects of age, prostate weight and prostate specific antigen on total and high grade (Gleason grade 4/5) cancer volume and percentage of high grade disease.

Results

In patients who underwent biopsy due to abnormal prostate specific antigen (stage T1c), prostate weight was negatively associated (p = 0.0002) with total cancer volume, volume of high grade disease and percentage of high grade disease. For patients who underwent biopsy based on abnormal digital rectal examination (stage T2) these associations were not observed.

Conclusions

Improved prostate specific antigen performance for high grade disease results in ascertainment bias in patients with T1c disease. Thus, the association between prostate size and high grade disease may be a consequence of grade dependent performance of prostate specific antigen rather than true tumor biology.

### PRECISE version 2: updated recommendations for reporting prostate magnetic resonance imaging in patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer [^117Xhtis]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

The Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) recommendations standardise the reporting of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients on active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer. An international consensus group recently updated these recommendations and identified the areas of uncertainty.

Methods

A panel of 38 experts used the formal RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method consensus methodology. Panellists scored 193 statements using a 1–9 agreement scale, where 9 means full agreement. A summary of agreement, uncertainty, or disagreement (derived from the group median score) and consensus (determined using the Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry method) was calculated for each statement and presented for discussion before individual rescoring.

Key Findings and Limitations

Participants agreed that MRI scans must meet a minimum image quality standard (median 9) or be given a score of 'X' for insufficient quality. The current scan should be compared with both baseline and previous scans (median 9), with the PRECISE score being the maximum from any lesion (median 8). PRECISE 3 (stable MRI) was subdivided into 3-V (visible) and 3-NonV (nonvisible) disease (median 9). Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System/Likert ≥ 3 lesions should be measured on T2-weighted imaging, using other sequences to aid in the identification (median 8), and whenever possible, reported pictorially (diagrams, screenshots, or contours; median 9). There was no consensus on how to measure tumour size. More research is needed to determine a significant size increase (median 9). PRECISE 5 was clarified as progression to stage ≥ T3a (median 9).

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The updated PRECISE recommendations reflect expert consensus opinion on minimal standards and reporting criteria for prostate MRI in AS.

### The correlation between body mass index and prostate volume: a retrospective analysis of pre and postoperative measurements in prostate cancer patients [^111nWBZB]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

This study provides evidence for a positive linear association between BMI and prostate volume, highlighting the importance of considering BMI in prostate volume assessments. The findings suggest that increased BMI is associated with larger prostate volumes, which may have significant implications for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of BPH and prostate cancer. Understanding the relationship between BMI and prostate volume can help clinicians improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics, including body weight. Furthermore, weight management strategies may represent a valuable approach to reducing the risk of prostate enlargement and its associated symptoms, thereby improving the quality of life for patients with BPH.

### Volume of the normal prostate gland in Polish boys, aged 1–17 years: based on transabdominal ultrasound-prospective study [^1126xaqE]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Until now, there are no established norms for prostate size in children. Prostate volume during development has been analyzed in small study groups. In diagnostic imaging, transabdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are used.

Aims

To establish prostate volume norms for individuals aged 1–17 years using transabdominal ultrasound.

Study Design

Between 2021 and 2023, transabdominal prostate ultrasound was performed on 482 Caucasian boys, aged 1–17 years, who were patients of the urology clinic. Normative data were based on results of 345 boys with normal lower urinary tract, urethral and penile structures. Patients with abnormal external genitalia, Prune Belly Syndrome, Myelomeningocele, chromosomal disorders, or prostate abnormalities found in ultrasound were excluded from the study. Patient eligibility was determined based on medical records and physical examinations. During ultrasound, height, anterior-posterior dimension, and width of prostate were assessed. Prostate volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula VH × L(AP) × W × 0.523. Measurements were correlated with age, weight, and height. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, statistical significance tests for means, and correlation methods. After estimating preliminary results, taking into account the development periods, patients were divided into age groups: 1–4 years (n = 70), 5–10 years (n = 124), 11–12 years (n = 43), 13–15 years (n = 65), and 16–17 years (n = 43).

Results

The table and nomogram shows prostate volumes based on age. Prostate size remains stable up to the age of 8. We noticed a transitional phase at the age of 8–11 years. A significant increase in volume occurs over 11 years of age. There was a statistically significant relationship between prostate size, age, height, and weight.

Discusion

Established norms can serve as a reference for prostate analysis in patients with defects of the genitourinary system. An interesting analysis would be a prostate size assessment in relation to stage of development on Tanner scale.

Conclusion

Transabdominal ultrasound, being a non-invasive, painless, and readily accessible examination, allows assessment of prostate size even in boys aged 1 year old. A statistically significant relationship was found between prostate size, weight, and height. Norms for prostate size in boys were established according to age.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116CS98Q]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Active surveillance — factors guiding transition to treatment — notes that PSA doubling time (PSADT) is not considered reliable enough to be used alone to detect disease progression; if repeat biopsy shows Grade Group ≥ 3 disease, or if tumor is found in a greater number or higher percentage of cores, cancer progression may have occurred. Grade reclassification on repeat biopsy is the most common factor influencing a change in management from active surveillance to treatment, and other factors include increase in tumor volume, a rise in PSA density, and patient anxiety, with considerations for change made in the context of the patient's life expectancy.

### The progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia: examining the evidence and determining the risk [^113F8Bod]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is often associated with enlargement of the prostate gland, lower urinary tract symptoms, decreased urinary flow and a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, if the symptoms associated with BPH are left untreated, serious complications, such as acute urinary retention, may ensue. Evidence is emerging from long-term clinical studies to suggest that BPH is a progressive disease, with some patients progressing much more rapidly than others.

Objective

This article aims to explore the natural history of BPH progression from a molecular, pathological and clinical perspective, with emphasis on the key clinical evidence to support the progressive nature of this disease. How our increased understanding of the disease and of the risk factors for BPH progression might be applied to improve current management practices are also discussed.

Conclusion

Strategies to identify patients most at risk and guidelines directed towards long-term management, in addition to short-term treatment, may be useful in helping to prevent BPH progression.

### Improving ultrasound-based prostate volume estimation [^113S3GSQ]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study showed that measurements done by experienced ultrasonographers using TRUS as compared to our pathologists' measurements by ruler on the same prostate in the fresh setting, underestimated height (4.0 cm vs. 3.6 cm) as well as length (4.1 cm vs. 3.7 cm), while the width was similar in both cases (4.7 cm vs. 4.8 cm). These findings are slightly different than that of an earlier report carried out on 87 prostates, which indicated an underestimation of height using TRUS vs. pathological dimensions (3.2 cm vs. 3.7 cm), and width (4.8 cm vs. 5.2 cm) but no difference in length.

Our study also demonstrated that the ellipsoid formula underestimates prostate volume by a mean of 18% when using TRUS imaging. The extent of underestimation of TRUS-measured prostate volume using the ellipsoid formula has been reported in a prior study to be greater than 10% and shown to underestimate true prostate volumes 80% of the time. In comparison, analyses with our coefficient in the formula (V = H × L × W × 0.66) provides a more accurate estimate of prostate volumes with an overestimation of 5.7%. In addition, a larger study comparing TRUS estimation of prostate volumes using the ellipsoid formula with 318 prostatectomy specimens showed a 9.1% underestimation for prostates with a mean volume of 37.3 cc. Once more, the prostates in the latter study were smaller than in our series, 11 cc less than the average 48.1 cc prostates we studied. Also, it is important to emphasize that in that study the measurements of the prostatectomy specimens were retrieved retrospectively from pathology reports as opposed to the prospective nature in our study focused on true prostate volume determination. Furthermore, it is unclear whether seminal vesicles were removed, measurements were done on fresh vs. fixed specimens, or if there were one or several health care professionals measuring prostate dimensions and recording data. A main limitation in all studies, including our own, is that TRUS data for prostate dimensions and volumes were retrieved from patient medical charts since it was part of routine tests done in the clinic and not part of a prospective research project. Finally, Scott et al. evaluated the reliability of total prostate and transition zone volume measurements by TRUS among three examiners with various levels of experience and, as expected, found that more experienced examiners had better reproducibility.

### Association between PSA density and pathologically significant prostate cancer: the impact of prostate volume [^111QouAB]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) is mainly based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood levels and digital rectal examination. However, this approach may result in a high rate of negative biopsies and increased detection of clinically insignificant PCa (CS-PCa). An important prognostic biomarker, PSA density (PSA-D) demonstrated improved performance in PCa detection compared to PSA. The relationship between prostate volume and the prognostic accuracy of PSA-D remains mostly unclear. The aim of our study is to investigate the PSA-D predictive value of CS-PCa detection at different prostate volumes.

Methods

Using our local radical prostatectomy registry, patients were divided into three prostate size subgroups based on preoperative sonographic prostate volume assessment: less than 50, 50–75, and more than 75cc. Patients' and PCa characteristics were recorded, including age, body mass index, PSA at diagnosis, prostate volume, PSA-D, D'Amico risk classification, Gleason grade group, and pathological staging following surgery.

Results

The study cohort included 364 patients who underwent Robotic Radical prostatectomy for biopsy-proven clinically localized PCa. 221 (61%) and 143 (39%) patients had PSA-D less than 0.15 and PSA-D more than 0.15, respectively. ISUP GG 1–2 PCa (CS-PCa) was observed in 220 patients (60%), while 144 (40%) had ISUP GG 3–5 PCa at final pathology. PSA-D correlated with CS-PCa only in small and medium-size prostates, but not in large glands (p = .03, p = .01, and p = .36, respectively). The highest sensitivity (72.7%) was observed in small prostates, compared to 3.2% in large prostates. The highest specificity (89.4%) was noted in large prostates. Positive predictive value in small and medium-size prostates was similar (~50%), compared to 20% in large glands. The negative predictive value was slightly better for small and medium-size prostates compared with large glands (68.9%, 73.7%, and 53.1%, respectively). An association between PSA-D and harboring CS-PCa was detected only in small and medium-size glands (72.7% and 43%, respectively).

Conclusion

PSA-D is associated with CS-PCa detection in radical prostatectomy specimens in small and medium-size prostates. The level of PSA-D is directly associated with the ISUP PCa grade group. Therefore, PSA-D is a beneficial, available, and cost-effective tool during decision-making in patients with small and medium-size prostate when considering treatment for PCa.

### Prostate volume: does it predict patient outcomes following prostate artery embolisation? A retrospective cohort study [^114WyRFE]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate artery embolisation (PAE) was first described in 2000 but has recently gained in popularity as a minimally invasive alternative for managing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is characterised by non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland. This enlargement can impinge on the urethra, leading to a spectrum of LUTS that significantly affect the quality of life, including increased frequency, urgency, a weakened stream, and nocturia. LUTS are widespread, and becomes more prevalent with age, affecting up to 90% of men above 80 years.

Traditionally, treatment options have ranged from medication to various forms of surgery, each with its own set of risks and benefits. PAE offers a novel approach by targeting the arteries supplying the prostate to reduce its size and alleviate symptoms. The procedure involves the catheter-based introduction of embolic materials to obstruct the prostatic arteries, thereby reducing blood flow and causing the prostate to shrink.

The attractiveness of PAE lies in the elimination of hospital stays, reduction in typical surgical risks, and a lower likelihood of sexual health complications such as retrograde ejaculation or erectile dysfunction. Additionally, PAE is often performed under local anaesthesia, reducing the risks associated with general anaesthesia.

The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is an essential tool in the clinical assessment of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As a validated questionnaire, the IPSS allows patients to self-report the severity of their symptoms, providing a subjective measure that helps clinicians in both diagnosing BPH and determining its impact on the patient's quality of life. While the IPSS is useful for patient selection for PAE, it is intrinsically subjective and does not incorporate volume measurements.

### Establishing normal reference ranges for prostate volume change with age in the population-based krimpen-study: prediction of future prostate volume in individual men [^116eHnQn]. The Prostate (2007). Low credibility.

Background

We aim to establish the normal pattern of prostate volume change with age to provide a baseline from which accelerated prostate growth might be identified in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH).

Methods

In a community-based study, prostate volume was determined at baseline and after 2.1 and 4.2 years in men without prostate cancer. A bivariate multilevel growth curve model was used to estimate the pattern of change of prostate volume with age.

Results

The average percentage increase of total prostate volume and transition zone volume per year of follow-up was 2.2% and 3.5%, respectively. The final model showed that prostate volume was related to age only. The future prostate volume of an individual can be predicted based on his age and known history of prostate volume. The model was also used to calculate time needed for the prostate volume to increase with a certain percentage, for men with different baseline prostate volume values at different ages.

Conclusions

This method establishes normal prostate volume values by age using prostate volume history in men without prostate cancer. The model provides baseline data from which disease progression might be detected.

### A randomized trial on accelerated versus standard small-margin radiation schedule in patients with prostate cancer treated with combined brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy: toxicity outcomes and patterns of prostate movement [^114m7wrW]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In patients with localized prostate cancer, different treatment options as radiation therapy and prostatectomy with comparable results in terms of survival are available. The choice between these treatment options depends mainly on personal preferences and on differences in the pattern and frequency of anticipated side effects.

Considering radiation therapy with curative intention in prostate cancer, both randomized and real-world evidence support the superiority of combined external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in terms of prognosis, especially in high-risk patients as those with poorly differentiated prostate cancers (Gleason score ≥ 9).

Delivering EBRT as hypofractionated schedules has the potential to be resource-efficient for health care and more convenient for patients. Besides, hypofractionated schedules have some theoretical advantages in terms of biologic effectiveness for tissues with low α/β ratio as several studies have shown for prostate cancer. In fact, ultrahypofractionated EBRT has been shown to be safe and as effective as normal fractionated EBRT in patients with prostate cancer.

When hypofractionated EBRT is planned, it is essential to ensure that the target volume is strictly defined to achieve high dose coverage to target without increasing the dose in organs-at-risk. In this equation, the choice of margin is the parameter that impacts the target volume the most. Taking prostate gland (simplifying its shape as spherical) as an example, a 7 mm margin (commonly used in clinical practice for hypofractionated EBRT) to an organ with 4 cm diameter would result in an increased target volume from 34 cm³ (which corresponds to a normal-sized prostate) to 82 cm³. If we have the possibility to reduce the margin to 3 mm, the volume will be only 51 cm³, which theoretically reduces the risk of radiation dose to toxicity-sensitive tissues that surround the prostate. In fact, reduced margins have been shown to be associated with less treatment-related toxicity.

A hypofractionated treatment with a small margin of 3 mm requires high precision and thorough assessment of intrafractional prostate movements to ensure high dose coverage to target volume. By using a system that measures the movements of the prostate in real time, unacceptably large movements can be immediately detected.

### Finasteride [^116wxWVf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect on Prostate Volume

In a long-term efficacy and safety study, prostate volume was assessed yearly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of patients. In patients treated with finasteride who remained on therapy, prostate volume was reduced compared with both baseline and placebo throughout the 4-year study. Finasteride decreased prostate volume by 17.9% (from 55.9 cc at baseline to 45.8 cc at 4 years) compared with an increase of 14.1% (from 51.3 cc to 58.5 cc) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). (See Figure 4.)

Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in a long-term efficacy and safety study. Mean prostate volume at baseline ranged between 40 to 50 cc. The reduction in prostate volume was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional five years of open extension studies.

Prostate Volume as a Predictor of Therapeutic Response

A meta-analysis combining 1-year data from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of similar design, including 4491 patients with symptomatic BPH, demonstrated that, in patients treated with finasteride, the magnitude of symptom response and degree of improvement in maximum urinary flow rate were greater in patients with an enlarged prostate at baseline.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and cancer risk — historical thresholds and biopsy-era findings: A PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was accepted as the upper limit of normal, but prostate cancer rates were significant at lower PSA levels (between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL), and men with PSA levels < 2.5 ng/mL were believed to have low risk. With biopsies performed across all PSA levels, PSA "should not be considered 'elevated' or 'normal', because prostate cancer was identified at all levels of PSA, including values < 1.0 ng/mL", and "the higher the PSA, the higher the risk of cancer", with aggressive cancers identified at higher levels.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116jH7GX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — principles of imaging address goals, modalities, and imaging frequency. Imaging is performed for the detection and characterization of disease to select treatment or guide change in disease management, with anatomic imaging techniques including ultrasound, CT, and MRI and functional imaging techniques including radionuclide bone scan, PET/CT, and advanced MRI techniques, such as spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For patients with early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence/recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP), the utility of imaging depends on risk group, pathologic Gleason grade and stage, PSA, and PSA doubling time (PSADT) after recurrence, and the frequency of imaging should be based on individual risk, age, PSADT, Gleason score, and overall health. Bone scans are rarely positive in asymptomatic patients with PSA < 10 ng/mL, and bone imaging should be performed more frequently when PSADT is ≤ 8 months. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### To biopsy or not biopsy, that is the question-PI-RADS 3 prostate lesions-validation of clinical and radiological parameters for biopsy decision-making [^111H6C4g]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

From August 2014 to September 2024, we identified 709 patients with normal findings on digital rectal examination (DRE) who underwent MRI-ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsies at our institution. To ensure analytical precision, 38 patients were excluded: 10 due to prior definitive prostate treatments (e.g. radiation or focal therapy), and 28 due to incomplete documentation.

Consequently, a final cohort of 671 patients with 981 PI-RADS 3 lesions was eligible for thorough inclusion and analysis. Median patient age was 65.44 years, consistent with the target population for prostate cancer screening. The median PSA level was 8.95 ng/ml, and median prostate volume was 61.2 mL.

Patient and lesion characteristics, along with detection rates, are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Characteristics of patients and targets

Notably, 351 patients (52.6%) had no prior prostate biopsy. The remaining 320 patients (47.4%) had undergone at least one transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy prior to the MRI-US fusion biopsy, with a mean of 0.80 procedures (range: 0–7). A table with the number of prior biopsies is provided in the Supplementary Appendix as table S2. Older patients exhibited significantly larger prostate volumes (p < 0.01), higher PSA levels (p < 0.01), and were more frequently referred for biopsy based on elevated PSA rather than abnormal digital rectal examination findings (p < 0.01).

Overall detection

The overall detection rate per target, was 36.9% (362/981 targets). The rate of clinically significant cancers was 15.8% in correlation with the entire cohort (155 csPCa/981 all targets), and 42.8% in correlation to all detected cancers (155 csPCa/362 all cancers). When analyzing the detection rates of all prostate carcinomas and clinically significant prostate carcinomas in relation to potentially influencing variables, notable differences emerge, suggesting variable-dependent diagnostic sensitivity (Table 1; Figs. 1 and 2, supplementary appendix figure S1).

### Understanding the relationship between tumor size, gland size, and disease aggressiveness in men with prostate cancer [^116kYBzn]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relationship between prostate gland and tumor volume in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. We hypothesized that larger tumors within smaller prostate glands are associated with more aggressive disease characteristics.

Methods

Records of patients undergoing RP from 2000–2008 at a single institution were reviewed retrospectively. The dominant nodule was considered to be the largest focus of cancer within the prostate, and the dominant nodule-to-prostate volume ratio (DNVR) was calculated according to the ratio of the dominant nodule volume to the gland weight. Cox regression was performed to assess the relationship between DNVR and both pathologic outcomes (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical score) and biochemical recurrence (BCR).

Results

At a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 174 patients (7.2%) suffered BCR. There was no linear correlation between tumor volume and gland size (R = -0.09). DNVR above the median (≥ 0.033 cc/gm) was closely associated with high clinicopathologic risk as measured by Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical score (hazard ratio, 35.53; 95% confidence interval, 14.42–87.55 for high- vs low-risk groups). In the univariable analysis, both tumor diameter and DNVR were associated with increased risk of BCR. However, in the multivariable model, only tumor diameter remained a significant predictor of BCR (hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–3.91).

Conclusion

Increased DNVR appears to be a characteristic of aggressive prostate tumors, although it did not predict BCR in the present study. However, these data support the association between tumor diameter and BCR after RP for prostate cancer independent of other key clinicopathologic features.

### Improving ultrasound-based prostate volume estimation [^114rnpok]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our prospective study on freshly obtained prostates as the reference defines a coefficient of 0.66 to be superior in estimating prostate volume in the eq. V = L × H × W × Coefficient when using TRUS. This new coefficient not only provides a more accurate estimation of true prostate volumes than the universally established ellipsoid coefficient, but also supports the suggestion that the prostate shape is closer to that of a bullet.

### The association between body size, prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen [^115YKaBX]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Increasing prostate volume contributes to urinary tract symptoms and may obscure prostate cancer detection. We investigated the association between obesity and prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA density among 753 men referred for prostate biopsy. Among men with a negative biopsy, prostate volume significantly increased approximately 25% from the lowest to highest body mass index (BMI), waist or hip circumference or height categories. PSA was 0.7 ng/ml lower with a high waist-to-hip ratio. These associations were less consistent among subjects diagnosed with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer. Our data suggest that obesity and height are independently associated with prostate volume.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and PSA density — risk assessment and thresholds are characterized as follows: Higher PSA level was associated with increased risks of biochemical recurrence, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality, and overall PSA level was deemed to be an important risk factor that should be assessed, documented, and used to categorize patient risk; the Panel did not include PSA density (serum PSA [ng/mL] divided by imaging measured prostate volume [cc]) in the systematic review, but an ad-hoc review demonstrated that a PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cc has been associated with the risk of upgrading on subsequent biopsy among patients on active surveillance; the Panel believes that PSA density remains an important component of disease risk assessment and recognizes the continuous nature of risk with PSA density values, cautioning against use of threshold values in isolation for management decision-making.

### Prostate specific antigen density correlates with features of prostate cancer aggressiveness [^113ehxKw]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

An increased prostate specific antigen density (serum prostate specific antigen divided by prostate volume) is an established parameter to help determine the need to perform prostate biopsies. A man with a high prostate specific antigen and a normal size prostate gland is more likely to have cancer than a man with the same prostate specific antigen and a large gland. Prostate specific antigen in relation to prostate size should also reflect the volume of cancer in the gland. One group defined clinically unimportant prostate cancer as tumor volume less than 0.5 cc, organ confined disease and Gleason less than 7. Another group noted that at the time of biopsy, a prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/cc combined with low risk clinical tumor features predicted insignificant cancer. There are limited published validating data on the association of prostate specific antigen density with the criteria for prostate cancer aggressiveness. We tested the association of prostate specific antigen density with features of tumor aggressiveness in a screened and in a nonscreened cohort of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.

Materials and Methods

The screened patient cohort included 1,280 patients with screen detected prostate cancer treated from 1990 to 2002 at Washington University, and the nonscreened cohort included 382 patients treated from 2003 to 2004 at Northwestern University. We recorded the clinical and pathological tumor parameters in a prospective database. Parameters evaluated were pathological tumor stage, Gleason sum, tumor volume, biochemical progression and the previously mentioned 2 criteria for clinically unimportant cancers. We grouped patients into 4 prostate specific antigen density categories of less than 0.1, 0.1 to 0.14, 0.15 to 0.19 and greater than 0.19 ng/ml/cc.

Results

There was a significant trend for worsening clinicopathological prognostic features as prostate specific antigen density increased. There were 357 (82%), 283 (75%), 171 (75%) and 192 (55%) men with organ confined disease with clear surgical margins if prostate specific antigen density was less than 0.1, 0.1 to 0.14, 0.15 to 0.19 and greater than 0.19 ng/ml/cc, respectively (p < 0.001). There were 86 (20%), 102 (27%), 64 (28%) and 157 (45%) men with a Gleason sum greater than 7 when grouped into each increasing PSA density category, respectively (p < 0.001). There were 91 (21%), 91 (25%), 74 (33%) and 157 (46%) men with a total cancer volume greater than 0.5 cc when grouped into each increasing PSA density category, respectively (p < 0.001). Prostate specific antigen velocity was greater than 2 ng/ml per year in 11%, 30%, 27% and 46% of men if prostate specific antigen density was less than 0.1, 0.1 to 0.14, 0.15 to 0.19 and greater than 0.19 ng/ml/cc, respectively (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Prostate specific antigen density measurements are useful in helping to determine the aggressiveness of clinically localized prostate cancer, and can be used as an adjunct in predicting insignificant cancer and outcomes after local therapy.

### Definition of enlarged prostate-national cancer institute… [^1141Y7sE]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

enlarged prostateListen to pronunciationA benign condition in which the prostate gland is larger than normal. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and urethra, which can slow or block the flow of urine from the bladder. This can cause urinary symptoms, such as feeling a need to urinate often or right away, waking up many times during the night to urinate, trouble urinating, leaking urine, pain during urination or after ejaculation, and blood in the urine. An enlarged prostate does not increase a person's risk of developing prostate cancer. However, if not treated, it can lead to a weak bladder, urinary retention, urinary tract infections, bladder stones, or bladder or kidney damage. An enlarged prostate is most common in older men. Also called benign prostatic hyperplasia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and BPH.

### Multiple repeat prostate biopsies and the detection of clinically insignificant cancer in men with large prostates [^117Mtsgo]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the impact of repeating prostate biopsies on the risk of detecting clinically insignificant prostate cancer (PCa) in larger prostate glands.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study using patients enrolled in our institutional PCa registry from 1991 to 2008 to assess the association of prostate volume and clinically insignificant PCa in men undergoing multiple prostate biopsies. Patients were stratified by prostate volume into 2 cohorts (< 50 cm(3) or ≥ 50 cm(3)). Additionally, patients were stratified by prostate biopsy on which PCa was identified (1 biopsy or ≥ 3 biopsies).

Results

Within the subgroup of patients with prostate volume ≥ 50 cm(3) requiring ≥ 3 biopsies before cancer diagnosis, 72.6% (45/62) had pathologic Gleason scores ≤ 6 and 81.6% (49/60) had an estimated tumor volume of ≤ 10% at the time of radical prostatectomy. This was significantly different from patients with prostate volume < 50 cm(3) diagnosed on their first biopsy, in which only 48.5% (656/1349) were found to have Gleason scores ≤ 6 and 54.2% (705/1300) had estimated tumor volume ≤ 10% (P < .01). There was no significant difference in the rate of Gleason score upgrading at time of prostatectomy between any of the subgroups.

Conclusion

PCas detected in men with prostatic enlargement requiring multiple biopsies are more likely to be low-grade, low-volume tumors at final pathology than men without prostate enlargement. Men with larger prostates who have already had prior negative biopsies should be counseled regarding the increased risk of detecting clinically insignificant PCa with additional biopsies.

Scoring criteria for PPS

Abbreviations: PPS prostate-pelvic syndrome

The diagnostic criteria for type-III prostatitis (based on the prostatitis classification system published by NIH in 1995 and the Chinese version of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome) are as follows: (a) clinical symptoms (required item): mainly manifested as recurrent pelvic pain or discomfort, and/or LUTS of abnormal urination, with or without sexual dysfunction, with a course of more than 3 months; (b) routine urine (required item): urinalysis before prostate massage is normal; (c) prostate palpation (required item): the gland is full, normal in size or enlarged, with a tough or uneven texture, or has inflammatory nodules, which may have localized tenderness; (d) EPS routine (required item): the characteristic of inflammatory type is that under the microscope, the white blood cell count in EPS is ≥ 10/HP, and the phospholipids bodies in EPS decrease or disappear; (e) urine bacterial culture is negative before and after prostate massage (recommended item); (f) ultrasound examination (optional item): the size of the prostate is normal or slightly reduced or slightly larger, the internal echo is normal or uneven, with or without prostate calcification, and the echo of the prostate capsule is enhanced, rough, thickened or unclear.

The diagnostic criteria for PPS are different from those for traditional type-III prostatitis in that PPS removes LUTPL and invasive EPS tests, and diagnoses prostate diseases through symptoms of type-III prostatitis, non-invasive routine urine test, and male urinary system ultrasound examination. The flow chart of patients ultimately included in the analysis of this study was shown in Fig. 1.

### Entender los cambios de la próstata-national cancer institute… [^113qqXZk]. NCI (2014). Low credibility.

Acerca de la próstata y los cambios en la próstata La próstata es parte del aparato reproductor masculino. La próstata suele agrandarse a medida que el hombre envejece. Cuando los hombres tienen entre 20 y 30 años, la próstata normal es del tamaño de una nuez. Cuando un hombre tiene 40 años, es posible que la próstata se haya agrandado un poco. A los 60 años, la próstata suele ser del tamaño de un limón. El riesgo de problemas de próstata, como la HPB y el cáncer de próstata, aumenta con la edad. Si en la prueba de PSA se observa que la concentración del PSA es alta, el médico le explicará los próximos pasos. Estas son algunas causas de la concentración alta del PSA:
- Afecciones benignas de la próstata
- Infecciones de las vías urinarias
- Un examen digital del recto reciente

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^112peXCu]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

AUA/SUO early detection — PSA density thresholds and test impact: Higher PSA density (serum PSA [ng/mL] divided by imaging measures of prostate volume [cc]) is associated with the risk of identifying clinically significant prostate cancer on biopsy, and lower thresholds such as PSA density ≥ 0.07 have higher sensitivity but lower specificity than higher thresholds such as PSA density ≥ 0.15. PSA density is an important component of disease risk assessment when imaging is available for volume measurement, but the Panel recognizes the continuous nature of risk and cautions against use of threshold values in isolation for management decision-making. In general, these tests are calibrated such that avoiding biopsy reduces biopsies by about one third with delayed detection or non-detection of 5% to 10% clinically significant prostate cancers, and as in the PSA screening setting, the use of SDM (shared decision making) is highly recommended given the uncertainty.

### Gross tumor volume and clinical target volume in prostate cancer: how do satellites relate to the index lesion [^117L7ayq]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is an increasing interest for dose differentiation in prostate radiotherapy. The purpose of our study was to analyze the spatial distribution of tumor satellites inside the prostate.

Methods and Materials

61 prostatectomy specimens were stained with H&E. Tumor regions were delineated by the uro-pathologist. Volumes, distances and cell densities of all delineated tumor regions were measured and further analyzed.

Results

Multifocal disease was seen in 84% of the patients. The median number of tumor foci was 3. The median distance between the index lesion and the satellites was 1.0 cm, with a maximum of 4.4 cm. The index lesions accounted for 88% of the total tumor volume. The contribution of tumor foci < 0.1 cm³ to the total tumor volume was 2%. The median cell density of the index lesion and all satellites, regardless of size, were significantly higher than that of the prostate.

Conclusions

Satellites do not appear in a limited margin around the index lesion (GTV). Consequently, a fixed CTV margin would not effectively cover all satellites. Thus if the aim is to treat all tumor foci, the entire prostate gland should be considered CTV.

### Improving ultrasound-based prostate volume estimation [^112mqMzn]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate volume is an important parameter used by clinicians to better manage patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or cancer. The increase in prostate volume with age is correlated with the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which can potentially obstruct the bladder outlet, and necessitate interventions. Knowing the volume of the prostate can help surgeons decide on pharmacological treatments or possibly optimal surgical modalities to resect sufficient prostatic tissue to relieve or improve LUTS. Moreover, the prostate volume is of utility in prostate cancer detection and management as it can be used in conjunction with serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA) to define the PSA density, a clinically relevant parameter for decision-making. In addition, the measurement of prostatic volume is also required in other fields such as radiation oncology, as patients might not be deemed candidates for brachytherapy or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) if prostate volumes are > 60 cc and > 80 cc, respectively. Hence, estimating the actual prostate volume with accuracy is required for proper medical and surgical management of prostatic diseases as well as for ablative procedures.

Ultrasonography, and more specifically transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), is the most commonly used tool to estimate prostate volume. The ultrasonograph computes the total volume by measuring the length (L), height (H) and width (W) of the gland and multiplying the product by a coefficient of π /6 (0.52), also known as the prolate ellipsoid formula. The same formula can also be used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities for the estimation of prostate volume. Another geometrical model known as the bullet formula (L × H × W × 5 π /24) or (L × H × W × 0.65) was proposed in 2009 as a potentially superior formula in estimating prostatic volume. Interestingly, existing studies examining the accuracy of these methods in measuring true prostate volume have reported conflicting evidence as to which formula is more accurate. For instance, Lee et al. had concluded that the ellipsoid formula is adequate and accurate enough in estimating prostatic volume using either TRUS or MRI. However, Rodriguez et al. rather concluded that the ellipsoid formula consistently underestimates prostate size by more than 10% at least 80% of the time. Furthermore, and in support of the latter findings, MacMahon et al. have demonstrated that the ellipsoid formula, on average, underestimated prostate volume by 17%.

### Influence of prostate volume and percent free prostate specific antigen on prostate cancer detection in men with a total prostate specific antigen of 2.6 to 10.0 ng / mL [^115btXeL]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Percent free prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density have been independently shown to increase the specificity of prostate cancer screening in men with prostate specific antigen levels between 4.1 and 10.0 ng/ml. Recent data suggest the total prostate specific antigen cutoff for performing a biopsy should be 2.6 ng/ml. We assessed the influence of percent free prostate specific antigen and prostate volume on cancer detection in men with a prostate specific antigen between 2.6 and 10.0 ng/ml.

Materials and Methods

From 1991 to 2005 all transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies (5,587) for abnormal digital rectal examination and/or increased age specific prostate specific antigen were evaluated. A total of 1,072 patients with a prostate specific antigen between 2.6 and 10.0 ng/ml and any percent free prostate specific antigen were included in study. The cancer detection rate was calculated for each percent free prostate specific antigen/volume stratum.

Results

Prostate cancer was detected in 296 patients (27.6%). The mean age and prostate specific antigen of the patients with benign pathology and prostate cancer were similar. Mean percent free prostate specific antigen was 17.5% and 14.1% (p > 0.05), and the mean volume was 62.0 and 46.0 cc (p = 0.001), respectively. The strongest risk factors for a positive biopsy were percent free prostate specific antigen (odds ratio 0.004, p < 0.001), volume (OR 0.977, p < 0.001) and digital rectal examination (OR 1.765, p = 0.007), but not total prostate specific antigen (p = 0.303). When stratified by volume and percent free prostate specific antigen, distinct risk groups were identified. The probability of detecting cancer inversely correlated with prostate volume and percent free prostate specific antigen.

Conclusions

In men with prostate specific antigen levels between 2.6 and 10.0 ng/ml, the probability of detecting cancer was inversely proportional to prostate volume and percent free prostate specific antigen. This table may assist in predicting patient risk for harboring prostate cancer.

Comparison of measured and TRUS-estimated prostate dimensions

The next step was to examine differences in individual prostate dimensions according to the method used to obtain them. We compared each dimension (L, H, W) estimated by ultrasound prior to surgery vs. the same respective prostate dimensions measured post-surgery from our initial cohort of 153 patients. This comparison is shown in Fig. 4. We observed that the mean length of the prostate was overestimated by 10.8% using ultrasound (4.1 cm vs. 3.7 cm) (p < 0.05). The mean height was overestimated using TRUS by 11.1% (4.0 cm vs. 3.6 cm) (p < 0.05). Finally, the width of the gland estimated by TRUS was fairly similar to the measured value (4.7 cm vs. 4.8 cm) (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Our data demonstrated no statistically significant difference in IPSS improvement of small volume prostates (< 51 mL) compared to large volume.

### Comparison of PI-RADS versions 2.0 and 2.1 for MRI-based calculation of the prostate volume [^11182MQo]. Academic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Prostate gland volume (PGV) should be routinely included in MRI reports of the prostate. The recently updated Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.1 includes a change in the recommended measurement method for PGV compared to version 2.0. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the agreement of MRI-based PGV calculations with the volumetric manual slice-by-slice prostate segmentation as a reference standard using the linear measurements per PI-RADS versions 2.0 and 2.1. Furthermore, to assess inter-reader agreement for the different measurement approaches, determine the influence of an enlarged transition zone on measurement accuracy and to assess the value of the bullet formula for PGV calculation.

Materials and Methods

Ninety-five consecutive treatment-naive patients undergoing prostate MRI were retrospectively analyzed. Prostates were manually contoured and segmented on axial T2-weighted images. Four different radiologists independently measured the prostate in three dimensions according to PI-RADS v2.0 and v2.1, respectively. MRI-based PGV was calculated using the ellipsoid and bullet formulas. Calculated volumes were compared to the reference manual segmentations using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Inter-reader agreement was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results

Inter-reader agreement was excellent for the ellipsoid and bullet formulas using PI-RADS v2.0 (ICC 0.985 and 0.987) and v2.1 (ICC 0.990 and 0.994), respectively. The median difference from the reference standard using the ellipsoid formula derived PGV was 0.4 mL (interquartile range, -3.9 to 5.1 mL) for PI-RADS v2.0 (p = 0.393) and 2.6 mL (interquartile range, -1.6 to 7.3 mL) for v2.1 (p < 0.001) with a median difference of 2.2 mL. The bullet formula overestimated PGV by a median of 13.3 mL using PI-RADS v2.0 (p < 0.001) and 16.0 mL using v2.1 (p < 0.001). In the presence of an enlarged transition zone the PGV tended to be higher than the reference standard for PI-RADS v2.0 (median difference of 4.7 mL; p = 0.018) and for v2.1 (median difference of 5.7 mL, p < 0.001) using the ellipsoid formula.

Conclusion

Inter-reader agreement was excellent for the calculated PGV for both methods. PI-RADS v2.0 measurements with the ellipsoid formula yielded the most accurate volume estimates. The differences between PI-RADS v2.0 and v2.1 were statistically significant although small in absolute numbers but may be of relevance in specific clinical scenarios like prostate-specific antigen density calculation. These findings validate the use of the ellipsoid formula and highlight that the bullet formula should not be used for prostate volume estimation due to systematic overestimation.

### Improving ultrasound-based prostate volume estimation [^111bbxJC]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The estimation of prostate volume is valuable for clinicians seeing patients with potential prostatic diseases, helping them in both diagnosis and treatment. As such, TRUS remains the main method applied routinely in the clinic to assess prostate volumes. Thus far, geometrical models were used to describe prostate shape, assuming the gland to be a prolate ellipsoid and more recently, a bullet. The present study is the first to prospectively use fresh prostate specimens as a reference to define a new coefficient of 0.66, which performed better than the universally adopted coefficient of 0.52 from the ellipsoid formula to estimate prostate volumes. Moreover, the new coefficient predicts a model closer to a bullet-shaped prostate based on 0.65 as its coefficient. Therefore, we suggest using 0.66 as the coefficient in the eq. (V = L × H × W × Coefficient) for image-based prostate volume estimation.

Among reasons in support of this proposition is that the coefficient derived from freshly obtained and trimmed prostates in our study is quite representative of patients consulting clinicians in general. For instance, this cohort was part of a larger cohort of 604 consecutive patients with a similar age distribution (mean = 61.3 years old, range = 44–76 years old) undergoing radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer at our centre. Unfortunately, TRUS measurement data were not available for most patients who were often referred for surgery from other centres. Nevertheless, all prostates were similarly processed, and their mean weight was similar: 45.1 g (range = 17.1 g–165.6 g). Among additional factors supporting the adoption of the prostate-derived 0.66 coefficient is the fresh status of specimens, rapidly processed and measured prospectively after excision, which is close to the in vivo situation. Often times in other studies, measurements are done after formaldehyde fixation, a process known to affect the prostate weight and volume.

Digital rectal examination can evaluate for prostate size, consistency, and tenderness; however, the examination reliably identifies only prostates larger than 50 mL.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING Urinalysis should be ordered to look for glucosuria, proteinuria, hematuria, and evidence of infection, with urine culture if necessary. 2 Prostate-specific antigen testing is not required for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Serum PSA is a limited predictor of prostate volume, risk of acute urinary retention, and need for surgery. 5Uroflowmetry is not useful for initial evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms. 5 Transrectal ultrasonography is more accurate than digital rectal examination at measuring prostate size. The American Urological Association recommends transrectal ultrasonography before treatment with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or surgery. 5However, the evidence that prostate-size measurement before medication initiation improves outcomes is limited.

5 The American Urological Association recommends 5-alpha reductase inhibitors if prostate volume is 30 mL or greater on imaging, the prostate is enlarged on examination, or PSA levels exceed 1. 5 ng per mL. 5Although the guideline states that a minimum prostate size of 30 mL is required for effective response from a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, the evidence referenced notes that men with small prostates tend to respond to placebo, whereas those with larger prostates do not. 5-Alpha reductase inhibitors can improve symptoms in all men, although slightly less so in those with smaller prostates.

### Can total and transition zone volume of the prostate determine whether to perform a repeat biopsy? [^112SkeDD]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the ability of total prostate (TP) and transition zone (TZ) volume to predict the outcome of a repeat prostate biopsy in patients with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 4 to 10 ng/mL.

Methods

A total of 1137 patients were included and underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided needle sextant and two transition zone biopsies of the prostate. All patients with a prior negative biopsy (benign prostatic tissue) underwent a repeat biopsy after 6 weeks. The TP and TZ volumes of the prostate were measured by transrectal ultrasonography.

Results

Of the 1137 patients, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 364 (32%), in 276 (24.2%) after the first biopsy and in 88 (7.7%) after the repeated biopsy. The TP and TZ volumes were larger in the patients with prostate cancer detected on the repeated biopsy (P < 0.0001). Using a cutoff for TP volume of less than 20 cm³ and greater than 80 cm³ and for TZ volume of less than 9 cm³ and greater than 41 cm³ would have spared 7.1% and 10% of repeated biopsies, respectively.

Conclusions

The probability for a positive repeat prostate biopsy increases in a logarithmic function for larger prostates, as well as for larger TP and, especially, for larger TZ volumes. The probability of finding prostate cancer on a repeat biopsy in prostates with small (less than 20 cm3) and large (greater than 79 cm3) TP, as well as in small (less than 9.3 cm3) and large (greater than 41 cm3) TZ volumes, was very low. Therefore, a repeat prostate biopsy within 6 weeks is unnecessary. These patients should be followed up by serial PSA determination.
