## Question

Should we perform arthroncentesis in kids?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether we should perform arthrocentesis in children with suspected acute bacterial arthritis and how to approach it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why arthrocentesis matters diagnostically and therapeutically. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines recommend about timing and indications. Next, I will examine exceptions, such as ill-appearing children and special joints like the hip. After that, I should review safety, feasibility, and the role of ultrasound guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note what to do if cultures are negative or if the child is not improving as expected [^e08c0fc7] [^633e3768].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why arthrocentesis is pivotal. Acute bacterial arthritis in children is a rheumatologic and orthopedic emergency; delays in diagnosis and source control risk irreversible joint destruction, growth disturbance, and systemic sepsis, so I need to ensure we do not miss the window for timely intervention. The criterion standard for diagnosis is synovial fluid analysis obtained by arthrocentesis, which both confirms the diagnosis and guides therapy, and it can provide immediate therapeutic decompression of a tense effusion, which is why guidelines prioritize getting fluid before antibiotics when clinically safe to do so [^e08c0fc7] [^633e3768] [^7ad9509d].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of recommendations. The PIDS/IDSA 2023 pediatric ABA guideline issues a conditional recommendation to obtain synovial fluid by arthrocentesis prior to starting empiric antimicrobials in children with suspected ABA, with moderate certainty of evidence, and a strong recommendation to perform WBC with differential and routine aerobic culture and Gram stain on that fluid. This aligns with adult guidance for suspected septic arthritis and reinforces that arthrocentesis is not optional when the diagnosis is in play [^633e3768] [^87b45b5d] [^1a591014].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the nuance about timing of antibiotics. In ill-appearing children or those with rapidly progressive infection, guidelines recommend immediate empiric IV antibiotics after blood cultures (if feasible) and without waiting for arthrocentesis, because the risk of deterioration outweighs the diagnostic yield trade-off; in clinically stable children, delaying antibiotics until after arthrocentesis is reasonable to preserve culture yield, acknowledging that modern molecular diagnostics mitigate some yield loss even after antibiotics, though evidence quality is limited [^171e3fa2] [^0c521325] [^a6b9b895].

> I need to check special anatomic considerations. For the hip and shoulder, the threshold for proceeding directly to surgical drainage is lower because these joints are deep, easily damaged, and aspiration alone may be insufficient; however, even in suspected hip sepsis, bedside or ultrasound-guided aspiration in the ED can expedite diagnosis and sometimes obviate immediate OR, with studies showing faster time to fluid and meaningful avoidance of OR in about half of cases, which is a key operational advantage in pediatric systems [^e08c0fc7] [^ca3be1e6] [^468e75ab].

> Next, I should review safety and feasibility. Arthrocentesis in children is generally safe with very low complication rates in primary ABA, and ultrasound guidance improves success and safety, particularly for the hip; point-of-care ultrasound has high sensitivity for effusion and is strongly recommended before more complex imaging, while recognizing that early false negatives can occur and persistent suspicion warrants repeat ultrasound or MRI. Sedation needs vary by age, joint, and cooperation, and many centers integrate aspiration under the same anesthetic as potential surgery to minimize repeat anesthesia exposure [^e08c0fc7] [^7e5dbb76] [^fcab0ef7] [^8e152daf].

> Let me consider the diagnostic yield and how it changes management. Synovial WBC count and differential remain central, with traditional cutoffs around 50,000 cells/mm³ supporting sepsis, though lower thresholds like 33,000 may improve sensitivity; importantly, Gram stain has limited sensitivity, especially for gram-negative organisms, so a negative Gram stain does not exclude sepsis and should not prematurely narrow empiric therapy. Molecular testing, particularly for Kingella kingae in young children, meaningfully increases pathogen detection and should be considered when routine cultures are negative, which is common in this age group [^8e152daf] [^c48a129b] [^69446ed9] [^0de837a6].

> I should double-check what to do if cultures are negative or the child fails to improve. Culture-negative ABA is not rare and decisions should remain clinical, supported by serial CRP trends and repeat exams; if there is a poor response within 48–96 hours, guidelines suggest obtaining MRI to evaluate for adjacent osteomyelitis, abscess, or other foci and considering additional invasive procedures for source control, which prevents prolonged undertreatment and missed concomitant infections [^778fba34] [^61443fbc] [^4df4c907].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the effusion is hemorrhagic. In equivocal cases with hemorrhagic fluid or atypical features, I should reconsider the differential, including pigmented villonodular synovitis, intra-articular venous malformation, or other mass lesions; MRI can be decisive in these scenarios and should be obtained before irreversible surgical intervention when suspicion persists, aligning with case-based evidence and reports emphasizing early MRI in atypical monoarthritis [^b206ef5f] [^2d7768c7].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Yes, we should perform arthrocentesis in children when acute bacterial arthritis is suspected, unless the child is critically ill and unstable, in which case immediate empiric antibiotics and resuscitation take precedence. In stable children, obtain synovial fluid before antibiotics when feasible, analyze WBC with differential, Gram stain, and aerobic culture, add targeted molecular testing for K. kingae in preschoolers if cultures are negative, and use ultrasound to guide aspiration and detect effusions, especially in the hip. Coordinate care so that if aspiration is done in the OR, cell count turnaround is fast enough to inform the need for same-setting drainage, and escalate to MRI and repeat procedures if the clinical course is suboptimal [^633e3768] [^e08c0fc7] [^7e5dbb76] [^8e152daf].

In children with suspected septic arthritis, **arthrocentesis is indicated** to obtain synovial fluid for diagnostic analysis and to decompress the joint [^e08c0fc7]. It should be performed **before antibiotics when clinically safe**, as delays reduce culture yield [^633e3768] [^a6b9b895]. Ultrasound guidance improves success and safety, especially for the hip and shoulder [^7e5dbb76] [^fcab0ef7]. If the child is ill-appearing or unstable, do not delay antibiotics; obtain blood cultures and start empiric therapy, then perform arthrocentesis as soon as feasible [^171e3fa2] [^0c521325]. Arthrocentesis is minimally invasive, with low complication rates, and is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^e08c0fc7] [^7ad9509d].

---

## Indications for arthrocentesis in pediatric patients

Arthrocentesis is indicated in pediatric patients when **septic arthritis is suspected**, particularly when the following features are present:

- **Acute joint swelling**: Especially with pain, warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion [^7ad9509d].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, irritability, or malaise [^4588d06b].

- **Laboratory abnormalities**: Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) or leukocytosis [^4689726a].

- **Inability to bear weight**: Particularly in the hip or knee, which increases suspicion for septic arthritis [^4e88ed0e].

---

## Diagnostic value of arthrocentesis

Arthrocentesis provides **critical diagnostic information** that cannot be reliably obtained through clinical assessment or imaging alone:

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: White blood cell (WBC) count, differential, Gram stain, and culture are essential to differentiate septic arthritis from other causes of joint effusion [^633e3768] [^4588d06b].

- **Pathogen identification**: Culture and molecular testing (e.g. PCR) can identify causative organisms, including fastidious pathogens such as Kingella kingae, which are often missed by routine cultures [^69446ed9] [^0de837a6].

- **Differentiation**: Helps distinguish septic arthritis from transient synovitis, rheumatologic conditions, or other non-infectious etiologies [^7ad9509d].

---

## Timing of arthrocentesis relative to antibiotic administration

The timing of arthrocentesis relative to antibiotic administration is **crucial** for maximizing diagnostic yield:

- **Before antibiotics**: Arthrocentesis should ideally be performed before initiating empiric antibiotic therapy to preserve culture yield and enable accurate pathogen identification [^633e3768] [^87b45b5d].

- **Ill-appearing patients**: In critically ill or unstable patients, antibiotics should not be delayed. Blood cultures should be obtained, empiric therapy initiated, and arthrocentesis performed as soon as feasible thereafter [^171e3fa2] [^0c521325].

- **Stable patients**: In clinically stable patients, it is reasonable to withhold antibiotics until arthrocentesis is completed, under careful observation [^c5da3f53].

---

## Safety and complications of arthrocentesis in pediatric patients

Arthrocentesis is generally **safe and well-tolerated** in pediatric patients, with low complication rates:

- **Complications**: Rare complications include infection, bleeding, and iatrogenic cartilage injury. The overall complication rate is less than 1% in primary acute bacterial arthritis cases [^e08c0fc7].

- **Ultrasound guidance**: Improves safety and success rates, particularly in difficult-to-aspirate joints such as the hip and shoulder [^fcab0ef7] [^468e75ab].

- **Sedation**: Sedation or anesthesia may be required in young or uncooperative children, but this does not significantly increase complication rates [^e08c0fc7].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods and their limitations

Several **alternative diagnostic methods** exist, but none replace the diagnostic accuracy of arthrocentesis:

| **Diagnostic method** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|
| Clinical assessment | - Nonspecific <br/> - Can mimic other conditions (e.g. transient synovitis, rheumatologic diseases) [^4588d06b] |
| Laboratory tests (CRP, ESR, WBC) | - Nonspecific <br/> - Cannot reliably differentiate septic from non-septic arthritis [^4689726a] |
| Imaging (ultrasound, MRI) | - Useful for detecting effusions and guiding arthrocentesis <br/> - Cannot definitively diagnose septic arthritis or identify causative organisms [^7e5dbb76] [^5a730866] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) **strongly recommend arthrocentesis** for suspected pediatric septic arthritis:

- **Obtain synovial fluid**: Perform arthrocentesis to obtain synovial fluid for analysis before initiating antibiotics when clinically feasible [^633e3768] [^87b45b5d].

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Perform WBC count, differential, Gram stain, and culture on obtained synovial fluid [^a8b44001].

- **Additional testing**: Consider molecular testing (e.g. PCR) for fastidious organisms, particularly in preschool-aged children at risk for Kingella kingae infection [^633e3768] [^69446ed9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Arthrocentesis is **essential** in pediatric patients with suspected septic arthritis. It provides definitive diagnostic information, guides appropriate antibiotic therapy, and enables timely joint decompression. Clinicians should perform arthrocentesis before antibiotics when clinically safe, using ultrasound guidance to maximize success and minimize complications. In ill-appearing patients, antibiotics should not be delayed, and arthrocentesis should be performed as soon as feasible thereafter.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) procedural approach — role of arthrocentesis, timing factors, and safety — is summarized as follows: the collection of synovial fluid of the affected joint(s) is a critical aspect of management of suspected ABA for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and the initial invasive procedure to collect synovial fluid can be performed by arthrocentesis, potentially to be immediately followed by surgical drainage (arthroscopy or arthrotomy) as needed. The choice and timing of the initial procedure is influenced by therapeutic need for drainage; severity of infection (based on vital signs, physical findings including clinical toxicity, and inflammatory marker elevation); location, size, and ease of accessibility of the affected joint; the requirement for anesthesia or sedation to perform supplemental imaging and/or arthrocenthesis with the possibility of subsequent arthrotomy; and availability of local resources to support necessary interventions. Arthrocentesis is quick and minimally invasive and may be done with the child under sedation, general anesthesia, or awake, but an exception is when there is suspicion of infection of a hip or shoulder joint, where more invasive procedures often are the best initial approach. Complication risk has been very low for primary ABA with a complication rate (< 1%), whereas with adjacent osteomyelitis the complication rate has been reported to be 38%, and affected children were older (7.6 vs 2.7 years) with higher inflammatory markers (initial CRP 16.2 vs 5.2 mg/dL) and higher rates of bacteremia (71.7% vs 9.7%).

These injections are most useful in instances of joint or tissue injury and inflammation. History of pain, local and referred, will provide important clues to the underlying pathology. Physical examination is extremely helpful in ascertaining the diagnosis. Knowledge of the anatomy of the area to be injected is essential. Intratendinous injection should be avoided because of the likelihood of weakening the tendon. Corticosteroid injections also should be avoided in cases of Achilles or patella tendinopathies. If therapeutic effect is achieved, a maximum of four injections per year is recommended. There is some concern that corticosteroid preparations, with repeated use, may accelerate normal, aging-related articular cartilage atrophy or may weaken tendons or ligaments. When symptoms are resistant, or when there is a history of trauma, a radiograph or other imaging study should be performed to help assist in the diagnosis.

Indications The indications for joint or soft tissue aspiration and injection fall into two categories: diagnostic and therapeutic. A common diagnostic indication for placing a needle in a joint is the aspiration of synovial fluid for evaluation. Synovial fluid evaluation can differentiate among various joint disease etiologies including infection, inflammation, and trauma. A second diagnostic indication involves the injection of a local anesthetic to confirm the presumptive diagnosis through symptom relief of the affected body part. Timing of Injections Appropriate timing can minimize complications and allow a clear diagnosis or therapeutic response. For diagnostic injections, the procedure should be performed when acute or chronic symptoms are present, when the diagnosis is unclear or needs to be confirmed, when consideration has been given to other diagnostic modalities, and when septic arthritis has been ruled out.

For therapeutic injections, the procedure should be performed when acute or chronic symptoms are present, after the diagnosis and therapeutic plan have been made, and after consideration has been given to obtaining radiographs. Therapeutic injection should be performed only with or after the initiation of other therapeutic modalities. In the absence of an underlying chronic inflammatory arthritis, any joint with an effusion should be radiographed to rule out a fracture or other intra-articular pathologic process. To avoid direct needle injury to articular cartilage or local nerves, attention should be paid to anatomic landmarks and depth of injection. Other rare, but possible, complications include pneumothorax, perilymphatic depigmentation, steroid arthropathy, adrenal suppression, and abnormal uterine bleeding.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) invasive diagnostics — In children with suspected ABA, we suggest collecting synovial fluid from the affected joint by arthrocentesis prior to starting empiric antimicrobial therapy (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). On joint fluid obtained by arthrocentesis, we recommend performing white blood cell count and differential and routine microbiological cultures (aerobic bacterial culture and Gram stain) (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Further diagnostic testing may be beneficial in certain situations, including molecular testing for specimens from which no pathogen has been identified by Gram stain and aerobic bacterial culture (particularly in preschool-aged children at higher risk of K. kingae infection) and more extensive scope of microbial testing, beyond aerobic bacterial culture (e.g., anaerobic, fungal, and/or mycobacterial cultures and stains; molecular testing, which may include metagenomic next-generation sequencing), in children who are immunocompromised or who have a history of penetrating injury; additional molecular tests may be performed on synovial samples held in the laboratory, or for additional cultures, a repeat arthrocentesis may be required.

### Current concepts in pediatric septic arthritis [^0b87d8e7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to present challenges regarding the clinical diagnosis, workup, and definitive management. Urgent management is essential, so treating surgeons must efficiently work through differential diagnoses, identify concomitant infections, and do a timely irrigation and débridement. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is increasing, typically resulting in a more rapid progression of symptoms with more severe clinical presentation. The diagnostic utility of MRI has resulted in improved detection of concomitant septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, although MRI must not substantially delay definitive management. Early diagnosis followed by urgent irrigation and débridement and antibiotic therapy are essential for satisfactory long-term outcomes. Antibiotics should not be administered until blood cultures and arthrocentesis fluid are obtained, except in rare cases of a septic or toxic patient. Once cultures are obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should commence and provide coverage for the most likely pathogens, given the patient's age. Laboratory markers, especially C-reactive protein, should be followed until normalization and correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms. Definitive antibiotic selection should be shared with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, who can help guide the duration of treatment.

### Counting the seconds: a quality improvement initiative to accelerate intraoperative results for arthrocentesis cell counts in a paediatric tertiary care hospital [^8e152daf]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

SF cell count remains the gold standard for differentiating between non-inflammatory, inflammatory and infectious joint disordersand aiding in surgical decision-making. Cell counts > 50 000 WBCs/mm 3 are indicative of septic arthritisand guide decision-making for surgeons managing these patients, although more recent evidence suggests lower cell cut-offs such as 33 000 may be more sensitive. Arthrocentesis may be performed in the ED, on the ward or in the OR. Given the higher likelihood of needing sedation in paediatric patients, arthrocentesis may be performed under general anaesthesia, with the ability to proceed directly to open incision and drainage if indicated by elevated cell counts. Avoiding a second anaesthetic has many advantages, including hospital resource utilisation and risk mitigation, particularly in neonates and infants who may experience cardiovascular and pulmonary complications from anaesthesia, with some studies suggesting potential long-term neurodevelopmental effects.

To effectively use single setting arthrocentesis and surgical drainage, TAT must be minimised. Extended time places surgeons in a challenging position, forcing them to decide between proceeding with potentially unnecessary open procedures or taking the risk of bringing the patient back for a separate surgery and anaesthesia once cell count results are available. TAT serves as a metric for evaluating not only laboratory efficiency but also the overall effectiveness of hospital programmes. A shorter TAT carries direct benefits: it reduces the length of time spent under anaesthesia, aids in optimising OR time, decreases length of stay, increases patient safety and generally does so in a cost-effective fashion. In this study, the primary goal was to consistently reduce the time from joint sample acquisition to first verification by the laboratory team to < 1 hour with the hopes of subsequently reducing the total time paediatric patients spend under general anaesthesia in the orthopaedic setting.

Abstract

Septic arthritis is one potential cause of pediatric joint effusion and pain that may lead to significant morbidity. We present a case where point-of-care ultrasound was used to identify and aspirate a joint effusion in a pediatric patient with septic arthritis of the ankle, facilitating timely diagnosis and care. We review the technique for arthrocentesis of the ankle and literature on point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis of pediatric septic arthritis.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — procedural management and surgical considerations: When the initial procedure is performed by a non-orthopedist and the fluid appears purulent or initial testing suggests bacterial infection, orthopedic consultation for arthroscopy or arthrotomy should be considered, and aspiration via arthrocentesis may decrease the urgency for initial surgical intervention; some children improve sufficiently after initial aspiration that subsequent surgical intervention may not be necessary. In a Spain cohort of knee ABA, age < 3 years and CRP < 20 mg/L were predictive of successful outcome with aspiration alone. Clinicians should consider adjacent osteomyelitis, and when present, joint drainage may need to be accompanied by procedures to debride adjacent bone and soft tissue. Comparative data include a Malawi trial that randomized 61 children with shoulder ABA to aspiration versus arthrotomy and found no difference in outcomes, though non-typhoidal Salmonella species accounted for 80% of positive joint fluid cultures, limiting generalizability. Arthroscopic drainage is described as safe and effective across multiple joints, and in an Australian study of pediatric knee ABA was associated with fewer repeat irrigations and shorter time to range of motion and weight bearing compared with open treatment. Historically, arthrotomy has been recommended for hips and shoulders, with a South African series reporting uncomplicated recovery when antibiotics plus arthrotomy occurred within 5 days of symptom onset, but significant and permanent hip damage when arthrotomy was delayed.

### Existing and emerging methods of diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric musculoskeletal infection [^378b8aae]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods of diagnosing and monitoring pediatric musculoskeletal infections are rapidly evolving. Key serologic tests are typically used in screening patients with suspected infections, and remain an integral part of the initial work-up. Synovial studies from arthrocentesis in possible septic arthritis, and source-specific cultures have been the foundation of our treatment algorithm. Given the prevalence of soft tissue abscesses and osteoarticular infections, advanced imaging is an advantageous tool. More affordable use and expanded access to MRI has made it a valuable adjunct to clinical picture and existing tests in order to comprehensively visualize the extent of musculoskeletal infections in children. Ongoing validation for criteria to help determine the patients that stand to benefit the most from MRI, even when surgical intervention may be delayed, remains of significant clinical interest. Given the rates of culture-negative infections, and the need for timely diagnosis, new diagnostic techniques are always being considered. The search for more accurate biomarkers, and technology such as Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) that can rapidly identify pathogens of all types of phyla based on a small sample of DNA, has promising clinical implications. While once novel and prohibitively expensive, these tests are now being applied in university and tertiary care centers in certain scenarios. Applying these techniques to pediatric musculoskeletal will require a large change in lab workflow and training. However, the benefits of acquiring diagnostic information along with will make them a superior tool in our arsenal of diagnostic tests.

### Procedural applications of point-of-care ultrasound in pediatric emergency medicine [^fcab0ef7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Point-of-care ultrasound can improve efficacy and safety of pediatric procedures performed in the emergency department. This article reviews ultrasound guidance for the following pediatric emergency medicine procedures: soft tissue (abscess incision and drainage, foreign body identification and removal, and peritonsillar abscess drainage), musculoskeletal and neurologic (hip arthrocentesis, peripheral nerve blocks, and lumbar puncture), vascular access (peripheral intravenous access and central line placement), and critical care (endotracheal tube placement, pericardiocentesis, thoracentesis, and paracentesis). By incorporating ultrasound, emergency physicians caring for pediatric patients have the potential to enhance their procedural scope, confidence, safety, and success.

### Management of a child with suspected acute septic arthritis [^7a1ab18e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis of childhood is a potentially devastating disease that causes permanent disability and can result in death. Traditional treatment consists of a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics combined with aggressive surgery. However, this approach is challenged by trials showing satisfactory outcomes with shorter treatment and less invasive surgery. Diagnostic arthrocentesis alone and an antibiotic for a fortnight, including initial intravenous administration for 2–4 days, suffice in most non-neonatal cases. A good penetrating agent, such as clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin, exceptionally high doses, and administration four times a day are probably key factors. If the symptoms and signs subside within a few days, and the serum C-reactive protein level drops below 20 mg/l, the antibiotic can usually be safely discontinued. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a concern, but fortunately, most strains have retained susceptibility to clindamycin. The above guidance is not applicable to neonates and immunocompromised patients who may require a different approach.

### Emergency department diagnosis of pediatric hip effusion and guided arthrocentesis using point-of-care ultrasound [^468e75ab]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Children with complaints of hip pain, a painful limp, or refusal to weight bear commonly present to the Emergency Department (ED). The ability to use point-of-care ultrasound in the ED to diagnose a hip joint effusion and to guide arthrocentesis can be helpful to facilitate diagnosis and management of these children. The capsular-synovial thickness of the hip is measured from the anterior bony cortical surface to the posterior surface of the iliopsoas muscle at the concavity of the femoral neck. A capsular-synovial thickness > 5 mm, or > 2 mm difference compared to the asymptomatic contralateral hip are the described sonographic criteria for hip joint effusion in children. We report on the use of point-of-care ultrasound to diagnose hip effusion and to guide arthrocentesis in a series of pediatric patients presenting with hip pain to the ED.

Abstract

Introduction

In paediatric patients with concern for septic arthritis, arthrocentesis may be performed under anaesthesia with intraoperative cell count determining need for surgical intervention. Shorter turnaround time (TAT) between collection and result minimises anaesthesia exposure for the patient and surgical time for the treatment team. This study evaluated a quality improvement (QI) initiative to decrease TAT to < 1 hour by improving interdisciplinary communication and placing visual reminders ('stat card') to indicate priority handling.

Methods

206 consecutive paediatric patients who underwent arthrocentesis for the diagnosis of septic arthritis were identified. Midway through the collection period, the QI intervention (stat card) was implemented. We collected the date and time of arthrocentesis and sample verification (TAT) and calculated the proportion of TAT < 1 hour preintervention and postintervention. We collected variables related to the affected joint and whether the stat card was used. Operative time was calculated for those samples collected in the Operating Room (OR).

Results

The final study population included 109 patients preintervention and 88 patients postintervention. Postintervention, the stat card was used in only 44% (20/45) of eligible cases. Compliance was highest in aspirations of the hip (75%). After adjusting for the affected joint, the odds of TAT < 1 hour were higher in the postintervention stat card group compared with the postintervention no stat card group (odds ratio 7.10, p = 0.0147) and to the preintervention group (odds ratio 3.63, p = 0.0810). There was no difference between the postintervention no stat card versus the preintervention groups (odds ratio 0.51, p = 0.2524). TAT was significantly decreased when the stat card was used (42 min) compared with when it was not used (84 min) (mean difference −39.5%, p = 0.0178). After adjusting for the affected joint, there was no difference in operative time across the three groups (p = 0.2531).

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary QI initiative for the intraoperative diagnosis of septic arthritis was effective in reducing cell count TAT but demonstrated poor compliance and failed to reduce operative time.

### Bedside aspiration for workup of the pediatric septic hip: avoid trips to the OR and expedited time to diagnosis [^ca3be1e6]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Septic arthritis of the hip is a pediatric orthopaedic emergency. Joint synovial fluid aspiration is a critical step of diagnosis, which may be delayed due to limited personnel or operating room (OR) availability. To expedite diagnosis, orthopaedic residents perform ultrasound-guided bedside arthrocentesis in the emergency department (ED). This study aims to evaluate the impact of this practice on time to diagnosis and definitive treatment of septic arthritis of the hip and minimizing trips to the operating room.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of patients presenting to our pediatric orthopaedic tertiary care emergency room requiring a hip aspiration to rule out septic arthritis between 2003 and 2023. We identified all patients who had resulted hip synovial fluid nucleated cell count during the above time period. Chart review was performed to determine how synovial fluid was collected via interventional radiology (IR), in the OR with an orthopaedic surgeon, or via bedside aspiration with the on-call resident. Clinical outcomes were primarily defined as time points in clinical care. Patient demographics, Kocher criteria values, time to aspiration, and final treatment are presented. Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher exact tests were used to compare demographic and clinical differences in RStudio using a two-sided level of significance of 0.05.

Results

Hip aspiration was performed in the workup of septic arthritis in 57 patients (median age 5.1 y; 58% female). Aspiration occurred in the ED for 28 patients, interventional radiology (IR) for 11, and in the OR for 18 patients. Bedside aspiration avoided a trip to the OR for 15 patients (54%). Median time to obtaining joint fluid was significantly shorter for patients undergoing bedside or IR-guided aspiration compared with OR aspiration (7.4 vs. 5.3 vs. 15.7 h, respectively; bedside vs. OR P = 0.007, IR vs. OR P = 0.013). Time from presentation to OR for open surgical debridement, total operative time, and the percentage of patients requiring open surgical debridement did not significantly differ between groups.

Discussion

Bedside aspiration decreases the time to diagnosis of septic arthritis and can prevent ~50% of children from going to the OR. This is beneficial for the patient as it may allow for earlier antibiotic administration, provide pain relief, and avoid possible complications of general anesthesia.

### Counting the seconds: a quality improvement initiative to accelerate intraoperative results for arthrocentesis cell counts in a paediatric tertiary care hospital [^46ac5a2c]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Paediatric orthopaedic surgeons often use synovial fluid (SF) cell counts to determine the need for formal incision and drainage in a patient with a joint effusion and signs of infection concerning for septic arthritis. To minimise anaesthetic exposure, arthrocentesis may be done under the same anaesthetic as the surgical intervention, if a cell count can be done efficiently. Laboratories use automated or manual analysis to determine white blood cell (WBC) and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (%) counts in SF samples, with traditionally accepted cut-offs of > 50 000 WBCs/μL indicating septic arthritis and need for open surgery. SF specimen collection, transport, analysis and resulting directly involves multiple teams and staff members, often with no direct personal contact. In response to the extended time from specimen submission to result, known as turnaround time (TAT), surgeons may choose to skip an arthrocentesis and perform incision and drainage on a joint with clinical concern for septic arthritis, rather than wait under anaesthesia for the result. With a goal to reduce TAT to < 1 hour, a multidisciplinary quality improvement (QI) initiative was developed with involvement from orthopaedic surgeons, nurses, operating room (OR) technologists and laboratory staff (microbiology and pathology). Barriers were identified and a process was delineated to streamline communication and clearly identify priority samples. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the QI intervention in reducing TAT to < 1 hour.

Introduction

In paediatric patients with concern for septic arthritis, arthrocentesis may be performed under anaesthesia with intraoperative cell count determining need for surgical intervention. Shorter turnaround time (TAT) between collection and result minimises anaesthesia exposure for the patient and surgical time for the treatment team. This study evaluated a quality improvement (QI) initiative to decrease TAT to < 1hour by improving interdisciplinary communication and placing visual reminders ('stat card') to indicate priority handling.

Methods

206 consecutive paediatric patients who underwent arthrocentesis for the diagnosis of septic arthritis were identified. Midway through the collection period, the QI intervention (stat card) was implemented. We collected the date and time of arthrocentesis and sample verification (TAT) and calculated the proportion of TAT < 1hour preintervention and postintervention. We collected variables related to the affected joint and whether the stat card was used. Operative time was calculated for those samples collected in the Operating Room (OR).

Results

The final study population included 109 patients preintervention and 88 patients postintervention. Postintervention, the stat card was used in only 44% (20/45) of eligible cases. Compliance was highest in aspirations of the hip (75%). After adjusting for the affected joint, the odds of TAT < 1hour were higher in the postintervention stat card group compared with the postintervention no stat card group (odds ratio 7.10, p = 0.0147) and to the preintervention group (odds ratio 3.63, p = 0.0810). There was no difference between the postintervention no stat card versus the preintervention groups (odds ratio 0.51, p = 0.2524). TAT was significantly decreased when the stat card was used (42min) compared with when it was not used (84min) (mean difference -39.5%, p = 0.0178). After adjusting for the affected joint, there was no difference in operative time across the three groups (p = 0.2531).

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary QI initiative for the intraoperative diagnosis of septic arthritis was effective in reducing cell count TAT but demonstrated poor compliance and failed to reduce operative time.

The primary barriers identified by our multidisciplinary QI team were related to communication. Our formal intervention, the 'stat card' (figure 1), provided clear instruction to both the OR and laboratory teams. Although simple, our intervention was consistent with a systematic review that found that the top 25% of their top performing orders implemented the use of different coloured labels for urgent specimens and regularly trained lab staff to expedite urgent samples into protocols.

While the stat card resulted in a higher proportion of TAT < 1 hour, it did not result in decreased operative time. Compliance was limited, with only 45% of eligible cases using the card, which could explain these findings. Another explanation may be the surgeon waiting for SF results in cases where the stat card was used, while proceeding directly to surgery based on clinical findings in cases where the stat card was not used, resulting in shorter median operative times for this group. The increased usage of hip joint aspirations is likely due to the diagnostic challenge that septic arthritis of the hip presents. Infections in other joints usually have a more specific clinical exam with effusions easier to visualise, palpate and identify; therefore, surgeons may feel more comfortable moving forward with operative incision and drainage in those cases without a diagnostic aspiration. However, our subgroup analysis of the hip cases did not demonstrate a decrease in operative time corresponding with a decrease in TAT with stat card use, which we would have expected. Statistically significant changes in TAT could also simply not be large enough to affect overall operative time, given the innumerable factors contributing to a patient's time spent in the operating suite. These findings highlight the joint-specific and case-specific nuances, as well as challenges in process changes within a busy tertiary care referral centre, where processes must be shared, understood and then used by fluctuating teams.

A subset of patients (n = 28) contributed multiple samples to the dataset (multiple joints sampled or the same joint sampled multiple times). In this subset of patients, we preferentially selected the sample that was flagged as a priority for each individual patient. If multiple samples were flagged as high priority or, conversely, if multiple samples were flagged as routine priority, we preferentially selected the sample that was obtained first for inclusion in the final dataset. This process ensured that all observations were independent.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the clinical characteristics. A multiple variable linear regression model, adjusted for collection department, joint and priority level, was used to test for differences in TAT before versus after implementation of the QI intervention ('stat card'). The time variable was log-transformed due to the skewed nature of this outcome variable. Parameter estimates from the model, the average difference between groups, were exponentiated and interpreted as the per cent change in TAT preintervention versus postintervention. Multiple variable linear regression models were also used to test whether differences between groups depended on sample priority level. A secondary logistic regression model was also used to compare the percentage of samples in which TAT was < 1 hour across these three groups. Finally, among priority samples collected in the OR during the postintervention period, we compared differences in clinical characteristics among samples when the 'stat card' was used versus when the 'stat card' was not used.

Results

The final study population included n = 109 unique patients in the preintervention group and n = 88 unique patients in the postintervention group. There was no difference in the department where the sample was collected or the joint affected between the preintervention and postintervention groups. There was a difference in the percentage of the samples ordered as high priority (p = 0.0085) (table 1), indicating that more samples were ordered as high priority (STAT) after the QI intervention.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of the sample preintervention versus postintervention

After adjusting for the collection department, priority level and affected joint, there was no difference in TAT preintervention and postintervention (p = 0.5267). Collection department (p < 0.0001) and priority level (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with improved TAT; faster times were associated with high priority samples as well as samples collected in the OR. During the postintervention time period, the stat card was used in 45% of the eligible cases (collected in OR and high priority). Day of week, season, hospital shift and specimen type were not significantly different between groups, but the stat card was used more often when the sample was collected from the hip joint (p = 0.0615) (see table 2).

Table 2
Stat card compliance rates (%) among priority samples obtained in the OR

Among eligible cases, we compared TAT across the following three groups: preintervention, postintervention with a stat card used and postintervention with a stat card not used. Postintervention, TAT was significantly decreased when the stat card was used compared with when the stat card was not used (p = 0.0012). However, there was no difference in TAT between the postintervention stat card group versus the preintervention group (p = 0.2821) or between the postintervention no stat card group versus the preintervention group (p = 0.0668). Although not statistically significant, the average TAT was decreased in the postintervention stat card group compared with the preintervention group (p = 0.5427) (See figure 2).

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — intra-articular antimicrobial agents during surgery — In children with presumed or confirmed ABA who require a surgical procedure, we recommend against the routine use of intra-articular antimicrobial agents (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), with the comment that this recommendation places a high value on avoiding unnecessary harms and costs associated with this intervention. The summary of evidence notes that high cure rates are achieved with systemic antimicrobials and drainage of infected articular fluid in children, precluding the need for surgical site (i.e., intra-articular) antimicrobial.

### Age and C-reactive protein as modifiers of kocher criteria in pediatric septic knee monoarthritis [^bfd7ca1d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although Kocher criteria can distinguish a septic hip from an aseptic cause, they may not apply to a septic knee. We aimed to identify predictors to discriminate septic and aseptic causes of acute knee monoarthritis in children who underwent arthrocentesis.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study among children who underwent arthrocentesis for suspected septic arthritis of the knee. Collected data included demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics. We performed univariate and multivariable analyses to identify predictors of the septic knee. We further investigated accuracy of different predictive models.

Results

A total of 60 patients who underwent arthrocentesis for suspected knee septic arthritis were included in this study. Septic arthritis of the knee was confirmed in 32 (53%) patients. Age ≤ 5 years (OR 4.237, [95% CI 1.270–14.127], p = 0.019), WBC > 12,000 cells/mm 3 (OR 5.059, [95% CI 1.424–17.970], p = 0.012), and CRP > 2 mg/dL (OR 3.180, [0.895–11.298], p = 0.074) were the most important predictors of a septic knee. Three-tier model comprising these three factors (AUC 0.766) and 4-tier model with addition of fever > 38.5°C (AUC 0.776) performed better than Kocher criteria (AUC 0.677), modified Kocher criteria (AUC 0.699) and Full Model (adding age ≤ 5 years and CRP > 2 mg/dL to Kocher criteria) (AUC 0.746). Full Model successfully ruled out septic arthritis if all 6 criteria were negative.

Conclusion

Based on these findings, we propose an algorithm to identify low, intermediate and high-risk patients for knee septic arthritis. Our proposed two-step algorithm incorporating major (age, WBC, CRP) and minor (fever, ESR, non-weight bearing) criteria can serve as a simple decision-support tool to justify arthrocentesis in children with suspected knee septic arthritis.

### Low prevalence of anaerobic bacteria in pediatric septic arthritis makes obtaining anaerobic cultures of questionable value [^658e885f]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric acute septic arthritis necessitates urgent identification and treatment to avoid irreversible joint damage if not recognized and treated in a timely manner. Many centers routinely obtain both aerobic and anaerobic cultures for the purpose of pathogen identification; however, the yield of anaerobic culture results has been called into question. The goal of this study was to determine the positivity rate of anaerobic cultures collected intraoperatively in pediatric patients with clinically diagnosed septic arthritis.

Methods

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of septic arthritis were extracted from a search of musculoskeletal infections at a large tertiary care pediatric hospital from 2007 to 2021. Cultures obtained from the operating room or through arthrocentesis were examined.

Results

We identified 470 cases of pediatric septic arthritis of which only 3 cultures were positive (0.6%) for anaerobic organisms. All cases involved a single isolate. The anaerobic bacteria that were detected included 1 facultative anaerobe, 1 strict anaerobe, and 1 relatively aerotolerant anaerobe. Four aerobic organisms grew on the anaerobic cultures. Three of the false positives also grew on aerobic culture media, whereas 1 aerobic specimen grew explicitly on anaerobic media. Neither the facultative anaerobe nor the aerotolerant anaerobe grew on aerobic culture media.

Conclusions

Over a 14-year period, only 0.6% (3 cases) of septic arthritis cases yielded positive anaerobic cultures that were not able to be cultured on aerobic media. As such, an anaerobic culture was more likely to culture a bacterium that would have also been cultured on aerobic media. In addition, a true positive anaerobic culture that would not have been diagnosed on aerobic cultures only occurs about once every 5 years at our institution. If one were to decide against obtaining anaerobic cultures, they would only miss 3 infections out of almost 500 (0.6%), and antibiotics would only have changed 0.6% of the time. These results suggest that routinely obtaining anaerobic cultures may be of limited value in pediatric septic arthritis. The false-positive rate of anaerobic labs exceeds that of true-positive cases. These results provide actionable opportunity to help guide clinician decision-making in a more cost-effective and efficient management of pediatric septic arthritis.

Figure 1
QI Intervention Stat Card. OR, operating room; QI, quality improvement.

To determine the effectiveness of the intervention, consecutive patients who underwent an arthrocentesis between September 2020 and September 2023 were identified. Patients who underwent arthrocentesis prior to July 2022 were included in the preintervention group, and patients who underwent a joint aspiration after July 2022 were included in the postintervention group. Samples in the postintervention group were divided into those with the 'stat card' and those without.

We collected the date and time when the sample was obtained and the date and time when the sample was first verified by the laboratory (when the OR team was notified of results). The duration of time between sample acquisition and verification was the primary variable of interest (TAT). We calculated the proportion of samples with TAT < 1 hour. We also collected the sample collection location (OR, floor or emergency department), affected joint, how the order was placed in the electronic medical record (high priority vs routine), as well as whether the 'stat card' was used (yes vs no). All patients who had the stat card sent were cases in which the operating surgeon waited for the cell count results before continuing with surgery, while in cases where the stat card was not used, the operating surgeon proceeded with surgery based on clinical findings rather than waiting for the cell count results. Operative time was only calculated for those subjects under general anaesthesia. Patients from the emergency department or floor were included as a comparison group, but operative time was not calculated.

### Septic arthritis of the elbow in children: clinical presentation and microbiological profile [^0d3afd90]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Septic arthritis of the elbow in children is a rare but important musculoskeletal infection, and there is little published data to guide treating clinicians. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, associated pathology, and microbiological profile of septic arthritis of the elbow in a pediatric population.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of children who had an elbow arthrocentesis for presumed septic arthritis and whose joint aspirates were positive for microbial growth. Data collected included demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, imaging, and laboratory data, including culture results.

Results

Twelve children underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis of the elbow joint for septic arthritis at an average age of 6 years and 9 months (range, 2 mo to 13 y and 7 mo). Every child had pain, localized erythema and edema, and restricted range of motion; 10/12 were febrile. Mean duration of symptoms prior to joint tap was 4 days (range, 1 to 14 d). Concurrent osteomyelitis was found in 7 patients, as confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): 5 at initial presentation and 2 after readmission for persistent symptoms. Causative pathogens were MSSA (7), MRSA (2), Group G streptococcus (1), Pseuodomonas aureginosa (1), and Streptococcus pneumonia (1). ESR was > 40 mm/h in 8/11 patients, CRP was > 2 mg/dL in all patients, and synovial WBC count was > 50,000 cells/mm in 8/9 patients. One patient developed fulminant sepsis during hospitalization and 2 children were readmitted within 30 days of discharge for unrecognized osteomyelitis and/or recurrence of septic arthritis of the elbow.

Conclusion

In 12 children studied with septic arthritis, S. aureus was the most common pathogen. Diagnosis is often delayed, and in most cases inflammatory markers were elevated (ESR > 40 mm/h, CRP > 2 mg/dL). Concomitant osteomyelitis is quite common, and therefore magnetic resonance imaging should be considered as part of the diagnostic work-up for this condition.

### Gram stain is not clinically relevant in treatment of pediatric septic arthritis [^c48a129b]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pediatric septic arthritis (SA) can be challenging due to wide variability in the presentation of musculoskeletal infection. Synovial fluid Gram stain is routinely obtained and often used as an initial indicator of the presence or absence of pediatric SA. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical utility of the Gram stain results from a joint aspiration in the diagnosis and management of pediatric SA.

Methods

All patients with suspected SA who underwent arthrocentesis and subsequent surgical irrigation and debridement at an urban tertiary care children's hospital between January 2007 and October 2016 were identified. Results of the synovial fluid Gram stain, as well as synovial cell count/differential and serum markers, were evaluated.

Results

A total of 302 patients that underwent incision and drainage for suspected SA were identified. In total, 102 patients (34%) had positive synovial fluid cultures and 47 patients (16%) had a microorganism detected on Gram stain. Gram stain sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SA were 0.40 and 0.97, respectively. This yielded a number needed to misdiagnose of 4.5 (ie, every fifth patient was misdiagnosed by Gram stain). For gram-negative organisms, the sensitivity dropped further to 0.13, with only 2/16 gram-negative organisms identified on Gram stain. Stepwise regression showed that age, serum white blood cell, and absolute neutrophil count were significant independent predictors for having a true positive Gram stain result. Elevated synovial white blood cell count was a significant predictor of having an accurate (culture matching the Gram stain) result.

Conclusions

The Gram stain result is a poor screening tool for the detection of SA and is particularly ineffective for the detection of gram-negative organisms. The clinical relevance of the Gram stain and cost-effectiveness of this test performed on every joint aspiration sent for culture requires additional evaluation. Patients with gram-negative SA may be at high risk for inadequate coverage with empiric antibiotics due to poor detection of gram-negative organisms on initial Gram stain.

Methods

SF cell count TAT was identified as an opportunity for a multidisciplinary QI project after anecdotal reports of delays in the OR at a tertiary care paediatric hospital. Process review by key stakeholders from the OR, orthopaedic surgery and clinical laboratory teams identified several barriers, including specimen ordering and labelling, specimen transport, prioritisation of testing within the lab and communication of results. After multidisciplinary discussion, changes to the specimen collection and resulting process were made in September 2020: the surgical OR team called to alert the haematology laboratory of incoming emergent (stat) cell count, the surgical team maintained responsibility for transportation of the specimen, haematology immediately processed and notified the OR team with results, and haematology then was responsible for transportation of the specimen to microbiology for further testing. In July of 2022, a coloured paper tag was added to samples ('stat card') that served as a visual reminder to laboratory staff that the sample was to be prioritised (figure 1).

Objective

To determine the frequency of adverse events of diagnostic arthrocentesis in patients with possible gout.

Methods

Consecutive patients underwent arthrocentesis and were evaluated at 6 weeks to determine adverse events. The 95% CI were obtained by bootstrapping.

Results

Arthrocentesis was performed in 910 patients, and 887 (97.5%) were evaluated for adverse events. Any adverse event was observed in 12 participants (1.4%, 95% CI 0.6–2.1). There was 1 case (0.1%, 95% CI 0–0.34) of septic arthritis.

Conclusions

Diagnostic arthrocentesis is associated with a low frequency of adverse events. Septic arthritis rarely occurs.

Septic arthritis is a disabling and possibly life-threatening disease that requires early diagnosis for optimal management. It is important that clinical and imaging features of septic arthritis be promptly identified. In addition, because other disease entities may have characteristics similar to those of septic arthritis, analysis of a needle biopsy specimen may be necessary for differential diagnosis. Radiologists may be asked to perform emergent aspiration of a possibly infected joint. It is important that those who perform aspiration procedures be familiar with a safe and effective imaging-guided arthrocentesis technique that is tailored to the individual patient and the specific joint affected.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for the detection of hip effusion and septic arthritis in adult patients with hip pain and negative initial imaging [^366cfca9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute or recurrent hip pain in adults can be a challenging presentation in the emergency department. While ultrasound is routinely used in the evaluation of pediatric patients with hip pain and a new limp, it is not commonly used for this purpose in adult emergency medicine. This case series demonstrates the clinical utility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in adult patients with acute or recurrent hip pain because performance of POCUS was the critical action that led to the identification of pathologic hip effusions in this series of adults.

Case Series

This case series includes 5 patients in whom clinical suspicion existed for the presence of a hip effusion and possible septic arthritis, despite nondiagnostic radiographic findings. Ultrasound was used to detect the effusion and guide subsequent arthrocentesis, imaging, or surgical intervention. In all patients, computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging scans were later used to confirm the presence of effusion. In all 5 patients (2 women and 3 men, with a mean age of 47.4 years), POCUS accurately detected the presence of hip effusion. Two of 5 synovial collections were caused by septic arthritis as confirmed by synovial fluid microbiologic examination. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case series emphasizes the clinical utility of POCUS in adult patients with acute and recurrent hip pain to detect a hip effusion, particularly in patients with significant risk factors for septic arthritis. POCUS can also be used to guide further imaging, arthrocentesis, surgical consultation, and intervention.

### Laboratory tests in adults with monoarticular arthritis: can they rule out a septic joint? [^52f91926]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

It is difficult to differentiate septic arthritis from other causes of monoarticular arthritis solely with a history and physical examination. The clinician must rely on ancillary tests to make a diagnosis, such as the white blood cell count of peripheral blood (WBC), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the white blood cell count of the joint fluid (jWBC) obtained from arthrocentesis. Although it is known that septic arthritis is associated with abnormalities in these tests, the majority of the data are based on studies in the pediatric population. In addition, although several emergency medicine texts indicate that a jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm(3) is "positive", it is known that septic arthritis can occur in patients with low jWBCs.

Objectives

To determine whether specific ancillary tests have sufficiently high sensitivities to rule out septic arthritis in adults.

Methods

This was a retrospective consecutive case series of patients from an urban emergency department (ED). Patients at least 18 years old who had septic arthritis confirmed by positive arthrocentesis culture or operative findings were included in the study. WBC greater than 11,000 cells/mm(3), ESR greater than 30 mm/hr, and jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm(3) were considered elevated.

Results

Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria. The sensitivities of an elevated WBC, ESR, or jWBC in adults who had septic arthritis were 48%, 96%, and 64%, respectively. There were broad ranges of WBC, ESR, or jWBC among the patients. More than one third of adult patients with septic arthritis had jWBCs less than 50,000 cells/mm(3). All patients had an abnormality in at least one of these tests.

Conclusions

The WBC, ESR, and jWBC are extremely variable in adults with septic arthritis. Laboratory tests do not rule out septic arthritis with accuracy.

### Pilot study analysis of serum cytokines to differentiate pediatric septic arthritis and transient synovitis [^79f92b04]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In pediatric patients, the presentation of the nontraumatic acutely painful joint/limb poses a diagnostic dilemma due to the similarity of presentations of the most likely diagnoses [septic arthritis (SA), transient synovitis (TS), osteomyelitis]. Current tools employed to differentiate these diagnoses rely on nonspecific inflammatory markers, radiologic imaging, and arthrocentesis. Diagnostic algorithms utilizing these clinical, radiographic, and biochemical parameters have produced conflicting results. The purpose of this study was to identify a serum-based inflammatory signature which can differentiate SA from TS in pediatric patients.

Methods

Serum samples were collected from 22 pediatric patients presenting with joint/extremity pain whose working diagnosis included SA or TS. Each sample was analyzed for serum abundance of 72 distinct biomarkers and cytokines using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay based arrays. Linear discriminant analysis was performed to identify a combinatorial biomarker panel to predict a diagnosis of SA or TS. Efficacy of the biomarker panel was compared with definitive diagnoses as based on laboratory tests, arthrocentesis results, and clinical scenario.

Results

At the time of presentation: (1) mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the SA group was 56.6mm/h and 12.4mm/h in the TS group (P < 0.001), (2) mean C-reactive protein was 55.9mg/dL in the SA group and 13.7mg/dL in the TS group (P = 0.12), and (3) mean white blood cell was 10.9k/mm3 in the SA group and 11.0k/mm3 in the TS group (P = 0.95). A combined panel of 72 biomarkers was examined using discriminant analysis to identify a limited set of predictors which could accurately predict whether a patient was diagnosed with SA or TS. A diagnostic algorithm consisting of transforming growth factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-7, IL-33, and IL-28A serum concentration correctly classified 20 of the 22 cases with a sensitivity and specificity of 90.9% (95% confidence interval: 73.9%-100.0%).

Conclusion

This study identifies a novel serum-based 4-cytokine panel that accurately differentiates SA from TS in pediatric patients with joint/limb pain.

### Characterization of fibroblast-like synoviocytes from the synovial fluid of patients affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^f2b189d3]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Seven patients fulfilling the 2001 ILAR classification criteria for various JIA subtypes and undergoing therapeutic arthrocentesis at the Unit of Rheumatology and Autoinflammatory Diseases, Department of Pediatric Sciences, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, were enrolled in the study between 2018 and 2023. All patients had clinically active disease with joint effusion, swelling, pain, and stiffness at the time of sampling. The number of active joints was determined by standard clinical evaluation followed by US or MRI evaluation. Arthrocentesis was performed under local anaesthesia or, in case of younger patients or multiple joints, under general sedation. Five children not affected by rheumatic conditions and undergoing minor surgical procedures at the Gaslini Institute were enrolled as a control group. The main demographic and clinical characteristics of the study cohort at the time of sampling are reported in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1.

Demographic and clinical data for JIA patients and control children

SF sample collection, cell isolation and culture

SF aspirates were obtained by knee arthrocentesis and collected into tubes containing EDTA, as described by Raggi et al. in 2022 and 2023. FLSs were isolated from the SF of patients, as detailed by Stebulis et al. Briefly, SF from patients undergoing arthrocentesis was centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at room temperature (RT) within 2 h of collection, and the cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with added 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco, Waltham, USA), 1% Pen/Strep, and 1% Glutammine (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) (complete medium). Cells were cultured at 37°C and trypsinized when 80% confluence was reached. Primary cultures were passaged three times to ensure that FLSs were the predominant cell types. For stimulation experiments, cells were seeded at 3 × 10 4 /ml in 12-well plates and treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml, Peprotech, Waltham, USA) for 24 h.

Skin fibroblasts (sFBs) from biopsies of children undergoing minor surgical procedures were used as controls (CTR).

Ultrasonography — practice recommendation and follow-up advises that ultrasonography is readily available, relatively low cost, and does not require sedation; the sensitivity for joint effusion is high (approximately 90%) though the absence of effusion does not completely rule out ABA; many false negatives occurred in the first 24 hours and children with a negative ultrasound result for effusion should have a repeat ultrasound examination or MRI if clinical suspicion persists; delay in appropriate therapy in children with falsely negative ultrasounds results in unfavorable outcomes for affected joints; because the overall benefits exceed risks, the panel makes a strong recommendation that ultrasonography of the affected joint be performed before more complex and less widely available imaging tests.

### The utility of leukocyte esterase strip test in the diagnosis of pediatric septic arthritis [^0b334654]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Most tests used to diagnose pediatric septic arthritis are either not accurate or do not produce rapid results. A leukocyte esterase (LE) strip test has previously been validated for the diagnosis of adult native and periprosthetic joint infections. The purpose of this prospective study was to: (1) evaluate the performance characteristics of the LE strip test in the diagnosis of pediatric septic arthritis and (2) determine the false positive rate of LE strip test on the aseptic synovial fluid (SF).

Methods

Between May 2016 and November 2018, SF was obtained from children who were hospitalized at our tertiary referral center on the basis of suspicion of septic arthritis. All patients underwent arthrocentesis, and the aspirate was tested with LE strip test, leukocyte count, and culture. Twenty-five patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. For the second part of the study, SF from 25 children undergoing surgery for developmental dysplasia of the hip was collected and tested with LE strip test, leukocyte count, and culture.

Results

In the first part of this study, 19 joints were classified as septic and 6 as aseptic. Considering a positive LE strip test ("++" and "+++" readings) indicative of septic arthritis yielded a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 83%, positive predictive value of 95%, and negative predictive value of 100%. In the second part, all 25 patients with an aseptic SF had a negative test result ("-" and "+" readings).

Conclusions

The LE strip test seems to be a valuable additional tool in the diagnosis of pediatric septic arthritis. The LE strip test has the advantages of being inexpensive and simple, providing real-time results and having a perfect negative predictive value to rule out the diagnosis of septic arthritis.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) timing of empiric antimicrobials — In children with presumed ABA who are ill-appearing or have rapidly progressive infection, we recommend immediately starting empiric antimicrobial therapy (after blood cultures are obtained if possible) rather than withholding antibiotics until invasive diagnostic procedures are performed (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), and invasive diagnostic procedures should occur as soon as feasible, even if antibiotics have already been administered. In children with presumed ABA who do not appear clinically ill, we suggest withholding antimicrobial therapy, while under careful observation, until an initial joint aspirate is collected for diagnostic purposes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The decision to initiate antimicrobials prior to invasive diagnostic procedures depends on the severity of the clinical presentation, local accessibility to experts and resources or, if appropriate, the time required for transport to a higher level of care for additional diagnostic or debridement procedures. The ability to diagnose pathogens by molecular diagnostic techniques suggests that critical information on pathogen identity is now less dependent on obtaining bacterial cultures prior to starting antimicrobial therapy.

### Clinical and biologic characteristics of Kingella kingae-induced septic arthritis of the knee in young children [^4e88ed0e]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Septic arthritis of the knee is one of the most frequently observed forms of K. kingae -induced joint infection. As with the other osteoarticular infections due to K. kingae, septic arthritis induced by this pathogen is reported to present with a milder clinical picture than pyogenic pathogens. The modified Kocher–Caird criteria only have a limited utility in predicting K. kingae -induced septic arthritis of the knee, but this is also the case for knee infections caused by other pathogens. However, as several previous studies have suggested, we believe the inability to bear weight is probably the strongest independent risk factor for septic arthritis of the knee, especially when K. kingae is the microorganism responsible, and we insist that to have a clear diagnosis, an arthrocentesis should be considered.

### Differentiation between septic arthritis and transient synovitis of the hip in children with clinical prediction algorithms [^b942066f]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiation between septic arthritis and transient synovitis of the hip in children can be difficult. Kocher et al. recently developed a clinical prediction algorithm for septic arthritis based on four clinical variables: history of fever, non-weight-bearing, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of ≥ 40 mm/hr, and a serum white blood-cell count of > 12000/mm(3) (> 12.0 x 10(9)/L). The purpose of this study was to apply this clinical algorithm retrospectively to determine its predictive value in our patient population.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed to identify all children who had undergone a hip arthrocentesis for the evaluation of an irritable hip at our institution between 1992 and 2000. One hundred and sixty-three patients with 165 involved hips satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the study and were classified as having true septic arthritis (twenty hips), presumed septic arthritis (twenty-seven hips), or transient synovitis (118 hips).

Results

Patients with septic arthritis (true and presumed; forty-seven hips) differed significantly (p < 0.05) from patients with transient synovitis (118 hips) with regard to the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, differential of serum white blood-cell count, total white blood-cell count and differential in the synovial fluid, gender, previous health-care visits, and history of fever. If the four independent multivariate predictors of septic arthritis proposed by Kocher et al. were present, the predicted probability of the patient having septic arthritis was 59% in our study, in contrast to the 99.6% predicted probability in the patient population described by Kocher et al. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the best model to describe our patient population was based on three variables: a history of fever, a serum total white blood-cell count of > 12000/mm(3) (> 12.0 x 10(9)/L), and a previous health-care visit. When all three variables were present, the predicted probability of the patient having septic arthritis was 71%.

Conclusions

Although the use of a clinical prediction algorithm to differentiate between septic arthritis and transient synovitis may have improved the utility of existing technology and medical care to facilitate the diagnosis at the institution at which the algorithm originated, application of the algorithm proposed by Kocher et al. or of our three-variable model does not appear to be valid at other institutions.

### Safety of arthrocentesis and joint injection in patients receiving anticoagulation at therapeutic levels [^1e36cf37]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Arthrocentesis and joint injections are commonly performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic indications. Because of safety concerns, there is often reluctance to perform these procedures in patients who are receiving anticoagulation at therapeutic levels. This study was undertaken to determine the safety of arthrocentesis and joint injection performed by physicians from different disciplines in patients who are anticoagulated.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 640 arthrocentesis and joint injection procedures performed in 514 anticoagulated patients between 2001 and 2009. We assessed the incidence of early and late clinically significant bleeding in or around a joint, infection, and procedure-related pain. We further compared the incidence of these complications in 456 procedures performed in patients with an international normalized ratio 2.0 or greater and 184 procedures performed in patients with an international normalized ratio less than 2.0.

Results

Only 1 procedure (0.2%) resulted in early, significant, clinical bleeding in the fully anticoagulated group. There was no statistically significant difference in early and late complications between patients who had procedures performed with an international normalized ratio 2.0 or greater and those whose anticoagulation was adjusted to an international normalized ratio less than 2.0.

Conclusion

Arthrocentesis and joint injections in patients receiving chronic warfarin therapy with therapeutic international normalized ratio are safe procedures. There does not seem to be a need for reducing the level of anticoagulation before procedures in these patients.

Introduction: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease in children and is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Cytological analysis of synovial fluid (SF) plays an important role in the differential diagnosis of arthritis.

Objectives: To assess the association between the clinical and laboratory characteristics of JIA and the cytological findings of SF.

Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted between February 2022 and December 2024. The study included all patients who were ultimately diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and who had undergone diagnostic arthrocentesis at presentation. Patients were excluded if they had received anti-inflammatory therapy prior to arthrocentesis, if an adequate amount of synovial fluid for cytological analysis was not obtained, or if the joint puncture was traumatic.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis — empiric antibiotics before joint fluid collection and patient outcomes: The guideline's review was unable to find prospectively collected data on risks and benefits of delaying empiric antimicrobial therapy in presumed ABA; instead, six retrospective observational studies with small samples and only unadjusted analyses evaluated empiric antibiotic administration prior to joint fluid collection. All six studies reported culture yield with or without antibiotic pre-treatment, and pooled analysis suggested a comparable yield of synovial fluid cultures with antibiotic pre-treatment (RD: 1.2% increased yield [95%CI: -12.0 to 14.5%]). Analyses of patient-important outcomes indicated that delaying antibiotics until after joint fluid collection may or may not have reduced complications (RD: -12.0%, 95%CI: -33.0 to 9.0%) and the requirement for repeat irrigation and debridement ("washouts") (RD: -4.0%, 95%CI: -25.3 to 17.0%), with certainty in the evidence judged very low due to very serious risk of bias, unadjusted analyses, and imprecision.

### Fever and knee effusion in the pediatric patient [^e60a54ad]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The pediatric patient with fever and knee effusion is always a cause for clinical concern. A thorough history and physical examination is required to guide appropriate diagnostic evaluation and management. Although pediatric knee effusions are common in the setting of trauma, the presence of fever should prompt consideration of infectious, rheumatologic, vasculitic, and malignant etiologies. This review covers the key components of the history, physical examination, diagnostic strategies, common etiologies, and initial management of the pediatric patient with fever and knee effusion.

### Tenosynovial giant cell tumor mimicking acute septic arthritis of the hip: a case report [^b206ef5f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

When a child presents with acute, atraumatic joint pain with inability to bear weight and pain with joint motion, ruling out septic arthritis is paramount. Delay in treatment of a septic joint, especially a larger joint such as the hip, can lead to rapid deterioration or necrosis of the articular surface. When septic arthritis of the hip is suspected, the modified Kocher criteria are typically used. This patient presented with three of five criteria based on his inability to bear weight on the affected side and elevated ESR and CRP (> 40 mm/hr and > 2 mg/dL, respectively), which translates to an 83% probability of septic arthritis of the hip according to Caird et al.

Given the concern for septic arthritis in this patient, an arthrocentesis was done. Types of joint effusion can be categorized into four types — noninflammatory, inflammatory, septic, and hemorrhagic — each with their own criteria based on the synovial fluid analysis (Table 1). As in this case, arthrocentesis from previously reported cases of TGCT typically yielded bloody fluid with a high red blood cell count, variable WBC count, and a negative Gram stain, most consistent with hemorrhagic synovial fluid. With borderline results from serology and synovial fluid and an examination that was not entirely consistent with septic arthritis, other causes for joint pain must be suspected as well.

Table 1
Classification of Synovial Fluid

Imaging, such as MRI, helps delineate the differential diagnoses for atypical causes of joint pain, and in this case, raised suspicion for TGCT. However, at many institutions, MRI is not obtained before open irrigation and débridement for suspected septic arthritis, usually related to MRI availability. Delaying MRI until after an irrigation and débridement would have likely delayed or even missed this diagnosis, as a capsulotomy and irrigation and débridement — which is often done rather than a true débridement — would likely not visualize the intra-articular mass. Given the equivocal nature of this patient's symptoms and arthrocentesis, MRI before operating was vital to achieve an accurate, early diagnosis of TGCT and proper treatment. To not miss this diagnosis in pediatric patients, MRI should be obtained before surgical irrigation and débridement if there is an equivocal history and examination and hemorrhagic, inflammatory range, or nondiagnostic synovial fluid joint aspirations.

### Tenosynovial giant cell tumor mimicking acute septic arthritis of the hip: a case report [^880df827]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This case report identifies one of the few reported pediatric cases of TGCT presenting as an acute, irritable hip mimicking septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is of paramount concern in these presentations, and an infectious workup involving inflammatory markers, WBC count, and possibly arthrocentesis should be pursued. However, in patients with an equivocal examination and laboratory test results, TGCT — although uncommon — should be considered as part of the differential, and MRI of the affected joint should be obtained before surgical intervention to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment of this pathology.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — synovial fluid microbiology practices emphasize that cultures for aerobic bacteria are routinely performed and laboratories should use chocolate (lysed sheep's blood) agar, and for young children it is now common practice to inoculate joint fluid directly into an aerobic blood culture bottle. In some cases of culture positive ABA, the Gram stain may be negative, and narrowing antimicrobial therapy based solely on the Gram stain is not advised. Anaerobic, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures should not be performed routinely in otherwise healthy children with primary ABA but should be performed for children who are immunocompromised, have penetrating injury to the joint, or have failed primary treatment, and other studies on joint fluid (e.g., pH, protein, LDH, lactate) are no longer recommended for routine use in children with suspected ABA.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — advanced imaging and repeat invasive procedures after poor early response: In children with presumed or confirmed ABA who demonstrate a poor clinical and laboratory response within 48–96 hours (continued fever, persistent bacteremia and/or rising CRP) after initial invasive procedures (open or arthroscopy) and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, we suggest performing MRI if not previously obtained (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), with the comment that MRI is performed to evaluate for adjacent AHO, pyomyositis, or abscess as potential indications of ineffective source control to determine whether additional invasive procedures should be considered. In children with presumed or confirmed primary ABA who demonstrate a poor clinical and laboratory response within 48–96 hours (continued fever, persistent bacteremia and/or rising CRP) after initial invasive procedures, and evidence to suggest persisting foci of infection (ineffective source control), we suggest additional invasive procedures to ensure adequate source control (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), with the comment that when ABA is associated with adjacent osteomyelitis, management should follow the osteomyelitis guideline. The summary of evidence notes that many children will re-accumulate fluid in the joint space despite the initial invasive procedure(s), that fluid re-accumulation is not a cause for undue concern among children who are clinically improving, and that ongoing observation with clinical reassessments is generally appropriate.

### Does this adult patient have septic arthritis? [^4588d06b]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

In patients who present with an acutely painful and swollen joint, prompt identification and treatment of septic arthritis can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To review the accuracy and precision of the clinical evaluation for the diagnosis of nongonococcal bacterial arthritis.

Data Sources

Structured PubMed and EMBASE searches (1966 through January 2007), limited to human, English-language articles and using the following Medical Subject Headings terms: arthritis, infectious, physical examination, medical history taking, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity and specificity.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of historical items, physical examination, serum, or synovial fluid laboratory data for diagnosing septic arthritis.

Data Extraction

Three authors independently abstracted data from the included studies.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen studies involving 6242 patients, of whom 653 met the gold standard for the diagnosis of septic arthritis, satisfied all inclusion criteria. Two studies examined risk factors and found that age, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, joint surgery, hip or knee prosthesis, skin infection, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection significantly increase the probability of septic arthritis. Joint pain (sensitivity, 85%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 78%-90%), a history of joint swelling (sensitivity, 78%; 95% CI, 71%-85%), and fever (sensitivity, 57%; 95% CI, 52%-62%) are the only findings that occur in more than 50% of patients. Sweats (sensitivity, 27%; 95% CI, 20%-34%) and rigors (sensitivity, 19%; 95% CI, 15%-24%) are less common findings in septic arthritis. Of all laboratory findings readily available to the clinician, the 2 most powerful were the synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells from arthrocentesis. The summary likelihood ratio (LR) increased as the synovial fluid WBC count increased (for counts < 25,000/microL: LR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23–0.43; for counts ≥ 25,000/microL: LR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.5–3.4; for counts > 50,000/microL: LR, 7.7; 95% CI, 5.7–11.0; and for counts > 100,000/microL: LR, 28.0; 95% CI, 12.0–66.0). On the same synovial fluid sample, a polymorphonuclear cell count of at least 90% suggests septic arthritis with an LR of 3.4 (95% CI, 2.8–4.2), while a polymorphonuclear cell count of less than 90% lowers the likelihood (LR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25–0.47).

Conclusions

Clinical findings identify patients with peripheral, monoarticular arthritis who might have septic arthritis. However, the synovial WBC and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells from arthrocentesis are required to assess the likelihood of septic arthritis before the Gram stain and culture test results are known.

### Approach to knee effusions [^e52b3622]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of an intra-articular knee effusion requires an extensive differential diagnosis and a systematic diagnostic approach. Pediatric knee effusions occur most commonly as acute hemarthroses after traumatic injury. However, the knee joint is susceptible to effusions secondary to a wide variety of atraumatic causes. Special attention is required in the atraumatic effusion to distinguish features of infectious, postinfectious, rheumatologic, hematologic, vasculitic, and malignant disease. This review discusses the various etiologies of both traumatic and atraumatic pediatric knee effusions highlighting the historical, physical examination, and laboratory characteristics to aid the emergency provider in diagnosis and initial management.

Routine preoperative MRI prior to arthrotomy — effects on surgery and length of stay: A retrospective pre/post-implementation study identified in the systematic review assessed routine preoperative MRI in patients with ABA and found reduced need for repeat surgery (RR: 0.57, 95%CI: .33 to .96) but no significant impact on unplanned repeat surgery (RR: 0.71, 95%CI: .45 to 1.11) or LOS (3.2 days shorter, p-value = 0.2); these estimates were judged uncertain due to very serious risk of bias and imprecision.

### Current approach to the evaluation and management of septic arthritis [^7ad9509d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis is an emergent condition caused by bacterial infection of a joint space. The most common etiology is hematogenous spread from bacteremia, but it can also occur from direct inoculation from bites, injection injuries, cellulitis, abscesses, or local trauma. Septic arthritis occurs most frequently in the lower extremities, with the hips and knees serving as the most common locations. The most sensitive findings include pain with motion of the joint, limited range of motion, tenderness of the joint, new joint swelling, and new effusion. Laboratory testing and imaging can support the diagnosis, but the criterion standard is diagnostic arthrocentesis. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics and joint decompression.

Subjects positive for K. kingae had a median (IQR) age of 17.6 months (13.9–28.6), and 53% were female. Most subjects (90%) had no underlying conditions. Less than 30% of subjects presented with fever at admission, and most had normal to mild elevations in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and white blood cell count, Table 1). Nearly all subjects were admitted (98%) primarily to Infectious Disease and Orthopedics units (87 and 6.7%, respectively) for a median (IQR) of 3 (1–17) days. Forty-three (96%) subjects had surgical interventions, including arthrocentesis, arthrotomy, incision and drainage, IR/CT, and/or US-guided aspiration, and bone biopsy. Across all 45 subjects, 23 (51%) were diagnosed with acute bacterial arthritis (ABA), 15 (33%) with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO), three (6.7%) with ABA and AHO, two (4.4%) with myositis, and two (4.4%) with (spondylo)discitis.

Introduction: Lipoma arborescens (LA) is a rare cause of chronic monoarticular arthritis. It should be considered during investigation of oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Objectives: To report the case of a teenage boy presenting with chronic monoarthritis of the knee undergoing investigation for JIA and tuberculous monoarthritis. The diagnosis of LA was based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological study.

Methods: Case report and narrative literature review.

Results: A 12-year-old boy presented with a 2-year history of pain and progressive swelling of the left knee. No morning stiffness, nor impact in daily activities. No history of trauma or constitutional symptoms. He underwent multiple arthrocentesis for pain relief previous to pediatric rheumatologist referral.

On clinical examination, patient presented warm left knee, painless diffuse effusion and asymmetric length of legs. Laboratory tests showed no elevated inflammatory parameters, and negative antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and HLA-B27. Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was 7 mm and normal chest x-ray. MRI showed marked effusion, synovial proliferation, post synovial fatty metaplasia, absence of bone erosions, subcortical bone edema in periphery of femoral condyles.

There was no response to treatment prescribed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. During follow up, needle aspiration was performed yielding 60 mL of aseptic citrine-colored fluid tested negative for Gene xpert and bacilloscopy. Histological assessment was performed after a synovial biopsy and diagnosis was consistent with LA.

Conclusion: Diagnostic of JIA requires ruling out other causes, including infections. Thorough investigation is mandatory in monoarthritis, including laboratory tests, imaging studies, synovial fluid analysis and biopsy in selected cases.

We describe the case aiming to raise suspicion of LA during pediatric rheumatology consultation. LA is a rare benign tumor characterized by villonodular proliferation of the synovium. There is fewer than 100 cases reported. It usually affects knee joint, in the suprapatellar pouch. Presents as slow progressive swelling, pain and effusion. Laboratory tests are normal. MRI is the imaging method of choice. Treatment is mostly by open or arthroscopic synovectomy with low risk of recurrence.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (follow-up), IDSA/PIDS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining sequential monitoring of CRP, in addition to serial clinical evaluation, to assess treatment response in pediatric patients with presumed or confirmed acute bacterial arthritis receiving antimicrobial therapy with or without surgical intervention.

Presumed acute bacterial arthritis with negative cultures — In the absence of a positive culture, there is no "gold standard" for pediatric ABA treatment; decisions to continue antimicrobial therapy rely on clinical findings, apparent response, and supporting laboratory tests. Children with presumed ABA tend to have less systemic inflammation, shorter duration of fever, and a shorter hospital LOS than those with confirmed pyogenic pathogens such as S. aureus; children with documented K. kingae arthritis tend to have findings more similar to presumed ABA. Reasons for negative cultures include: presence of fastidious organisms (K. kingae, N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis), receipt of antibiotics prior to aspiration, inhibition of bacterial growth in purulent joint fluid, microbial density below detection for culture or PCR, and non-infectious causes such as transient nonbacterial synovitis or reactive arthritis.

### COVID-19-associated arthritis: an emerging new entity? [^e2ee46e2]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review, we gathered all published data on patients with COVID-19-associated arthritis. We summarised a total of 33 cases in two categories: onset up to 1 week after COVID-19 (7 cases), and onset > 1 week after COVID-19 (26 cases).

We propose a new classification for cases of arthritis possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: 'COVID-19-associated arthritis'. The distinction between reactive and viral arthritis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is artificial and there is no consensual definition for either of them, both in terms of clinical presentation as well as in terms of the required period of time between the onset of COVID-19 and the onset of arthritis. Some of the cases described are outside of the interval of time described as typical of reactive arthritis (1–4 weeks); these are reports in which the articular symptoms started before or at the same time as COVID-19 symptoms or in which the articular symptoms started at least 1 month after of the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Since important differential diagnoses of viral and reactive arthritis include crystal arthropathy, septic arthritis and other chronic inflammatory joint diseases, serological evaluation and synovial fluid analysis are critical investigations. Arthrocentesis results were reported in 10 cases, and no crystal and/or microorganisms were detected in the synovial fluid of these patients.

Our study has limitations. It is based on a small number of reports and these being descriptive and voluntary observations they are prone to ascertainment and publication bias, and findings may not be generalisable to other populations and settings. Moreover, some cases were better documented than others, and for example, important investigations such as autoantibody and serological testing and synovial fluid analysis were not systematically performed. Furthermore, the SLR did not find epidemiological data about the incidence or prevalence of cases of viral and/or reactive arthritis during specific periods of the pandemic, which could be compared with the incidence or prevalence of cases of COVID-19 infection during the same period of the pandemic, and with the incidence or prevalence of cases of viral and/or reactive arthritis before the pandemic, in the same geographical area — this type of data could allow to better infer regarding a potential causal association between COVID-19 and arthritis, as studied in Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Executive summary — non-invasive diagnostic laboratory tests in suspected acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — states that in children with suspected ABA, we recommend performing a blood culture prior to administration of antimicrobial therapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). We suggest measuring serum C-reactive protein (CRP) on initial evaluation (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), noting that serum CRP has a low accuracy to establish the diagnosis of ABA but an elevated initial CRP can serve as the baseline value for sequential monitoring that may guide decision-making regarding duration of antimicrobial therapy. We suggest against measuring serum procalcitonin (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

### Role of ultrasound and inflammatory factors in the management of pediatric hip joint effusion [^378a1461]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The average volume of aspirated fluid was 2.5 times the volume of fluid measured in the anterior recess of hip. Since septic arthritis was not observed in any of the patients with effusion volume < 0.5 cc and normal inflammatory factors, conservative management and close follow-up can be recommended in these patients instead of joint fluid aspiration.

### Intra-articular venous malformations of the knee: a diagnostic challenge [^2d7768c7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular venous malformations (IAVM) are rare benign vascular anomalies that usually affect young patients and most common locate in the knee. The terminology of these lesions is still ill-defined, as they are often termed in the literature as synovial hemangiomas. Early diagnosis can be difficult, because they usually present with nonspecific clinical manifestations that are similar those of other rheumatic diseases, especially juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Case Series

We conducted a retrospective analysis of five pediatric patients admitted to our units for recurrent swelling of the knee, and compared their characteristics with those of literature reports. The average age at first symptom and time from onset to diagnosis was 3.9 years (range 18 months-7 years) and 3.5 years (range 1–7 years), respectively. In our patients, an initial misdiagnosis of JIA, bleeding disorder or traumatic arthropathy was made. On MRI imaging, the features of the lesion were similar in all patients, and were marked by isointense-to-hypointense signal in T1-weighted images, and hyperintense signal in T2-weighted images. When performed, arthrocentesis led to aspiration of bloody fluid. The diagnosis was confirmed with a biopsy and histopathologic assessment in all patients. Open surgery enabled complete excision of the mass and was followed by stable remission over time in all cases.

Conclusions

Our report highlights the challenges that may be posed by the detection of knee IAVM and the frequent long delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. The key elements for early recognition include careful assessment of patient history, demonstration of bloody fluid on arthrocentesis, and proper interpretation of MRI scanning.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (follow-up), IDSA/PIDS 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid obtaining routine follow-up imaging in pediatric patients with primary acute bacterial arthritis with expected improvement during medical management with or without surgical intervention, associated with full clinical recovery.

Imaging approach for suspected pediatric ABA — role of MRI: The presumptive diagnosis of ABA can usually be made by a combination of clinical examination, laboratory tests and ultrasound without advanced imaging by MRI, and obtaining an MRI routinely in all children presenting with suspected ABA does not appear necessary; however, if plain radiographs and ultrasound have not provided sufficient information to determine need for joint aspiration or arthrotomy, then the advanced imaging modality of choice is MRI, which may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis, determining the extent of infection, identifying abscesses requiring surgical intervention, and distinguishing transient nonbacterial synovitis or other inflammatory arthritis from ABA.

C-reactive protein (CRP) in suspected acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — Despite limited diagnostic accuracy, in a child with suspected ABA, we suggest performing a CRP on initial evaluation, with the primary utility on admission as a baseline for serial measurements during the treatment course; CRP is offered in most hospital settings, can be obtained with other tests, is relatively inexpensive with results usually quickly available, and normal or minimally elevated concentrations of serum CRP do not exclude ABA but should prompt investigation of additional non-infectious etiologies.

### Septic arthritis of native joints [^114507c8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a rheumatologic emergency that may lead to disability or death. Prompt evacuation of the joint, either by arthrocentesis at the bedside, open or arthroscopic drainage in the operating room, or imaging-guided drainage in the radiology suite, is mandatory. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major cause of septic arthritis in the United States. MRSA joint infection seems to be associated with worse outcomes. Antibiotic courses of 3 to 4 weeks in duration are usually adequate for uncomplicated bacterial arthritis. Treatment duration should be extended to 6 weeks if there is imaging evidence of accompanying osteomyelitis.

Introduction: Mild painful knee swelling with functional limitation is one of the most common clinical picture at onset of monoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)

Objectives: To present an unusual condition featured by overlapping clinical signs typical of monoarticular JIA.

Methods: Diagnostic work-up including routine and immunological blood test combined to imaging assessments (i.e. knee ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and synovial biopsy was carried out. Literature revision of similar case report was performed to confirm significance of the findings

Results: A 12 year-old female presented with left knee swelling, mild pain and functional limitation, persisting for 8 weeks without history of recent trauma nor infections. Morning stiffness was not referred. Physical examination was unremarkable except for local mild painful swelling associated to functional limitation at squatting. General condition were good except for obesity. Eighteen months earlier, a similar episode occurred in the same joint and resolved following evacuative arthrocentesis with referred serosal synovial fluid. Persistent well-being was referred until the ongoing relapse. Given the personal and family history (i.e. psoriasis and autoimmune thyroiditis), onset of JIA was suspected. Routine tests, anti-streptococcal titer antibodies and autoimmune profiling were unremarkable while eye examination ruled out signs of uveitis. Knee ultrasound reported prominent diffuse synovial thickening with mamillated aspects, associated with mild corpuscolated joint effusion, without certain signs of hypervascularization. Pigmented villonodular hyperplasia was considered, and knees MRI performed. Surprisingly, MRI reported findings consistent with lipoma arborescens, a benign intra-articular tumor featured by villous synovial hypertrophy and lipomatous infiltration of the subsynovial tissue. Synovial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis and the patient was referred to orthopedics for therapeutical synovectomy

Imaging for suspected acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — initial studies: In children with suspected ABA, we recommend obtaining plain radiography of the affected joint and adjacent bones rather than not performing plain radiographs (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), noting that despite the low sensitivity of plain radiography for detecting joint effusion or adjacent osteomyelitis at initial presentation, other important etiologies of acute musculoskeletal pain may be identified; in children with suspected ABA who require further imaging to detect joint effusion, particularly of the hip or shoulder, we recommend performing ultrasonography of the affected joint.

### Ultrasound-guided hip arthrocentesis in the ED [^9f06c6e7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

In patients presenting with atraumatic joint pain and swelling, diagnosis is typically made by synovial fluid analysis. Management of an acute suspected hip joint arthritis can present a challenge to the emergency physician (EP). Hip joint effusions are somewhat more difficult to identify and aspirate than effusions in other joints that are commonly managed by EPs. Identification and aspiration of a hip joint effusion under ultrasound guidance is a well-established procedure in the fields of orthopedic surgery and interventional radiology. Here, we report 4 cases of ultrasound-guided hip arthrocentesis at the bedside by EPs; relevant technical details of the procedure are reviewed. These cases demonstrate the feasibility of ultrasound-guided hip arthrocentesis in the emergency department (ED) by EPs. With increasing availability of bedside ultrasound in the ED, suspected hip joint arthritis or infection may be evaluated and managed by the trained EP in a fashion similar to other joint arthritides.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (management of resistant disease), IDSA/PIDS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining MRI, if not previously obtained, in pediatric patients with presumed or confirmed acute bacterial arthritis demonstrating a poor clinical and laboratory response within 48–96 hours (continued fever, persistent bacteremia, and/or rising CRP) after initial invasive procedures (open or arthroscopic) and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — repeat procedures and drain management — retrospective hip ABA data identify risks for requiring a repeat procedure including higher preoperative temperature, initial misdiagnosis of ABA, longer time from initial symptoms to surgery, presenting CRP > 100 mg/L (normal < 10), presenting ESR > 40 mm/hour, adjacent AHO, and intraoperative cultures positive for MRSA. Serial aspirations have been reported to be required in between 4% to 20% of patients, and a small case series suggests failure with repeated aspirations may be higher among children older than 10 years. For arthroscopy-managed cases, serial arthroscopy was reported to be required in approximately 10–15% of patients, and one small series found that no children with knee ABA managed with arthroscopy required repeat procedures compared with 39% managed by open arthrotomy. Regarding drains, they are typically removed when output volume becomes low, usually within a few days of surgery. This is framed as a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty of evidence, recommending that children with primary ABA with worsening symptoms after an initial procedure have advanced imaging and a repeat procedure as necessary for source control.

### Predicting duration of beneficial effect of joint injection among children with chronic arthritis by measuring biomarkers concentration in synovial fluid at the time of injection [^cf583c69]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Intra-articular corticosteroids injection (IAC) is a mainstay for the treatment of children with chronic arthritis; nonetheless its efficacy showed variability among published studies and it is still not possible to predict the outcome in a single patient. Our objective was to study the profile of biomarkers in the synovial fluid (SF) obtained at the time of injection and establish if such profile predicts duration of effect.

Methods

SF obtained from patients who underwent knee arthrocentesis and injection was procured and stored for cytokine analysis. Records of those patients who had at least 6 months of follow-up from the injection were reviewed. Time to flare was recorded. Levels of IL-6, IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-2sR, MMP-3, IL-10 and TGF-Beta1 were measured by ELISA. For primary analysis each patient was utilized once. For secondary analysis each injected knee was considered a single event.

Results

60 samples from 33 patients were obtained. In the primary analysis we found a correlation between MMP-3 synovial fluid levels and outcome at 6 months (p = 0,02; p = 0,03 for different quartiles). In the secondary analysis we found that IL-6 and IL-10 levels predicted outcome at six and at 12 months (IL-6: p = 0.01; p = 0.02 respectively) (IL-10: p = 0.017; p = 0.01 respectively), with higher levels of IL-6 predicting shorter time to relapse and higher levels of IL-10 longer duration of corticosteroids effect.

Conclusions

Our study identified MMP-3 and possibly IL-6 and IL-10 as candidates for the development of a set of biomarkers to predict response to IAC among children with chronic arthritis at the time of injection.

### Current variation in joint aspiration practice for the evaluation of pediatric septic arthritis [^c2a1fcbe]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis (SA) in childhood is a rare condition, but one with the potential for serious sequelae if not identified early and appropriately treated. Because earlier diagnosis and treatment has been shown to increase the rate of satisfactory outcomes, numerous attempts have been made to standardize the evaluation of children with concern for SA. However, without universally accepted management guidelines for pediatric SA, there remains significant variability in the proposed algorithms for clinical evaluation and management of musculoskeletal infections. Differences can range from units of measure for predictive markers to joint aspiration protocols for diagnostic imaging.

Although institutional variation has been inferred from previous publications, no study has sought to objectively evaluate these variations in the evaluation of pediatric SA. Details about the areas of concordance and discordance in the assessment of pediatric SA will help guide protocol development efforts and drive future prospective studies.

The purpose of this study was to assess practice variations between pediatric tertiary care institutions during the evaluation and treatment of pediatric SA.

### Predictability of clinical knowledge through mobile app-based simulation for the treatment of pediatric septic arthritis: a pilot study [^c116d9f5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recently the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery and the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education have identified the treatment of septic arthritis of the hip in children as a milestone skill for all US orthopaedic residents. The purpose of this study was to test correlation between clinical knowledge and examination score on a mobile app-based training module for the treatment of pediatric septic hip arthritis.

Methods

A 4-part simulation model on surgical decision-making associated with the treatment of pediatric septic arthritis was developed through expert consensus. Orthopaedic trainees participating in the "Top Gun" program of the 2015 and 2016 International Pediatric Orthopaedic Symposiums were recruited to participate in this pilot study. Trainees completed a presimulation quiz on their knowledge of diagnosis, arthrocentesis, and surgical irrigation and debridement on a pediatric patient presenting with septic arthritis of the hip. Trainees then completed the 4-part simulation on the mobile app. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between the quiz and the simulation.

Results

A total of 53 orthopaedic residents and fellows participated in the simulation. Median quiz score was 87 points [interquartile range (IQR), 81 to 94] before the intervention and 100 points (IQR, 94 to 100) postintervention. The median simulation test score was 89 (IQR, 81 to 92) which demonstrated a positive correlation with the postintervention quiz (r = 0.44, P < 0.001). The preintervention metrics demonstrated a positive correlation with postintervention metrics (r = 0.53, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

This study revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between the mobile app simulation and the clinical knowledge of the participants, as well as the ability to improve knowledge about a procedure during the testing period. These findings support the ability for the mobile app to test clinical knowledge. In the current environment of decreased work hours and patient exposure for orthopaedic trainees, mobile app-based simulation has the potential to safely aid in assessment of orthopaedic residents and fellows.

### Role of ultrasound and inflammatory factors in the management of pediatric hip joint effusion [^fa08a5a1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Since these laboratory tests aren't always readily available, usage of joint aspiration under ultrasound guidance can be used to differentiate septic joints and transient synovitis. High WBC count as well as low fluid glucose increases the likelihood of septic joints and synovial fluid cultures are positive in most septic arthritis cases. Even though it does not always yield a definite result, needle aspiration of the hip joint is the most specific test in diagnosing septic arthritis; however, it is an invasive procedure with itself limitations.

Therefore, to reduce the need for joint aspiration and non-invasive management of patients, we compared the combination of ultrasound findings, and especially ultrasound estimation of hip joint fluid volume, with laboratory findings to assess differentiation septic arthritis from reactive arthritis.
