## Question

In VITAL-DEP, what was the effect of long-term marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on incident depression in older adults without clinically relevant depressive symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the effect of long-term marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on incident depression in older adults without clinically relevant depressive symptoms, based on the VITAL-DEP randomized clinical trial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and population. Then, I should verify the intervention and dosing. Next, I will examine the primary outcomes and statistical results. After that, I need to check safety signals and subgroup or sensitivity analyses. Finally, I will integrate these findings with broader evidence and translate them into clinical implications and limitations, making sure I cite the exact figures and confidence intervals from the trial report.

> Let me first confirm the study design and population so I don't misstate the context. VITAL-DEP was a large, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ancillary study nested within the VITAL parent trial, enrolling 18,353 adults aged 50 years or older without clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline, with a median treatment duration of 5.3 years and high retention, which gives it excellent power and generalizability for prevention questions in this population [^1a3dc57a] [^b8952c48].

> I need to verify the intervention details precisely. Participants were randomized to marine omega-3 fatty acids at 1 g/day providing 465 mg EPA and 375 mg DHA versus matching placebo, with a 2×2 factorial design also randomizing vitamin D, and the omega-3 versus placebo comparison was the focus for depression outcomes; importantly, there was no significant interaction between omega-3 and vitamin D, supporting the interpretability of the omega-3 arm results [^1a3dc57a] [^b8952c48].

> Now, let me examine the primary outcome on incident depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms. The omega-3 group had 651 events at 13.9 per 1000 person-years versus 583 events at 12.3 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.13 with a 95% CI of 1.01 to 1.26 and P = 0.03, indicating a small but statistically significant increase in depression risk with omega-3 supplementation over 5.3 years [^1a3dc57a] [^b8952c48].

> Wait, let me verify the continuous mood outcome so I don't overinterpret a single endpoint. The mean difference in change in PHQ-8 scores favored neither group, with a 0.03-point difference (95% CI, −0.01 to 0.07; P = 0.19), so there was no improvement in mood trajectories with omega-3 compared with placebo over time, which aligns with the lack of benefit on incident cases and reinforces that the signal is not favorable [^1a3dc57a] [^b8952c48].

> I should confirm safety signals and whether any adverse events could explain the modest increase in depression. Serious adverse events were balanced, including major cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, suicide, and gastrointestinal bleeding, and common symptoms like easy bruising and stomach upset were similar, so the observed increase in depression incidence does not appear attributable to overt toxicity or safety imbalances [^1a3dc57a] [^b8952c48].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering dose, formulation, and population context. The EPA dose here was 465 mg/day with an EPA:DHA ratio near 1.2:1, which is lower than some treatment literature suggesting benefit with higher EPA proportions and higher total EPA doses, and the population was community-dwelling older adults without baseline depressive symptoms, so prevention may differ mechanistically from treatment contexts where anti-inflammatory or membrane effects could be more salient [^1a3dc57a] [^b6786e51] [^eaa4b0f1].

> Next, I should review how these results fit with broader evidence. Large prevention trials like MooDFOOD also found no preventive benefit and even a slight signal toward worse symptoms with multinutrient supplements including omega-3s in overweight adults with subclinical depression, and meta-analyses of treatment studies show small, heterogeneous effects that often lose significance after accounting for publication bias, reinforcing that routine omega-3 supplementation should not be recommended for depression prevention in general populations [^e09272d9] [^dbdff207] [^defddfba].

> I will now examine clinical implications and guideline alignment. The VITAL-DEP authors conclude that their findings do not support the use of omega-3 supplements to prevent depression in adults, and this aligns with contemporary guidelines that advise against omega-3s for MDD treatment given low-certainty, small effects, and lack of preventive benefit signals in high-quality prevention trials, so omega-3s should not be prescribed for primary prevention of depression in older adults without symptoms [^1a3dc57a] [^6f14cefe].

> But wait, what if subgroups or baseline omega-3 status modified effects. VITAL-DEP did not show subgroup benefits by sex, race, or baseline mood risk strata in the main analyses, and while some treatment studies suggest baseline omega-3 levels may moderate response, that moderation has not translated into consistent prevention benefits in at-risk or general populations, so routine screening or targeted supplementation for prevention remains unsupported [^1a3dc57a] [^feb919e6] [^e09272d9].

> Let me reconsider the magnitude and clinical relevance so I don't overstate harm. The absolute risk increase is about 1.6 per 1000 person-years, translating to roughly 1 additional depression case per 625 person-years of omega-3 use, which is small at the individual level but directionally unfavorable and, at a population scale, argues against recommending omega-3s for depression prevention in this setting [^1a3dc57a] [^b8952c48].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line matches the data. In VITAL-DEP, long-term marine omega-3 supplementation at 1 g/day with 465 mg EPA and 375 mg DHA did not prevent depression and was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in incident depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms over 5.3 years, with no improvement in mood scores and no safety imbalance explaining the signal, so routine omega-3 supplementation should not be recommended for primary prevention of depression in older adults without depressive symptoms [^1a3dc57a] [^b8952c48].

In VITAL-DEP, long-term marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (1 g/day, 465 mg EPA, 375 mg DHA) **did not prevent depression** in older adults without clinically relevant depressive symptoms and was associated with a **small but statistically significant increase** in incident depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01–1.26) [^1a3dc57a] over a median 5.3 years. There was **no significant difference** in longitudinal mood scores (PHQ-8 change 0.03, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.07) [^1a3dc57a]. These findings do not support routine omega-3 supplementation for depression prevention in this population [^1a3dc57a].

---

## Study design and population

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial trial.
- **Population**: 18,353 adults aged ≥ 50 years without clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline [^1a3dc57a].
- **Intervention**: Marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day: 465 mg EPA, 375 mg DHA) vs placebo; median follow-up 5.3 years [^1a3dc57a].
- **Primary outcomes**: Incident depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms; change in PHQ-8 mood scores [^1a3dc57a].

---

## Primary outcomes

### Incident depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms

- **Omega-3 group**: 651 events, 13.9 per 1,000 person-years.
- **Placebo group**: 583 events, 12.3 per 1,000 person-years.
- **Hazard ratio**: 1.13 (95% CI 1.01–1.26; P = 0.03) [^1a3dc57a].

---

### Change in mood scores (PHQ-8)

Mean difference in PHQ-8 change: 0.03 points (95% CI −0.01 to 0.07; P = 0.19) — **no significant difference** [^1a3dc57a].

---

## Clinical significance

The **absolute risk increase** is 1.6 per 1,000 person-years (about 0.16% per year), indicating a small effect size. The **number needed to harm** is approximately 625 over 5.3 years, underscoring limited clinical impact.

---

## Safety and tolerability

Safety and tolerability were **similar between groups**, with no significant differences in major cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, suicide, gastrointestinal bleeding, easy bruising, or stomach upset/pain [^1a3dc57a].

---

## Comparison with previous evidence

Previous observational and interventional studies have shown mixed results, with some suggesting potential benefits in specific populations or with higher EPA content [^b6786e51] [^eaa4b0f1]. However, **large-scale RCTs** such as VITAL-DEP and MooDFOOD [^e09272d9] have not demonstrated preventive benefits in general or high-risk populations.

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: Results apply to older adults without baseline depressive symptoms; effects may differ in younger populations or those with existing depression.
- **Dose and formulation**: The EPA:DHA ratio and total dose may influence outcomes; higher EPA ratios have shown treatment benefits in some studies [^b6786e51] [^eaa4b0f1].
- **Biological mechanisms**: Omega-3s may have different effects on treatment versus prevention, potentially explaining the lack of preventive benefit observed here [^edcf2257].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Routine omega-3 supplementation is **not recommended** for depression prevention in older adults without clinically relevant depressive symptoms [^1a3dc57a]. Clinicians should prioritize evidence-based preventive strategies, such as psychotherapy, social engagement, and physical activity, and reserve omega-3 supplementation for specific clinical indications or as adjunctive therapy in diagnosed depression.

---

In VITAL-DEP, marine omega-3 supplementation **did not prevent depression** in older adults without depressive symptoms and was associated with a small increase in incident depression; routine use for prevention is not supported.

### Effect of long-term supplementation with marine omega-3 fatty acids vs placebo on risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms and on change in mood scores: a randomized clinical trial [^1a3dc57a]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Marine omega-3 fatty acid (omega-3) supplements have been used to treat depression but their ability to prevent depression in the general adult population is unknown.

Objective

To test effects of omega-3 supplementation on late-life depression risk and mood scores.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A total of 18 353 adults participated in the VITAL-DEP (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial-Depression Endpoint Prevention) ancillary study to VITAL, a randomized trial of cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention among 25 871 US adults. There were 16 657 at risk of incident depression (no previous depression) and 1696 at risk of recurrent depression (previous depression, but not for the past 2 years). Randomization occurred from November 2011 through March 2014; randomized treatment ended on December 31, 2017.

Interventions

Randomized 2×2 factorial assignment to vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d), marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/d of fish oil, including 465 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 375 mg of docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo; 9171 were randomized to omega-3 and 9182 were randomized to matching placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prespecified coprimary outcomes were risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms (total of incident+recurrent cases); mean difference in mood score (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8] depression scale).

Results

Among 18 353 participants who were randomized (mean age, 67.5 [SD, 7.1] years; 49.2% women), 90.3% completed the trial (93.5% among those alive at the end of the trial); the median treatment duration was 5.3 years. The test for interaction between the omega-3 and the vitamin D agents was not significant (P for interaction = .14). Depression risk was significantly higher comparing omega-3 (651 events, 13.9 per 1000 person-years) with placebo (583 events, 12.3 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.26; P = 0.03). No significant differences were observed comparing omega-3 with placebo groups in longitudinal mood scores: the mean difference in change in PHQ-8 score was 0.03 points (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.07; P = 0.19). Regarding serious and common adverse events, the respective prevalence values in omega-3 vs placebo groups were major cardiovascular events (2.7% vs 2.9%), all-cause mortality (3.3% vs 3.1%), suicide (0.02% vs 0.01%), gastrointestinal bleeding (2.6% vs 2.7%), easy bruising (24.8% vs 25.1%), and stomach upset or pain (35.2% vs 35.1%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults aged 50 years or older without clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline, treatment with omega-3 supplements compared with placebo yielded mixed results, with a small but statistically significant increase in risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms but no difference in mood scores, over a median follow-up of 5.3 years. These findings do not support the use of omega-3 supplements in adults to prevent depression.

The study VITAL-DEP was published by Olivia I Okereke and colleagues in 2021 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Major depressive disorder. In the VITAL-DEP study, the trial question was: what is the effect of long-term supplementation of marine omega-3 fatty acids in older adults without clinically relevant depressive symptoms? In the VITAL-DEP study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the VITAL-DEP study, the population was: 18353 patients (9023 female, 9330 male). The inclusion criteria were adults aged ≥ 50 years at risk of incident depression or at risk of recurrent depression. The key exclusion criteria were significant depressive symptoms, history of alcohol or substance disorder, use of psychotropics, hypothyroidism, major neurologic disorder or delirium episode in < 12 months. In the VITAL-DEP study, the interventions were: n = 9171 omega-3 (1 g/d of fish oil, including 465 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 375 mg of docosahexaenoic acid) n = 9182 placebo (matching omega-3 placebo). In the VITAL-DEP study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the incidence of of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms (13.9 events /1000 py vs. 12.3 events /1000 py; HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.26). In the VITAL-DEP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in suicide, gastrointestinal bleeding, easy bruising, stomach upset or pain. In the VITAL-DEP study, the conclusion was: in adults aged ≥ 50 years at risk of incident depression or at risk of recurrent depression, omega-3 was inferior to placebo with respect to the incidence of of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms.

### Effect of long-term vitamin D3 supplementation vs placebo on risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms and on change in mood scores: a randomized clinical trial [^8dab13c7]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D have been associated with higher risk for depression later in life, but there have been few long-term, high-dose large-scale trials.

Objective

To test the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on late-life depression risk and mood scores.

Design, Setting, and Participants

There were 18 353 men and women aged 50 years or older in the VITAL-DEP (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial-Depression Endpoint Prevention) ancillary study to VITAL, a randomized clinical trial of cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention among 25 871 adults in the US. There were 16 657 at risk for incident depression (ie, no depression history) and 1696 at risk for recurrent depression (ie, depression history but no treatment for depression within the past 2 years). Randomization occurred from November 2011 through March 2014; randomized treatment ended on December 31, 2017, and this was the final date of follow-up.

Intervention

Randomized assignment in a 2×2 factorial design to vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d of cholecalciferol) and fish oil or placebo; 9181 were randomized to vitamin D3 and 9172 were randomized to matching placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were the risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms (total of incident and recurrent cases) and the mean difference in mood scores (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale [PHQ-8]; score range, 0 points [least symptoms] to 24 points [most symptoms]; the minimal clinically important difference for change in scores was 0.5 points).

Results

Among the 18 353 randomized participants (mean age, 67.5 [SD, 7.1] years; 49.2% women), the median treatment duration was 5.3 years and 90.5% completed the trial (93.5% among those alive at the end of the trial). Risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms was not significantly different between the vitamin D3 group (609 depression or clinically relevant depressive symptom events; 12.9/1000 person-years) and the placebo group (625 depression or clinically relevant depressive symptom events; 13.3/1000 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.09]; P = 0.62); there were no significant differences between groups in depression incidence or recurrence. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups for change in mood scores over time; mean change in PHQ-8 score was not significantly different from zero (mean difference for change in mood scores, 0.01 points [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.05 points]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults aged 50 years or older without clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline, treatment with vitamin D3 compared with placebo did not result in a statistically significant difference in the incidence and recurrence of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms or for change in mood scores over a median follow-up of 5.3 years. These findings do not support the use of vitamin D3 in adults to prevent depression.

### Effects of vitamin dand marine omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on indicated and selective prevention of depression in older adults: results from the clinical center sub-cohort of the VITamin D and omegA-3 triaL (VITAL) [^07bf98e1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective: To test vitamin D 3 and omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3s) for late-life depression prevention under the National Academy of Medicine framework for indicated (targeting subthreshold depression) and selective (targeting presence of high-risk factors) prevention.

Methods: The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a 2×2 factorial trial of vitamin D 3 (2,000 IU/d) and/or omega-3s (1 g/d) for cardiovascular and cancer prevention (enrollment: November 2011-March 2014; end date: December 31, 2017). In this targeted prevention study, we included 720 VITAL clinical sub-cohort participants who completed neurobehavioral assessments at baseline and 2 years (91.9% retention). High-risk factors were subthreshold or clinical anxiety, impaired activities of daily living, physical/functional limitation, medical comorbidity, cognitive impairment, caregiving burden, problem drinking, and low psychosocial support. Coprimary outcomes were incident major depressive disorder (MDD), adjudicated using DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition), and change in mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). We used exact tests to determine treatment effects on MDD incidence and repeated-measures models to determine treatment effects on PHQ-9.

Results: A total of 11.1% had subthreshold depression, 60.8% had ≥ 1 high-risk factor, MDD incidence was 4.7% (5.1% among completers), and mean PHQ-9 score change was 0.02 points. Among those with subthreshold depression, the MDD risk ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.36 (0.06 to 1.28) for vitamin D 3 and 0.85 (0.25 to 2.92) for omega-3s, compared to placebo; results were also null among those with ≥ 1 high-risk factor (vitamin D 3 vs placebo: 0.63 [0.25 to 1.53]; omega-3s vs placebo: 1.08 [0.46 to 2.71]). There were no significant differences in PHQ-9 score change comparing either supplement with placebo.

Conclusions: Neither vitamin D 3 nor omega-3s showed benefits for indicated and selective prevention of late-life depression; statistical power was limited.

Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01696435.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and major depression: a mendelian randomization study [^cbe693a1]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating mental condition characterized by pervasive feelings of sadness and loss of interest and often accompanied by feelings of guilt, hopelessness, low energy and concentration, disturbances in sleep, appetite and suicidal ideation. Despite progress in treatment options for MDD, it remains a leading cause of global morbidity, affecting individuals, families, and societies. Each episode of MDD increases the likelihood of recurrence, with a significant proportion of individuals experiencing a chronic course of relapse and remission. Given the high prevalence, recurrence, and impact of MDD, interventions with even modest preventative effects may have significant population impacts.

The association between omega-3 fatty acids and MDD has been a focus of research for decades, but uncertainty about its true nature remains. While observational studies suggest inverse associations between omega-3 fatty acids and MDD, estimates are likely to be confounded by broader dietary consumption, socioeconomic factors, as well as reverse effects from poorer dietary habits among depressed individuals. Trials using omega-3 fatty acid supplements for MDD have yielded mixed results, possibly due to methodological heterogeneity. Recent meta-analyses have highlighted the impact of dose and EPA:DHA ratio on MDD outcomes with a minimum of 1–2 g per day and a minimum ratio of 2:1 advocated in current guidelines. Differences in selected populations, background dietary intakes, omega-3 measurements, MDD categorization, and oxidation of omega-3 fatty acid supplements over time may also complicate the planning and interpretation of trials. Trials using omega-3 fatty acids to prevent MDD could provide stronger evidence for an aetiological role, although these are more practical and financially onerous. Two recent prevention trials have not identified any benefit of omega-3 fatty acids above placebo on MDD incidence. In fact, the VITAL-DEP trial identified an increased risk of MDD from 1 g fish oil per day over 5 years (HR 1.13 (1.01–1.26), p = 0.03, n = 9171), although the authors acknowledged the EPA dose (465 g) and ratio (< 2:1) as a limitation. Similarly, the omega-3 arm of the MooDFOOD trial found no significant improvement of 1412 mg of EPA and DHA (3:1 ratio) on depressive symptoms in 682 participants over a 12-month follow-up compared to placebo. However, baseline MDD scores were high, and regression to the mean across groups limited statistical power. Furthermore, the MooDFOOD supplements included a combination of micronutrients, differential effects of which may have impacted outcomes. It is hard to ascertain whether minor methodological adaptations may have affected trial outcomes, and further investigation of causality may help to inform successful intervention development.

### Effect of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on risk of frailty: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^b6f2bed5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Preventive strategies for frailty are needed. Whether supplements with anti-inflammatory properties, such as vitamin D3 or marine omega-3 fatty acids, are useful for frailty prevention is unknown.

Objective

To test the effects of vitamin D3 and omega-3 supplements on change in frailty in older individuals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was conducted in 2021, as a prespecified ancillary to the Vitamin D and Omega-3 (VITAL) trial, a 2×2 factorial randomized clinical trial. A total of 25 871 individuals (men aged ≥ 50 years and women aged ≥ 55 years), without cancer or cardiovascular disease and with data on frailty, were recruited across all 50 US states from November 2011 to March 2014 and followed up through December 31, 2017. Data analysis for the ancillary study was conducted from December 1, 2019, to March 30, 2022.

Interventions

Vitamin D3, 2000 IU/d, and marine omega-3 fatty acids, 1 g/d.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Frailty was measured using a validated 36-item frailty index that includes measures of function, cognition, mood, and comorbidities from annual questionnaires. Change in frailty score from baseline to year 5, according to randomization, using an intention-to-treat protocol, was assessed using repeated measures. Cox proportional hazards regression models assessed incident frailty. In subgroup analysis, an alternative frailty definition, the physical phenotype, was used as a sensitivity analysis.

Results

Of 25 871 VITAL trial participants randomized, 25 057 had sufficient data to calculate a frailty index. Baseline mean (SD) age was 67.2 (7.0) years, and 12 698 (50.7.%) were women. Mean (SD) frailty score was 0.109 (0.090) (range, 0.00–0.685), and 3174 individuals (12.7%) were frail. During a median 5-year follow-up, mean (SD) frailty scores increased to 0.121 (0.099) (range, 0.00–0.792). Neither vitamin D3 nor omega-3 fatty acid supplementation affected mean frailty scores over time (mean difference at year 5: vitamin D3, -0.0002; P = 0.85; omega-3 fatty acid, -0.0001; P = 0.90) or rate of change in mean frailty score (interaction with time: vitamin D3; P = 0.98; omega-3 fatty acid; P = 0.13) Incident frailty remained similar over time (interaction with time: vitamin D3, P = 0.90; omega-3 fatty acid; P = 0.32). Results were unchanged using the frailty physical phenotype.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this ancillary study of the VITAL randomized clinical trial, treatment with vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, compared with placebo, did not affect the rate of frailty change or incidence over time. These results do not support routine use of either vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for frailty prevention in generally healthy community-dwelling older adults not selected for vitamin D3 deficiency.

### A role for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids in major depression? An exploration using genomics [^a3c0bbdf]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Depression-related disability is a major health and economic burden for societies that require an urgent answer. Nevertheless, despite depression's public health relevance, treatment options available nowadays are not optimal in terms of efficacy. Epidemiological evidences are constantly scanned in order to identify potentially actionable target that may substantially improve the prevention and treatment of depression. Recently developed genomic tools could be efficiently employed to examine the nature of observational associations emerging in epidemiology, providing some indications on the most promising associations to be prioritized in subsequent intervention studies. The premature and direct translation of observational associations in nutritional epidemiology into supplementation interventions may encounter indeed disappointing results, as emerging for different health outcomes. For instance, recent large-scale meta-analyses of randomized control studies have shown, for instance, that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent fractures, falls, or improve bone mineral density, or that n3-PUFA supplementation had no significant effect on coronary heart disease or major vascular events. More recently, results from the large VITALtrial testing n3-PUFA supplementation in > 25 000 participants showed no significant impact on the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases or cancer.

In conclusion, we believe that findings from the present study, in conjunction with previous conflicting evidence from clinical studies, represent a cautionary tale for further research testing the potential therapeutic effect of vitamin D and n3-PUFA supplementation on depression, as the expectations of a direct causal effect of these compounds on mood should be substantially reconsidered. Upcoming results from already established large-scale randomized controlled trials such as MoodFOODor VITAL-DEPwill tell whether this conclusion is correct. During the evaluation of the present manuscript results for the MoodFOOD trial were published, confirming that multinutrient supplementation (including vitamin D and omega-3) was not effective in preventing the onset of major depressive episodes.

### A role for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids in major depression? An exploration using genomics [^dc966d16]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent years a growing interest has emerged in the potential value of nutritional supplementation in mood disorders. Large-scale randomized controlled trials such as MoodFOOD(N ~ 1000) or ﻿VITAL-DEP(N ~ 25 000) have been established to test the effect of supplementation in the prevention of depression. The rationale for these interventions was inspired from epidemiological evidence of an inverse association between depression and circulating concentrations of compounds that could be easily supplemented, such as vitamin D and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA). Meta-analyses of large observational studies consistently reported cross-sectional, and to a lesser extent longitudinal, associations of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25-OH-D, the body reserve of vitamin D) and n3-PUFA with depression. – In > 2000 psychiatrically well-characterized participants from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), we previously confirmed, lower concentrations of 25-OH-D and n3-PUFA in patients with depression as compared to healthy controls, and inverse associations with symptom severity. Previous clinical studies attempted to translate this observational evidence in interventions: meta-analyses – pooling results from trials testing the effect of vitamin D and omega-3 supplements on depression reported conflicting findings, with studies showing both small clinical effect and no effect. Conflicting findings have been commonly attributed to heterogeneity and limitations in study design, including small samples, inadequacy of supplementation dose, or lack of blood markers to trace the biological availability of the compounds supplemented. As a consequence, the implementation of larger and methodologically robust trials has been repeatedly advocated to overcome this impasse.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for depression in adults [^dbdff207]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly debilitating, difficult to treat, has a high rate of recurrence, and negatively impacts the individual and society as a whole. One potential treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), also known as omega-3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n-3PUFAs in MDD, but the evidence is far from conclusive. Reviews and meta-analyses clearly demonstrate heterogeneity between studies. Investigations of heterogeneity suggest different effects of n-3PUFAs, depending on the severity of depressive symptoms, where no effects of n-3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomology, but possible benefit may be suggested in studies of individuals with more severe depressive symptomology. Hence it is important to establish their effectiveness in treating MDD. This review updates and incorporates an earlier review with the same research objective (Appleton 2015).

Objectives

To assess the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also known as omega-3 fatty acids) versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, antidepressant treatment, standard care, no treatment, wait-list control) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO together with trial registries and grey literature sources (to 9 January 2021). We checked reference lists and contacted authors of included studies for additional information when necessary.

Selection Criteria

We included studies in the review if they: used a randomised controlled trial design; provided n-3PUFAs as an intervention; used a comparator; measured depressive symptomology as an outcome; and were conducted in adults with MDD. Primary outcomes were depressive symptomology (continuous data collected using a validated rating scale) and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptomology (dichotomous data on remission and response), quality of life, and non-completion of studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

The review includes 35 relevant studies: 34 studies involving a total of 1924 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo, and one study involving 40 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to antidepressant treatment. For the placebo comparison, n-3PUFA supplementation resulted in a small to modest benefit for depressive symptomology, compared to placebo: standardised mean difference (SMD) (random-effects model) -0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.64 to -0.16; 33 studies, 1848 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but this effect is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. An SMD of 0.40 represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17-item) of approximately 2.5 points (95% CI 1.0 to 4.0), where the minimal clinically important change score on this scale is 3.0 points. The confidence intervals include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there is considerable heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well-conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate may be biased towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs. Although the numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar in intervention and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.64; 24 studies, 1503 participants; very low-certainty evidence), the confidence intervals include a small decrease to a modest increase in adverse events with n-3PUFAs. There was no evidence for a difference between n-3PUFA and placebo groups in remission rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.72; 8 studies, 609 participants, low-certainty evidence), response rates (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.79; 17 studies, 794 participants; low-certainty evidence), quality of life (SMD -0.38 (95% CI -0.82 to 0.06), 12 studies, 476 participants, very low-certainty evidence), or trial non-completion (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22; 29 studies, 1777 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The evidence on which these results are based was also very limited, highly heterogeneous, and potentially biased. Only one study, involving 40 participants, was available for the antidepressant comparison. This study found no differences between treatment with n-3PUFAs and treatment with antidepressants in depressive symptomology (mean difference (MD) -0.70, 95% CI -5.88 to 4.48), rates of response to treatment (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.31), or trial non-completion (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.71). Confidence intervals are however very wide in all analyses, and do not rule out important beneficial or detrimental effects of n-3PUFAs compared to antidepressants. Adverse events were not reported in a manner suitable for analysis, and rates of depression remission and quality of life were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, we do not have sufficient high-certainty evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. Our primary analyses may suggest a small-to-modest, non-clinically beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs on depressive symptomology compared to placebo; however the estimate is imprecise, and we judged the certainty of the evidence on which this result is based to be low to very low. Our data may also suggest similar rates of adverse events and trial non-completion in n-3PUFA and placebo groups, but again our estimates are very imprecise. Effects of n-3PUFAs compared to antidepressants are very imprecise and uncertain. More complete evidence is required for both the potential positive and negative effects of n-3PUFAs for MDD.

### Efficacy of marine ω-3 fatty acid supplementation vs placebo in reducing incidence of dry eye disease in healthy US adults: a randomized clinical trial [^b2fb7cb2]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Results of several small randomized clinical trials have suggested that supplements of marine ω-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in treating signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (DED). However, randomized clinical trial data to examine whether ω-3 fatty acid supplements can prevent DED are lacking.

Objective

To evaluate whether long-term daily supplementation with marine ω-3 fatty acids prevents the development of DED.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prespecified ancillary study of the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), a nationwide randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2×2 factorial trial of vitamin D and marine ω-3 fatty acids in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Participants in this ancillary study were 23 523 US adults (men 50 years and older and women 55 years and older) who at study entry were free of a previous diagnosis of DED and were not experiencing severe dry eye symptoms. Participants were enrolled from November 2011 to March 2014, and treatment and follow-up ended on December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from January 2020 to August 2021.

Interventions

Marine ω-3 fatty acids, 1 g per day.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was incident clinically diagnosed DED confirmed by review of the medical records. The secondary end point was a composite of all confirmed incident clinically diagnosed DED cases plus all incident reports of severe DED symptoms.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the 23 523 participants included in the analysis was 67.0 (7.0) years, and 11 349 participants (48.3%) were women. The cohort included 4610 participants (20.0%) who self-identified as Black, 16 481 (71.6%) who self-identified as non-Hispanic White, and 1927 (8.4%) of other racial or ethnic groups or who declined to respond, consolidated owing to small numbers, including American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. During a median (range) 5.3 (3.8–6.1) years of treatment and follow-up, 472 of 23 523 participants (2.0%) experienced a medical record-confirmed diagnosis of DED. There was no difference in diagnosed DED by randomized ω-3 fatty acid assignment (232 of 11 757 participants [2.0%] with end points in the treated group vs 240 of 11 766 [2.0%] with end points in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81–1.16). Similarly, there was no difference between groups for the secondary end point of diagnosed DED plus incident severe DED symptoms (1044 participants [8.9%] with end points in the treated group vs 1074 [9.1%] with end points in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89–1.06).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, long-term supplementation with 1 g per day of marine ω-3 fatty acids for a median (range) of 5.3 (3.8–6.1) years did not reduce the incidence of diagnosed DED or a combined end point of diagnosed DED or incident severe DED symptoms. These results do not support recommending marine ω-3 fatty acid supplementation to reduce the incidence of DED.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and reduction of depressive symptoms in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f31d1a97]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to systematically review the efficacy of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplements in reducing depressive symptoms among older adults aged 60 and above.

Methods

Relevant electronic databases were searched from their inception to June 4, 2018, including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Global Health, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Chinese Biomedical Medicine Database. Two reviewers independently screened for eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. The effect size data were analyzed using robust variance estimation in meta-regression.

Results

Nine studies were included. The overall treatment effects of n-3 PUFA supplements in reducing depressive symptoms for older adults was not statistically significant (d = -0.202, 95% CI = -0.463, 0.060). Meta-regression found interventions with dosage of n-3 PUFA greater than 1.5 g/d had an average effect size of -0.428, with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.822, -0.035], which is statistically significant. Meta-regression did not find significant moderating effects of comorbidity, baseline depression, intervention duration, and EPA-DHA ratio, potentially due to limited statistical power.

Limitations

The current review only included 9 studies based on literature search in major English and Chinese databases, which provided limited statistical power for moderator analysis and the results are suggestive only.

Conclusions

The meta-analysis of 9 RCTs found mixed findings of the efficacy of n-3 PUFA in the treatment of depressive symptoms among older adults aged 60 and above. More high-quality, large-scale RCTs are needed to confirm the current conclusions.

### The efficacy of omega-3 supplementation for major depression: a randomized controlled trial [^1af04d03]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To document the short-term efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in reducing depressive symptoms in patients experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE).

Method

Inclusive, double-blind, randomized, controlled, 8-week, parallel-group trial, conducted October 17, 2005 through January 30, 2009 in 8 Canadian academic and psychiatric clinics. Adult outpatients (N = 432) with MDE (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 5.0.0, criteria) lasting at least 4 weeks, including 40.3% taking antidepressants at baseline, were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of 1,050 mg/d of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 150 mg/d of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or matched sunflower oil placebo (2% fish oil). The primary outcome was the self-report Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR(30)); the secondary outcome was the clinician-rated Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

Results

The adjusted mean difference between treatment and placebo was 1.32 points (95% CI, -0.20 to 2.84; P = 0.088) on the IDS-SR(30) and 0.97 points (95% CI, -0.012 to 1.95; P = 0.053) on the MADRS. Planned subgroup analyses revealed a significant interaction of comorbid anxiety disorders and study group (P = 0.035). For patients without comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 204), omega-3 supplementation was superior to placebo, with an adjusted mean difference of 3.17 points on the IDS-SR(30) (95% CI, 0.89 to 5.45; P = 0.007) and 1.93 points (95% CI, 0.50 to 3.36; P = 0.008) on the MADRS.

Conclusions

In this heterogeneous sample of patients with MDE, there was only a trend toward superiority of omega-3 supplementation over placebo in reducing depressive symptoms. However, there was a clear benefit of omega-3 supplementation among patients with MDE without comorbid anxiety disorders.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for depression in adults [^8a9eb39b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly debilitating, difficult to treat, has a high rate of recurrence, and negatively impacts the individual and society as a whole. One emerging potential treatment for MDD is n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), also known as omega-3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n-3PUFAs in MDD, but the evidence is far from conclusive. Reviews and meta-analyses clearly demonstrate heterogeneity between studies. Investigations of heterogeneity suggest differential effects of n-3PUFAs, depending on severity of depressive symptoms, where no effects of n-3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomology, but possible benefit may be suggested in studies of individuals with more severe depressive symptomology.

Objectives

To assess the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also known as omega-3 fatty acids) versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, anti-depressant treatment, standard care, no treatment, wait-list control) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Registers (CCDANCTR) and International Trial Registries over all years to May 2015. We searched the database CINAHL over all years of records to September 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included studies in the review if they: were a randomised controlled trial; provided n-3PUFAs as an intervention; used a comparator; measured depressive symptomology as an outcome; and were conducted in adults with MDD. Primary outcomes were depressive symptomology (continuous data collected using a validated rating scale) and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptomology (dichotomous data on remission and response), quality of life, and failure to complete studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We found 26 relevant studies: 25 studies involving a total of 1438 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo, and one study involving 40 participants investigated the impact of n-3PUFA supplementation compared to antidepressant treatment. For the placebo comparison, n-3PUFA supplementation results in a small to modest benefit for depressive symptomology, compared to placebo: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to -0.52; 25 studies, 1373 participants, very low quality evidence), but this effect is unlikely to be clinically meaningful (an SMD of 0.32 represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17-item) of approximately 2.2 points (95% CI 0.8 to 3.6)). The confidence intervals include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there is considerable heterogeneity between the studies. Although the numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar in intervention and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.62; 19 studies, 1207 participants; very low-quality evidence), the confidence intervals include a significant increase in adverse events with n-3PUFAs as well as a small possible decrease. Rates of remission and response, quality of life, and rates of failure to complete studies were also similar between groups, but confidence intervals are again wide. The evidence on which these results are based is very limited. All studies contributing to our analyses were of direct relevance to our research question, but we rated the quality of the evidence for all outcomes as low to very low. The number of studies and number of participants contributing to all analyses were low, and the majority of studies were small and judged to be at high risk of bias on several measures. Our analyses were also likely to be highly influenced by three large trials. Although we judge these trials to be at low risk of bias, they contribute 26.9% to 82% of data. Our effect size estimates are also imprecise. Funnel plot asymmetry and sensitivity analyses (using fixed-effect models, and only studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias, performance bias or attrition bias) also suggest a likely bias towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs. There was substantial heterogeneity in analyses of our primary outcome of depressive symptomology. This heterogeneity was not explained by the presence or absence of comorbidities or by the presence or absence of adjunctive therapy. Only one study was available for the antidepressant comparison, involving 40 participants. This study found no differences between treatment with n-3PUFAs and treatment with antidepressants in depressive symptomology (mean difference (MD) -0.70 (95% CI -5.88 to 4.48)), rates of response to treatment or failure to complete. Adverse events were not reported in a manner suitable for analysis, and rates of depression remission and quality of life were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, we do not have sufficient high quality evidence to determine the effects of n-3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. Our primary analyses suggest a small-to-modest, non-clinically beneficial effect of n-3PUFAs on depressive symptomology compared to placebo; however the estimate is imprecise, and we judged the quality of the evidence on which this result is based to be low/very low. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well-conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate is likely to be biased towards a positive finding for n-3PUFAs, and that the true effect is likely to be smaller. Our data, however, also suggest similar rates of adverse events and numbers failing to complete trials in n-3PUFA and placebo groups, but again our estimates are very imprecise. The one study that directly compares n-3PUFAs and antidepressants in our review finds comparable benefit. More evidence, and more complete evidence, are required, particularly regarding both the potential positive and negative effects of n-3PUFAs for MDD.

### The effect of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on pain prevalence and severity in older adults: a large-scale ancillary study of the VITamin D and omegA-3 triaL (VITAL) [^693c7aad]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A diet supplemented with vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids may prevent and treat painful disorders by promoting the resolution of inflammation. However, large, randomized placebo-controlled trials evaluating the effects of supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D on the presence and severity of pain are lacking. VITamin D and OmegA-3 triaL-Pain (VITAL-Pain) is an ancillary study to the VITAL trial, a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU/day) and omega-3 supplementation (1 g/day) over 5.3 years of median follow-up, among 25,871 older men and women. We assessed pain among those reaching the end of the VITAL intervention phase using questions from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey. We used ordinal logistic regression to test the effect of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids on the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval [CI] of reporting higher pain prevalence or severity. Overall, 19,611 participants provided complete pain information at the end of the VITAL trial. The ORs for higher pain prevalence or severity for vitamin D and omega-3 supplementation vs placebo were 0.99 ([CI] 0.94–1.05) and 0.99 ([CI] 0.94–1.04), respectively. There was no interaction between the 2 active treatments. Dietary supplementation with commonly used moderate doses of vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acids over a median of 5.3 years did not result in a lower prevalence or severity of pain in middle-aged and older U.S. adults.

### Efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in depression: a meta-analysis [^eaa4b0f1]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 PUFAs with formulations containing ≥ 60% EPA demonstrated antidepressant effects when EPA ≤ 1 g/d. Although many trials support these meta-analysis results, we should nonetheless recognize the heterogeneity among these trials and pay more attention to the proportion and dosage of both DHA and EPA supplementation, including whether they have opposite effects in the case of a 1:1 ratio and how much EPA is effective in improving depression. We note that the long-term efficacy and health effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in depression have yet to be elucidated.

### Effect of marine omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin D supplementation on incident atrial fibrillation: a randomized clinical trial [^8bb3ffda]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disturbance, continues to increase in incidence, and results in significant morbidity and mortality. The marine omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and vitamin D have been reported to have both benefits and risks with respect to incident AF, but large-scale, long-term randomized trial data are lacking.

Objective

To test the effects of long-term administration of marine omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D on incident AF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

An ancillary study of a 2 × 2 factorial randomized clinical trial involving 25 119 women and men aged 50 years or older without prior cardiovascular disease, cancer, or AF. Participants were recruited directly by mail between November 2011 and March 2014 from all 50 US states and were followed up until December 31, 2017.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive EPA-DHA (460 mg/d of EPA and 380 mg/d of DHA) and vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) (n = 6272 analyzed); EPA-DHA and placebo (n = 6270 analyzed); vitamin D3 and placebo (n = 6281 analyzed); or 2 placebos (n = 6296 analyzed).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was incident AF confirmed by medical record review.

Results

Among the 25 119 participants who were randomized and included in the analysis (mean age, 66.7 years; 50.8% women), 24 127 (96.1%) completed the trial. Over a median 5.3 years of treatment and follow-up, the primary end point of incident AF occurred in 900 participants (3.6% of study population). For the EPA-DHA vs placebo comparison, incident AF events occurred in 469 (3.7%) vs 431 (3.4%) participants, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.96–1.24; P = 0.19). For the vitamin D3 vs placebo comparison, incident AF events occurred in 469 (3.7%) vs 431 (3.4%) participants, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.96–1.25; P = 0.19). There was no evidence for interaction between the 2 study agents (P = 0.39).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults aged 50 years or older, treatment with EPA-DHA or vitamin D3, compared with placebo, resulted in no significant difference in the risk of incident AF over a median follow-up of more than 5 years. The findings do not support the use of either agent for the primary prevention of incident AF.

### Meta-analysis of the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in clinical trials in depression [^b6786e51]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Randomized trials of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) treatment for depression have differed in outcome. Recent meta-analyses ascribe discrepancies to differential effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) versus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and to diagnostic heterogeneity. This meta-analysis tests the hypothesis that EPA is the effective component in PUFA treatment of major depressive episodes.

Data Sources

PubMed/MeSH was searched for studies published in English from 1960 through June 2010 using the terms fish oils (MeSH) AND (depressive disorder [MeSH] OR bipolar depression) AND randomized controlled trial (publication type). The search was supplemented by manual bibliography review and examination of relevant review articles.

Study Selection

The search yielded 15 trials involving 916 participants. Studies were included if they had a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study design; if depressive episode was the primary complaint (with or without comorbid medical conditions); if omega-3 PUFA supplements were administered; and if appropriate outcome measures were used to assess depressed mood.

Data Extraction

Extracted data included study design, sample sizes, doses and percentages of EPA and DHA, mean ages, baseline and endpoint depression ratings and standard deviations for PUFA and placebo groups, and P values. The clinical outcome of interest was the standardized mean difference in the change from baseline to endpoint scores on a depression rating scale in subjects taking PUFA supplements versus subjects taking placebo.

Data Synthesis

In a mixed-effect model, percentage of EPA in the supplements was the fixed-effect predictor, dichotomized into 2 groups: EPA < 60% or EPA ≥ 60% of the total EPA + DHA. Secondary analyses explored the relevance of treatment duration, age, and EPA dose.

Results

Supplements with EPA ≥ 60% showed benefit on standardized mean depression scores (effect size = 0.532; 95% CI, 0.277–0.733; t = 4.195; P < .001) versus supplements with EPA < 60% (effect size = -0.026; 95% CI, -0.200 to 0.148; t = -0.316; P = 0.756), with negligible contribution of random effects or heteroscedasticity and with no effects of treatment duration or age. Supplements with EPA < 60% were ineffective. Exploratory analyses supported a nonlinear model, with improvement determined by the dose of EPA in excess of DHA, within the range of 200 to 2,200 mg/d of EPA.

Conclusions

Supplements containing EPA ≥ 60% of total EPA + DHA, in a dose range of 200 to 2,200 mg/d of EPA in excess of DHA, were effective against primary depression. Translational studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of EPA's therapeutic benefit.

### Effects of n-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism after myocardial infarction [^21d5de09]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction (MI), n-3 (omega-3) PUFA status is low, whereas the risk of depression is increased.

Objective

The objective was to assess whether the plant-derived α-linolenic acid (ALA) and the fish fatty acids EPA and DHA would improve affective states.

Design

In a secondary analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Alpha Omega Trial, 4116 of 4837 (85.1%) patients (aged 60–80 y; 79.2% men) who had experienced an MI were included. Margarine spreads were used to deliver 400 mg EPA-DHA/d, 2 g ALA/d, both EPA-DHA and ALA, or a placebo for 40 mo. At 40 mo, the endpoints of depressive symptoms (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale) and dispositional optimism (a 4-item questionnaire and the Life Orientation Test-Revised) were analyzed by using a posttest-only design.

Results

The 4 randomly assigned groups did not differ in baseline characteristics. ALA supplementation significantly increased plasma cholesteryl ester concentrations of ALA by 69%, and EPA-DHA supplementation increased plasma cholesteryl ester concentrations of EPA and DHA by 61% and 30%, respectively. Depressive symptoms or dispositional optimism did not differ between groups with the use of n-3 fatty acids compared with placebo at the 40-mo follow-up. The standardized mean (± SE) differences in depressive symptoms were as follows: for EPA-DHA plus ALA (n = 1009) compared with placebo (n = 1030), -0.025 ± 0.044 (P = 0.57); for EPA-DHA (n = 1007) compared with placebo, -0.048 ± 0.044 (P = 0.28); and for ALA (n = 1022) compared with placebo, -0.047 ± 0.044 (P = 0.29).

Conclusions

In patients who had experienced an MI, low-dose EPA-DHA supplementation, ALA supplementation, or a combination of both did not affect depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism. These findings are in accord with those from previous trials in individuals without psychopathology or without severe depressive symptoms. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00127452.

### Supplementation with B vitamins or n-3 fatty acids and depressive symptoms in cardiovascular disease survivors: ancillary findings from the SUpplementation with FOLate, vitamins B-6 and B-12 and / or OMega-3 fatty acids (SU.FOL.OM3) randomized trial [^c3b42ff2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary factors might affect depressive symptoms.

Objective

In secondary data analyses, we examined effects of supplementation with B vitamins or n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids on depressive symptoms in cardiovascular disease survivors.

Design

The SUpplementation with FOLate, vitamins B-6 and B-12 and/or OMega-3 fatty acids (SU.FOL.OM3) trial was a secondary prevention trial (2003–2009; n = 2501) in which individuals aged 45–80 y were randomly assigned, by using a 2 × 2 factorial design, to receive 0.56 mg 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and vitamins B-6 (3 mg) and B-12 (0.02 mg); EPA and DHA (600 mg) in a 2:1 ratio; B vitamins and n-3 fatty acids; or a placebo. Depressive symptoms were evaluated at years 3 and 5 with the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Overall and sex-specific ORs and 95% CIs were estimated in 2000 participants by using factorial logistic regression.

Results

After a median of 4.7 y of supplementation, there was no association between allocation to receive B vitamins and depressive symptoms. However, the allocation to receive n-3 fatty acids was positively associated with depressive symptoms (GDS > 10) in men (adjusted OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.61) but not in women.

Conclusions

We showed no beneficial effects of a long-term, low-dose supplementation with B vitamins or n-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms in cardiovascular disease survivors. The adverse effects of n-3 fatty acids in men merit confirmation.

### Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of depression and poor physical function in older persons: the D-vitaal study, a randomized clinical trial [^e39c4310]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

It is remarkable that observational studies have demonstrated rather consistent associations between vitamin D status and numerous health outcomes, whereas this is often not confirmed by trial evidence. Therefore, it is more likely that vitamin D status is a marker for poor health or inflammation instead of a cause of disease.

At the moment, several large-scale, long-term RCTs are being conducted to examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on multiple outcomes in older persons: the Vitamin D Assessment Study (ViDa) trial (n = 5110, 100,000 IU/mo for a median period of 3.3 y), the VITamin D and OmegA-3 (VITAL) trial and its ancillary the VITamin D and OmegA-3 Trial–Depression Endpoint Prevention (VITAL–DEP) study (n = 25,874, 2000 IU/d for a mean period of 5 y), and the Vitamin D3–Omega3–Home Exercise –HeALTHy Ageing and Longevity Trial (DO-HEALTH) (n = 2152, 2000 IU/d for 3 y). Although these trials use general population samples, the n is large enough to allow for subgroup analyses. The outcomes of these trials will shed more light on the complex relationship of vitamin D with depression and physical functioning. In addition, there may be some potential in the combination of antidepressants with vitamin D in the treatment of depression, although a recent report suggests that it can be challenging to conduct such an RCT.

The D-Vitaal recruitment phase was also challenging. We had to send out ∼56,000 information brochures to include 155 participants, which underlines the difficulty of recruiting for this type of RCT in the general population. Most of the potential participants did not respond to our invitation, which might have been due to ineligibility or lack of interest to participate in an RCT. Including participants with even lower baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations (< 30 nmol/L) would be of great scientific interest but will be complicated to accomplish, both ethically and practically.

Based on the results of this study, supplementation with vitamin D for the prevention of depression and poor physical functioning cannot be recommended. However, it is important to continue research for effective and acceptable prevention strategies for these health problems in older persons.

In conclusion, this randomized placebo-controlled trial found no effect of 1200 IU/d vitamin D supplementation for 1 y on depressive symptoms or physical functioning in a high-risk population with relatively low vitamin D status.

### Efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in depression: a meta-analysis [^0b234457]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Search strategy

We conducted a systematic bibliographic search for studies that examined the role of omega-3 PUFAs in depression using "major depressive disorder", "depression", "fatty acid, omega-3", and "randomized controlled trial" as key words. We applied our search in the following databases, from inception to 20 December 2017: PubMed and the Ovid version of EMBASE (Supplementary 1). We also searched the references of selected studies and earlier meta-analyses to identify additional potential studies for inclusion in our analysis.

Study selection

Two independent, trained reviewers screened the identified articles for their relevance by title/abstract and full text. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by discussion in all cases and if necessary, by arbitration by a third reviewer. Relevant articles were obtained and included in this review if they had the following characteristics: (1) a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, (2) inclusion of adults with a diagnosis of clinical depression (DSM-III-R/DSM-IV) or depressive symptoms according to validated psychometric instruments (with or without comorbid medical conditions), and (3) clear dosage and duration of EPA and DHA intake. We excluded studies with the following characteristics: (1) depression secondary to other neuropsychiatric disorders and (2) perinatal major depressive disorder.

Assessment of risk of bias

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We resolved disagreements by discussion, and we assessed the risk of bias according to the following categories: (1) selection bias, (2) performance bias, (3) detection bias, (4) attrition bias, (5) reporting bias, and (6) other bias.

We judged each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear risk and have provided a supporting quotation from the study report together with a justification for our judgment in each 'Risk of bias' table (Supplementary 2).

### Pilot study of DNA methylation, molecular aging markers and measures of health and well-being in aging [^011bda93]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Source of participants

Participants were from VITAL-DEP (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL-Depression Endpoint Prevention, NCT01696435), a late-life depression prevention ancillary study, to the VITAL (NCT01169259) trial. VITAL consists of 25,871 men and women, aged 50+ and 55+ years (mean = 67 years), respectively, in a 2 × 2 factorial randomized trial of heart disease and cancer prevention using vitamin D and/or fish oil; cohort details are provided elsewhere. VITAL also incorporates a Clinical Translational Science Center (CTSC) sub-cohort of n = 1054 men and women, all of whom are participants in the full trial, who presented for baseline and 2-year follow-up visits. Among these CTSC participants, VITAL-DEP established a set of n = 1041 adults who completed comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments at baseline and 2-year follow-up, as detailed elsewhere. Participants for the current study are members of the VITAL-DEP CTSC component.

Sample selection

We selected 23 participants (n = 11 cases and n = 12 controls). Cases were diagnosed with DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual)-IV-criteria psychiatric disorders, as determined by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)during the VITAL-DEP CTSC component protocol. Cases included those with: bipolar disorder (n = 2), unipolar major depression (n = 2), phobic anxiety (panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia; n = 4), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 1), co-morbid unipolar depression and panic disorder (n = 1), and co-morbid bipolar, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder (n = 1). Controls were healthy persons with no current or lifetime history of DSM-IV criteria psychiatric disorder. Cases and controls were balanced by sex and age (i.e. distributions of 10-year age groups from 50–90 years) and were selected form a larger subset of participants who had both existing telomere and mtCN data (see below). These selected 23 CTSC participants also had complete blood counts (CBCs) and at least 1 μg of extracted genomic DNA available. Participants with extreme characteristics that could bias the methylation results (e.g. heavy/binge alcohol use) were excluded from this selection.

### Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder [^76fe35c8]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our revised updated meta-analysis adds nuance to the continuing debate on the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on depressive symptoms in MDD. By addressing several issues as noted in the introduction, the present meta-analysis studied effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in all available evidence in a specific relatively homogeneous group of MDD subjects. Overall, with an standardized mean difference of 0.398 present meta-analysis shows a beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs that is comparable to effects reported in meta-analyses of antidepressants. Of note, this effect seemed larger in studies (1) supplementing higher doses of EPA and (2) performed in patients using antidepressants (augmentation/add-on), while it was independent of baseline depression severity or EPA/(EPA+DHA) ratio. However, more recent trials had smaller effect sizes, independent of trial quality.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and major depression: a mendelian randomization study [^faedf838]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our results provide evidence for a link between genetically predicted omega-3 fatty acids and MDD. The effect appears strongest for EPA, remains robust to biologically correlated lipids, and is not explained by reverse causality. This strengthens the evidence for a causal effect of omega-3 fatty acids on MDD, although horizontal pleiotropy and confounding by linkage disequilibrium cannot be fully excluded. Further research to triangulate these findings and consider potential mediating mechanisms and phenotypes would be valuable. Future trials of omega-3 supplementation for MDD should ensure adequate power to detect modest effects, along with ensuring formulation, dose, and participant selection are the most likely to benefit.

### The N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation to prevent depression recurrence in patients with late-life depression: a 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^d8225ec0]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Reports on the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) for the treatment of late-life depression (LLD) are mixed, and most studies focus on the modification of depressive symptoms rather than depression prevention. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs in preventing depressive recurrence in patients with late-life depression. In addition, we investigated the effects of n-3 PUFAs on changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms and inflammatory markers in LLD.

Methods

A 52-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted. We enrolled a total of 39 euthymic patients with LLD. They were randomized to receive either n-3 PUFAs (1.2 g per day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 1 g of docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo for 52 weeks. Recurrence of depression and severity of depression symptoms were assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 52.

Results

A total of 39 patients completed the trial with 19 in the n-3 PUFAs group and 20 in the placebo group. Cox proportional hazard regression indicated that n-3 PUFAs had significant protective effect on depression recurrence (Hazard Ratio: 0.295, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.093–0.931, p value = 0.037). But n-3 PUFAs intervention had no significant effect in reducing depressive or anxiety symptoms, inflammatory markers over the placebo group.

Limitation

The results should be interpreted with consideration of the modest sample size.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that n-3 PUFAs may have a prophylactic effect in currently euthymic patients with LLD.

### VITAL-DEP: depression endpoint prevention in the VITamin D… [^c1f80c61]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Study Overview VITAL-DEP: Depression Endpoint Prevention in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL is a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the prevention of depression in older adults. Existing data from laboratory studies, epidemiologic research, limited clinical trials research suggest that these nutritional agents may reduce risk of depression or improve mood, but large primary prevention trials with adequate dosing and lengthy treatment durations in general populations are lacking. Participants in all groups will take two pills each day — one softgel that contains either vitamin D3 or vitamin D placebo and one capsule that contains either omega-3 or omega-3 placebo. Participants will receive their study pills in convenient calendar packages via U. S. mail.

The secondary aims will address whether: 1) among a subset of 1, 000 participants evaluated at a Clinical and Translational Science Center, the agents reduce risk of depression and yield better mood scores among persons with known risk factors for late-life depression; 2) among a subset of 1, 000. participants evaluated at a CTSC, the agents reduce risk of major depression and yield better mood scores among persons with sub-syndromal depressive symptoms; 3) among all VITAL participants, African-American race modifies effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on late-life depression risk and on mood scores; 4) among a subset of participants, baseline plasma levels of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are related to depression risk and/or modify agent effects. Thus, VITAL-DEP will address simultaneously the impact of both vitamin D and fish oil for universal, selective and indicated prevention of late-life depression.

### Updated systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids on depressed mood [^8c2ea19b]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The debate over a role for n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in depressed mood continues.

Objective

The objective was to update a previous systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.

Design

Eight databases were searched for trials that randomly assigned participants to receive n-3 PUFAs/fish, measured depressed mood, used human participants, and included a comparison group up to April 2009.

Results

Thirty-five randomized controlled trials were identified; 17 were not included in the previous review. The pooled standardized difference in mean outcome of the 29 trials that provided data to allow pooling (fixed-effects model) was 0.10 SD (95% CI: 0.02, 0.17) in those who received n-3 PUFAs compared with placebo, with strong evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 65%, P < 0.01). The presence of funnel plot asymmetry suggested that publication bias was a likely source of this heterogeneity. Depressive symptom severity and participant diagnosis also explained some of the observed heterogeneity. Greater effects of n-3 PUFAs were found in individuals with more-severe depressive symptoms. In trials that enrolled individuals with a diagnosed depressive disorder, the combined mean difference was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.55), although evidence of heterogeneity was also found (I(2) = 71%). In trials that enrolled individuals without a depressive diagnosis, no beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs were found (largest combined mean difference: 0.22; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.44; I(2) = 0%).

Conclusions

Trial evidence of the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood has increased but remains difficult to summarize because of considerable heterogeneity. The evidence available provides some support of a benefit of n-3 PUFAs in individuals with diagnosed depressive illness but no evidence of any benefit in individuals without a diagnosis of depressive illness.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplements in depressed heart Failure Patients: results of the OCEAN trial [^943777b5]. JACC: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to test the effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on omega-3 levels, depressive symptoms, and other psychosocial factors, as well as other chronic heart failure (CHF)-related functional measures.

Background

Patients with CHF and depression had low blood omega-3 concentrations that were associated with an elevated risk of mortality.

Methods

This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial using a 400/200 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil at 2 g and an almost pure EPA at 2 g, compared with a matched placebo, daily for 12 weeks for patients with CHF and major depressive disorder. Statistical analyses included the intention-to-treat population and "completers" (defined as participants consuming ≥ 70% of the capsules and completing the final endpoint evaluation between 10 and 14 weeks).

Results

A total of 108 patients with CHF and major depressive disorder and a score ≥ 18 on the Hamilton Depression Scale who were randomized at 1:1:1 to the 3 interventions at 3 enrolling centers from June 12, 2014, to May 19, 2016; 80 (74.1%) qualified as completers. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that the levels of all omega-3 variables were significantly elevated in the omega-3 groups, whereas the placebo group showed little change; there were no between-group differences with overall depression measurements. Per-protocol exploratory analyses showed that scores on the social functioning measurement of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey improved notably in the 400/200 EPA/DHA (p = 0.040) and EPA (p = 0.10) groups compared with the placebo group. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that increased omega-3 indices were associated with improved cognitive depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

Omega-3 supplementation resulted in significant increases in omega-3 levels in red blood cell counts, corresponding to a particular compound of omega-3. Changes in cognitive depressive symptoms and social function were in favor of the omega-3 supplementation. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the benefits of omega-3 supplementation on modifying psychosocial factors for patients with CHF. (Omega-3 Supplementation for Co-Morbid Depression and Heart Failure Treatment [OCEAN]; NCT02057406).

### Effects of supplemental vitamin D3, omega-3 fatty acids on physical performance measures in the VITamin D and omegA-3 triaL [^dbfce5f3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Declining muscle strength and performance in older adults are associated with falls, fractures, and premature death.

Objective

This work aimed to determine whether supplementation with vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acids vs placebo for 2 years improves physical performance measures.

Methods

VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial of supplemental vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acids vs placebo in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25 871 US adults. This ancillary study was completed in a New England subcohort that had in-person evaluations at baseline and 2-year follow-up. This study was conducted with 1054 participants (age: men ≥ 50 and women ≥ 55 years) at the Center for Clinical Investigations in Boston. Interventions included a 2 × 2 factorial design of supplemental vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/day) and/or marine omega-3 fatty acids (1g/day). Main outcome measures included 2-year changes in physical performance measures of grip strength, walking speed, standing balance, repeated chair stands, and Timed-up and Go (TUG).

Results

At 2 years, all randomized groups showed worsening walking speeds and TUG. There were no differences in changes in grip strength, walking speeds, Short Physical Performance Battery (composite of walking speed, balance, and chair stands), and TUG between the vitamin D3-treated and the placebo-treated groups and between the omega-3-treated and the placebo-treated groups. Effects overall did not vary by sex, age, body mass index, or baseline measures of total or free 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) or plasma omega-3 index; TUG slightly worsened with vitamin D supplementation, compared to placebo, in participants with baseline total 25(OH)D levels above the median (P = 0.01; P for interaction = .04).

Conclusion

Neither supplemental vitamin D3 nor marine omega-3 fatty acids for 2 years improved physical performance in this generally healthy adult population.

### Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder [^2757ae68]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been proposed as (adjuvant) treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). In the present meta-analysis, we pooled randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on depressive symptoms in MDD. Moreover, we performed meta-regression to test whether supplementation effects depended on eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid dose, their ratio, study duration, participants' age, percentage antidepressant users, baseline MDD symptom severity, publication year and study quality. To limit heterogeneity, we only included studies in adult patients with MDD assessed using standardized clinical interviews, and excluded studies that specifically studied perinatal/perimenopausal or comorbid MDD. Our PubMED/EMBASE search resulted in 1955 articles, from which we included 13 studies providing 1233 participants. After taking potential publication bias into account, meta-analysis showed an overall beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs on depressive symptoms in MDD (standardized mean difference = 0.398 (0.114–0.682), P = 0.006, random-effects model). As an explanation for significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 73.36, P < 0.001), meta-regression showed that higher EPA dose (β = 0.00037 (0.00009–0.00065), P = 0.009), higher percentage antidepressant users (β = 0.0058 (0.00017–0.01144), P = 0.044) and earlier publication year (β = -0.0735 (-0.143 to 0.004), P = 0.04) were significantly associated with better outcome for PUFA supplementation. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed. In conclusion, present meta-analysis suggested a beneficial overall effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in MDD patients, especially for higher doses of EPA and in participants taking antidepressants. Future precision medicine trials should establish whether possible interactions between EPA and antidepressants could provide targets to improve antidepressant response and its prediction. Furthermore, potential long-term biochemical side effects of high-dosed add-on EPA supplementation should be carefully monitored.

### Supplementation-induced increase in circulating omega-3 serum levels is not associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms: results from the mooDFOOD depression prevention trial [^e09272d9]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and sample

The MooDFOOD depression prevention trial was designed to measure the feasibility and effectiveness of two different nutritional strategies to prevent a new episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) in high‐risk overweight persons with subclinical symptoms of depression. This study was a 2 × 2 factorial RCT performed between July 30, 2015, and October 13, 2017, in four European countries (Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands). For full details of trial design and protocol, see Roca et al. (2016) and for trial results, see Bot et al. (2019). Ethics approval was provided by the human research ethics boards of the study sites. All participants provided written informed consent. A total of 1,025 participants were recruited by the four study sites (located in Leipzig, Germany; Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Exeter, United Kingdom; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Main eligibility criteria were: age between 18 and 75 years, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) between 25 and 40 kg/m 2, and having at least mild depressive symptoms as operationalized by Patient Health Questionnaire scores of 5 or higher (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001) but having no current MDD episode in the past 6 months (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0; Sheehan et al. 1998). All eligible participants were invited to visit one of the study sites for a baseline interview. The interview, physical measurements, and blood sampling were conducted by trained research assistants or nurses. Furthermore, participants completed self‐report questionnaires. Follow‐up assessments in which blood was assessed took place at 3, 6, and 12 months. For the analyses of the current study, only participants with available data on at least one PUFA measurement were included (N = 682). Included participants were significantly older, were physically more active, drank more glasses of alcohol per week, were more often higher educated, and were less often current smokers than excluded participants (n = 343). The investigation was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki (trial registration number: NCT02529423).

### Omega-3 fatty acids in major depressive disorder [^cdc7be38]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder have high rates of cardiovascular disease and other medical comorbidity. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly those found in fish and seafood, have cardiovascular health benefits and may play an adjunctive role in the treatment of mood disorders. However, existing studies on omega-3 fatty acids in depression have limitations such as small sample sizes and a wide variance in study design, and results regarding efficacy are mixed. The preponderance of data from placebo-controlled treatment studies suggests that omega-3 fatty acids are a reasonable augmentation strategy for the treatment of major depressive disorder. More research is necessary before omega-3 supplements can be recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of depression. For many individuals with major depressive disorder, augmentation with omega-3 fatty acids should be considered, as general health benefits are well established and adjunctive use is low risk.

### Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder [^a5f1166b]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Therefore, our study aims at continuing the academic debate by performing a revised updated meta-analysis on the effectiveness of omega-3 PUFAs for the treatment of MDD taking into account the above issues of concern. In addition, we performed meta-regression analyses to explain expected heterogeneity, by testing the effects of EPA and DHA dose and their ratio, study duration, participants' age, percentage antidepressant users, baseline MDD symptom severity, publication year and study quality.

31. 74%2 Testing preventive effects of omega-3 fatty acids for late-life depression was indeed the priority of our study. 1 However, although the mean baseline age was 67 years, we included participants aged 50 years or older, so it did not focus exclusively on geriatric depression. As previously noted, 3 depression rates in our study were comparable with age- and sex-specific incidence and recurrence in rigorous prior work among community-dwelling older adults.

4 Moreover, incidence, rather than prevalence, is the relevant rate here. Also, Liang and colleagues do not distinguish between current vs lifetime prevalence or major vs minor depression. The estimated 31. 74% prevalence rate of depression is considerably higher than prior prevalence estimates of late-life major depression and depressive disorders. 5 This discrepancy may also reflect varied or less stringent symptom questionnaire cut points for diagnosis of depression compared with diagnostic interviews, which were used in the source studies for the meta-analysis. 2 Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Effects of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and a simple home strength exercise program on fall prevention: the DO-HEALTH randomized clinical trial [^cc25b69d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The roles of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and home exercise on fall prevention among generally healthy and active older adults are unclear.

Objectives

We tested the effects of daily supplemental vitamin D, daily supplemental marine omega-3s fatty acids, and a simple home exercise program (SHEP), alone or in combination, on the incidences of total and injurious falls among generally healthy older adults.

Methods

We performed a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial-design randomized controlled trial among 2157 community-dwelling adults aged 70 years and older, who had no major health events in the 5 years prior to enrolment, recruited from Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, and Portugal between December 2012 and November 2014. Participants were randomly assigned to supplementation with 2000 international units/day of vitamin D3 and/or 1 g/day of marine omega-3s, and/or a SHEP compared with placebo and/or control exercise over 3 years. The primary endpoint for the present fall analysis was the incidence rate of total falls. Falls were recorded prospectively throughout the trial. Since there were no interactions between treatments, the main effects are reported based on a modified intent-to-treat analysis.

Results

Of 2157 randomized participants, 1900 (88%) completed the study. The mean age was 74.9 years, 61.7% were women, 40.7% had a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration < 20 ng/ml, and 83% were at least moderately physically active. In total, 3333 falls were recorded over a median follow-up of 2.99 years. Overall, vitamin D and the SHEP had no benefit on total falls, whilst supplementation with omega-3s compared to no omega-3 supplementation reduced total falls by 10% (incidence rate ratio = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–1.00; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Among generally healthy, active, and vitamin D-replete older adults, omega-3 supplementation may have a modest benefit on the incidence of total falls, whilst a daily high dose of vitamin D or a SHEP had no benefit.

### Effects of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids on depressed mood: systematic review of published trials [^13e59fd0]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Greater dietary intakes of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may be beneficial for depressed mood.

Objective

This study aimed to systematically review all published randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood.

Design

Eight medical and health databases were searched over all years of records until June 2006 for trials that exposed participants to n-3 PUFAs or fish, measured depressed mood, were conducted on human participants, and included a comparison group.

Results

Eighteen randomized controlled trials were identified; 12 were included in a meta-analysis. The pooled standardized difference in mean outcome (fixed-effects model) was 0.13 SDs (95% CI: 0.01, 0.25) in those receiving n-3 PUFAs compared with placebo, with strong evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 79%, P < 0.001). The presence of funnel plot asymmetry suggested that publication bias was the likely source of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses that excluded one large trial increased the effect size estimates but did not reduce heterogeneity. Meta-regression provided some evidence that the effect was stronger in trials involving populations with major depression-the difference in the effect size estimates was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.05, 1.41; P = 0.04), but there was still considerable heterogeneity when trials that involved populations with major depression were pooled separately (I2 = 72%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Trial evidence that examines the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood is limited and is difficult to summarize and evaluate because of considerable heterogeneity. The evidence available provides little support for the use of n-3 PUFAs to improve depressed mood. Larger trials with adequate power to detect clinically important benefits are required.

### Effect of vitamin D3 supplements on development of advanced cancer: a secondary analysis of the VITAL randomized clinical trial [^e395cc9b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Epidemiologic and trial data suggest that vitamin D supplementation may reduce metastatic cancer and cancer mortality, reflecting shared biological pathways.

Objective

To follow up on the possible reduction in cancer death in the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) with an evaluation of whether vitamin D reduces the incidence of advanced (metastatic or fatal) cancer and an examination possible effect modification by body mass index.

Design, Setting, and Participants

VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial clinical trial of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/d). This multicenter clinical trial was conducted in the United States; participants included men aged 50 years or older and women aged 55 years or older who were free of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline. Randomization took place from November 2011 through March 2014, and study medication ended on December 31, 2017. Data for this secondary analysis were analyzed from November 1, 2011, to December 31, 2017.

Interventions

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/d) supplements.

Main Outcomes and Measures

For the present analysis, the primary outcome was a composite incidence of metastatic and fatal invasive total cancer, because the main VITAL study showed a possible reduction in fatal cancer with vitamin D supplementation and effect modification by body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) for total cancer incidence reduction for individuals with normal BMI, but not for individuals with overweight or obesity. Secondary analyses included examination of BMI (< 25, 25 to < 30, and ≥ 30) as effect modifiers of the observed associations.

Results

Among 25 871 randomized VITAL participants (51% female; mean [SD] age, 67.1 [7.1] years), 1617 were diagnosed with invasive cancer over a median intervention period of 5.3 years (range, 3.8–6.1 years). As previously reported, no significant differences for cancer incidence by treatment arm were observed. However, a significant reduction in advanced cancers (metastatic or fatal) was found for those randomized to vitamin D compared with placebo (226 of 12 927 assigned to vitamin D [1.7%] and 274 of 12 944 assigned to placebo [2.1%]; HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69–0.99]; P = 0.04). When stratified by BMI, there was a significant reduction for the vitamin D arm in incident metastatic or fatal cancer among those with normal BMI (BMI < 25: HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45–0.86]) but not among those with overweight or obesity (BMI 25- < 30: HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.68–1.17]; BMI ≥ 30: HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.74–1.49]) (P = 0.03 for interaction by BMI).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, supplementation with vitamin D reduced the incidence of advanced (metastatic or fatal) cancer in the overall cohort, with the strongest risk reduction seen in individuals with normal weight.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^879041a9]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency, but 26 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 1 nested case-control study assessed treatment with deficiency variably defined as < 20 ng/mL to ≤ 31.2 ng/mL across outcomes. For all-cause mortality, trials ranged from 16 weeks to 7 years and a pooled analysis of 8 trials (n = 2006) showed no difference with vitamin D treatment vs controls (relative risk [RR], 1.13 [95% CI, 0.93–1.28]). For incident diabetes, 5 RCTs with 1 to 7 years of follow-up (n = 3356) found no difference (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.80–1.15]). For cardiovascular events, VITAL (n = 2001) and ViDA (n = 1270) reported no statistically significant differences among subgroups with serum vitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL at baseline; VITAL had 5.3 years of follow-up and ViDA had 3.3 years of follow-up. For cancer incidence, VITAL and a post hoc ViDA analysis reported no difference among participants with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/mL at baseline; ViDA had only 3 years of follow-up, and in the WHI Calcium–Vitamin D nested case-control, there was no significant difference at less than 12 ng/mL (adjusted OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.59–1.79]) or between 12 and 20 ng/mL (adjusted OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.87–1.48]). For falls, pooled data found no association with number of falls (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.75–1.08]). In VITAL–DEP, among those with baseline less than 20 ng/mL (n = 1328), there was no difference in change in depression scores over a median 5.3 years. An unplanned subgroup analysis found no difference in incidence of a first urinary tract infection among participants with vitamin D deficiency treated with vitamin D compared with placebo. For outcomes with sufficient data (mortality, fractures, and falls), findings were similar between studies using a lower threshold and studies using a higher threshold.

### Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder [^52c2b864]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been proposed as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Over the last decade, several meta-analyses have been performed, which suggested variable degrees of beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFAs for MDD, but made critical remarks regarding the quality of the evidence and possible publication bias. These meta-analyses evoked academic correspondence, discussing the used inclusion criteria and selection of outcome measures. In brief, this correspondence suggested beneficial effects (1) if a higher ratio of omega-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was being supplementedand (2) only in patients with actual MDD as opposed to subjects with merely depressive symptoms.

Of these meta-analyses, only the three most recent meta-analyses covered the research performed over the last 5 years: (1) Grosso et al. included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to August 2013, and concluded that omega-3 PUFAs were effective in depressive patients with or without an MDD diagnosis; (2) Yang et al. pooled RCTs published up to March 2015 on the effect of the combination of EPA and DHA on depression in women and observed a beneficial effect; and (3) Appleton et al. performed a Cochrane meta-analysis of RCTs published up to May 2015, concluding that there is a small-to-modest, non-clinically beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs.

### Do essential fatty acids have a role in the treatment of depression? [^0371d56d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies are used more than conventional therapies by people with self-defined anxiety and depression. Preliminary evidence supports a hypothesis that low plasma concentration of essential fatty acids is associated with depression. Reported here is the result of a systematic review examining the therapeutic efficacy of essential fatty acids for depression.

Methods

Data sources included Medline, Psychinfo, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases searched from inception through September 2001. English language randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, intervention studies, case control studies, reviews, and case reports of humans were selected, without limits for demographics or co-morbidities. Two abstractors independently evaluated each study, then reconciled findings. When possible, between group treatment effect size was noted or calculated.

Results

Six articles met inclusion criteria: one RCT, two reviews, and three case control trials. A common outcome measure among the case control trials allowed for direct comparison of effect sizes.

Conclusions

The evidence implies promise of a treatment effect of omega-3 fatty acids for depression in adults; although a statement of definitive clinical efficacy is premature. Further study of essential fatty acids as independent and adjuvant therapy for adult depression is indicated, including more sophisticated investigation of dose-response in particular populations.

### Anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^36585872]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence from clinical and animal studies with anti-inflammatory agents in depression is conflicting. One possible reason is the heterogeneity of baseline inflammation levels. Since older adults are generally associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and depression is one of the most common mental disorders in this population, this meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the therapeutic and preventative effects of anti-inflammatory interventions for depression among older adults. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 18, 2024. The primary outcomes were mean change scores of depression scores and incidences of depression after treatment. Pooled standard mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Of 3116 screened articles, 31 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with 25 studies investigating efficacy and 7 studies investigating the incidence following anti-inflammatory treatment. Anti-inflammatory interventions were statistically significantly more effective than placebo in reducing depressive scores for older adults with depression (SMD = −0.57, 95% CI = −0.98 to −0.15, p = 0.008). Sub-group analyses supported the use of omega-3 fatty acids (SMD = −0.14, 95% CI = −0.27 to −0.02, p = 0.03) and botanical drug or dietary intervention (SMD = −0.86, 95% CI = −1.58 to −0.13, p = 0.02) among older participants. While limited by substantial heterogeneity among included studies, these results reveal the moderate beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults. Future high-quality RCTs are warranted to determine which anti-inflammatory interventions are most preferential for older patients with depression.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression: a review of the evidence and a methodological critique [^d65f3103]. Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Several lines of evidence indicate an association between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and depression. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the evidence to date within the context of the study design and methodology used. In case-control and cohort studies, concentrations of omega-3 PUFAs were lower in participants with unipolar and postpartum depression. Fish are the major dietary source of omega-3 PUFAs, and infrequent fish consumption is associated with depression in epidemiological studies. While these findings do not appear to be the result of confounding, in some studies failure to detect confounding may be due to a lack of power or incomplete control. In four of seven double-blind randomized controlled trials, depression was significantly improved upon treatment with at least 1 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid, an omega-3 PUFA. While clinical significance was demonstrated, preservation of blinding may be a limitation in this area of research. It remains unclear whether omega-3 supplementation is effective independently of antidepressant treatment, for depressed patients in general or only those with abnormally low concentrations of these PUFAs. The relationship between omega-3 PUFAs and depression is biologically plausible and is consistent across study designs, study groups, and diverse populations, which increases the likelihood of a causal relationship.

### Effect of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on risk of frailty: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^38df71da]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are postulated to have anabolic effects through activation of the mTOR signaling pathway and lowering insulin resistance, both of which are implicated in sarcopenia, and CVD. In the VITAL trial, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation did not lower the overall incidence of a major CVD event (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80–1.06; P = 0.24), although there was a significant effect on lower risk of myocardial infarction, fatal myocardial infarction, and total coronary heart disease. In a meta-analysis of 13 trials that included a total of 127 477 participants followed up for an average of 5 years, there was a significantly lower risk of CVD events in those randomized to omega-3 fatty acids vs placebo. Furthermore, the Prevention with Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) trial demonstrated that high adherence to a Mediterranean diet, which is high in fish consumption, was associated with a lower risk of frailty in post-hoc analysis. These data have led to the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may also prevent frailty. The data in the present study do not support the use of omega-3 fatty acids for prevention of frailty; in fact, in subgroup analyses, there was a significant interaction for age favoring placebo for individuals aged 67 years and older. These subgroup data should be interpreted with caution.

The lack of benefit of vitamin D 3 or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on frailty in the VITAL trial may be due to the overall healthy population, as evidenced by only 13% with frailty at baseline. In the general population of older adults of similar ages, prevalence rates of frailty approach 25%, and the rate in those with CVD can be as high as 60%. It is possible that persons who will benefit the most from supplementation with vitamin D 3 and omega-3 fatty acids are more vulnerable individuals, such as those no longer able to live in the community.

### Efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in depression: a meta-analysis [^8d5ddca2]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

We conducted this meta-analysis of double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials to estimate the efficacy of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in the improvement of depression. We applied a systematic bibliographic search in PubMed and EMBASE for articles published prior to 20 December 2017. This meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and R 3.4.3, and means and standard deviations were calculated in fixed- or random-effects models based on the results of the Q-test. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the stability of the results, and publication bias was evaluated by a funnel plot and Egger's linear regression analysis. Our search resulted in 180 articles; we analyzed 26 studies, which included 2160 participants. The meta-analysis showed an overall beneficial effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on depression symptoms (SMD = -0.28, P = 0.004). Compared with placebo, EPA-pure (= 100% EPA) and EPA-major formulations (≥ 60% EPA) demonstrated clinical benefits with an EPA dosage ≤ 1g/d (SMD = -0.50, P = 0.003, and SMD = -1.03, P = 0.03, respectively), whereas DHA-pure and DHA-major formulations did not exhibit such benefits. Current evidence supports the finding that omega-3 PUFAs with EPA ≥ 60% at a dosage of ≤ 1g/d would have beneficial effects on depression. Further studies are warranted to examine supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs for specific subgroups of subjects with inflammation, severity of depression, and the dose response for both EPA and DHA supplementation.

### Effect of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on risk of frailty: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^c7c26899]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this ancillary study of the VITAL randomized clinical trial of community-dwelling participants aged 50 years and older, neither vitamin D 3, 2000 IU/d, nor omega-3 fatty acid, 1 g/d, supplementation, compared with placebo, affected frailty levels or incidence change in frailty scores over 5 years of treatment. Results did not change significantly after considering interactions by sex, race and ethnicity, BMI, baseline serum 25(OH)D levels, and weekly fish consumption, or when using an alternative definition of frailty, except for a significant interaction by age for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. These results do not support the routine supplementation of healthy community-dwelling adults with vitamin D 3 or omega-3 fatty acids for the prevention of frailty.

Frailty, a syndrome of diminished physiologic reserve, is caused by inflammation and worsened by poor nutrition. Observational data have shown an association between malnutrition and increased risk of frailty, and supplementation with micronutrients and macronutrients has been hypothesized as a potential approach for both prevention and treatment of frailty. Moreover, sarcopenia and decline in function are closely related, and perhaps on the pathway to frailty. Frailty is differentiated from sarcopenia as a multisystem impairment leading to an increased vulnerability. Low 25(OH)D concentrations have been implicated in sarcopenia, in part through the presence of 1,25(OH) 2 D receptors in skeletal muscle that lead to alterations in contractility and reduced muscle synthesis. Low concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids have similarly been associated with an increased risk of frailty and sarcopenia. It is therefore tempting to consider supplementation with vitamin D 3 and omega-3 fatty acids, both of which have anti-inflammatory properties, as strategies to lower the risk of frailty and sarcopenia. However, the reported findings in this trial on participants largely replete in vitamin D 3 do not support this practice. It is possible that in a less-nourished population, vitamin D 3 and omega-3 fatty acids may have a role in prevention of frailty. Regular exercise and the Mediterranean diet are proven strategies for the prevention of frailty and should be encouraged for older adults.

### Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder [^507e19d0]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Search strategy

We performed a search in the Medline and Embase databases (from inception up to 8 December 2015). We used a search strategy combining terms regarding MDD and fatty acid supplementation using Boolean operators (See Supplementary Methods). We additionally searched references of selected studies and earlier meta-analyses for potential studies.

Study selection

Two independent reviewers (RJTM and IH/JA) screened the identified articles for their relevance by title and abstract, and — if necessary — the full text. In case of disagreement between reviewers, inclusion could be conclusively determined by discussion in all the cases. A priori criteria for inclusion of studies were: (1) design was a randomized placebo-controlled trial; (2) inclusion of adult patients with MDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as assessed by a standardized clinical interview. We excluded studies that (1) specifically studied perinatal or perimenopausal MDD or (2) MDD secondary to other neuropsychiatric disorders.

With these in- and exclusion criteria, we aimed to test the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on depressive symptoms specifically in MDD, as opposed to depressive symptoms in the general population (including subclinical depression). Because previous meta-analyses included clinically more heterogeneous populations which theoretically may preclude meta-analysis, we aimed to prevent inclusion of trials where supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids could improve an underlying somatic or (neuro)psychiatric disorder, with a secondary effect on the depression scores. In addition, by excluding specific subgroups like perinatal or perimenopausal MDD, with a potentially different pathophysiology, we aimed to further minimize heterogeneity among included studies. Because of the widespread comorbidity between MDD and cardiovascular disease, we did not exclude studies that specifically studied MDD with comorbid cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Nevertheless, we performed sensitivity analyses without the studies that specifically studied MDD with comorbid cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

Critical appraisal

We assessed the quality of the studies that were selected with the in- and exclusion criteria above using the Jadad scale for reporting RCTs.

3.4 Modification of intervention effects on depressive symptoms by baseline PUFA levels

Table 3 reports the results of mixed models adjusted for all sociodemographic, lifestyle, and somatic health covariates, examining whether the effect of multinutrient and n‐3 PUFA fish oil supplements on depressive symptoms over time is modified by baseline n‐3 PUFA, DHA, EPA, and n‐6 PUFA levels. Subjects taking supplements, as compared to those on placebo, tended to have higher although statistically not significant, depressive symptoms over the entire follow‐up (β = 1.13, SE = 0.621, p = .070; β = 1.12, SE = 0.621, p = .070; β = 1.13, SE = 0.620, p = .068; β = 1.13, SE = 0.622, p = .070, respectively). Baseline n‐3 PUFA, DHA, EPA, and n‐6 PUFA did not modify the effect of the supplements (p = .40, p = .29, p = .67, and p = .84, respectively). This was consistent over time (e.g. all baseline PUFA‐by‐intervention‐by‐time interaction terms, p > .05). Subjects in the groups with F‐BA had depressive symptoms severity comparable to subjects in the groups without F‐BA, and the effect of the F‐BA on depressive symptoms over time was also not modified by baseline n‐3 PUFA, DHA, EPA, and n‐6 PUFA levels (results not shown).

### Effects of 1-year treatment with highly purified omega-3 fatty acids on depression after myocardial infarction: results from the OMEGA trial [^8f810b1c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The effects of supplementation of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on prevalence and severity of depression were evaluated in patients after a myocardial infarction.

Method

A cross-sectional evaluation (posttest-only design) within the prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter OMEGA trial was performed in patients after myocardial infarction at 12 months' follow-up (N = 2,081; age, mean = 64 years; men, 76.7%; women, 21.8%) from April 2005 to June 2007. Patients received supplementation with ethyl esters 90 (460-mg EPA and 380-mg DHA) or placebo for 12 months. Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); a BDI-II cutoff score of ≥ 14 was used as diagnosis of depression.

Results

When the total population was evaluated, no effects of EPA/DHA supplementation on depressive symptoms according to BDI-II score (mean [SD]) could be demonstrated: EPA/DHA (n = 1,046), 7.1 (6.9); placebo (n = 1,035), 7.1 (7.0); P = 0.7. The post hoc analyses of depressed patients with and without antidepressants revealed a tendency toward an antidepressant effect in patients with EPA/DHA supplementation as monotherapy: EPA/DHA (n = 125), 19.4 (5.8); placebo (n = 113), 19.9 (5.1); P = 0.07. However, in depressed patients with EPA/DHA supplementation as adjunctive to conventional antidepressants, a clinically relevant antidepressant effect was demonstrated: EPA/DHA (n = 33), 20.9 (7.1); placebo (n = 29), 24.9 (8.5); P < .05.

Conclusions

EPA/DHA supplementation in the total sample of patients after myocardial infarction had no effect on depressive symptoms. The clinically relevant antidepressant effect in the subgroup of depressed patients with EPA/DHA supplementation as adjunctive to conventional antidepressants that was revealed in the post hoc analysis might provide a basis for a controlled, prospective trial of omega-3 augmentation of antidepressants in patients after myocardial infarction.

### Omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio and subsequent mood disorders in young people with at-risk mental states: a 7-year longitudinal study [^526e1380]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have important physiological functions and are key regulators of cell membrane properties. As such, they play important structural and functional roles in the human brain and affect monoaminergic neurotransmission, dendritic arborization, synapse formation, and ion channel function. Omega-3 (n -3) PUFAs have been shown to possess anti-inflammatoryand antioxidantproperties, while n -6 PUFAs are generally seen as pro-inflammatory, and a high n -6/3 PUFA ratio is thought to have adverse health effects.

Epidemiological studies show that the dietary intake of n -3 PUFAs through fish consumption is inversely correlated with the prevalence of depression, thus suggesting that n -3 PUFAs have a protective effect. While the traditional human diet has a ratio of n -6/3 PUFA of approximately 1:1, contemporary Western diets are characterized by a ratio of around 15:1, reflecting deficient intake of n -3 fatty acids and excessive intake of n -6 fatty acids. Importantly, adherence to a Western diet is associated with a higher prevalence of depression. This has given rise to the hypothesis that the long-term changes in dietary patterns that have occurred in industrialized countries over the last centuries have led to an increase in the n -6/3 PUFA ratio, which may be causally linked to an increase in the incidence of mood disorders. Indeed, case–control studies have suggested that individuals with depression have lower levels of n -3 PUFAs and higher n -6/3 PUFA ratios compared to healthy controls. Recent meta-analyses of n -3 PUFAs supplementation trials in patients with depression have resulted in inconsistent conclusions. Some meta-analyses have concluded that n -3 PUFA supplementation does not have a significant benefit on depressive symptoms, while others have found significant beneficial effects, which appeared to be related to higher doses of the n -3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Although lower levels of n -3 PUFAs and higher n -6/3 PUFA ratios have been reported in adults with depression, little is known about PUFA levels in youth, nor whether abnormalities in membrane lipid composition precede the onset of depression in this group. This is salient because even prenatal and early childhood diet appears to play a role in risk for mood disorders, and as such represents a potential intervention target.

### Effect of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on risk of frailty: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^18bc651a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The rapid increase of the worldwide population of aging individuals has led to increased urgency to identify potential preventive strategies for frailty. Frailty is a syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve in the face of external stressors that is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Although frailty is independent of age, it increases in prevalence with age, with estimates that up to half of adults aged 85 years and older are living with frailty. Chronic inflammation is a primary hypothesized mechanism leading to frailty. Whether medications and supplements with anti-inflammatory properties can lower the risk of frailty remains uncertain.

The Vitamin D and Omega-3 (VITAL) trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of vitamin D 3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the primary outcomes of cancer or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both of these supplements have anti-inflammatory properties and may have a role in lowering the risk of frailty over time or modifying the trajectory of frailty. Specifically, low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels are associated with frailty, potentially as a marker of poor nutrition or through a direct effect on muscle and bone health, both of which are closely linked with frailty. Observational studies, however, are limited by reverse causation. Studies in mice have suggested that supplementation with vitamin D 3 may slow the development of frailty, but observational data in humans have been mixed and study data are limited. Omega-3 fatty acids may have a role in prevention of CVD, which shares a bidirectional association with frailty. Moreover, some evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may improve sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss, which is closely interrelated with frailty. Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that vitamin D 3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation would lower the risk of frailty, defined according to 2 leading definitions of frailty, over time in community-dwelling older adults who participated in the VITAL trial.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms in HIV-positive individuals: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^452fdc88]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The antidepressant effect of omega-3 fatty acids has been described in the non-HIV population. The effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the mood status of HIV-positive patients has not been evaluated yet.

Objective

In this study, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms was evaluated in HIV-positive individuals.

Method

A total of 100 HIV-positive patients with Beck Depression Score ≥ 16, were assigned to receive either omega-3 fatty acids or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. Depressive symptoms of each participant were evaluated at baseline (month 0) and at the end of months 1 and 2 of the study. Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition, depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire were used for assessment of depressive symptoms.

Results

Reduction in mean ± SD of all depression scores during the study period was statistically significant within the omega-3 group and when compared with the placebo group (for both comparisons, P < 0.001). Also, the mean differences of all depression scores were decreased significantly during the intervals: months 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Among the participants, 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) patients in the omega-3 and the placebo group, respectively, experienced mild gastrointestinal problems, but the incidence of adverse drug reactions related to the interventions was not statistically different between the groups (P = 0.09).

Conclusion

Omega-3 fatty acids improved depressive symptoms in HIV-positive individuals without any significant adverse reaction.

### Anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6a75347c]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

This study provides a new perspective on using anti-inflammatory interventions in the elderly population. The anti-inflammatory regimen can be a potential choice for depression amelioration and prevention in older adults. Considering the limited efficacy of current antidepressant agents, it is warranted to further assess the combined effect of antidepressants and omega-3 FA, botanical drug or dietary intervention. Besides, more high-quality RCTs are needed to answer the following important questions. First, which kind of botanical drug or dietary interventions or what ratio of omega-3 FA is most recommended for older adults? Second, how do we adjust the anti-inflammatory regimens for therapeutic or preventative purposes?

This meta-analysis had several limitations. First, to retrieve as much data as possible from available clinical studies of anti-inflammatory interventions in managing of depressive symptoms in elder subjects, we included subjects with an average age older than 60. The results may be underestimated or overestimated due to this confounding factor, while we took this confounding factor into account in the GRADE assessment. Second, although all the included original studies were RCTs, the baseline depressive scores could be different. Meta-analysis based on the changes in depressive symptoms from baseline to endpoint could mitigate but could not fully avoid the potential overestimation of our results. Besides, given that most included studies assessed depressive symptoms by GDS > 5 points, our findings could be more applicable for mild to moderate depression in the elderly. The efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatments on severe depression remains to be verified by further clinical trials. Third, substantial heterogeneity was found in most analyses, which could not be effectively avoided by subgroup analysis or sensitivity analysis. Fourth, insufficient data were available to determine the difference in efficacy of anti-inflammatory interventions on older participants with and without high-level baseline inflammation. Fifth, the classification of anti-inflammatory treatments for older adults remains provisional. For instance, the interventions implemented in the studies of this meta-analysis under the heading "botanical drug or dietary intervention" were somewhat heterogeneous.

In conclusion, our findings of the comprehensive meta-analysis support the notion that anti-inflammatory interventions might help to prevent and reduce depressive symptoms in older participants with or without depression. Omega-3 FA and botanical drugs, or dietary intervention, rather than NSAIDs or statins, show promising anti-depressant effects in older adults. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity in most comparisons. Future RCTs are warranted to further assess the safety and efficacy of anti-inflammatory intervention monotherapy or combined treatment with first-line antidepressants.

Figure 1 depicts the estimated mean n‐3 PUFA, DHA, EPA, and n‐6 PUFA levels for all four intervention groups derived from a linear mixed model (Table S2) adjusted for all sociodemographic, lifestyle, and somatic health covariates. At the 6‐month follow‐up, the supplement group without F‐BA, and the supplement group with F‐BA, had higher n‐3 PUFA (Cohen's d = 0.27, p < .001; Cohen's d = 0.23, p < .001), EPA (Cohen's d = 0.38, p < .001; Cohen's d = 0.34, p < .001), and DHA (Cohen's d = 0.14, p = .001; Cohen's d = 0.10, p = .013) levels compared to the placebo without F‐BA group. At the 12‐month follow‐up, the supplement group without F‐BA and the supplement group with F‐BA, still had higher levels of n‐3 PUFA (Cohen's d = 0.21, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.19, p < .001) and EPA levels (Cohen's d = 0.33, p < .001; Cohen's d = 0.31, p < .001) as compared to the placebo without F‐BA group, but only the supplement group without F‐BA maintained significantly higher DHA level (d = .09, p = .032). The placebo group with F‐BA had significantly higher levels of DHA (d = 0.09, p = .033) only at a 6‐month follow‐up, as compared to the placebo group without F‐BA. No significant differences in mean n‐6 PUFA levels across the four groups were found at any time point.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^defddfba]. Molecular Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acid (FA) treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in order to determine efficacy and to examine sources of heterogeneity between trials. PubMed (1965-May 2010) was searched for randomized, placebo-controlled trials of omega-3 FAs for MDD. Our primary outcome measure was standardized mean difference in a clinical measure of depression severity. In stratified meta-analysis, we examined the effects of trial duration, trial methodological quality, baseline depression severity, diagnostic indication, dose of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in omega-3 preparations, and whether omega-3 FA was given as monotherapy or augmentation. In 13 randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of omega-3 FAs involving 731 participants, meta-analysis demonstrated no significant benefit of omega-3 FA treatment compared with placebo (standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.04, 0.26). Meta-analysis demonstrated significant heterogeneity and publication bias. Nearly all evidence of omega-3 benefit was removed after adjusting for publication bias using the trim-and-fill method (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.13, 0.15). Secondary analyses suggested a trend toward increased efficacy of omega-3 FAs in trials of lower methodological quality, trials of shorter duration, trials which utilized completers rather than intention-to-treat analysis, and trials in which study participants had greater baseline depression severity. Current published trials suggest a small, non-significant benefit of omega-3 FAs for major depression. Nearly all of the treatment efficacy observed in the published literature may be attributable to publication bias.

1 INTRODUCTION

Omega‐3 (n‐3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) consist of, for example, α‐linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and can be mainly found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and some nuts and seeds (James, Gibson, & Cleland, 2000; Simopoulos, 1999). ALA is a so‐called essential fatty acid as humans must ingest ALA through their diet (e.g. leafy green vegetables and in flaxseed and canola oils), or through supplements as our bodies seem to require ALA for good health but cannot synthesize ALA by itself (Young & Conquer, 2005). Omega‐6 (n‐6) PUFAs consist of, for example, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, which are, for example, found in plant and vegetable seeds and oils as found in margarine and many processed foods (James et al. 2000; Simopoulos, 1999).

Depression — n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) have been studied for prevention and treatment in adults and children with heterogeneous findings. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials mostly in adults with major depression or depressive symptoms found DHA and EPA supplementation yielded a pooled SMD of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.59), suggesting a beneficial effect versus placebo, while other meta-analyses have not found a beneficial effect and attribute positive results to publication bias and methodologic shortcomings. Cross-sectional pediatric studies have demonstrated lower erythrocyte DHA levels in patients with major depression, and trials of fish consumption or n-3 LCPUFA treatment in children have had mixed results.

VA/DoD guideline — omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D for major depressive disorder (MDD) — We suggest against using omega-3 fatty acids or vitamin D for treatment of MDD (Weak against | Not reviewed, Not changed). Evidence for omega-3 fatty acids reports no significant overall benefit for depressive symptoms, with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) having no effect and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) showing a small effect, and the quality of evidence rated as poor; even though EPA may have a small benefit compared to placebo in adults with MDD, the evidence base was not sufficient to recommend prescribing EPA instead of other validated medications or psychotherapies. For vitamin D, available evidence does not support supplementation as monotherapy, including one systematic review (SR) of mild to moderate MDD in adults with normal serum vitamin D that included nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly allocating 4,923 patients and indicating a non-significant difference favoring placebo. In severe MDD with deficiency, one RCT randomly allocated 109 participants to 300,000 IU vitamin D3, 150,000 IU vitamin D3, or no treatment and followed participants for three months; investigators reported 300,000 IU vitamin D3 was more effective than no treatment, with no significant difference for 150,000 IU versus no treatment, but the study quality was poor with lack of ITT analysis and double-blinding, and the dosage and route of administration were atypical for most clinical practice, which generally recommends 50,000 IU orally weekly until vitamin D levels normalize. The recommendation remains Not reviewed, Not changed, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low.

At the same time, interventions that ameliorate insulin resistance may reduce long-term risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Studies have suggested that supplementation with marine omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) may improve insulin sensitivity, although the effect on risk of incident T2D remains controversial. N-3 FA may reduce the risk of CVD, particularly CHD, as shown in observational studies of fish/omega-3 intake and biomarkers, as well as some RCTs of marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Additionally, a prior meta-analysis suggested that fish oil supplementation may improve insulin sensitivity among individuals with underlying metabolic dysfunction. Vitamin D has also been identified to improve markers of insulin resistance, was associated with lower risk of T2D and CVD in some observational studies, and may modestly reduce the incidence of diabetes, though its role in cardiovascular outcomes may be relatively limited. One study also showed that vitamin D treatment led to a 50% increased likelihood of reverting from prediabetes to normoglycemia. However, fewer studies have examined the relationship between these interventions among individuals with varying degrees of insulin resistance.

The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, NCT01169259) was a 2 × 2 factorial design randomized controlled trial that investigated the efficacy of n-3 FA (1 g/day) and vitamin D 3 (2000 IU/day) for the primary prevention of CVD and cancer. Using a nested case-control design within VITAL, we aimed to assess the association of 4 biomarkers of glucose-insulin homeostasis with the risk of incident cardiometabolic diseases, and whether these associations may be modifiable by the randomized treatments (e.g. vitamin D or n-3 FA). We hypothesized that higher baseline levels of insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and the novel IRS would be positively associated with incident CVD, CHD, and T2D, but these associations would be attenuated among participants assigned to active n-3 FA or vitamin D treatment compared to those assigned to placebo.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for major depressive disorder with high inflammation: a randomized dose-finding clinical trial [^80a8b745]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective: This study compared the impact of 3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) doses versus placebo on inflammatory biomarkers and depressive symptoms.

Methods: Sixty-one unmedicated adults (75% female; 45.5 ± 13.8 years) with DSM-5 major depressive disorder (MDD), body mass index > 25 kg/m 2, and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) ≥ 3.0 mg/L were randomly assigned to receive EPA 1 g/d, 2 g/d, or 4 g/d or placebo for 12 weeks. Prespecified endpoints were a ≥ 0.40 effect size decrease in plasma interleukin (IL)-6, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokines, and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Response was defined as a ≥ 50% decrease of Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Clinician-Rated version (IDS-C30) scores. We compared outcomes for the 3 EPA doses versus placebo.

Results: In 45 completers, only median PBMC TNF decreased at 2 g/d EPA. No EPA dose produced a ≥ 0.35 effect size reduction in plasma IL-6 or mitogen-stimulated TNF. Response rates for EPA 4 g/d were 64%, versus 40% for placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 2.63; Cohen d = 0.53), 38% for EPA 1 g/d, and 36% for EPA 2 g/d (all P > .05). EPA 4 g/d showed a significant correlation between percent decrease in plasma hs-CRP and IDS-C30 symptom reduction at 12 weeks (Spearman ρ = 0.691, P = 0.019).

Conclusions: EPA 4 g/d demonstrated a medium effect size for response rates versus placebo. This dose may alleviate MDD in overweight individuals with elevated inflammatory markers, and change in hs-CRP may be correlated with clinical response.

Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02553915.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for depression in children and adolescents [^9e088e60]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Mental health disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD) are well recognized as major contributors to the global burden of disease among adolescents. The prevalence of adolescent depression is estimated to have increased by at least 25% during the COVID-19 pandemic, compounding the already challenging problem of insufficient mental health service and service accessibility that existed prepandemic. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation is currently recommended as a preventive treatment for depression in high-risk adults as well as a second-line monotherapy for adults with mild to moderate MDD, and adjunctive to antidepressants for adults with moderate to severe MDD. The benefits of omega-3 PUFA intake on depressive illness have been hypothesized to occur as a result of their effect on neurotransmission, maintenance of membrane fluidity, and anti-inflammatory action. A comprehensive synthesis and quantification of the existing evidence on omega-3 PUFA's efficacy in treating depression among children and adolescents is essential for clinicians to provide informed guidance to young people and their families, especially considering the absence of current guidelines for this age group.

Objectives

Primary objective To determine the impact of omega-3 PUFA supplementation versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, wait list controls, no treatment/supplementation, or standard care) on clinician-diagnosed depression or self-reported depression symptoms in children and adolescents. Secondary objectives To estimate the size of the effect of omega-3 PUFAs on depression symptoms. To estimate the effect of each type of omega-3 PUFA (EPA or DHA), compared with placebo, on depression. To determine if the effect is modified by dosage, format (capsule or liquid), sex, or age. To determine compliance and attrition for omega-3 PUFAs as an intervention for depression in children and adolescents. To determine the safety of omega-3 PUFAs as an intervention for depression in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, reference lists of included studies, grey literature, and relevant reviews. The latest search date was 18 May 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving males and females aged 19 years or younger with diagnosed depression comparing omega-3 PUFA supplementation to placebo, wait list control, no treatment/supplementation, or standard care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were self-reported depression symptoms and clinically diagnosed resolution of depression. Our secondary outcomes were attrition, adverse effects, and compliance with the intervention. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for key outcomes.

Main Results

We included five trials with 228 participants in our meta-analysis. All trials used a placebo comparator; intervention duration ranged from 10 to 16 weeks (median: 12 weeks). Omega-3 PUFA supplementation compared to placebo may reduce self-reported depression symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.85 to 0.17; lower SMD means greater improvement in depression due to omega-3 PUFA; 5 trials, 185 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may have little to no effect on remission of depression symptoms compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (omega-3 PUFA versus placebo: 50% versus 48%; odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.75; 4 trials, 127 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may result in little to no difference in attrition (dropouts) compared to placebo (omega-3 PUFA versus placebo: 18% versus 19%; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.90; 5 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence). Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may result in little to no difference in adverse effects, with one study reporting more muscle cramps in the fish oil group (13/27 participants) compared to the placebo group (6/29 participants); one study reported more frequent defecation in the omega-3 group (1/29 participants) and one study identified mild skin rash and unusual/manic behavior in the placebo group (2/27 participants). None of the included studies reported serious adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on five small studies, omega-3 PUFA supplementation may reduce self-reported depression symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may have little to no effect on depression remission compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may result in little to no difference in attrition or adverse effects. The studies observed no serious adverse effects. This review highlights early-stage research on omega-3 PUFA and depression in young people. The evidence on the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in improving self-reported depression symptoms or achieving depression remission in children and adolescents is very uncertain. While no harms are evident, more data are needed to confirm potential risks. Addressing current limitations in the evidence base through the design and conduct of methodologically rigorous studies - larger sample sizes, varied dosages, eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid ratios, treatment durations, and safety profiles - is crucial to advance our understanding of the role of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for depression in children and adolescents.

### Supplementation-induced increase in circulating omega-3 serum levels is not associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms: results from the mooDFOOD depression prevention trial [^2dafe5d0]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is ambiguity on how omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with depression, and what the temporality of the association might be. The present study aimed to examine whether (intervention-induced changes in) n-3 PUFA levels were associated with (changes in) depressive symptoms.

Methods

Baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up data on 682 overweight and subclinically depressed persons from four European countries that participated in the MooDFOOD depression prevention randomized controlled trial were used. Participants were allocated to four intervention groups: (a) placebos, (b) placebos and food-related behavioral activation therapy (F-BA), (c) multinutrient supplements (fish oil and multivitamin), and (d) multinutrient supplements and F-BA. Depressive symptoms were measured using the inventory of depressive symptomatology. PUFA levels (µmol/L) were measured using gas chromatography. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographics, lifestyle, and somatic health.

Results

Increases in n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid levels over time were significantly larger in the supplement groups than in placebo groups. Change in PUFA levels was not significantly associated with the change in depressive symptoms (β = .002, SE = 0.003, p = .39; β = .003, SE = 0.005, p = .64; β = .005, SE = 0.005, p = .29; β = -.0002, SE = 0.0004, p = .69). Baseline PUFA levels did not modify the intervention effects on depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

In overweight and subclinical depressed persons, multinutrient supplements led to significant increases in n-3 PUFA levels over time, which were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Multinutrient supplements do not seem to be an effective preventive strategy in lowering depressive symptoms over time in these at-risk groups.

### Supplementation-induced increase in circulating omega-3 serum levels is not associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms: results from the mooDFOOD depression prevention trial [^202cd6b8]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

To summarize, this study shows that n‐3 PUFA and EPA levels can be effectively increased by fish oil supplements, but that these observed changes in n‐3 PUFA, EPA, DHA, and n‐6 PUFA levels over a 6‐month period were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms in the same period, and that baseline PUFA levels do not modify the effects of fish oil supplements on depressive symptoms. This could be one of the many possible explanations for the lack of preventive effect for depressive disorders found in the MooDFOOD depression prevention trial study. It can be concluded that the increase in n‐3 PUFA, DHA, and EPA circulating levels obtained through the n‐3 PUFA supplementation regime implemented in the MooDFOOD study (Bot et al. 2019) is not associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms in persons that have subclinical depressive symptoms. As several previous RCTs did find a beneficial treatment effect of n‐3 PUFA supplementation (Appleton et al. 2010, 2015; Grosso et al. 2014; Mocking et al. 2016), this may mean that PUFA alterations might be more involved in the progression of a depressive disorder rather than in the development of a depressive disorder.

Results

Selection of studies

An outline of the search strategy is presented in Supplementary 1. From the searches for recently published RCTs in the databases, 179 records were identified. Of these, 173 records were reviewed, and 16 trials met the eligibility criteria. From the searches for systematic reviews or meta-analyses, 25 potential records were identified, and 12 RCTs met the eligibility criteria. Two studies describing results that came from the same trial were removed. Ultimately, 26 trials were included in our meta-analysis (Fig. 1), and details of these trials are displayed in Table 1. Among these trials, 12 showed a significant effect of omega-3 PUFAs on the selected rating scales. The risk of bias for all included trials was assessed by the Cochrane methods, and the results can be seen in supplementary 2.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and mood disorders [^74a9dfb6]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This article is an overview of epidemiological and treatment studies suggesting that deficits in dietary-based omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may make an etiological contribution to mood disorders and that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may provide a therapeutic strategy.

Method

Relevant published studies are detailed and considered.

Results

Several epidemiological studies suggest covariation between seafood consumption and rates of mood disorders. Biological marker studies indicate deficits in omega-3 fatty acids in people with depressive disorders, while several treatment studies indicate therapeutic benefits from omega-3 supplementation. A similar contribution of omega-3 fatty acids to coronary artery disease may explain the well-described links between coronary artery disease and depression.

Conclusions

Deficits in omega-3 fatty acids have been identified as a contributing factor to mood disorders and offer a potential rational treatment approach. This review identifies a number of hypotheses and studies for consideration. In particular, the authors argue for studies clarifying the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation for unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders, both as individual and augmentation treatment strategies, and for studies pursuing which omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is likely to provide the greatest benefit.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid in the treatment of major depression [^06cc684d]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was an evaluation of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for the treatment of major depression.

Method

Thirty-six depressed patients were randomly assigned to receive DHA, 2 g/day, or placebo for 6 weeks. Response was defined a priori as a ≥ 50% reduction in the score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Thirty-five participants were evaluable; 18 received DHA, and 17 received placebo.

Results

Response rates were 27.8% in the DHA group and 23.5% in the placebo group. The difference in response rates between groups did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusions

This trial failed to show a significant effect of DHA monotherapy in subjects with major depression.

### Nutrition therapy recommendations for the management of adults with diabetes [^7cee29e1]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids

Evidence does not support recommending omega-3 (EPA and DHA) supplements for people with diabetes for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular events. (A)
As recommended for the general public, an increase in foods containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) (from fatty fish) and omega-3 linolenic acid (ALA) is recommended for individuals with diabetes because of their beneficial effects on lipoproteins, prevention of heart disease, and associations with positive health outcomes in observational studies. (B)
The recommendation for the general public to eat fish (particularly fatty fish) at least two times (two servings) per week is also appropriate for people with diabetes. (B)

The ADA systematic review identified seven RCTs and one single-arm study (2002–2010) using omega-3 fatty acid supplements and one cohort study on whole-food omega-3 intake. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids did not improve glycemic control, but higher-dose supplementation decreased triglycerides. Additional blood-derived markers of CVD risk were not consistently altered in these trials. In subjects with diabetes, six short-duration (30 days to 12 weeks) RCTs were published after the macronutrient review comparing omega-3 (EPA and DHA) supplements to placebo and reported minimal or no beneficial effects or mixed/inconsistent beneficial effects on CVD risk factors and other health issues (e.g. depression). Supplementation with flaxseed (32 g/day) or flaxseed oil (13 g/day) for 12 weeks did not affect glycemic control or adipokines. Three longer-duration studies (4 months; 40 months; 6.2 years) also reported mixed outcomes. Two studies reported no beneficial effects of supplementation. In one study, patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to atorvastatin or placebo and/or omega-3 supplements (2 g/day) or placebo. No differences on estimated 10-year CVD risks were observed with the addition of omega-3 fatty acid supplements compared with placebo. In the largest and longest trial, in patients with type 2 diabetes, supplementation with 1 g/day omega-3 fatty acids compared with placebo did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events, death from any cause, or death from arrhythmia. However, in one study in postmyocardial patients with diabetes, low-dose supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids (400 mg/day) exerted a protective effect on ventricular arrhythmia–related events, and a reduction in mortality was reported. Thus, RCTs do not support recommending omega-3 supplements for primary or secondary prevention of CVD despite the strength of evidence from observational and preclinical studies.

### Efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in depression: a meta-analysis [^341ffe07]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A growing body of evidence has indicated that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) have been effective in improving depression. Supplementation with the two main types of omega-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), has also been found to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression. However, EPA and DHA may play different roles in depression because of their involvement in anti-inflammatory activity and their maintenance of membrane integrity and fluidity, respectively. The different therapeutic effects of EPA and DHA on depression need to be further studied.

The treatment efficacy of supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs in depression is influenced by the proportion and dosage of EPA or DHA. Previous meta-analyses have proposed that PUFAs that are mainly EPA (EPA > 50%, 60%, and 80%of the dose) have significantly greater efficacy than those that are mainly DHA (DHA > 50%, 60%, and 80% of the dose, respectively), regardless of PUFAs monotherapy or adjuvant use. Some studies have also demonstrated that different dosages of EPA and DHA may result in different levels of efficacy. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicated that EPA, mostly at dosages of 1 or 2 g/d, was better (than placebo and DHA) as a monotherapy or adjuvant in the treatment of mild to moderate depression and that the ratio of an 'active' synergetic effect between EPA and DHA would probably be either 2:1 or 3:1 –. Regarding DHA supplementation, Mischoulon et al. also reported that compared to 4 g/d, greater efficacy was found at 1 g/d and 2 g/d in a single-arm randomized trial on depression.

Given the discrepancy in these methodological aspects, the results would be interpreted differently in each of the previously mentioned studies. However, whether and how EPA and DHA initiate their effects on depression differentially or synergistically with regard to dosage and proportion are still unclear. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to provide an update on the therapeutic effect of omega-3 PUFAs and on the associations between EPA or DHA supplementation and depression, including the effects of the dosage and proportion of EPA or DHA supplementation on depression.

Statistical analysis

We used standardized mean differences as the summary statistic for continuous data by attaining the mean (SD) and sample size (n) of the omega-3 PUFAs and placebo groups. When SDs were not available, we estimated them based on the other statistical parameters reported in the study or requested by authors. All data were analyzed at a single point at the end of the trial. We calculated the Q-statistic to estimate the heterogeneity, and P ≤ 0.01 was considered statistically significant for the Q-statistic test. The I 2 statistic was used to quantify heterogeneity, and an I 2 -value of 0% indicated no observed heterogeneity, with larger values showing increased heterogeneity. Given the expected heterogeneity, we a priori used a random-effects model. Fixed-effects models would be applied when I 2 was < 75%. A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding low-quality studies, trials recruiting participants with particular conditions, or trials with characteristics that were different from those in the other trials. Publication bias was assessed with a funnel plot and Egger's test. Egger's linear regression test was used to evaluate asymmetry, and P < 0.05 was set as the level of significance. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 (RevMan; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) and R 3.4.3 (R; GitHub, San Francisco, US).

2.2.1 Fatty acid measurements

Blood samples were collected at all four sites, stored at −80°C and shipped to Reference Laboratory in Barcelona (Spain) for analyses using gas chromatography. For each participant, in total 2 mL of blood serum was used for assessment of n‐3 PUFA, DHA, EPA, and n‐6 PUFA (in µmol/L). Compared to the other countries, a smaller number of participants from Germany provided blood samples due to logistic reasons that were not related to the randomization of the interventions. At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months follow‐up, the number of participants with available blood data was 673, 479, and 477, respectively.

2.2.2 Severity of depression

Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the 30‐item self‐report Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology questionnaire (IDS‐SR 30, range 0–84), with higher scores indicating higher severity (Rush, Gullion, Basco, Jarrett, & Trivedi, 1996). At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months of follow‐up, the number of participants with available IDS‐SR 30 data was 994, 747, and 757, respectively.

### The efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms in perinatal women: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^4c7493de]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Perinatal depression (PND) is normally defined as onset of a depression episode, ranging from mild to severe, during pregnancy or postpartum within 1 year after delivery. Depression disorder during perinatal period among childbearing-age women is increasingly common worldwide, with a prevalence of 11.9% in general and higher risk in low-income countries, as high as 25% antepartum and 20% postpartum. Different from general "maternity blues", with remission in 1 or 2 weeks; PND symptoms are more severe and persistent if they are ignored. Symptoms of PND include depressed mood, marked lack of interest or pleasure in all or most activities, significant weight loss or gain, insomnia or excessive sleep, psychomotor excitement or retardation, fatigue or poor energy, feelings of meaninglessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, and the risk of self-harm or even suicide. Moreover, babies' health can be adversely affected by PND. Depression during pregnancy without treatment can lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, such as small in size, preterm birth, and the risk for low birth weight –. In the long-term, offspring of mothers subjected to PND are prone to defects in cognitive development in childhood, have a higher risk to display depressive behavior in adolescence and be involved in criminal activities in adulthood.

The treatment of PND is a clinical dilemma. Almost all antidepressants can cross the placenta more or less. Almost all of pregnant women refuse to take medications with fear of potential side effects on offspring, for example major cardiovascular malformations and poor neonatal adaptation syndromes. Omega-3 FA, mainly comprised of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA), is a type of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). DHA constitutes an essential part of cell membranes and is found to be abundant in brains and retina. Both DHA and EPA are precursors of a group of eicosanoids, which have anti-inflammatory effects. Naturally, human is unable to synthesize omega-3 FA in vivo, hence regular dietary intake of deep-sea fish which is enriched in omega-3 is essential for health. As a kind of indispensable nutrient substance, plenty of studies have verified the moderate beneficial effects of omega-3 (monotherapy or adjuvant) on some mental diseases like major depressive disorder (MDD). The supposed mechanisms are anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant. Therefore, considering of safety in perinatal period, omega-3 FA are supposed to be a promising therapy alternative for PND.

### Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder [^e3cc1296]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations and strengths

Despite several strengths of this meta-analysis, some limitations should be noted. First, the present meta-analysis has not been performed on patient level data. It would be interesting to confirm these findings on a patient level. Moreover, this may also lead to additional predictors of supplementation outcome, giving rise to extra targets for future precision medicine studies. We hope researchers will be motivated to share and pool available data in the future. Furthermore, while the present meta-analysis had enough power to detect small-to-medium effect sizes, smaller regression effects may have been lost as a result of the smaller number of studies due to the specific in- and exclusion criteria. In addition, several concerns regarding the quality of the available evidence could be made, like in most meta-analyses. Further high-quality evidence to support a beneficial effect of EPA in (antidepressant using) MDD patients could lead to more precise estimates of overall effect size. Finally, to maintain power for the meta-regression regarding the effect of percentage antidepressant users on supplementation outcome, we pooled all concurrent antidepressant classes together, while the effects may differ per class. It would be interesting to further test this in future studies including users of different antidepressants.

Nonetheless, the present study/analyses focused on studies that specifically included patients with MDD according to diagnostic criteria as ascertained with a structured clinical interview. We thus limited clinical heterogeneity while still maintaining a substantial overall sample size. As a second strength, by performing extensive nuanced a priori planned publication bias analyses and meta-regression analyses, we revealed new evidence for (1) an effect of EPA dose as opposed to EPA to DHA ratio and (2) an interaction between omega-3 PUFAs and antidepressants, both of which may be highly relevant for clinical practice.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the present meta-analysis observed a beneficial overall effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with MDD according to diagnostic criteria, which seemed larger in studies that supplemented higher doses of EPA and included patients taking antidepressants. Future precision/personalized medicine trials should establish whether possible interactions between EPA and antidepressants could provide targets to improve antidepressant response and its prediction. Nevertheless, potential long-term biochemical side effects of high-dosed add-on EPA supplementation should be carefully monitored.

### Supplementation-induced increase in circulating omega-3 serum levels is not associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms: results from the mooDFOOD depression prevention trial [^2b0e2ae8]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, n‐3 and n‐6 PUFA serum levels are finally available for a large part of the MooDFOOD sample which provides us with the opportunity to examine whether these interventions resulted in a significant change in n‐3 and n‐6 PUFA levels and whether these changes are related to a subsequent change in depressive symptoms over time. Furthermore, it could also be that the interventions were only effective in participants with low baseline n‐3 PUFA levels and high baseline n‐6 PUFA levels, as these subjects may benefit most from the interventions, also in terms of the impact on depressive symptoms. Consequently, this study examined whether both supplementation, as well as food‐related behavioral activation, lead to an increase in serum PUFA levels and whether such change is associated with a change in depressive symptoms. We also aimed to examine whether participants with lower n‐3 PUFA levels or higher n‐6 PUFA levels at baseline were most responding to the interventions (e.g. in terms of depression symptoms over time).

4 DISCUSSION

The present study examined associations of n‐3 PUFA (including DHA and EPA) and n‐6 PUFA levels with depressive symptoms using data on 682 participants from the MooDFOOD depression prevention trial (Bot et al. 2019). We found that n‐3 PUFA and EPA levels can be effectively increased by multinutrient supplements, but these increases were not associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms over time. Also, baseline PUFA levels did not modify the effect of the multinutrient supplements or the F‐BA. Therefore, our experimental study does not support the hypothesis that n‐3 PUFA levels have a direct causal effect on depressive symptoms.

More specifically, significantly larger increases in n‐3 PUFA and EPA levels were found in the two supplement groups versus the two placebo groups, which was consistent with our expectations. This difference indicates that the n‐3 PUFA supplements were sufficiently used to give a contrast in blood n‐3 PUFA and EPA levels, as was already shown in the adherence (77%) to supplements (Bot et al. 2019). Interestingly, the effect of the supplements tended to level off at 6 months of follow‐up (see Figure 1), which could mean that adherence to supplement intake decreased at that time point, or that there is a ceiling effect, for example, after reaching a certain level of PUFA you cannot increase PUFA levels any more (Maki, Palacios, Bell, & Toth, 2017; Meyer & de Groot, 2017). However, a biological mechanism explaining the specific n‐3 PUFA level at which a ceiling effect is reached has not been proposed yet. Additionally, it should be noted that it has not yet been established what the healthy range is for PUFA levels. As EPA is the main ingredient of these fish oil supplements (ratio EPA:DHA was 3:1) and as conversion of EPA into DHA is low (Simopoulos, 1999), it was expected that DHA would not increase in a similar magnitude, which was confirmed. Perhaps a higher dosage of DHA would be needed to provide a larger change in DHA blood levels. Earlier study designs differ in terms of duration and administration of supplements and in fatty acids measurements which makes comparing effect sizes difficult. The study by Carney et al. (2009) has also found a statistical difference in postsupplementation omega‐3‐index between the supplement group and placebo group, for which we calculated a Cohen's d of 1.96. In the present study, for n‐3 PUFA levels after 12 months of supplementation Cohen's d s of 0.27 (supplements without F‐BA group) and 0.19 (supplements with F‐BA group) were found when compared to the placebo without F‐BA group.

### A double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing eicosapentaenoic acid versus docosahexaenoic acid for depression [^5a590bc2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare 2 omega-3 (n-3) preparations enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) versus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as monotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) in a 2-site, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.

Method

196 adults (53% female; mean [SD] age = 44.7 [13.4] years) with DSM-IV MDD and a baseline 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score ≥ 15 were randomized equally from May 18, 2006, to June 30, 2011, to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with oral EPA-enriched n-3 1000 mg/d, DHA-enriched n-3 1,000 mg/d, or placebo.

Results

154 subjects completed the study. Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis (n = 177 subjects with ≥ 1 postbaseline visit; 59.3% female, mean [SD] age 45.8 [12.5] years) employed mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM). All 3 groups demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the HDRS-17 (primary outcome measure), 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR-16), and Clinical Global Improvement-Severity Scale (CGI-S) (P < .05), but neither n-3 preparation separated from placebo (P > .05). Response and remission rates were in the range of 40%-50% and 30%, respectively, for all treatments, with no significant differences between groups. One subject receiving EPA-enriched n-3 discontinued due to worsening depression, and 1 subject receiving placebo discontinued due to an unspecified "negative reaction" to pills.

Conclusions

Neither EPA-enriched nor DHA-enriched n-3 was superior to placebo for the treatment of MDD.

3.3 Longitudinal associations between PUFAs and depression severity

As shown in Table 2, after adjustment for all sociodemographic, lifestyle, and somatic health covariates, the changes in n‐3 PUFA, DHA, EPA, and n‐6 PUFA levels over time were not significantly associated with changes in depressive symptoms severity (β = .002, SE = 0.003, p = .39; β = .003, SE = 0.005, p = .64; β = .005, SE = 0.005, p = .29; β = −.0002, SE = 0.0004, p = .69). These nonsignificant associations were consistent between baseline and 6 months of follow‐up and between 6 and 12 months of follow‐up for all PUFA measures (PUFA‐by‐time interaction terms: n‐3 PUFA p = .69, DHA p = .89, EPA p = .53, and n‐6 PUFA p = .81, respectively).

### Omega-3 fatty acids for major depressive disorder with… [^114d6db1]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study will evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects and antidepressant efficacy and tolerability of EPA versus placebo in the treatment of MDD. The study design is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel-group dose-finding 12 week outpatient clinical trial. The study population will consist of outpatients who are overweight and suffer from MDD, who also demonstrate systemic inflammation. One hundred adult MDD patients will be randomized to enter the 12-week double-blind treatment period. Each of the four study arms will have 25 patients, with the expectation of 20 completers per arm, based on a 20% early termination rate. The subjects will be recruited through advertisements and clinical referrals from psychiatrists and general physicians who are treating overweight outpatients with MDD. Participants must agree not to significantly modify their diet during the 12 weeks of the study.

Patients with MDD may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until MDD remission occurs. This guidance is consistent with global class labelling for antidepressants. Although there has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain subjects, a causal role for antidepressants in inducing such behaviors has not been established. Nevertheless, subjects being treated with study medication will be observed closely for clinical worsening and suicidality, especially at the beginning and end of the course of treatment, or at the time of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

Consideration will be given to possibly discontinuing the investigational product in subjects whose depression is persistently worse or whose emergent suicidality is severe or abrupt in onset or was not part of the subject's presenting symptoms. To assess suicidal ideation and behaviors, the CSSRS will be used in this trial. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania, have been reported in patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD. Consideration will be given to possibly discontinuing the study medication in subjects for whom such symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the subject's presenting symptoms.

### Anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7990b891]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Of the studies included in the meta-analysis, 11 trials with 13,198 participants compared the effects of omega-3 FA with placebo. Heterogeneity among the 11 comparisons was identified as significant (I 2 = 61%, p = 0.005). Subgroup meta-analysis for the primary outcome revealed that omega-3 FA outperformed placebo in terms of antidepressant effects (SMD = −0.14, 95% CI = −0.27 to −0.02, p = 0.03). However, sensitivity analyses showed the results could be affected by omitting one of several studies of omega-3 FA. A descriptive study was excluded in the meta-analysis. This study demonstrated that the GDS scores were significant improved after treatment with EPA (p = 0.04) and DHA (p = 0.01), suggesting the potential benefits of omega-3 FA intakes in reducing depressive symptoms.

In addition, 6 studies with 915 participants focused on the effects of botanical drugs or dietary interventions, including Xinkeshu tablets, nanocurcumin, argan oil, Soy protein, and fish dietary. Subgroup analysis of these studies yielded a moderate but significant improvement in depressive symptom scores, with a pooled SMD of −0.86 (95% CI, −1.58 to −0.13, p = 0.02). A significant heterogeneity was found among these studies (I 2 = 95%, p < 0.00001). However, sensitivity analyses performed by excluding each study seriatim in the software could change the results significantly (data not shown). The remaining study explored the potential anti-depressant effects of lovastatin. No significant effects of this drug were found in this single study (SMD = −0.08, 95% CI = −0.33 to 0.16, p = 0.51).

### Supplementation-induced increase in circulating omega-3 serum levels is not associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms: results from the mooDFOOD depression prevention trial [^b88e04a9]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, no significant associations were found between change in n‐3 PUFA, DHA, EPA, and n‐6 PUFA levels with a change in depressive symptoms. This is in line with a recent study that applied Mendelian randomization analyses — inferring a causal relationship between modifiable risk factors and disease using genetic variants as a natural experiment — on data from ~500,000 subjects (Milaneschi et al. 2019). Findings provided no evidence of a causal role of n‐3 PUFA on the risk of MDD onset. The question arises what could be the nature of the association between n‐3 PUFA levels and depressive disorders. One explanation could be that low n‐3 PUFA levels may arise when depressive symptoms arise, for example, as an epiphenomenon. Possibly, common third factors, such as dysregulations in biological stress systems (Thesing et al. 2018a) or psychological vulnerabilities (Thesing et al. 2018a), may lead to both a depressive disorder and n‐3 PUFA alterations. A second explanation could be that the direction of the association is the other way around: depressive symptoms may lead, for example, via unhealthy food intake (e.g. consuming fewer products high in n‐3 PUFAs such as fatty fish), to lower n‐3 PUFA plasma levels. A third explanation could be that alterations in PUFA levels are an adaptive process, protecting the body for future damage by oxidative stress, as some PUFAs are highly oxidizable (Assies et al. 2014) and as increased levels of oxidative stress have been found in patients with a depressive disorder (Black, Bot, Scheffer, Cuijpers, & Penninx, 2015). In all three cases, supplementing persons with n‐3 PUFAs to increase n‐3 PUFA levels would not be effective in preventing depression, and in the third case, supplementation may even be harmful (e.g. increase oxidative stress). It is important to note that in the MooDFOOD prevention trial the supplements resulted in slightly poorer depressive and anxiety symptoms scores compared with placebo (Bot et al. 2019). Harmful side effects might have been the reason for this.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on mood and emotional information processing in recovered depressed individuals [^72f6b3a7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been reported for several psychiatric disorders, particularly for depression. Association studies show a relationship between omega-3 intake and depression risk. Meta-analyses of clinical trials have shown a moderate effect of supplementation on depressive symptoms, but not on normal mood states. Few studies have investigated effects on cognition. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of omega-3 supplements on cognition and mood of recovered depressed individuals. Seventy-one participants were randomized to receive either omega-3 or placebo for four weeks in a randomized double-blind design. Results showed small effects of omega-3 supplementation on aspects of emotional decision-making and on self-reported states of depression and tension. Some of the effects were confounded by learning effects. No significant effects were observed on memory, attention, cognitive reactivity and depressive symptoms. While inconclusive, the present findings may indicate that omega-3 supplementation has selective effects on emotional cognition and mood in recovered depressed participants.

### Effects of dietary interventions on depressive symptom profiles: results from the mooDFOOD depression prevention study [^f931a565]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The dose and ratio of the multi-nutrient supplements used in MooDFOOD were based on several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational and treatment studies in clinically depressed patients available at that time (published between 2006 and 2016; for details see Roca et al.). According to the updated meta-review by Firth et al. of treatment studies and the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research Practice (ISNPR) guidelines (Guu et al.), the indicated dosage for omega-3 supplementation is higher than the amount used in the current study. Based on these findings and in the absence of results from prevention studies, perhaps in hindsight a higher dosage – particularly of EPA – could have been considered for the omega-3 supplement. However, factors that contribute to the development of a disorder in high-risk groups may differ from those that play a role in the progression of disorder in patient groups and the evidence to date for omega-3 supplementation to prevent depression in high-risk groups is limited (Thesing, Lamers, Bot, Penninx, & Milaneschi). Whether not finding a reduction in depressive symptom profiles in the multi-nutrient supplementation group can be explained by the dose of the omega-3 supplement thus remains unclear.

A central issue in the clinical relevance of our findings is that effect sizes were quite small. Compared to the effect sizes for F-BA therapy on the somatic and energy-related symptom profiles in the current study, previous studies involving non- or subclinical populations generally report larger effect sizes for psychotherapy (g = 0.35) (Cuijpers et al.), smartphone-based mental health interventions (g = 0.38) (Firth et al.), and exercise (d = 0.37–0.52) (Conn,) on combined measures of depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, learning how to effectively manage dietary intake and behaviors can lay the foundation for lifelong healthy eating. This could ultimately affect health outcomes that extend beyond the reduction of specific depressive symptoms, for instance by preventing additional weight gain and related somatic conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes). In such a way, they can have long-lasting effects.

### Supplementation-induced increase in circulating omega-3 serum levels is not associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms: results from the mooDFOOD depression prevention trial [^27da8523]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite not all studies finding a cross‐sectional association between n‐3 PUFAs and depressive disorders, systematic reviews, and meta‐analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated n‐3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of depressive disorders have concluded that overall a beneficial effect can be found (Appleton, Rogers, & Ness, 2010; Appleton, Sallis, Perry, Ness, & Churchill, 2015; Bloch & Hannestad, 2012; Grosso et al. 2014; Mocking et al. 2016). This seems especially true for EPA and in patients taking antidepressants, as shown by a recent meta‐analysis involving 13 studies and 1,233 participants (Mocking et al. 2016). However, large heterogeneity has been found in effect sizes, which could possibly be explained by methodological differences between the studies (e.g. sample backgrounds and supplement types, doses, and duration). Hence, the clinical significance of the found effect is still questionable. Some meta‐analytic evidence (Appleton et al. 2010; Bloch & Hannestad, 2012) suggests a potential role of clinical depression characteristics in the efficacy of n‐3 PUFA supplementation; studies including more‐severely depressed patients tend to show higher efficacy of n‐3 PUFA supplementation to treat depression than studies including less‐severe‐depressed patients.

It is important to make a distinction between treatment studies and prevention studies, as the factors involved in the development of a disorder in at‐risk individuals may be different than those factors involved in the course of a depressive disorder in patients. Recently, we showed in the multicountry MooDFOOD depression prevention trial among 1,025 overweight adults with subclinical depressive symptoms that multinutrient supplementation (including n‐3 PUFA fish oil supplements and a multivitamin) and a food‐related behavioral activation therapy both did not reduce the onset of episodes of major depressive disorder during 1 year (Bot et al. 2019). As the supplements contained n‐3 PUFAs and the food‐related behavioral activation therapy promoted eating fish at least three times a week, it was hypothesized that both interventions would lead to an increase in n‐3 PUFA serum levels in participants, which was hypothesized to lead to a reduction in depressive symptoms and a decreased risk for the onset of a new depressive disorder episode. However, against expectations, the supplements resulted in slightly poorer depressive and anxiety symptoms scores compared with the placebo.

### Is low dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids associated with depression? [^ef08eeb8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examined the association between the dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids and low mood, major depression, and suicide.

Method

A total of 29,133 men ages 50 to 69 years participated in a population-based trial in Finland. The intake of fatty acids and fish consumption were calculated from a diet history questionnaire. Self-reported depressed mood was recorded three times annually, data on hospital treatments due to a major depressive disorder were derived from the National Hospital Discharge Register, and suicides were identified from death certificates.

Results

There were no associations between the dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids or fish consumption and depressed mood, major depressive episodes, or suicide.

Conclusions

Dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids showed no association with low mood level.

### Vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo and incident type 2 diabetes in an ancillary study of the randomized vitamin D and omega-3 trial [^da180b0d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The strengths of this pre-specified ancillary analysis include leveraging the large VITAL trial with a diverse US population, high participant retention over long-term follow-up, and confirmed T2D outcome ascertainment. Limitations of our study include the enrollment of participants without selection for low serum 25(OH)D levels, resulting in the majority of participants with levels above 20 ng/ml at baseline, as is true for most vitamin D trials. However, subgroup analyses did not suggest effects of vitamin D vs. placebo for T2D differed among participants with < 20 ng/ml at baseline. The incidence of T2D was lower than predicted for the ages enrolle, d modestly impacting statistical power. It is also unknown whether our findings are generalizable to other age and demographic subgroups. Longer follow-up may be informative, especially given the latency of clinical T2D onset, and observational follow-up of VITAL participants is ongoing in an open-label extension study.

In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation at 2000 IU/d over 5.3 years did not reduce T2D compared with placebo in a general population of older US adults not preselected for prediabetes or vitamin D deficiency. In an updated meta-analysis including 4 RCTs (2 conducted in patients with prediabetes), there was an overall combined 11% reduction in T2D with vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo; however, there was no effect of vitamin D vs. placebo in VITAL on intermediate glycemic traits after 2 years. Our findings do not support routine vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of T2D among older adults in the general population.

### Exploration of the optimized portrait of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in treating depression: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^69a021cb]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

According to previous studies, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are controversial for the efficacy of treating depression.

Aims

This meta-analysis aims to investigate whether omega-3 PUFAs are able to treat depression, and find out the most beneficial clinical portrait.

Methods

More than two reviewers searched six registries, and 36 studies were eventually considered eligible. The PRISMA guidelines were used for data extraction, Cochrane Handbook for quality assessment, and random effects model for data pooling.

Outcomes

Significant heterogeneity and publication bias were observed. According to the results, significant efficacy was detected in the overall analysis [SMD = -0.26, 95% CI = (-0.41, -0.11)] and several subgroups, while total daily dosage might be a potential heterogeneity source (P < 0.05). No between-group difference was observed in the rate of response [RR = 0.99, 95% CI = (0.82, 1.20)], remission [RR = 1.17, 95% CI = (0.92, 1.48)], and adverse events [RR = 1.07, 95% CI = (0.90, 1.29)]. Total daily intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and remission rate conformed to linear correlation (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

1) Omega-3 PUFAs might be effective in treating depression; 2) For Asian patients with mild to moderate depression and no other baseline medication, over 8 weeks of omega-3 PUFAs 1000–1500 mg/day with ratio of EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) between 1:1 and 2:1 might benefit the most; 3) Omega-3 PUFAs are no superior than placebo in rates of response, remission, and adverse events. Although several limitations exist, the evidence-based information provides guidance for clinical practice and directions for further research.

### Omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio and subsequent mood disorders in young people with at-risk mental states: a 7-year longitudinal study [^69767d05]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

An important mechanistic question is whether individuals with low levels of n -3 PUFAs or an increased n -6/3 PUFA ratio are at elevated risk of developing mental disorders. We have recently demonstrated that higher levels of α-linolenic acid, the 'parent' essential fatty acid of the n -3 family, predicted short-term functional improvement among individuals at ultrahigh risk (UHR) of developing psychosis who receive n -3 PUFAs supplementation, while decreased levels of nervonic acid, a monounsaturated very long-chain fatty acid involved in myelin synthesis, predicted transition to first-episode psychosis in the same study. In contrast, longitudinal studies investigating associations of n -3 PUFAs and depressive symptoms in general adult population samples have not reported significant associations.

To address the hypothesis that low levels of n -3 PUFAs or an increased n -6/3 PUFA ratio precedes the onset of mood disorders in at-risk groups, we conducted a secondary analysis of the Vienna n -3 study, a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of n -3 PUFAs or placebo in UHR patients, to test whether erythrocyte membrane levels of PUFAs predict mood disorders during a (median) 7-year follow-up in young individuals with UHR for psychosis.

Although the F‐BA promoted an n‐3 PUFA rich diet (e.g. three times of fish per week), F‐BA did not lead to changes in PUFA serum levels, as the groups with F‐BA did not have significantly higher n‐3 PUFA, DHA, or EPA levels or lower n‐6 PUFA levels at 6‐ or 12‐month follow‐up when compared to the groups without F‐BA, except for higher DHA levels at 6 months of follow‐up in the group with placebo and F‐BA. The fact that we did not find a consistent increase in all n‐3 PUFA measures and at all time points was unexpected, because a self‐reported increased intake of food products high in n‐3 PUFAs (e.g. fatty fish, nuts, and seeds) in the F‐BA groups was found previously in the same MooDFOOD study sample (Grasso et al. 2019). It seems like the increase of intake of products high in n‐3 PUFAs was only moderate and therefore may not have led to substantial increases in all n‐3 PUFAs.

Abstract

Background

There is ambiguity on how omega‐3 (n‐3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with depression, and what the temporality of the association might be. The present study aimed to examine whether (intervention‐induced changes in) n‐3 PUFA levels were associated with (changes in) depressive symptoms.

Methods

Baseline, 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up data on 682 overweight and subclinically depressed persons from four European countries that participated in the MooDFOOD depression prevention randomized controlled trial were used. Participants were allocated to four intervention groups: (a) placebos, (b) placebos and food‐related behavioral activation therapy (F‐BA), (c) multinutrient supplements (fish oil and multivitamin), and (d) multinutrient supplements and F‐BA. Depressive symptoms were measured using the inventory of depressive symptomatology. PUFA levels (µmol/L) were measured using gas chromatography. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographics, lifestyle, and somatic health.

Results

Increases in n‐3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid levels over time were significantly larger in the supplement groups than in placebo groups. Change in PUFA levels was not significantly associated with the change in depressive symptoms (β = .002, SE = 0.003, p = .39; β = .003, SE = 0.005, p = .64; β = .005, SE = 0.005, p = .29; β = −.0002, SE = 0.0004, p = .69). Baseline PUFA levels did not modify the intervention effects on depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

In overweight and subclinical depressed persons, multinutrient supplements led to significant increases in n‐3 PUFA levels over time, which were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Multinutrient supplements do not seem to be an effective preventive strategy in lowering depressive symptoms over time in these at‐risk groups.

As stated earlier, it is important to make a distinction between treatment studies and prevention studies. The three explanations given above for the possible nature of the association between n‐3 PUFA levels and depressive disorder, are not in line with some meta‐analyses of RCTs that do find a beneficial treatment effect of n‐3 PUFA supplementation in depressed patients, although with small effect sizes and, therefore, questionable clinical significance (Appleton et al. 2010, 2015; Grosso et al. 2014; Mocking et al. 2016). This suggests that n‐3 PUFA supplements may be less effective in individuals at risk for depression than in currently depressed patients. Recently, the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research Practice has formulated guidelines for the use of n‐3 PUFA supplementation in the treatment and prevention of MDD (Guu et al. 2019). In response, we argued that there is indeed some evidence from RCTs for the usefulness of n‐3 PUFA supplementation in the treatment of clinically depressed cases, but there is not enough evidence from RCTs on the usefulness of n‐3 PUFA supplementation in the prevention of depression in at‐risk individuals (Thesing, Lamers, Bot, Penninx, & Milaneschi, 2019). The question arises how it can be that n‐3 PUFA supplementation could be effective in the treatment of clinically depressed patients, but not in the prevention of depression in subclinically depressed patients, and maybe even lead to slightly poorer depressive and anxiety symptoms scores compared with placebo (Bot et al. 2019). One explanation could be that the biological mechanisms and related markers (including a chemical imbalance in the brain, e.g. n‐3 PUFA alterations next to neurotransmitter imbalances) of onset are different from those of disease progression. Additionally, other markers (such as nonbiological markers, i.e. life events or personality) may be more involved in the onset of a depressive disorder, whereas n‐3 PUFAs might be involved more in the progression of a depressive disorder. If this is the case, n‐3 PUFA supplements would be inefficient in preventing the onset of depression, but might be effective in the treatment of a current depression.

### Baseline blood levels of omega-3 and depression remission: a secondary analysis of data from a placebo-controlled trial of omega-3 supplements [^feb919e6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Depression is associated with low red blood cell (RBC) levels of 2 omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), suggesting that omega-3 supplements might improve depression. However, clinical trials have produced mixed results. The purpose of this secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial was to determine whether baseline blood levels of omega-3, which are known to vary widely among individuals, predict depression outcomes.

Method

The percentages of EPA, DHA, and the omega-6 arachidonic acid (AA) were measured in RBCs at baseline and posttreatment in 122 participants with DSM-IV major depression who were randomly assigned between May 2005 and December 2008 to receive either 50 mg/d of sertraline and a daily dosage of 930 mg EPA/750 mg DHA or sertraline plus placebo. Associations between baseline omega-3 RBC levels and remission of depression (17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ≤ 7) were analyzed by treatment arm.

Results

Among participants in the omega-3 arm, baseline RBC levels of EPA + DHA (P = 0.002) and the EPA + DHA:AA ratio (P = 0.003) were significantly higher among those whose depression subsequently remitted compared with those whose depression did not remit. No associations were detected in the sertraline plus placebo arm. Baseline levels of EPA (P = 0.03) and the EPA + DHA:AA ratio (P = 0.04) moderated the relationship between treatment arm and depression outcomes.

Conclusions

High baseline RBC levels of EPA and DHA and a high EPA + DHA:AA ratio predict favorable depression outcomes in patients receiving omega-3 supplements. Omega-3 supplementation may be an effective treatment for depression, but the requisite dosage and duration of treatment may depend on the patient's baseline level of omega-3 fatty acids.

### Dietary intake of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids and the risk of clinical depression in women: a 10-y prospective follow-up study [^2baffc6d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The associations between different sources of dietary n-3 (omega-3) and n-6 (omega-6) fatty acids and the risk of depression have not been prospectively studied.

Objective

The objective was to examine the relation between different n-3 and n-6 types with clinical depression incidence.

Design

We prospectively studied 54,632 US women from the Nurses' Health Study who were 50–77 y of age and free from depressive symptoms at baseline. Information on diet was obtained from validated food-frequency questionnaires. Clinical depression was defined as reporting both physician-diagnosed depression and regular antidepressant medication use.

Results

During 10 y of follow-up (1996–2006), 2823 incident cases of depression were documented. Intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids from fish was not associated with depression risk [relative risk (RR) for 0.3-g/d increment: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.10], whereas α-linolenic acid (ALA) intake was inversely associated with depression risk (multivariate RR for 0.5-g/d increment: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.94). The inverse association between ALA and depression was stronger in women with low linoleic acid (LA) intake (P for interaction = 0.02): a 0.5-g/d increment in ALA was inversely associated with depression in the first, second, and third LA quintiles [RR (95% CI): 0.57 (0.37, 0.87), 0.62 (0.41, 0.93), and 0.68 (0.47, 0.96), respectively] but not in the fourth and fifth quintiles.

Conclusions

The results of this large longitudinal study do not support a protective effect of long-chain n-3 from fish on depression risk. Although these data support the hypothesis that higher ALA and lower LA intakes reduce depression risk, this relation warrants further investigation.

### Anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2873a3a7]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The preventative effects of anti-inflammatory management for depression have seldom been investigated in previous meta-analyses. Our findings showed that older participants who administered anti-inflammatory interventions might be less likely to suffer from depression than those in the placebo condition. However, the marginal p-value and the upper limit of the credible interval close to the line of no difference suggest concern about whether this estimate is robust enough to guide clinical practice.

Subgroup analyses indicated that omega-3 FA and botanical drug or dietary intervention significantly improved depressive symptoms in older adults, whereas NSAIDs and statins did not. However, the beneficial magnitude of omega-3 FA and botanical drug or dietary intervention is small. Sensitivity analyses also indicate that the anti-depressant effects could be affected by omitting some included studies. Future high-quality RCTs with large sample size are needed to further verify the efficacy of these anti-inflammatory interventions. The current findings suggest that omega-3 FA and botanical drug or dietary intervention may be a superior option than other anti-inflammatory interventions for older adults, even though the benefits of some types, such as statins, have been confirmed among adults. Two meta-analyses of studies reported similar effects of omega-3 FA on reducing depressive symptoms in the elderly population (Hedges' g = −0.94, 95% CI = −1.37 to 0.50; d = −0.428, 95% CI = −0.822 to −0.035). However, these previous meta-analyses focused on older adults and only investigated the anti-depressant efficacy of omega-3 FA, without evaluating other types of anti-inflammatory regimens or their preventative effects. Besides, omega-3 FA has been recommended for MDD treatment for the elderly, children, and pregnant women, and prevention in high-risk populations. It should be noted that the negative results of statin and NSAIDs are estimated based on very limited data from studies with significant heterogeneity among them. Surprisingly, several main types of anti-inflammatory agents, such as cytokine inhibitors and corticosteroids for adults with depression were not retrieved in the meta-analysis. One possible interpretation for the lack of these studies is the concern about the safety of these drugs for frail seniors. Moreover, we did not conduct subgroup analyses regarding medical comorbidity condition or the treatment duration due to the insufficient data from included original studies. But certain medical comorbidities may moderate anti-inflammatory treatment impact. For instance, some comorbid conditions of depression, including rheumatoid arthritis and vascular disease, are characterized by chronic inflammation. The effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment for depression might be partially reduced by overwhelming the comorbidity-evoked inflammation. Besides, comorbidities such as gastrointestinal disorders can affect the drug absorption, and kidney diseases can affect the drug metabolism. These pharmacological alterations may attenuate the benefits of anti-inflammatory treatment for late-life depression. Thus, future studies are need to determine whether increasing the dosage and/or prolonging the treatment duration may enhance the anti-depressant effects of anti-inflammatory interventions in such populations.

### Anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^19d6b9cc]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis represents the most comprehensive summary of currently available data for the treatment and prevention of anti-inflammatory interventions for depression among older adults. Our review of 31 RCTs demonstrated that anti-inflammatory interventions could be more beneficial than placebo control conditions for older adults with or without depressive disorders, and the corresponding SMDs of −0.57 and −0.07 were medium and trivial effect sizes. Compared with active control regimens (sertraline, tocopherol and tramadol), anti-inflammatory treatments were not significantly more effective in reducing depression symptoms for depressed patients, although the limited number of studies available suggests the need for further research. It should be noted that, the evidence of quality in the above outcome of antidepressant effect were low or very low, which may limit the application of this evidence in clinical practice and guideline development. Overall, our results among older adults are consistent with those of previous meta-analyses, which also report small to medium effects of anti-inflammatory treatments for patients with depressive symptoms. Intriguingly, we find beneficial effects of omega-3 FA and botanical drug or dietary intervention, but not NSAIDs and statins, among old population. However, young adult MDD patients may benefit from a broader spectrum of anti-inflammatory agents, including NSAIDs, statins, cytokine inhibitors, etc. This distinction might be partially attributed to the severity of depression. The inflammatory activity may be particularly elevated in these severe MDD patients, making them benefits more from the classic anti-inflammatory agents.

### N-3 PUFAs for depression: treatment effect or absence-of-placebo effect? [^c056f223]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

In a meta-analysis, Liao et al. conclude that n-3 PUFAs have a therapeutic effect on depression. Here we argue that this conclusion is premature.

Firstly, in contrast with their stated inclusion criteria, the data from 2 trials did not include an inert placebo arm. Also in contrast with an inclusion criterion, another trial was carried out in a non-(clinically) depressed sample. Furthermore, data from a single trial were included twice and placebo conditions of this trial, and that of one other trial, were double-counted in analyses. The use of dependent data in meta-analyses gives a false impression of precision.

We carried out a random-effect meta-analysis on the corrected dataset, which yielded a Standardized Mean Difference (SMD; Cohen's d) of −0.31 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = −0.57 to −0.05) favoring n-3 PUFAs over placebo in the treatment of depression. Liao et al. report an SMD of −0.26 (95% CI = −0.47 to −0.09). Consequently, the errors do not invalidate the study conclusion, but note that the CI has widened.

Liao et al. included a trial performed by Marangell et al. who in their report had presented a null-finding on the differences in the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs versus placebo in the treatment of depression (P = 0.43, page 996). In the meta-analysis, the same RCT is presented as having a large and statistically significant effect (SMD = −0.82). This mismatch is due to the parameter for efficacy that Liao et al. used: data at a single point at the end of the trial. This parameter is inferior to the crucial time x treatment interaction. Marangell et al. indeed report a large difference between the treatment and placebo group post-treatment; however, this is due to the fact that randomization failed. The control group scored significantly higher on the primary outcome measure at baseline, and this difference was not affected by treatment. To present this particular RCT as a positive trial is contrary to the findings reported in the original paper.
