## Question

A 23-year-old female college basketball player presents in Sports Clinic after she felt a 'pop' in her knee after coming down with a rebound. To examine the patient, you have her lie down on the table with her knees flexed 90 degrees. With your hand around her knee you are able to draw the tibia toward you from underneath the femur. The torn structure implicated by this physical exam maneuver has which of the following attachments?
A. The posterior intercondylar area of tibia and the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femur
B. The anterior intercondylar area of tibia and the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femur
C. The lateral epicondyle of the femur and the head of fibula
D. The medial condyle of the femur and the medial condyle of the tibia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ligament is being tested by drawing the tibia anteriorly at 90 degrees of knee flexion and what its correct femoral and tibial attachment sites are among the given options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about identifying the physical examination maneuver and confirming which ligament it assesses. Then, I should verify the classic injury mechanism and how that aligns with the vignette. Next, I will review the precise femoral and tibial attachment anatomy of the implicated ligament. Finally, I will compare each option against the anatomic landmarks and select the best match, making sure I don't conflate ACL with PCL or collateral structures.

> Let me first confirm the test being described. Drawing the tibia anteriorly with the knee flexed to 90 degrees is the anterior drawer test, which evaluates the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament. A soft or excessive anterior translation indicates ACL insufficiency, which fits the "pop" during a noncontact landing in a basketball player, a classic ACL scenario [^1177mTKk] [^115xM2jT] [^112ZEHxu].

> Wait, let me verify the injury mechanism before I anchor on the diagnosis. Noncontact ACL injuries commonly occur with landing or cutting, often with valgus and internal rotation, and patients frequently report a "pop" with rapid hemarthrosis. This 23-year-old female athlete's rebound landing and pop are highly consistent with ACL rupture, reinforcing that the anterior drawer finding implicates the ACL rather than the PCL or collateral ligaments [^115xM2jT] [^112EwKy8] [^111svJuU].

> I need to check the femoral attachment next. The ACL originates on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle within the intercondylar notch; specifically, the direct femoral insertion lies on the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle, posterior to the lateral intercondylar ridge, which corresponds to the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle in standard descriptions [^1124Awyk] [^114Bp8is].

> Hold on, I should verify the tibial attachment to avoid confusion with the PCL. The ACL inserts on the anterior intercondylar area of the tibial plateau, anterior to the intercondylar eminence, which is distinct from the PCL's posterior intercondylar tibial footprint. This anterior tibial location is the key differentiator when matching options [^1169zfsM].

> Let me now examine the options against this anatomy. Option A places the tibial attachment posteriorly, which would describe the PCL, not the ACL; Option C describes the lateral collateral ligament's femoral origin at the lateral epicondyle and fibular head insertion; Option D describes medial compartment structures, not ACL; only Option B correctly pairs the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia with the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle, matching ACL anatomy [^1169zfsM] [^117GWkqd] [^1124Awyk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "posterior drawer" because of the 90-degree flexion cue, but that would be testing posterior translation for the PCL. Here the examiner is drawing the tibia anteriorly, so it is the anterior drawer and ACL, not posterior drawer and PCL, which would show posterior sag and increased posterior translation instead of anterior laxity [^1177mTKk] [^112C1ayM].

> Final answer: The torn structure is the anterior cruciate ligament, and its attachments are the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle, which corresponds to Option B [^1124Awyk].

---

The described maneuver is the **anterior drawer test** [^1177mTKk], which detects anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury [^112ZEHxu]. The ACL originates from the **anterior intercondylar area of the tibia** and inserts on the **posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle** [^1124Awyk]. Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

## Clinical scenario and mechanism of injury

The patient is a 23-year-old female basketball player who felt a "pop" in her knee after landing from a rebound — a classic non-contact mechanism for ACL injury [^117GWkqd]. Non-contact ACL injuries typically occur during **landing, cutting, or pivoting maneuvers**, often associated with valgus collapse and internal rotation of the tibia [^117GWkqd].

---

## Physical examination maneuver: anterior drawer test

The described maneuver, performed with the knee flexed to 90 degrees and the examiner grasping the proximal tibia to apply an anterior force, is the **anterior drawer test** [^1177mTKk]. A positive test, indicated by excessive anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur, suggests ACL insufficiency [^1177mTKk].

---

## Anatomical attachments of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)

The ACL is an intra-articular ligament that **originates from the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia** and inserts on the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle [^notfound]. These attachments provide the ACL with its primary function of resisting anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur [^114Bp8is].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Description** | **Correctness** |
|-|-|-|
| A | Posterior intercondylar area of tibia and posteromedial aspect of lateral femur | Incorrect (describes PCL attachments) |
| B | Anterior intercondylar area of tibia and posteromedial aspect of lateral femur | Correct (ACL attachments) |
| C | Lateral epicondyle of femur and head of fibula | Incorrect (describes LCL attachments) |
| D | Medial condyle of femur and medial condyle of tibia | Incorrect (describes MCL attachments) |

---

Option A describes the **posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)**, which originates from the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia and inserts on the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle [^notfound]. Option C describes the **lateral collateral ligament (LCL)**, which originates from the lateral epicondyle of the femur and inserts on the head of the fibula [^117GWkqd]. Option D describes the **medial collateral ligament (MCL)**, which originates from the medial epicondyle of the femur and inserts on the medial condyle of the tibia [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B**, as the ACL originates from the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and inserts on the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle [^notfound]. This anatomical configuration aligns with the clinical presentation and the positive anterior drawer test, confirming ACL injury in this patient [^112ZEHxu].

Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the United States and throughout the world, and therefore represents one of the most common sources of sports-related injuries. Basketball injuries should be managed by the same general rehabilitation principles as other sports injuries. Additionally, the clinician should be aware not only of general sports injuries but of those injuries most commonly seen in basketball players. By maintaining knowledge of the most common basketball injuries as well as their diagnosis and treatment, the clinician can help to optimize the athlete's return to play and enjoyment of the sport.

### Variation in the medial patellofemoral ligament origin in the skeletally immature knee: an anatomic study [^115Vy1ch]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is frequently reconstructed to treat recurrent patellar instability. The femoral origin of the MPFL is well described in adults but not in the skeletally immature knee.

Purpose

To identify a radiographic landmark for the femoral MPFL attachment in the skeletally immature knee and study its relationship to the distal femoral physis.

Study Design

Descriptive laboratory study.

Methods

Thirty-six cadaveric specimens between 2 and 11 years old were dissected and examined (29 male and 7 female). Metallic markers were placed at the proximal and distal borders of the MPFL femoral origin footprint. Computed tomography scans with 0.625-mm slices in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes were used to measure the maximum ossified height and ossified depth. The measurements were used to describe the position of the midpoint MPFL attachment with respect to the posterior-anterior and distal-proximal dimensions of the femoral condyle on the sagittal view and to describe the distance from the physis to the femoral origin of the MPFL.

Results

In 23 of 36 specimens, the femoral origin of the MPFL was distal to the physis. Thirteen of the 36 specimens had an MPFL origin at or proximal to the physis, with a more proximal MPFL origin consistently seen in older specimens. The distance of the MPFL origin to the physis ranged from 15.1 mm distal to the physis to 8.3 mm proximal to the physis. The mean midpoint of the MPFL femoral origin was located 3.0 ± 5.5 mm distal to the physis for all specimens. For specimens aged < 7 years, the mean MPFL origin was 4.7 mm distal to the physis, and for specimens aged ≥ 7 years, the mean MPFL origin was 0.8 mm proximal to the femoral physis. The MPFL origin was more proximal and anterior for those aged ≥ 7 years and more distal and posterior for those aged < 7 years.

Conclusion

Surgical reconstruction of the MPFL is a common treatment to restore patellar stability. There appears to be significant variability in the origin of the MPFL in skeletally immature specimens. This study demonstrated that the MPFL origin was more proximal and anterior with respect to the physis in the older age group. The MPFL origin footprint may be customized for different age groups.

Clinical Relevance

This information shows anatomic variation of the MPFL origin with age, with older specimens having a footprint that was more proximal and anterior than younger specimens. Customization of the surgical technique might be considered based on patient age.

### Effects of sports injury prevention training on the biomechanical risk factors of anterior cruciate ligament injury in high school female basketball players [^1131Gop4]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Female athletes have a higher risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury than their male counterparts who play at similar levels in sports involving pivoting and landing.

Hypothesis

The competitive female basketball players who participated in a sports injury prevention training program would show better muscle strength and flexibility and improved biomechanical properties associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury than during the pretraining period and than posttraining parameters in a control group.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

A total of 22 high school female basketball players were recruited and randomly divided into 2 groups (the experimental group and the control group, 11 participants each). The experimental group was instructed in the 6 parts of the sports injury prevention training program and performed it during the first 20 minutes of team practice for the next 8 weeks, while the control group performed their regular training program. Both groups were tested with a rebound-jump task before and after the 8-week period. A total of 21 reflective markers were placed in preassigned positions. In this controlled laboratory study, a 2-way analysis of variance (2 × 2) experimental design was used for the statistical analysis (P < .05) using the experimental group and a testing session as within and between factors, respectively. Post hoc tests with Sidak correction were used when significant factor effects and/or interactions were observed.

Results

A comparison of the experimental group's pretraining and posttraining results identified training effects on all strength parameters (P = 0.004 to .043) and on knee flexion, which reflects increased flexibility (P = 0.022). The experimental group showed higher knee flexion angles (P = 0.024), greater interknee distances (P = 0.004), lower hamstring-quadriceps ratios (P = 0.023), and lower maximum knee extension torques (P = 0.043) after training. In the control group, no statistical differences were observed between pretraining and posttraining findings (P = 0.084 to .873). At pretraining, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups for any parameter (P = 0.067 to .784). However, a comparison of the 2 groups after training revealed that the experimental group had significantly higher knee flexion angles (P = 0.023), greater knee distances (P = 0.005), lower hamstring-quadriceps ratios (P = 0.021), lower maximum knee extension torques (P = 0.124), and higher maximum knee abduction torques P (= .043) than the control group.

Conclusion

The sports injury prevention training program improved the strength and flexibility of the competitive female basketball players tested and biomechanical properties associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury as compared with pretraining parameters and with posttraining parameters in the control group.

Clinical Relevance

This injury prevention program could potentially modify the flexibility, strength, and biomechanical properties associated with ACL injury and lower the athlete's risk for injury.

Fig. 2
Arthroscopic images of the operation. Only PCL was found ruptured proximally without bone avulsion after general inspection (a-b). Absorbable sutures were placed in the PCL stumps by suture passer (c-d). STA tibial tunnel was drilled using a 2 mm K-wire (e–f). The PRP was injected into the PCL femoral footprint (g), and a reduction of the PCL could be seen when the sutures were tensioned in 90° of flexion and anterior drawer (h). ACL (asterisk); PCL (arrow); Medial condyle (arrowhead)

Immediately post operation, the posterior drawer test was negative (Supplement Video 1). The ruptured PCL was repaired with an all-epiphyseal STA without evidence of growth plate violation (Figs. 6 and 7). The child was allowed to walk in an adjustable splint with the help of crutch and was sent to rehabilitation for quadriceps strengthening among the first 4 weeks after the operation. The splint could allow the knee with full range of motion. After 4 weeks post-operation, the crutch and the splint were not applied. At 12 weeks post-operative, she was able ambulate without pain and could take part in all pre-injury activities. (Supplement Video 1) The suture tape was removed under arthroscopy and revealed the PCL was re-attached (Fig. 8) at 12 months after the first surgery. And at the time of this report, 24 months after surgery, she was doing well without any problems and with negative posterior drawer test. Meanwhile, based on the physical examination, no varus or valgus deformity was noticed; and the length of the lower limbs were equal. However, the longer follow up result about the limbs related to growth plate is still unknown, which would be evaluated by annual clinical assessment.

### Posterior cruciate ligament rupture and all-epiphyseal repair with suture tape augmentation in a 5-year-old girl: a case report and review of the literature [^113Hzcbt]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Only a few case reports regarding pediatric posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) ruptures without bone avulsion exist in the literature. The present study aims to share our experience in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of a child with a proximal PCL tear.

Materials and methods

This article reports a 5-year-old female diagnosed with a proximal PCL tear. The ruptured PCL was repaired with an all-epiphyseal suture tape augmentation (STA) without evidence of growth plate violation.

Results

The suture tape was removed under arthroscopy and revealed the PCL was re-attached at 12 months after the first surgery. And at the time of this report, 36 months after surgery, she was doing well without any problems and with negative posterior drawer test.

Conclusions

Pediatric PCL tear without bone avulsion is rare. However, the torn PCL was noticed healed based on an arthroscopic second-look.

### Fixation of femoral attachment: anterior cruciate ligament avulsion fracture with arthroscopy suture loop technique [^113D97Hb]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) avulsion fracture is rare and mostly occur in tibial attachment. Avulsion fracture of femoral attachment of ACL was uncommon and mostly reported in skeletally immature patient. This article aims to report an interesting case of femoral attachment-ACL avulsion fracture in skeletally mature patient with arthroscopic suture loop fixation. A 32-year-old man, with no significant medical-surgical history, sustained a right non-contact pivoting knee injury during soccer competition. Plain radiographs of knee joint demonstrated intra-articular bone fragment in the intercondylar notch space. The MRI confirmed femoral attachment-ACL avulsion fracture. Then, we planned to perform fixation of femoral attachment-ACL avulsion fracture with arthroscopy suture loop technique. At 5 months after surgery, patient had no pain and swelling knee. The physical examination demonstrated negative Lachman test, anterior drawer test, pivot shift test and patient can return to preinjury daily activity and sport activities.

### Biomechanical assessment of the anterolateral ligament of the knee: a secondary restraint in simulated tests of the pivot shift and of anterior stability [^1147zmUr]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Injury to the lateral capsular tissues of the knee may accompany rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). A distinct lateral structure, the anterolateral ligament, has been identified, and reconstruction strategies for this tissue in combination with ACL reconstruction have been proposed. However, the biomechanical function of the anterolateral ligament is not well understood. Thus, this study had two research questions: (1) What is the contribution of the anterolateral ligament to knee stability in the ACL-sectioned knee? (2) Does the anterolateral ligament bear increased load in the absence of the ACL?

Methods

Twelve cadaveric knees from donors who were a mean (and standard deviation) of 43 ± 15 years old at the time of death were loaded using a robotic manipulator to simulate clinical tests of the pivot shift and anterior stability. Motions were recorded with the ACL intact, with the ACL sectioned, and with both the ACL and anterolateral ligament sectioned. In situ loads borne by the ACL and anterolateral ligament in the ACL-intact knee and borne by the anterolateral ligament in the ACL-sectioned knee were determined.

Results

Sectioning the anterolateral ligament in the ACL-sectioned knee led to mean increases of 2 to 3 mm in anterior tibial translation in both anterior stability and simulated pivot-shift tests. In the ACL-intact knee, the load borne by the anterolateral ligament was a mean of ≤ 10.2 N in response to anterior loads and < 17 N in response to the simulated pivot shift. In the ACL-sectioned knee, the load borne by the anterolateral ligament increased on average to < 55% of the load normally borne by the ACL in the intact knee. However, in the ACL-sectioned knee, the anterolateral ligament engaged only after the tibia translated beyond the physiologic limits of motion of the ACL-intact knee.

Conclusions

The anterolateral ligament is a secondary stabilizer compared with the ACL for the simulated Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot shift examinations.

Clinical Relevance

Since the anterolateral ligament engages only during pathologic ranges of tibial translation, there is a limited need for anatomical reconstruction of the anterolateral ligament in a well-functioning ACL-reconstructed knee.

### Current concepts review: comprehensive physical examination for instability of the knee [^111SApYb]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A careful history and physical examination are the cornerstones of orthopaedic sports medicine. When evaluating a patient for ligamentous instability of the knee joint, an understanding of the contribution of anatomic structures to stability enhances a practitioner's ability to achieve an accurate clinical diagnosis. This article reviews the various types of knee instability and the associated anatomic structures. Ultimately, information must be obtained from multiple tests to reach the final diagnosis. We describe in detail the pathologic and biomechanical basis of the tests for both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral instability of the knee joint and provide recommendations for performance and interpretation of these physical examinations.

### Assessment of the "functional length" of the three bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament [^114uj9zd]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

The objectives of the present study are to compare "functional length" between the three bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) from extension to deep flexion and to perform a sensitivity study on the patterns of "functional length" change due to deviations in insertion site selection. Nine knees of healthy volunteers were examined using a horizontal open magnetic resonance apparatus with the knee at 0 degrees -150 degrees of flexion and created three-dimensional (3D) virtual models of the knee. The femoral and tibial attachment sites of the three ACL bundles were determined, and the distance between the attachment sites was automatically calculated as the "functional length" of each bundle in each position. After changing the attachment sites, computer simulation was performed to investigate in vivo "functional length" changes for the three bundles of the ACL in normal knee kinematics from extension to deep flexion. Three bundles statistically significantly changed in "functional length" during flexion/extension, while they were longest at full extension, and decreased with increasing knee flexion to 100 degrees. They were smallest at flexion of 100 degrees, with increase lengths with flexion deeper than 100 degrees. Deviation of 6 mm of insertion site beyond attachment area caused significant alteration in the pattern of "functional length" change of each bundle, while deviation of 3 mm within attachment area caused no significant difference. The "functional length" of the three ACL bundles was not isometric, not even the antero-medial bundle. The "functional length" might be of major importance in terms of the site of the ACL insertion. The "functional length" of multiple bundles of the ACL and the pattern of their changes are useful for not only graft choice and preparation but also knee angle and initial tension at graft fixation during multiple-bundle ACL reconstruction surgery.

### Structural properties of the primary medial knee ligaments [^116pRUqB]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The structural properties of the individual components of the superficial medial collateral ligament (MCL), deep MCL, and posterior oblique ligament (POL) have not been studied in isolation. To define the necessary strength requirements for an anatomical medial knee reconstruction, knowledge of these structural properties is necessary.

Hypothesis

The components of the superficial MCL, POL, and deep MCL have significantly different structural properties.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

This study used 20 fresh-frozen nonpaired cadaveric knee specimens with a mean age of 54 years (range, 27 to 68 years). These knees provided 8 samples for each tested medial knee structure, which was individually isolated and loaded to failure at 20 mm per minute. Specifically tested were the superficial MCL with intact femoral and detached proximal tibial attachments, the superficial MCL with intact femoral and detached distal tibial attachments, the central arm of the POL, and the isolated deep MCL. Load was recorded as a function of displacement. Stiffness of the ligament at failure was calculated from these measurements.

Results

The mean load at failure for the superficial MCL with the intact femoral and distal tibial attachments was 557 N. Mean load at failure was 88 N for the intact femoral and proximal tibial divisions of the superficial MCL, 256 N for the POL, and 101 N for the deep MCL. Stiffness of the ligaments just before failure was 63, 17, 38, and 27 N/mm, in the same order as above.

Conclusion

The proximal and distal tibial divisions of the superficial MCL, POL, and deep MCL produced loads of clinical importance.

Clinical Relevance

Knowledge of the structural properties of these attachment sites will assist in reconstruction graft choices, fixation method choices, and overall operative treatment of medial knee injury.

### Surgical repair of stener-like injuries of the medial collateral ligament of the knee in professional athletes [^116VpZhe]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A "Stener-like" lesion of the knee is defined as a distal avulsion of the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) with interposition of the pes anserinus between the ligament and its tibial insertion-a displacement impeding anatomic healing. Because of the scarcity of these injuries, the literature is limited to case reports and small case series.

Purpose

To assess the effect of surgical repair of acute Stener-like lesions of the sMCL on the following outcomes: return to preinjury level of sporting function; time to return to preinjury level of sporting function; functional performance; injury recurrence; and any other complications.

Study Design

Case series: Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

This prospective single-surgeon study included 23 elite athletes with a mean age of 27.2 years (range, 19–37 years). Of the participants, 20 were men (87%) and 3 were women (13%). The mean body mass index was 23.1 ± 2.3. A total of 16 athletes were soccer players (70%) and 7 were rugby players (30%), with isolated acute, traumatic Stener-like lesions of the sMCL of the knee confirmed on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical repair was undertaken with primary suture anchor repair with ligament repair or reconstruction system (LARS) augmentation. Predefined outcomes were recorded at regular intervals after surgery. The minimum follow-up time was 24 months (range, 24–108 months) from the date of surgery.

Results

The mean time from injury to surgical intervention was 9 days (range, 3–28 days). Overall, 15 (65%) athletes had isolated distal sMCL injuries requiring anatomic suture anchor repair at the distal tibial insertion site only, and 8 (35%) athletes had concomitant injuries of the proximal and distal sMCL and required anatomic suture anchor repair at the proximal and distal attachment sites. Ten athletes required LARS augmentation at the time of the index operation. All study patients returned to their preinjury level of sporting activity in professional soccer or rugby. The mean time from surgical intervention to return to full sporting activity was 16.8 ± 2.7 weeks. At 6 and 24 months' follow-up, all patients had Tegner scores of 10. At a 2-year follow-up, all study patients were still participating at their preinjury level of sporting activity. Three patients developed complications around the LARS that required further surgery to remove synthetic material; however, this did not affect function.

Conclusion

Surgical repair of acute Stener-like lesions of the sMCL is associated with a high return to preinjury level of sporting function, excellent functional performance, and a low risk of recurrence at short-term follow-up in elite athletes.

### Patellar tendon rupture in a basketball player [^113bCUVT]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

The patient was a 21-year-old male who was referred to physical therapy with a 1-week history of right knee pain and stiffness following an injury of traumatic onset. While attempting to jump off of both legs to dunk a basketball during a game, the patient heard and felt a pop in his right knee that was associated with an immediate onset of pain and swelling. He was unable to bear weight following the injury and, therefore, immediately went to the emergency department, where radiographs were completed and interpreted as negative for a fracture. However, the patella for the right knee was superiorly displaced. The patient was issued crutches and referred to physical therapy. At the time of the initial physical therapy examination, the patient was still not able to bear full weight on the right lower extremity or actively fully extend his right knee. Due to concern over possible meniscal, medial collateral ligament, or patellar tendon involvement, the patient's physician was contacted and magnetic resonance imaging was ordered. Five days later, the patient presented with decreased knee effusion and the special tests for the medial collateral ligament and meniscus were negative. However, the patient was still not able to actively extend his knee, suggesting a possible rupture of the patellar tendon, which was later confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical repair of the patellar tendon was performed 2 weeks later.

Case Presentation

The patient was initially seen at age 15 years for atraumatic right knee swelling and pain after a basketball game. The patient had no known history of congenital or developmental abnormalities before presentation. The patient had a history of an episode of bilateral knee pain from playing basketball at the age of 13 years, which resolved with bracing treatment and an episode of left (contralateral) knee pain at the age of 14 years after a hike for which a left knee MRI was done, demonstrating no abnormalities. The patient's mother reports a personal history of a meniscus injury treated surgically, but the patient has no other known family history of similar conditions.

On initial presentation, the patient was found to have positive medial joint line tenderness, tibial sag sign, posterior drawer test, quadriceps active test, dial test at 30° of knee flexion, and a positive click with McMurray testing. Over the course of the next 6 years, the patient continued to have intermittent medial joint line pain and evidence of PCL deficiency, including the posterior sag sign, posterior drawer test, and quadriceps active test. The pain was treated nonsurgically with bracing treatment and physical therapy aimed at strengthening and neuromuscular reorientation. The patient continued to experience five episodes of knee pain with full resolution between episodes. Three MRI examinations were done over 6 years (Figures 1 and 2), demonstrating an absence of the PCL without evidence of meniscal derangements and a mildly hypoplastic lateral tibial spine, which was likely a product of the congenitally absent PCL.

At the age of 20 years, the patient returned to clinic with a new episode of knee pain and a desire to pursue surgical intervention. Joint decision was made to undergo PCL reconstruction given his recurrent episodes of pain, recalcitrant to conservative management. Arthroscopically assisted PCL reconstruction was done using an Achilles tendon allograft with interference screw fixation for both the femur and the tibia (Figures 3–5).

### Anterior cruciate ligament force is reduced by anteromedial reconstructions that mimic the role of deep medial collateral ligament [^112bHhmu]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Combined injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial structures, including the superficial and deep medial collateral ligaments (sMCL and dMCL), are common and associated with anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI). While various medial reconstructions have been developed to address this, their impact on ACL graft loading remains unclear.

Purpose

To evaluate the effects of different medial reconstructions on ACL load.

Hypothesis

Adding an anteromedial (AM) reconstruction reduces ACL load more effectively than adding an isolated single-bundle superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) reconstruction.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Eight unpaired knees were tested in a kinematic rig with imposed loads displacing the tibia. This included 5 N·m of external rotation (ER) and internal rotation and a combined 89 N of anterior translation with ER (the AM drawer [AMD] test). Testing was performed in the intact state, after sectioning of the sMCL and deep medial collateral ligament (dMCL) and after 4 different medial reconstructions: (1) modified Lind reconstruction, (2) single-bundle sMCL with AM reconstruction, (3) flat sMCL with flat AM reconstruction, and (4) isolated single-bundle sMCL reconstruction. ACL load was measured by releasing its tibial attachment and securing the ligament to a load cell.

Results

Sectioning the sMCL and dMCL increased the ACL load during AMD testing at all flexion angles ranging from 18.1% (from 123.34 ± 23.11 N to 145.61 ± 23.66 N; p = 0.0227) in full extension to 88.0% (from 42.7 ± 20.72 N to 80.21 ± 21.93 N; P < .001) at 90° of flexion and during ER from 0° to 60° of flexion (from intact 19.66 ± 19.9 N to 68.58 ± 38.75 N in ER; P < .001) compared with the intact state. All reconstructions that added an AM reconstruction limb reduced the ACL load during AMD testing across all flexion angles. The isolated single-bundle sMCL reconstruction did not significantly differ from the cutting state at 0° and 60° to 90° (P > .05). During ER in each medial reconstruction, ACL load did not differ significantly from the intact state at any flexion angle, with only the combined single-bundle sMCL and AM reconstruction significantly reducing ACL force at 0° of flexion compared with the MCL-sectioned state (from 118.53 ± 36.06 N to 90.8 ± 18.26 N; 23.4%; p = 0.0137).

Conclusion

In this in vitro biomechanical study, medial reconstruction techniques incorporating AM reconstruction in addition to sMCL reconstruction effectively reduced ACL load, restoring the native ACL load profile in knees with combined sMCL/dMCL deficiency. Isolated sMCL reconstruction was insufficient for restoring a normal ACL load.

Clinical Relevance

An increase in ACL load with AM rotatory instability (AMRI) may be a risk factor for ACL graft failure. AM reconstruction may decrease the likelihood of ACL graft failure in patients with AMRI after combined ACL/MCL injuries.

### Diagnosis of simultaneous acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament using point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department [^1139EzYv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries from sport-related activities are frequently seen in the emergency department (ED). However, knee instability tests are known to show variable sensitivity and specificity. These tests would also have limited functionality in patients with severe pain and swelling in the knee.

Case Report

A 19-year-old female judo player presented to the ED with severe left knee pain. She had abruptly twisted her left knee while she was shoulder-throwing her opponent. She complained of severe pain and refused physical examination of the knee injury; as a result, evaluation of knee instability could not be performed. However, a point-of-care ultrasound helped in making a prompt and accurate diagnosis of simultaneous, complete rupture and partial ruptures of the ACL and PCL, respectively. The ultrasound findings correlated well with the magnetic resonance imaging images in the assessment of the combined ACL-PCL ruptures. The patient underwent simultaneous arthroscopic ACL and PCL reconstruction with a hamstring tendon autograft and was discharged. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Point-of-care ultrasound imaging of the knee in trauma patients may be helpful for diagnosis of ACL and PCL injuries by augmenting findings of physical examinations in patients with severe pain and swelling in the knee. Ultimately, it may lead to more accurate diagnosis and treatment plans in knee trauma patients.

Case 2

A 19-year-old female basketball player presented to the clinic 3 weeks after the onset of moderate calf pain in the posterior aspect of her left lower leg, approximately 2 cm above the insertion of the Achilles, while playing basketball. She noted 1 to 2 weeks of intermittent calf pain before this episode while running. She was diagnosed with a left ankle sprain and placed in a walking boot by her athletic trainer. She noted no history of performance-enhancing drugs, antibiotic use, or previous injuries. On physical examination, a palpable gap was noted in the region of the Achilles tendon. The patient was unable to plantarflex and had a positive Thompson test. An MRI was ordered, which demonstrated a complete rupture of her Achilles tendon (Figure 1, B). Intraoperatively, degenerative tissue was identified. The repair was performed as noted in case #1 (no fibrin clot) with the same rehabilitation protocol. At 6 months, the patient had full plantar flexion strength, no pain, and returned to play. At 4.5 years after her surgery, she had successfully competed in collegiate basketball at the NCAA Division III level.

Case 3

A 17-year-old female basketball player presented to the clinic 8 weeks after the onset of calf pain in the posterior aspect of her left lower leg, approximately 2 cm above the insertion of the Achilles, while playing basketball. She was diagnosed with a left ankle sprain and an Achilles tendon strain by another provider and was treated conservatively. After 6 weeks of conservative treatment, she returned to basketball and felt a pop in her posterior leg while playing. She noted no history of performance-enhancing drugs, antibiotic use, or previous injuries. On physical examination, a palpable gap was noted in the region of the Achilles tendon. The patient was unable to plantarflex and had a positive Thompson test. An MRI was ordered, which demonstrated a complete rupture of her Achilles tendon (Figure 1, C). Interoperatively, degenerative tissue was identified. The repair was performed in the same fashion as noted in case #1 (with a fibrin clot) with the same rehabilitation protocol. At 6 months, the patient had full plantar flexion strength, no pain, and returned to play. At 4.5 years after her surgery, she had successful competed in collegiate basketball at the NCAA Division II level.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part I. history, physical examination, radiographs, and laboratory tests [^111ezFBM]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently encounter patients with knee pain. Accurate diagnosis requires a knowledge of knee anatomy, common pain patterns in knee injuries, and features of frequently encountered causes of knee pain, as well as specific physical examination skills. The history should include characteristics of the patient's pain, mechanical symptoms (locking, popping, giving way), joint effusion (timing, amount, recurrence), and mechanism of injury. The physical examination should include careful inspection of the knee, palpation for point tenderness, assessment of joint effusion, range-of-motion testing, evaluation of ligaments for injury or laxity, and assessment of the menisci. Radiographs should be obtained in patients with isolated patellar tenderness or tenderness at the head of the fibula, inability to bear weight or flex the knee to 90 degrees, or age greater than 55 years.

Mobility

Hamstring Mobility

Testing of hamstring mobility was performed on an examination table with a firm surface and lumbar support. The player was lying on the bench in the supine position with the pelvis and the nontested leg stabilized using belts to avoid accessory movements. The hip of the testing leg was fixed at 120° of flexion using a belt, and the player was supported against further hip flexion by the tester pressing with both hands distally on the femur. The ankle and foot were relaxed, and the hip was in neutral rotation, abduction, and adduction. Three landmarks were placed on the leg: lateral fibular malleolus, lateral femoral epicondyle, and greater trochanter of femur. The knee was extended passively with an 8-kg load, and a goniometer was placed to the point of the knee joint line. Flexibility was measured as static range of motion.

Hip Anteversion

The player lay in a relaxed prone position on a therapy bench and was fixed with a belt over her pelvis. One test person held the distal part of the player's tibia, passively flexed the knee to 90°, and then rotated the hip passively inward and outward until the most lateral and prominent part of the greater trochanter was identified by palpation. In this position, another test person measured the angle between the vertical line and the shaft of the tibia to the nearest degree using a standardized goniometer.

Navicular Drop

The navicular drop was defined as the distance that the navicular tuberosity moves in the standing position as the subtalar joint is allowed to move from its neutral position to a relaxed position. The height of the navicular tuberosity was measured in neutral and relaxed stance positions, and the total excursion was measured.

Injury Registration

All complete ACL injuries among the tested players were recorded through May 2015, primarily through semiannual contact with the participating teams (manager, coach, and medical staff). If any acute knee injuries occurring during regular team training or competition were reported, the injured player was contacted by phone to get detailed medical data and a description of the injury situation. Noncontact ACL injury, as defined in this study, also consisted of "indirect contact": situations where player contact may have occurred before or at the time of injury but was not a direct blow to the knee (contact injury). All ACL injuries were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and/or arthroscopy.

### Long-term prognosis of patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) in young, elite volleyball players: tendon changes 11 years after baseline [^112eFWUS]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this prospective cohort show that jumper's knee is not a self-limiting condition; young competitive volleyball players report persistent reductions in knee function from baseline to follow-up 11 years later. Jumper's knee problems directly caused around one-fifth of players with jumper's knee at baseline to retire from competitive volleyball. However, a majority of the structural changes observed at baseline had normalized.

Clinical Outcomes at Follow-up: Symptoms Persisted

For sports medicine clinicians working with young elite jumping athletes, patellar tendon pain is a common presentation. As stated in the introductory section, these young athletes (and their parents) often ask about the consequences of continuing to play: prognosis and the long-term prognosis. It is well known that some acute knee injuries, especially ACL injuries with associated cartilage and meniscal damage, substantially increase the risk of future knee osteoarthritis. No data exist on the future knee health of athletes developing tendinopathy during adolescence; the longest follow-up reported in 2 recent systematic reviews on treatment outcomes for jumper's knee was 4.3 years.

To close this knowledge gap, we conducted the current study, the first prospective, long-term follow-up of a large cohort of young athletes. The main outcome, that symptoms from jumper's knee tend to persist, is perhaps not surprising, considering the high prevalence of jumper's knee among mature elite volleyball players documented in cross-sectional studies. Lian et al, examining a national elite cohort of 56 players with a mean age of 27 years, found that 45% had current symptoms of jumper's knee. Our findings are also corroborated by data from Kettunen et al, who reexamined a mixed-sports sample of 18 former athletes, 27 years old at baseline, 15 years after the completion of outpatient treatment, reporting that their symptoms and functional limitations persisted after the athletic career was over. Other sports such as basketball, football, and track and field have similar problems, illustrating that jumper's knee represents a problem in sports characterized by high-intensity jumping and sprinting.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^115xM2jT]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guideline — history and physical for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury — states that a relevant history should be obtained, and a focused musculoskeletal exam of the lower extremities should be performed when assessing for an ACL injury, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Relevant history is important for diagnosing ACL injuries and concomitant pathology and should include at a minimum the mechanism and date of injury, history of hearing/feeling a popping sensation, ability to bear weight, ability to return to play, history of mechanical symptoms of locking or catching, localization of pain if possible, and any history of prior knee injuries; history of hearing/feeling a popping sensation and associated swelling is important in predicting an ACL injury. Appropriate physical exam is important in diagnosing ACL injuries and concomitant pathology and should also be performed including at a minimum: a neurovascular exam of the lower extremity with documentation of both distal perfusion and tibial/peroneal nerve function, assessment of varus and valgus laxity at 0 and 30 degrees of flexion, dial testing at 30 and 90 degrees of flexion, and evaluation of anterior-posterior laxity with Lachman's and anterior drawer and rotational laxity with pivot shift and active buckling sign tests. A thorough history and physical exam will assist the practitioner in prompt and accurate diagnosis of ACL injuries and concomitant pathology, and there are no known harms associated with appropriate implementation of this recommendation.

### Surgical technique: when to arthroscopically repair the torn posterior cruciate ligament [^114L6xG8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior cruciate ligament injuries can occur as isolated ligament ruptures or in association with the multiligament-injured knee. Delayed reconstruction, at 2–3 weeks post-injury, is predominantly recommended for posterior cruciate ligament tears in the multiligament-injured knee. While acute bone and soft tissue avulsion patterns of injury can be amenable to repair, the described techniques have been associated with some difficulties attaching the avulsed ligament.

Description Of Technique

As part of a reconstruction/repair of a multiligament-injured knee, we performed arthroscopic primary repair of the posterior cruciate ligament by passing Bunnell-type stitches into the substance of the ligament using a reloadable suture passer. We then passed the sutures through drill holes into the femoral footprint of the ligament and tied them over a bony bridge.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed three patients with posterior cruciate ligament tears associated with a multiligament-injured knee. All patients had posterior cruciate ligament soft tissue avulsions or "peel off" injuries diagnosed by MRI. The described repair technique was used to repair the posterior cruciate ligament avulsion. Minimum followup was 64 months (mean, 68 months; range, 64–75 months). ROM, stability testing, and functional outcome scores (Lysholm and modified Cincinnati) were recorded.

Results

Mean ROM was 0° to 127°. Posterior drawer testing was negative in all three patients. The mean Lysholm score was 92 and the mean modified Cincinnati score was 94. Followup MRI confirmed ligament healing in all patients.

Conclusions

We believe arthroscopic posterior cruciate ligament repair for soft tissue peel off injuries is a technique that, when applied to carefully selected patients, may be helpful to the surgeon treating patients with a multiligament-injured knee.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Basketball players with clinically diagnosed PFP were recruited to participate in this study. Participants were screened and recruited from the varsity teams and clubs at the local universities. All participants had at least 3 years of experience playing basketball, currently practiced basketball more than 1 day per week, had no trauma to the lower extremity in the past 6 months, and had no previous surgery in the lower extremity. A licensed physical therapist examined eligible participants and determined if they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for PFP. The inclusion criteria were (1) experiencing retropatellar and/or peripatellar pain during at least two of the following functional activities: ascending stairs, descending stairs, running, jumping, hopping, and squatting; (2) pain lasting longer than 1 month; (3) pain intensity during above-mentioned activities greater than a 3 on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS). The exclusion criteria were (1) referred pain from the lower back or hips; (2) positive findings on knee examination for meniscus (McMurray and Apley tests), ligament (Lachman's, anterior/posterior drawer, pivot shift, and valgus/varus stress tests) or interarticular lesions (sweep test). The institutional review board of National Cheng Kung University Hospital approved this study (B-ER-101–168). The study was carried out in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants signed a written informed consent form prior to their inclusion in the study.

### Proximal tibiofibular dislocation [^115KBieH]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation is an uncommon injury, which may be easily missed on plain radiography. If recognised, it can be treated in the emergency department, avoiding surgery and long term problems. The case is presented of a 22 year old male rugby player who was tackled from the left hand side while turning to the left. He heard a "pop" from his knee as he fell to the ground. Clinical examination revealed a prominence in the area of the fibular head. There was no evidence of peroneal nerve injury. Plain x rays confirmed a clinical suspicion for anterior dislocation of the proximal tibiofibular joint. Proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation typically occurs when the knee is slightly flexed and the foot is rotated and plantar flexed. Antero lateral dislocation is the most common pattern. Diagnosis is largely clinical, but the findings may be subtle. Plain films may not show any abnormality and computed tomography is the investigation of choice if there is clinical suspicion for the injury. The dislocation should be reduced in the emergency department, but controversy exists whether early mobilisation or casting is the most appropriate course of action.

### Meniscus tear developed by pulling of the anomalous insertion of medial meniscus on anterior cruciate ligament [^114nWZ7h]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Case report

A 20-year-old female college-level soccer player presented to the senior author's clinic due to symptoms of left knee instability. Her height was 177.8 cm, and her weight was 70.3 kg. Her past surgical history was remarkable for contralateral (right) knee ACL double-bundle reconstruction performed approximately 2 years prior to this visit. Two months ago, the patient suffered a non-contact cutting injury to her left knee (valgus and internal rotation of the tibia) during a game. She heard a pop in the left knee, immediately felt pain, and was unable to continue playing. She had a positive Lachman test and positive pivot shift test. Interestingly, 1 month before her injury, she had been involved in a clinical research program comparing the MRI studies of reconstructed and normal anterior cruciate ligaments. Thus, we were able to obtain a pre-injury 3T MRI of the left knee joint. On the MRI image, we found an abnormal band originating from the medial meniscus, coursing in the front of the ACL (Fig. 1). Post-injury MRI revealed increased signal and complete loss of continuity of the ACL fibers. The corresponding sagittal MRI slice showed a slackened low-signal band which we suspected as an AIMM.

Fig. 1
Four consecutive cuttings of proton density image of 3T MRI show abnormal band (arrow) originated from the medial meniscus (arrowhead) a, directed to the femoral insertion site of the ACL d. Abnormal band was completely separated from the lower half of the ACL fiber b, c

During the arthroscopic examination, a white-colored, round band could be seen running from the medial meniscus to the torn ACL remnant (Fig. 2 a). The distal end of this structure fanned out in the shape of a "hockey stick blade". The proximal end of the abnormal band was directed toward the femoral ACL insertion site and attached on the bony surface adjacent to the remnant ACL tissue on the ACL insertion site. Next, careful examination was performed to determine the tear pattern of the meniscus. The medial meniscus that was attached to the abnormal band was torn along the inner meniscus from the anterior insertion site on the tibial plateau to the anteromedial corner of the medial meniscus (Fig. 2 b). The torn inner meniscus was still attached to the outer meniscus, similar to a posterior-based flap tear.

Flow diagram of the tested participants, including their injury status at baseline and follow-up and the number of analyzed participants in each group. All groups were included in the cross-sectional part of this study, whereas only the Prev/New ACL group and the Prev ACL group were included in the prospective part. ACL, anterior cruciate ligament; Prev, previous.

The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics, the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, and the Norwegian Social Science Data Services. All participants provided written informed consent before inclusion, including parental consent for players aged < 18 years. The study conformed to the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Data Collection and Test Procedures

All players attended 1 day of comprehensive baseline testing during the preseason, including a vertical drop jump task, a cutting task, and a range of neuromuscular, mobility, clinical, and anthropometric measurements. We obtained information about player demographic characteristics, playing experience, and history of previous ACL injuries through a detailed questionnaire.

The basis for this study was a biomechanical analysis of sport-specific cutting tasks using 3-dimensional motion capture. The players wore their own indoor shoes, shorts, and a sports bra. A total of 35 reflective markers were attached over uniquely defined marker positions. After a static, standing calibration trial and a standardized warm-up procedure, players commenced with the cutting task. They were instructed to execute the cutting maneuver as they would in a real match, with high intensity and effort. The players accelerated for 6 meters and arrived with matchlike, self-selected approach speeds at an angle of approximately 30° to the long axis of the runway (Figure 2). The cutting angle was not predetermined. For the handball-specific cut, the player received a lateral pass from a teammate right before performing a matchlike cutting maneuver to fake and pass a human static defender (Figure 2A). For the soccer-specific cut, the player received a pass forcing her to perform a sharp side-step cutting maneuver (Figure 2B). The details of the cutting test procedure were described previously. At least 5 successful trials with maximal matchlike effort were recorded for each leg, the first 3 of which were selected for analyses. If 1 or more markers were obscured during parts of the cutting movement or if the force platform was partially missed, we considered trials 4 and 5 as viable alternatives.

### Physical examination of knee ligament injuries [^114VawVQ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The knee is one of the most commonly injured joints in the body. A thorough history and physical examination of the knee facilitates accurate diagnosis of ligament injury. Several examination techniques for the knee ligaments that were developed before advanced imaging remain as accurate or more accurate than these newer imaging modalities. Proper use of these examination techniques requires an understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of knee ligament injuries. Advanced imaging can be used to augment a history and examination when necessary, but should not replace a thorough history and physical examination.

### Anterior cruciate ligament rupture in skeletally immature patients [^114YwQWP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of ACL lesions should include a detailed clinical history, physical examination, and imaging assessment. The patient usually presents with a painful effusion of the affected knee and avoids load bearing on the affected limb. Unlike adult patients, children often fail to provide a clear history regarding the mechanism of trauma. Overall, 65% of young athletes with hemarthrosis have an ACL rupture. Positive Lachman tests (sensitivity: ∼96%), anterior drawer, and pivot shift are usually present but are limited by pain and swelling in the acute phase. Pediatric patients show poor tolerance to these tests, thereby reducing the validity of the tests. The pivot shift can be done under sedation, reaching 98% positivity. Given the physiologically increased generalized joint laxity in the pediatric population, comparative testing of the contralateral limb is of utmost importance. We must also evaluate other underlying conditions in the patient, such as limb-length discrepancy or axis alteration.

AP, lateral, and intercondylar tunnel radiograph views are recommended to rule out trauma-related bone injuries. Among these, it is important to identify avulsion fractures of the tibial spines that correspond to an ACL rupture equivalent in the population with an immature skeleton. In all patients suspected of an ACL injury, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the knee should be obtained, which has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 88% in children with ACL rupture (Figure 3). It also provides important information regarding commonly associated injuries, such as meniscal tears, chondral injuries, and other ligament injuries, which may have implications for the treatment of the patient.,

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 1: anatomy, biomechanics and diagnostics [^1169zfsM]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Anatomy

With an average length of 36–38 mm and a mean cross-sectional area of 40–60 mm² at the midsubstance level, the PCL is an intra-articular, extra-synovial ligamentous structure of the knee. It is generally accepted and supported by numerous anatomical and biomechanical studies that the PCL consists of two distinct bundles (Fig. 1). More prominent, larger in its cross-sectional area, and stronger against tensile stress is the anterolateral bundle (ALB). In contrast, the posteromedial bundle (PMB) represents a weaker and anatomically more diverse part of the PCL. The extensive half-moon shaped femoral attachment site is located on the lateral facet of the medial femoral condyle, involves anteriorly the roof of the intercondylar notch, is proximally bounded by the medial intercondylar ridge, reaches distally the margin of the articular cartilage of the medial femoral condyle, and thus covers an area of approximately 190–230 mm² (Fig. 2). Based on a modified quadrant method superimposed on the medial femoral condyle, on strict lateral radiographs, the centre of the femoral insertion site of the ALB is located at approximately 38–42% of the depth (measured from the anterior cartilage margin) and 13–16% of the height (measured from the roof of the intercondylar notch) of the medial femoral condyle along and perpendicular to the Blumensaat's line, respectively. The corresponding values for the PMB are 49–63% and 35–38%, respectively. According to a recent anatomic study, the midsubstance of the PCL appears to be flat with a mean width and thickness of approximately 13 mm and 5 mm, respectively. The significantly smaller and trapezoidal-shaped tibial attachment site of the PCL covers an area of approximately 160–220 mm² and is in close proximity to the posterior root of the medial and lateral menisci. The centre of the tibial PCL attachment is located slightly distal to the articular surface in a sulcus termed the PCL facet, which is located between the medial and lateral tibial plateau condyle at approximately 50% (measured from the medial tibial border) of the tibial plateau's total medial–lateral diameter. More specifically, the tibial footprint is bounded posteriorly by the champagne-glass drop-off, a bony landmark at the transitional zone to the popliteus muscle which can be consistently identified on lateral radiographs. Another pertinent bony landmark is called the bundle ridge, which separates the tibial attachment site of the ALB and PMB.

### Three distinct mechanisms predominate in non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries in male professional football players: a systematic video analysis of 39 cases [^113oX9UU]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Lower limb biomechanics

In the video analysis on Australian Rules football, all indirect and all but one non-contact ACL injury had a shallow knee flexion (less than 30°) at IC which tallies with our findings (maximum 20° knee flexion). The most reliable data to date are likely those reported in a study utilising a model-based image matching (MBIM) technique to estimate joint kinematics in ACL injury situations of 10 basketball and handball players. The mean knee flexion angle at IC was 23°, and this increased by 24° within the following 40 ms where the injury was assumed to occur. Thus, it seems that a majority of ACL injured athletes are likely to have a relatively straight knee at the time of injury. Vertical compression at a straight knee has previously been shown to load the ACL through anterior tibial drawer and internal rotation.

Although the classification of knee valgus was uncertain as determined by visual inspection in 11 cases in our study, we observed valgus in 15 of the 19 remaining cases. This finding is in line with previous research from several other sports, and suggests that knee valgus is also an important injury component in football. A sudden knee valgus increase was also reported in a non-contact ACL injury in a male professional football player, where the MBIM technique was employed.

Interestingly, there were no sex-related differences in knee valgus at IC in a study of 39 ACL injuries in female and male basketball players, but the valgus angle was significantly higher in females at assumed time of injury 33–50 ms later. Similar findings were reported in a study on a mixed sample of athletes where knee valgus was significantly more pronounced in female athletes' five frames after IC compared with males. Additionally, a valgus collapse was reported to be five times more common in female than in male basketball players. It has been argued that the dynamic valgus collapse might be a sex-specific knee motion occurring predominately in females. Our data seem to support this hypothesis, since an overt valgus collapse was identified in only a minority of the non-contact and indirect contact cases. However, given that we observed knee valgus in three-quarter of the cases where assessment was possible, one can speculate whether the overt valgus collapse often seen in females is a sex-specific consequence after the injury (eg, due to lower muscle strength and higher joint laxity) rather than a mechanism leading to the injury.

### Role of the anterior cruciate ligament, anterolateral complex, and lateral meniscus posterior root in anterolateral rotatory knee instability: a biomechanical study [^111QheGS]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

After ethics approval (Imperial College Healthcare Tissue Bank project R18027–5A), 22 unpaired fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees (13 male, 9 female; mean age, 57 years [range, 47–65 years]) were obtained from a tissue bank (Medcure). They were stored at −20°C and thawed for 24 hours at room temperature before preparation. They had no evidence of previous surgery, abnormal laxity, ligament or meniscal damage, articular erosions, or malalignment via manual examination and arthroscopic visualization by an orthopaedic surgeon (L.W.). Ten knees were tested robotically to obtain the contributions to stability, and 12 knees were tested kinematically to measure the resulting instability. However, 2 knees had to be excluded from the kinematics testing owing to technical error, leaving 10 for analysis. Knees were kept moist with intermittent water spraying during the entire test.

Specimen Preparation

The femora and tibiae were cut 170 mm from the joint line. Skin and subcutaneous fat were removed for the robotic testing but not for the kinematics testing. All other soft tissues on the femur and tibia within 80 mm from the joint line were left intact. Tissue attaching more proximally and distally was removed, exposing the bones for fixation. The fibula was shortened and secured to the tibia in its anatomic position using a tricortical bone screw.

### Pseudo-arthrosis repair of a posterior cruciate ligament avulsion fracture [^112ZPvE9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) plays a major role in knee stabilization. It acts as a primary restraint against posterior displacement and, in concert with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), to regulate external rotation of the knee during extension.

The most commonly reported mechanism of injury to the PCL is a posteriorly directed blow to the anterior aspect of the proximal tibia with the knee flexed at 90°. Another mechanism is sudden hyperextension in conjunction with associated varus or valgus force or hyperflexion of the knee.

Sports injury and motor vehicle accidents account for the majority of PCL injuries. Clinical examination shows a posterior sag and a positive posterior drawer test if the PCL is ruptured or avulsed. In case of avulsion, radiological examination will reveal a bony fragment at the tibial attachment of the PCL.

Avulsion of the tibial insertion of the PCL is believed to be an uncommon injury. A non-displaced bony avulsion can be treated conservatively with a plaster cast, holding the knee flexed and the tibia pulled forward to diminish tension on the PCL. There is general consensus that a displaced bony PCL avulsion should be surgically reduced and fixed immediately to stabilize the knee joint and prevent non-union.

All publications on the repair of acute bony avulsion of the tibial attachment of the PCL report excellent clinical results.

Information on the treatment of bony PCL avulsions past the acute phase is rare. Trickey states that surgical repair of an avulsion the tibial attachment of the PCL after 3 weeks is not successful. However, Meyers and Torisu dispute this statement. There is one report in the literature of a reduction and screw fixation combined with posterolateral stabilization of a 4.5-year-old bony avulsion of the PCL with good clinical result.

To the authors' knowledge, there is no report of pseudo-arthrosis repair of a PCL avulsion fracture. We report the case of a pseudo-arthrosis repair of a 4-year-old bony avulsion fracture of the PCL using a minimally invasive technique, screw fixation, and bone grafting.

### Reliability of estimates of ACL attachment locations in 3-dimensional knee reconstruction based on routine clinical MRI in pediatric patients [^111ZErnM]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current techniques of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction focus on the placement of femoral and tibial tunnels at anatomic ACL attachments, which can be difficult to identify intraoperatively.

Purpose

To determine whether the 3-dimensional (3D) center of ACL attachments can be reliably detected from routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with intact ACLs and whether the reliability of this technique changes if the ACL is torn.

Study Design

Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

A computer technique was developed in which users identify points along ACL attachments on routine clinical MRI of preoperative knees. These attachments are then displayed on a 3D MRI reconstruction, which can be used as a visual guide for the surgeon during arthroscopic surgery. Thirty-seven pediatric patients (age range, 10–17 years) with ACL tears and 37 controls with intact ACLs were examined. Two blinded observers identified cruciate ligament attachments on routine clinical 1.5-T MRI of knees. From the resulting 3D model, the location of the center of each ligament attachment site and its area were calculated and reliability assessed.

Results

Mean interobserver variation of the centers of ACL attachments for the intact versus torn ACL was 1.7 ± 0.9 mm versus 1.8 ± 1.1 mm (femoral) and 1.4 ± 0.9 mm versus 1.7 ± 1.0 mm (tibial), respectively (P > .05). The 95% confidence interval for the center location was at most 4 mm. The identified ACL attachment areas were more variable, with interobserver reliability ranging from fair to excellent by the intraclass correlation coefficient. Overlap of ligament areas between observers for the intact versus torn ACL was 70% ± 15% versus 73% ± 12% (femoral) and 79% ± 9% versus 78% ± 10% (tibial), respectively (P > .05). In all cases, intraobserver reliability was superior to interobserver reliability.

Conclusion

The 3D locations of ACL tibial and femoral attachment centers were identified from routine clinical MRI with variability averaging less than 2 mm between 2 observers. The margin of error was at most 4 mm, representing the thickness of a single axial MRI slice, whether the ACL was intact or torn. Remnant tissue at attachments allows a reliable assessment even of torn ligaments. Identification of the ligament attachment areas was more user dependent than was identification of the attachment centers.

### MRI-negative bucket-handle tears of the lateral meniscus in athletes: a case series [^1179npJG]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely used non-invasive test for assessing intra-articular injuries of the knee. It has been suggested that a negative MRI can be useful in avoiding the need for diagnostic arthroscopy in cases where clinical examination is equivocal. However, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI is not 100%, particularly for tears of the lateral meniscus. Furthermore, a false negative MRI scan may result in premature return to play in athletes, resulting in increased risk of further damage to a torn meniscus. To illustrate this issue, we present a case series of eight elite athletes who all presented with mechanical knee symptoms and where MRI scans revealed no significant intra-articular pathology. Five of the athletes were allowed to return to sport on the basis of a negative MRI. All patients were subsequently found to have a bucket-handle tear of their lateral meniscus at arthroscopy. Two independent, experienced musculoskeletal radiologists were asked to review the MRI films without being given any clinical history of the cases. Although injuries to the popliteus tendon were noted in two of the athletes who had sustained a recent acute injury to their knee, no meniscal tears were identified. Thus arthroscopy remains the gold standard for the assessment and management of high-demand patients with a clinical suspicion of meniscal pathology.

### MRI anatomy of the tibial ACL attachment and proximal epiphysis in a large population of skeletally immature knees: reference parameters for planning anatomic physeal-sparing ACL reconstruction [^114WdGdy]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

To aid in performing anatomic physeal-sparing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, it is important for surgeons to have reference data for the native ACL attachment positions and epiphyseal anatomy in skeletally immature knees.

Purpose

To characterize anatomic parameters of the ACL tibial insertion and proximal tibial epiphysis at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large population of skeletally immature knees.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

The ACL tibial attachment site and proximal epiphysis were examined in 570 skeletally immature knees with an intact ACL (age, 6–15 years) using 1.5-T proton density-weighted sagittal MRI; also measured were the tibial anteroposterior diameter; anterior, central, and posterior ACL attachment positions; vertical height of the epiphysis; and maximum oblique epiphyseal depth extending from the ACL tibial attachment center to the tibial tuberosity.

Results

In adolescents (11–15 years of age), the center of the ACL's tibial attachment was 51.5% ± 5.7% of the anteroposterior diameter of the tibia, with no significant differences between sexes or age groups (P > .05 in all cases). Mean vertical epiphyseal height was 15.9 ± 1.7 mm in the adolescent group, with significant differences between 11-year-olds (15.2 ± 1.5 mm) and 15-year-olds (16.6 ± 1.6 mm), P < .001, and between males (16.6 ± 1.5 mm) and females (14.8 ± 1.4), P < .001. Mean maximum oblique depth was 30.0 ± 5.3 mm, with a significant difference between 11-year-olds (26.7 ± 4.9 mm) and 15-year-olds (32.7 ± 5.1 mm), P < .001, and between males (29.7 ± 6.4 mm) and females (27.8 ± 5.2 mm), P < .001. The maximum oblique depth occurred at a mean angle of ~50°, and this angle did not change with age or sex. There was a significant moderate correlation (r = 0.39, P < .001) between epiphyseal vertical height and maximum oblique depth.

Conclusion

The center of the ACL tibial attachment was consistently near 51% of the anteroposterior diameter, regardless of age or sex. The vertical depth of the tibial epiphysis was ~16 mm in adolescents. Maximum oblique depth from ACL attachment was ~30 mm, occurring at a mean angle ~50° regardless of age or sex. The normative values for tibial ACL attachment and epiphyseal anatomy presented here may be helpful in selecting candidates for surgery and in planning surgical approaches for pediatric ACL reconstruction.

### Editorial commentary: the pivot shift and Lachman examinations: teammates with distinct roles [^1149Zmcq]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

The pivot shift and Lachman examinations are "teammates" with complementary but distinct roles in the successful diagnosis and treatment of anterior cruciate ligament rupture and injury to the surrounding soft-tissue envelope of the knee. The Lachman test measures anterior tibial translation in response to an applied anterior tibial load. This test assesses the integrity of the native or reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament and the secondary medial restraints including the medial meniscus and medial collateral ligament. In contrast, the pivot shift exam creates coupled tibiofemoral motions in response to a complex combination of multiplanar loads. This test assesses the stabilizing role of the native or reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament and the secondary lateral restraints including the lateral meniscus and anterolateral complex. The pivot shift grade depends not only on the soft the tissue stabilizers of the knee but also on the shape of the proximal tibia and the distal femur including lateral tibial slope and femoral condylar offset. Both examinations have unique strengths and weaknesses, but when combined as diagnostic tools, they achieve far more collectively than what each can achieve alone.

### Posterior cruciate ligament rupture and all-epiphyseal repair with suture tape augmentation in a 5-year-old girl: a case report and review of the literature [^112wvCiy]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 5-year-old girl injured her right knee while playing with her mother. It occurred when the mother hugged the girl's neck from behind and leaned on the girl's shoulders with her body weight. The mother's weight was transferred through the girl's extended right knee, as she was standing on that one leg. Since this event, the girl complained of right knee pain and the inability to bear weight on the right lower extremity. An adjustable splint was applied in her first visit clinic at the time of the injury and was worn until the patient was seen in our clinic 20 days later. Examination of her knee revealed clinical signs of effusion, no limitation of the range of motion, a positive sagging sign of the right tibia, and a posterior drawer test with over 10 mm displacement (Supplement Video 1). A negative right hip exam was observed. X-Ray did not reveal osseous lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a complete proximal tear of the PCL with an intact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and intact menisci (Fig. 1). A clinical diagnosis of a grade III PCL tear was made, and the girl was scheduled to be treated with surgery as non-operative management might fail to restore the normal kinematics of the knee and predispose to early degeneration. Written informed consent of the operation was obtained from the patient's parents.

### Fast-tracked rehabilitation and return to sport of an elite rugby player with a complicated posterolateral corner injury and associated peroneal paralysis [^116SGVAJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 24-year-old international level rugby player, fifth year medical student and an author of this paper, presented himself at the emergency department following a rugby-related trauma involving a posterolateral hyperextension of the left knee with considerable hydrops. The patient was 1.95 m in length and weighed 115 kg with a fat percentage of 16%. Examination showed a positive Lachman and varus stress test with a range of motion (ROM) noted as flexion/extension 100/0/0. Furthermore, complete loss of dorsiflexion and eversion of the left foot was observed as well as sensibility loss of the lateral half of the lower left leg and dorsum of the foot. Left knee flexion strength was graded at 2/5 on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle power. The MRI, shown in figure 1, revealed an avulsion fracture of the semimembranosus, a torn ACL and a complex complete PLC injury comprising a distal biceps femoris tendon avulsion fracture, grade 3 LCL, arcuate ligament and popliteus muscle-tendon-ligament unit tear as wells as extensive injury to the peroneal nerve consisting of a longitudinal tear. An electromyography (EMG), performed the same week showed possible continuation of the peroneal nerve, yet minimal to no signal conduction. Due to the short time postinjury at which the EMG was performed, it was repeated at 6 weeks postinjury. This EMG showed denervation of the tibialis anterior and minimal movement of the peroneus brevis following stimulation. Due to the considerable haemarthrosis, the reconstruction of the PLC and ACL repair was set for 8 weeks postinjury.

### Long-term prognosis of patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) in young, elite volleyball players: tendon changes 11 years after baseline [^1174YaXM]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Jumper's knee is not a self-limiting condition; volleyball players who had developed jumper's knee during adolescence reported persistent reductions in knee function 11 years later, leading a substantial proportion to retire from competitive volleyball. Although approximately 70% of tendons with structural changes at baseline were normal at follow-up, there was no clear relationship between structure and function. Athletes presenting with early symptoms of jumper's knee should receive appropriate treatment without delay to prevent prolonged, recalcitrant symptoms and reduced knee function.

### The diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for anterior cruciate ligament tears are comparable but the Lachman test has been previously overestimated: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZEHxu]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common with a median annual incidence of 0.03% per person overall and up to 3.7% in professional athletes. Potential consequences of an ACL tear include further knee injury, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, and reduced quality of life; therefore, prompt, accurate diagnosis is important to expedite treatment and mitigate these risks.

ACL tears are diagnosed by combining patient history and physical examination with imaging modalities utilised if required. History elements include a traumatic pivoting mechanism, typically without direct contact to the knee, a 'popping' or 'snapping' sensation, effusion within 2 h of injury and knee instability. Based on an overview of systematic reviews investigating the diagnostic validity of physical examination tests, the Lachman test is considered to be of high diagnostic value to confirm and exclude an ACL tear, while the pivot shift test may be used to rule in an ACL injury when positive. The Lever sign demonstrates similar diagnostic accuracy to more established tests, but these tests have not been compared directly using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Although this synthesis of data represents the best available evidence to guide clinical practice, numerous studies in the aforementioned systematic reviews include subjects with additional knee ligament injury, which could affect test sensitivity. Since up to half of all patients with an ACL tear sustain a concomitant medial or lateral ligament injury, it is important to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ACL tests in the absence of such injury. Furthermore, previous meta-analyses have evaluated studies by methods that do not account for the non-independence of sensitivity and specificity, which are often negatively correlated. More recently, approaches such as bivariate random effects models have been recommended for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy.

The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to provide an updated synthesis of studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for ACL tears (partial and complete) without concomitant knee ligament injury. Data are presented for the anterior drawer, Lachman, Lever sign and pivot shift tests performed without anaesthesia, in acute and post-acute presentations.

The study hypotheses were that ACL clinical tests will have lower sensitivity in the absence of concomitant ligament injury, and the diagnostic accuracy of the Lachman test will be superior to the Lever sign. The findings from this study will provide more accurate estimates of the diagnostic ability of ACL tests, to inform clinicians in these common clinical situations.

### The role of fibers in the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament in resisting tibial displacement [^114Bp8is]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose was to clarify the load-bearing functions of the fibers of the femoral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) attachment in resisting tibial anterior drawer and rotation.

Methods

A sequential cutting study was performed on 8 fresh-frozen human knees. The femoral attachment of the ACL was divided into a central area that had dense fibers inserting directly into the femur and anterior and posterior fan-like extension areas. The ACL fibers were cut sequentially from the bone: the posterior fan-like area in 2 stages, the central dense area in 4 stages, and then the anterior fan-like area in 2 stages. Each knee was mounted in a robotic joint testing system that applied tibial anteroposterior 6-mm translations and 10° or 15° of internal rotation at 0° to 90° of flexion. The reduction of restraining force or moment was measured after each cut.

Results

The central area resisted 82% to 90% of the anterior drawer force; the anterior fan-like area, 2% to 3%; and the posterior fan-like area, 11% to 15%. Among the 4 central areas, most load was carried close to the roof of the intercondylar notch: the anteromedial bundle resisted 66% to 84% of the force and the posterolateral bundle resisted 16% to 9% from 0° to 90° of flexion. There was no clear pattern for tibial internal rotation, with the load shared among the posterodistal and central areas near extension and mostly the central areas in flexion.

Conclusions

Under the experimental conditions described, 66% to 84% of the resistance to tibial anterior drawer arose from the ACL fibers at the central-proximal area of the femoral attachment, corresponding to the anteromedial bundle; the fan-like extension fibers contributed very little. This work did not support moving a single-bundle ACL graft to the side wall of the notch or attempting to cover the whole attachment area if the intention was to mimic how the natural ACL resists tibial displacements.

Clinical Relevance

There is ongoing debate about how best to reconstruct the ACL to restore normal knee function, including where is the best place for ACL graft tunnels. This study found that the most important area on the femur, in terms of resisting displacement of the tibia, was in the central-anterior part of the femoral ACL attachment, near the roof of the intercondylar notch. The testing protocol did not lead to data that would support using a large ACL graft tunnel that attempts to cover the whole natural femoral attachment area.

### Positioning of the femoral tunnel in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: functional anatomical reconstruction [^1124Awyk]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

A study published in 2010divided ACL insertion into direct and indirect fibres. In 2012, another histological studynoted a microscopic structure of four layers in both the femoral and tibial direct insertion, demonstrating that direct fibres are stronger and biomechanically more important, whereas indirect fibres work only as ligament anchor points. In 2014, another study was published in which the authors reported difficulty in reconstructing indirect fibres when using tunnels. However, it was observed that it is possible to recreate the remaining ACL substance fibres with the currently used techniques.

The positioning described in the following paragraphs relates to the arthroscopic view, where anterior means anatomically inferior, posterior means superior, low means posterior and high means anterior.

Direct ACL insertion is located anteriorly, on the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle. It is connected to a bone depression parallel and immediately posterior to the intercondylar lateral ridge and to the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle. It is suggested that the direct insertion fibre architecture is an important stabilising structure, consisting of a band of dense collagen fibres with a zonal architecture that moves from the ligament to the fibrocartilage, to the mineralised fibrocartilage and then to the bone. It is a resistant and firm insertion from a biomechanical point of view, as this tissue transition provides the load distribution in a gradual manner.

Indirect ACL insertion is represented by the most posterior femoral insertion fibres and is fan-shaped, bordering the articular cartilage when the knee is fully extended.

The fibres inserted in areas that correspond to an AM band provide 66% to 84% of the total resistance to the anterior drawer from 0 degrees to 90 degrees of flexion. The contribution of the fibres comprising the PL portion of the band decreases to 16% at 0 degrees and 9% at 90 degrees. The superior fibres of the ACL femoral insertion (anterior band), adjacent to the intercondylar lateral ridge, possess greater strength than the inferior fibres in relation to the Lachman, anterior drawer and pivot shift simulated tests. Furthermore, the virtual fibres located in the superior AM portion of the femoral ACL insertion are more isometric than the fibres inserted in the inferior region. Given this fact, it could be advantageous to create a 'superior' femoral tunnel during ACL reconstruction, in the lateral intercondylar ridge.

Results

Hundred patients (80 male and 20 female) with a mean age of 22.3 ± 4.9 years and a minimum follow-up of 12 months (mean 35.6 ± 11.4) were included. There were 81 non-contact and 19 contact injuries in 53 right and 47 left knees. The time between injury and MRI was 2.5 ± 3.2 days (range 0–21) and 16.6 ± 13.1 days (range 3–100) between injury and surgery. All included patients were professional athletes to ensure MRIs were obtained shortly after injury: 60 soccer players, 26 rugby players, 4 ballet dancers and 10 players from other sports (netball, hockey, lacrosse, cricket, gymnastics, handball, and swimming). This group was chosen as early MRI scanning is routine.

Clinical assessment

Preoperative EUA showed a positive anterior drawer test in all patients: 83% grade I, 17% grade II. Lachman tests were graded I in 2%, II in 35% and III in 63% of the patients. Pivot shift tests were positive in all patients: 29% grade I, 54% grade II and 13% grade III. Owing to the inclusion criteria, posterior drawer, valgus and varus stress tests were negative in all patients, as was the dial test.

### Acute knee effusions: a systematic approach to diagnosis… [^1177mTKk]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

If trauma is involved, the clinician should inquire about the date and mechanism of injury, what sport, if any, was involved, and whether a direct blow caused the injury. Historical findings suggestive of fracture include a mechanism of injury involving a high-velocity collision, the occurrence of a "pop" at the time of injury, age greater than 55 years and inability to bear weight immediately after the injury. Palpation of the knee is best accomplished with the patient supine and the knee flexed to 90 degrees to enhance patient relaxation. The patella and its supporting structures, bilateral joint lines and collateral ligaments are palpated for tenderness, crepitus and localized swelling. FRACTURE Physical examination findings suggestive of fracture include a tense effusion, deformity, crepitation and ecchymosis. If a fracture is suspected, the hip and ankle joints should be examined, as should the leg's neurovascular status.

Fractures about the knee may be open or closed, displaced or nondisplaced. If a break occurred in the skin overlying the fracture, it must be considered an open fracture, necessitating orthopedic referral. The quality of the end point should also be noted; a soft end point indicates an ACL tear. The anterior drawer test is performed with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. Similar to the Lachman's test, the tibia is drawn anteriorly, and asymmetric translation is an indicator of ACL injury. Physical findings of a PCL injury include effusion, positive posterior drawer and tibial sag tests, and abrasions or ecchymosis over the proximal anterior tibia. The posterior drawer test is performed with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion and the proximal tibia directed posteriorly. Comparison with the uninjured knee reveals increased tibial translation posteriorly.

The sag test is performed with the patient supine, hips flexed to 45 degrees and both knees flexed to 90 degrees. In this position, the affected tibia drops back or sags on the femur if a PCL injury has occurred. MENISCAL INJURY Examination reveals joint line tenderness, inability to squat or hop because of pain, and positive results on the McMurray's test or the Apley's test. If an extension lag is present on motion testing, a displaced vertical tear, often called a bucket-handle tear, should be suspected.

### The role of fibers in the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament in resisting tibial displacement [^1113qtcs]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Partition of Femoral Attachment of ACL

Two transverse holes were created across the distal femur, avoiding the collateral ligament attachments and other stabilizing structures. The medial femoral condyle was separated with a reciprocating saw, starting between the cruciate ligaments and cutting proximally in the sagittal plane for 60 mm and then medially.

The morphology and dimensions of the femoral ACL attachment were assessed on the lateral intercondylar surface. The outline of the attachment with the fan-like extensions was marked (Fig 1), on the basis of visual observation of the extent of the ACL fiber attachment area. The narrow, central, direct attachment area of the ACL midsubstance was identified by flexing and extending the knee with the ACL tensed. The directly attaching fibers remained tight when the knee was flexed and extended, passing straight to the bone attachment. The posterior fan-like extension fibers were tight when the knee was near extension but remained adherent to the surface of the femur when the knee flexed, causing a distinct folding of the ACL fibers at the boundary between the posterior fan-like extension and the central direct attachment areas, as illustrated in prior anatomic studies. A similar process identified the boundary between the central direct fiber attachment area and the anterior fan-like extension area, in a deep fold between the bulk of the ACL and the wall of the intercondylar notch. These boundary lines were marked and were found to be straight and parallel, so another line could be drawn midway between them, along the central axis of the direct attachment area. Two more lines were drawn parallel to the central line, tangent to the outer edges of the attachment. Five parallel lines were drawn parallel to Blumensaat's line: 2 were tangent to the outer edges of ACL attachment, and then the other 3 were equally spaced between them so that the length of the central direct fiber attachment area was divided into 4 equal parts. For the geometry and position of these divisions, we used a ruler and sharp-pointed dividers, so the dimensions of the sub-areas were known within ± 0.5 mm. This method divided the femoral attachment of the ACL into 12 partitions — 4 central, 4 anterior, and 4 posterior — so that the femoral attachment of the ACL had been partitioned in a manner akin to a 12-square checkerboard (Fig 1). The lines defining these areas had ink rubbed into them for easy identification during the fiber-cutting surgical procedure.

### Restriction of posterior tibial translation during the posterior drawer test in internal or external rotation is dependent on peripheral stabilizers of the knee: a biomechanical robotic investigation [^115fPH25]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The posteromedial and posterolateral structures of the knee have previously been shown to be secondary restraints to posterior tibial translation (PTT). The effect of these structures may increase when performing the posterior drawer test in internal or external rotation.

Purpose/Hypothesis

The purpose was to investigate the influence of the posteromedial and posterolateral structures on restricting PTT in neutral, external, and internal rotation. It was hypothesized that the posteromedial structures restrict PTT in internal rotation, while the posterolateral structures restrict PTT in external rotation.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

A sequential cutting study was performed on 24 fresh-frozen human knee specimens utilizing a 6 degrees of freedom robotic test setup. After determining the native knee kinematics from 0° to 90° of knee flexion, an 89-N posterior drawer test in neutral, internal, and external rotation was performed at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion. In 8 knees, a motion-controlled protocol was applied, replicating the native motion while the force was measured. The reduction of the restraining force represented the percentage contribution of each cut. In 16 knees, a force-controlled protocol was applied, determining the increase in PTT after each cut. After calculating the native knee kinematics, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was cut, followed by randomized sectioning of the posteromedial (medial collateral ligament, posterior oblique ligament) and posterolateral (lateral collateral ligament, popliteus complex) structures. Mixed linear models with the post hoc Dunn test were used for statistical analysis.

Results

During motion-controlled testing, performing the posterior drawer test in internal or external rotation significantly decreased the contribution of the PCL in restraining PTT. The PCL was the primary restraint to PTT during the posterior drawer test in neutral rotation at all flexion angles (24.4%-61.2% contribution). The primary restraint to PTT during the posterior drawer test in internal rotation was the posterior oblique ligament at 0° (24.2% ± 14.1%), the medial collateral ligament at 30° (33.6% ± 11.4%), and the PCL at 60° and 90° (46.2%-57.8%). In external rotation, the primary restraint was the lateral collateral ligament at 0° (24.7% ± 10.5%) and the popliteus complex at 30° to 90° (56.4%-65.2%). During force-controlled testing, PTT in the PCL-deficient knee was significantly decreased when performing the posterior drawer test in internal or external rotation. Insufficiency of the posterolateral or posteromedial structures, in addition to insufficiency of the PCL, during the posterior drawer test in neutral rotation led to an additional significant increase in PTT of up to 7.6 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6–11.7). Insufficiency of the posterolateral structures led to a significant further increase in PTT during the posterior drawer test in external rotation of up to 12.6 mm (95% CI, 3.5–21.8). Insufficiency of the posteromedial structures led to a significant additional increase in PTT during the posterior drawer test in internal rotation of up to 14.9 mm (95% CI, 8.2–21.6).

Conclusion

The peripheral ligamentous structures of the knee acted as secondary restraints to PTT in neutral rotation and became primary stabilizers in internal or external rotation, depending on the flexion angle.

Clinical Relevance

This study may guide the clinician in diagnosing deficiencies of the posteromedial or posterolateral structures of the knee. In cases of isolated PCL deficiencies, PTT is reduced when the posterior drawer test is performed in internal or external rotation. However, an additional deficiency of the posteromedial or posterolateral structures further increases PTT.

Sprains

Background: Knee sprains include injury to any of the ligamentous structures within the knee joint. Major ligaments include the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and will be discussed here. Additionally, there are the anterolateral ligament (ALL), transverse meniscal ligament, posterior meniscofemoral ligament, oblique popliteal ligament, arcuate ligament, popliteofibular ligament, and the ligaments that form the joint capsule.
Etiology: Ligamentous knee sprains are due to trauma or sports injury, both with contact and non-contact forces. The ACL is commonly injured during plant and cut maneuvers due to increased knee abduction during hip adduction and knee valgus during hip internal rotation. Additionally, internal rotation of the tibia increases risk of ACL strain. These three movements are combined in landing from jump with hip extended and internally rotated, knee extended and valgus, tibia internally rotated, and foot planted. Hewett et al evaluated ACL injury mechanics in female athletes and found that abduction angle was 8° greater in ACL injury and those with ACL injury had 2.5 times greater abduction moments.PCL injuries are usually concomitant with injury to other ligaments particularly when varus or valgus stress or rotational force is involved. The PCL is injured with posterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur. Force is required and a PCL tear is commonly known as a "dashboard injury" which occurs when the flexed knee hits a motor vehicle dashboard during a collision and is translated posteriorly, or during hyperflexion of the knee with the foot in plantar flexion, such as falling onto the flexed knee.
MCL injuries can occur in isolation or in combination with the ACL or PCL. The MCL originates at the medial epicondyle of the tibia deep to the pes anserine and inserts 5–7 cm below the joint line. It functions as the primary medial knee stabilizer and resists valgus stress, anterior tibial translation, and internal rotation. The most common mechanism of injury to the MCL is direct lateral force to the knee or maneuvers that induce severe valgus stress to the knee, and injury most often occurs at the femoral insertion. The LCL is the primary stabilizer of the lateral knee, originates at the lateral epicondyle of the femur and inserts on the medial fibular head. It resists varus stress, external rotation and posterior displacement of the fibula; therefore, it can be injured by contact and non-contact forces in these planes. Common mechanism of injury is direct varus force to the medial knee or hyperextension stress across the knee.
Diagnostic Criteria: Sprains are graded based on severity: Grade 1 – mild, painful stretching or minimal tearing of fibers, Grade 2 – moderate, painful, partial tearing of fibers, Grade 3 – severe, painful or sometimes not painful, complete rupture of ligament and may demonstrate instability. Clinical physical exam findings: ACL – knee line pain, positive Lachman's test. PCL – dimple sign, posterior drawer test, posterior sag test, quadriceps active test, external rotation recurvatum test.MCL – medial joint line pain and tenderness, positive valgus stress test. LCL – lateral joint line pain and tenderness, lateral joint edema, positive varus stress test, lateral compartment laxity with figure 4 position. History and physical exam support the clinical diagnosis, and imaging should include weight — bearing knee series and stress radiographs; however, the gold standard for diagnosis of ligament injury in the knee is MRI.
Treatment: Symptomatic pain emanating from knee sprains is typically managed conservatively with topical or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in those without contraindications as well as alternating ice and heat. From an orthopedic perspective, grade I and II sprains are treated with progressive weight bearing as tolerated, bracing, gentle active assisted range of motion, and strengthening of surrounding supportive musculature and are specific to each ligament involved. Some isolated Grade 3 sprains are treated with a longer period of immobilization and bracing, toe touch weight bearing, followed by aggressive range of motion (ROM); however, combined injury or severe Grade 3 sprains with complete ligament rupture can be treated surgically, particularly if the ACL is involved.

### Jump landing strategies in male and female college athletes and the implications of such strategies for anterior cruciate ligament injury [^113annYQ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Female athletes are more likely than male athletes to injure the anterior cruciate ligament. Causes of this increased injury incidence in female athletes remain unclear, despite numerous investigations.

Hypothesis

Female athletes will exhibit lower hamstring muscle activation and smaller knee flexion angles than male athletes during jump landings, especially when the knee muscles are fatigued.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Eight female and six male varsity college basketball athletes with no history of knee ligament injury performed jump landings on the dominant leg from a maximum height jump and from 25.4 cm and 50.8 cm high platforms under nonfatigued and fatigued conditions. Knee joint angle and surface electromyographic signals from the quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscles were recorded.

Results

Women landed with greater knee flexion angles and greater knee flexion accelerations than men. Knee muscle activation patterns were generally similar in men and women.

Conclusion

As compared with male college basketball players, female college basketball players did not exhibit altered knee muscle coordination characteristics that would predispose them to anterior cruciate ligament injury when landing from jumps. This conclusion is made within the parameters of this study and based on the observation that hamstring muscle activation was similar for both groups. The greater knee flexion we observed in the female subjects would be expected to decrease their risk of injury.

Clinical Relevance

Factors other than those evaluated in this study need to be considered when attempting to determine the reasons underlying the increased incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injuries consistently observed in elite female athletes.

### Comparable instrumented knee joint laxity and patient-reported outcomes after ACL repair with dynamic intraligamentary stabilization or ACL reconstruction: 5-year results of a randomized controlled trial [^117XT98H]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the early history of the surgical treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, many efforts have been made to restore knee joint kinematics with ACL repair. However, in 1976, Feagin and Curlreported unsatisfying results at 5 years after ACL repair in 64 cadets at the United States Military Academy: more than 90% of 32 re-evaluated patients reported persistent subjective instability. Improved results after ligament augmentation, led to a paradigm change toward ACL reconstruction, which is considered the gold standard treatment for ACL tears. Nevertheless, innovative operative techniques with favorable short-term results have led to the renaissance of ACL repair in the past decade.

Although early ACL repair techniques consisted of arthrotomy with open suturing of the ACL with femoral drill holes and cast immobilization for 4 to 6 weeks, modern techniques of arthroscopic ACL repair include refixation using suture anchors, biological augmentation of ACL repair, rigid augmentation with suture tapes, and dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS). With DIS, the torn ACL is reattached to its femoral insertion, and a nonresorbable cordlike suture is placed along the ACL and fixed to a dynamic spring in an implant in the proximal tibia. Dynamic stabilization of the tibia in a posterior drawer position through full range of motion aims to protect the reattached ACL during the period of healing.

The outcomes of suture anchor repair or suture tape augmentation have been reported only in a limited number of noncomparative cohort studies. In contrast, favorable patient-reported outcomes (PROs) with sufficient healing of the ACL after DIS have been found in numerous cohort studies, which are summarized in a recent review regarding ACL repair with DIS. There have been 2 recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on favorable anterior tibial translation (ATT) and PROs after ACL repair with DIS in comparison with ACL reconstruction in the short term. However, there is still a lack of comparative midterm and long-term studies, and the level of evidence to support the use of new ACL repair techniques is still low.

The aim of the present study was to assess instrumented knee joint laxity and PROs at 5 years after ACL repair in comparison with primary ACL reconstruction for acute isolated ACL tears. It was hypothesized that ACL repair with DIS would lead to instrumented knee joint laxity and PROs that are comparable with ACL reconstruction, with comparable rates of recurrent instability and revision surgery.

### Long-term prognosis of patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) in young, elite volleyball players: tendon changes 11 years after baseline [^113FAt2s]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of jumper's knee is high in sports characterized by high demands on leg extensor speed and power, such as volleyball, basketball, football, and track and field sports. Elite jumping athletes are the most susceptible, with a point prevalence of jumper's knee as high as 40% to 50% among high-level volleyball players. Knee pain from jumper's knee can severely limit or even end an athletic career. The mean duration of symptoms among current elite athletes is as high as 32 to 76 months, which means that jumper's knee can be a recalcitrant condition.

Unfortunately, the long-term prognosis for young athletes developing jumper's knee is unknown. Sports medicine clinicians working with young elite jumping athletes are therefore unable to answer the questions often asked by athletes and their parents: Is this a serious injury? If I keep playing, will I have knee problems later in life? Even after I one day quit sport? Currently, the longest follow-up reported in 2 recent systematic reviews on treatment outcomes was 4.3 years. The exception is Kettunen et aland their case-control study in which they followed 18 athletes with jumper's knee (3 went on to surgery) and 16 control athletes for 15 years, reporting that symptoms remained after the athletic career was over and that their knee problem caused more than half of those with jumper's knee group to retire from competitive sports.

In many athletes with symptoms of jumper's knee, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the painful tendons will reveal morphological abnormalities, typically localized tendon thickening with hypoechoic areas and increased vascularity. However, as early as 1996, cross-sectional ultrasound studies by Khan et aland Lian et alrevealed that not only were there symptomatic tendons with normal tendon morphology but also asymptomatic tendons with tendon thickening and hypoechoic areas. These findings have been reproduced in subsequent cross-sectional studies. However, follow-up studies to identify changes in tendon structure, such as that by Fredberg and Bolvig, have typically only followed athletes for 1 season. They found that one-third of the abnormal tendons in asymptomatic elite soccer players normalized during the season, while 8% of the normal tendons become abnormal.
