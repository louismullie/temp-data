## Question

High testosterone level in 40 year old female

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a high testosterone level in a 40-year-old woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming that the testosterone elevation is real and measured correctly. Then, I should verify menopausal status and clinical severity because the pre- versus postmenopausal state and virilizing features change the differential and urgency. Next, I will build a prioritized differential and outline the initial laboratory workup. After that, I need to check the imaging strategy and how to interpret negative studies. Finally, I will consider functional testing to localize the source, discuss management options including medical therapy and surgery, and summarize follow-up and prognosis, while constantly checking that each step aligns with guideline thresholds and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical finding, because assay error is common in this range and misclassification leads to unnecessary procedures. I need to ensure the testosterone was measured by LC–MS/MS, the gold standard, and that SHBG was measured to allow calculation of the free androgen index; total testosterone above about 5.1 nmol/L (roughly 150 ng/dL) is a red flag for a tumor and should prompt urgent evaluation, whereas levels in the 2–3 nmol/L range are more compatible with PCOS or hyperthecosis and allow a measured workup, and I should double-check units and the lab's reference intervals before proceeding [^114uKr7g] [^116CRTP1].

> Hold on, I should verify menopausal status because it changes pretest probabilities. At age 40, many women are still cycling, so I need to ask about cycle regularity and timing, and if uncertain, obtain FSH and LH; elevated gonadotropins with low estradiol support menopause, while regular cycles indicate premenopausal physiology, and that distinction will guide how aggressively I pursue tumors versus functional causes and how I interpret ovarian imaging [^notfound].

> Next, I should review clinical severity and tempo of symptoms to estimate risk. Let me think about the classic red flags: clitoromegaly, voice deepening, rapid-onset or rapidly progressive hirsutism, and temporal hair loss or androgenic alopecia, because these features raise the likelihood of an androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumor and warrant expedited imaging and surgical planning; in contrast, gradual, longstanding hirsutism and acne are more consistent with PCOS, though I must not anchor prematurely on that diagnosis [^114uKr7g] [^112YxnCf].

> Now I will build a prioritized differential. The most concerning causes at any age are androgen-secreting ovarian tumors, such as Sertoli–Leydig or steroid cell tumors, and androgen-secreting adrenal tumors, including adenomas and carcinomas; I should also consider ovarian hyperthecosis, PCOS, and, less commonly, nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia or exogenous androgen exposure, and I need to remember that even benign-appearing ovarian masses can occasionally secrete androgens, so I must keep a high index of suspicion when symptoms are severe or progressive [^112YxnCf] [^111LgbHZ] [^115SFJro].

> Wait, let me verify the biochemical threshold again before labeling this high risk. Using LC–MS/MS, a total testosterone ≥ 5.1 nmol/L has about 90% sensitivity and 81% specificity for an androgen-producing tumor; I should confirm that this is the assay used, and if only an immunoassay was done, I should repeat with LC–MS/MS before making a tumor call, because immunoassays cross-react and overestimate in the female range [^114uKr7g] [^116CRTP1].

> I will now examine the initial laboratory panel. I need total testosterone, SHBG, and calculated free testosterone or FAI, plus DHEAS as an adrenal marker, androstenedione to detect PCOS patterns, and morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone to screen for nonclassical CAH; if Cushingoid features are present, I should add cortisol and ACTH, and I will reserve inhibin B and AMH if I suspect an ovarian sex cord–stromal tumor or need to refine the differential after imaging, making sure all steroid hormones are measured with high-specificity methods whenever possible [^114uKr7g] [^114qx1Qk].

> Let me consider imaging strategy, and I should not jump to conclusions if the first scan is negative. Transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line test for suspected ovarian pathology, but small tumors can be missed, so if testosterone is markedly elevated and ultrasound is unrevealing, I should proceed to MRI of the ovaries; for adrenal sources, a contrast-enhanced CT of the adrenals is preferred to define size and characteristics, keeping in mind that adrenal carcinomas are often large and heterogeneous, while small lipid-rich adenomas are typically benign and nonfunctional, and that a unilateral adrenal mass > 4 cm with virilization raises concern for carcinoma and warrants oncologic evaluation [^116CRTP1] [^115SFJro].

> But wait, what if imaging is negative and the biochemical picture still screams ovarian or adrenal hyperandrogenism. In that scenario, I should review functional localization tests, starting with a GnRH agonist suppression test; suppression of testosterone by more than 50% at 28 days supports a gonadotropin-dependent ovarian source such as hyperthecosis, whereas lack of suppression makes an adrenal tumor or an autonomous ovarian tumor more likely, and I need to remember that although rare, some adrenal or even ovarian tumors can be gonadotropin responsive, so a positive suppression test is supportive but not absolutely specific for benign disease [^114bLpV4] [^113nK14u].

> If localization remains uncertain after imaging and functional testing, I should double-check whether selective venous sampling is indicated. Combined adrenal and ovarian vein catheterization can demonstrate lateralizing gradients of androgens to localize occult sources when noninvasive studies are equivocal, but it is technically challenging and carries risks, so I should reserve it for experienced centers and for cases where the result will change surgical management [^117GQC2F] [^113dGCWT].

> For management, let me first confirm that urgent surgical resection is indicated when testosterone is clearly in the tumor range, typically ≥ 5.1 nmol/L, or when there are virilizing features, especially if imaging reveals a unilateral ovarian or adrenal mass; bilateral oophorectomy is the definitive therapy for ovarian hyperthecosis or tumor, and adrenalectomy is indicated for adrenal tumors, with the expectation that testosterone can normalize within weeks after removal of the source, though some signs like clitoromegaly or voice deepening may persist [^114uKr7g] [^1147fzEB].

> If testosterone is elevated but below the tumor threshold and symptoms are mild to moderate, I should consider medical therapy while continuing evaluation. Spironolactone 100 mg daily is a reasonable first-line antiandrogen for hirsutism, finasteride can be added for additional effect, and metformin is appropriate if PCOS or insulin resistance is present; I need to ensure contraception if using teratogenic agents and counsel on slow onset of benefit over months due to the hair cycle, adjusting therapy based on clinical response and repeat androgens [^112WKwR3] [^116CRTP1].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of GnRH agonists in perimenopausal or menopausal women with suspected ovarian hyperandrogenism who are poor surgical candidates or decline surgery. Short-course GnRH agonist can suppress gonadotropins and androgens, and if testosterone drops by more than 50%, that supports a gonadotropin-dependent ovarian source; some patients experience sustained remission after a short course, but I need to monitor bone health and menopausal symptoms with long-term therapy and individualize decisions given variable responses and potential side effects [^114bLpV4] [^117RKzCj].

> I need to ensure we address metabolic health because androgen excess, particularly in PCOS or hyperthecosis, correlates with insulin resistance and cardiometabolic risk. I should screen for dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, and blood pressure, and initiate lifestyle and pharmacologic management as indicated, recognizing that reducing androgen burden can modestly improve metabolic parameters but that comprehensive risk reduction is essential [^112YxnCf] [^116CRTP1].

> Next, I should review prognosis and counseling. If a tumor is resected, testosterone typically normalizes within weeks and hirsutism and acne improve over months, though clitoromegaly and voice changes often persist; if hyperthecosis is treated surgically, remission is durable, and if medical therapy is used, I should set expectations for gradual improvement and schedule follow-up every 3–6 months with repeat testosterone and clinical scoring to titrate therapy and surveil for progression [^1147fzEB] [^114uKr7g].

> To summarize my decision flow, I should confirm the assay and the true elevation, assess menopausal status and clinical severity, obtain a targeted androgen panel, image ovaries and adrenals based on risk, consider GnRH suppression or venous sampling if localization is uncertain, treat surgically when tumor-level testosterone or virilization is present, and use medical therapy for milder cases while monitoring metabolic health and symptoms over time, ensuring that each step is justified by current guideline thresholds and the patient's goals and comorbidities [^114uKr7g] [^116CRTP1] [^112YxnCf].

High testosterone in a 40-year-old woman is abnormal and most often due to **PCOS** [^111y2xSG], but **androgen-secreting tumors** [^112YxnCf] and ovarian hyperthecosis [^116CRTP1] must be excluded, especially with testosterone > 5 nmol/L or virilization [^114uKr7g]. Use **LC-MS/MS** [^114TpmrL] for accurate testosterone and assess hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and virilization [^112BdEua]. If testosterone is > 5 nmol/L or virilization is present, **urgent imaging** [^114uKr7g] (TVUS for ovaries, CT/MRI for adrenals) is required. Management is cause-specific: treat PCOS with lifestyle, OCPs, and anti-androgens [^1175qogk]; surgical removal for tumors or hyperthecosis [^1147fzEB]; and address metabolic risks [^1175qogk].

## Normal testosterone levels in women

Normal total testosterone in reproductive-age women is 0.3–1.8 nmol/L (10–55 ng/dL) [^113DtnGN] by LC-MS/MS [^114uKr7g]; **levels > 5 nmol/L strongly suggest an androgen-secreting tumor** [^114uKr7g] [^116CRTP1].

---

## Clinical presentation of high testosterone in women

Hyperandrogenism presents with:

- **Hirsutism**: Excess terminal hair in androgen-dependent areas [^112pGwDe].
- **Acne**: Often moderate to severe and refractory [^notfound].
- **Androgenic alopecia**: Female pattern hair loss [^114uKr7g].
- **Virilization**: Clitoromegaly, deepening voice, increased muscle mass, breast atrophy [^114eb26M].

## Causes of high testosterone in women

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Ovarian | Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) | Most common; chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries [^111y2xSG] |
| Ovarian | Ovarian hyperthecosis | Postmenopausal; luteinized theca cells produce excess testosterone [^115A5KDW] |
| Ovarian | Androgen-secreting tumors | Sertoli-Leydig, Leydig cell, or steroid cell tumors [^notfound] |
| Adrenal | Androgen-secreting adrenal tumors | Adenomas or carcinomas causing virilization [^115SFJro] |
| Adrenal | Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) | Enzyme defects (e.g. 21-hydroxylase) causing androgen excess [^113ihyb4] |
| Exogenous | Exogenous androgens | Anabolic steroids, testosterone supplements [^115PmV5m] |

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Document the onset, progression, and severity of **hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and virilization** [^112pGwDe], and perform a **modified Ferriman-Gallwey score** [^112BdEua] to standardize hirsutism severity.

---

### Biochemical evaluation

- **Total testosterone**: LC-MS/MS preferred [^114TpmrL]; > 5 nmol/L suggests tumor [^114uKr7g].
- **Free testosterone**: More sensitive for bioactive androgen excess [^114TpmrL].
- **DHEAS**: Elevated in adrenal causes [^115SFJro].
- **17-hydroxyprogesterone**: Screen for CAH [^113ihyb4].
- **LH/FSH**: May be elevated in PCOS [^111y2xSG].

---

### Imaging studies

Transvaginal ultrasound is the **first-line modality for ovarian lesions** [^notfound]; **CT/MRI** are used for adrenal masses or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^115SFJro].

---

## Management strategies

### Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

- **Lifestyle**: Weight loss, diet, exercise [^1175qogk].
- **Oral contraceptives**: Suppress ovarian androgens, increase SHBG [^111qWcA6].
- **Anti-androgens**: Spironolactone, finasteride, flutamide for hirsutism/acne [^112WKwR3].
- **Metformin**: For insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome [^1175qogk].

---

### Ovarian hyperthecosis

Bilateral oophorectomy is **definitive** [^1147fzEB]; a **GnRH agonist** is an option for those declining surgery or at high surgical risk [^117RKzCj].

---

### Androgen-secreting tumors

Surgical removal is the **definitive treatment** for both ovarian and adrenal tumors [^1147fzEB].

---

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)

Glucocorticoids suppress adrenal androgens, and **genetic counseling** is recommended for patients and families [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated hyperandrogenism can cause **metabolic syndrome** — insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes [^114mAMxF] — as well as **cardiovascular disease** with increased cardiovascular risk [^113EYgX3]. Psychological effects include anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause and treatment: **PCOS** has a good prognosis with lifestyle and medical therapy [^114NTN9g], whereas **tumors** have an excellent prognosis with surgical removal [^1147fzEB]. Persistent symptoms may occur in hyperthecosis or idiopathic cases [^1147fzEB].

Evidence of clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess poses a unique differential in postmenopausal women. Some signs and symptoms of postmenopausal hyperandrogenism can be normal and attributed to the natural aging process. However, the causes of androgen excess in this group include both nontumorous and tumorous causes. Treatment of androgen excess may improve both quality of life and long-term metabolic outcomes.

Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism is a condition caused by relative or absolute androgen excess originating from the ovaries and/or the adrenal glands. Hirsutism, in other words, increased terminal hair growth in androgen-dependent areas of the body, is considered the most effective measure of hyperandrogenism in women. Other symptoms can be acne and androgenic alopecia or the development of virilization, including clitoromegaly. Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism may also be associated with metabolic disorders such as abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Mild hyperandrogenic symptoms can be due to relative androgen excess associated with menopausal transition or polycystic ovary syndrome, which is likely the most common cause of postmenopausal hyperandrogenism. Virilizing symptoms, on the other hand, can be caused by ovarian hyperthecosis or an androgen-producing ovarian or adrenal tumor that could be malignant. Determination of serum testosterone, preferably by tandem mass spectrometry, is the first step in the endocrine evaluation, providing important information on the degree of androgen excess. Testosterone > 5 nmol/L is associated with virilization and requires prompt investigation to rule out an androgen-producing tumor in the first instance. To localize the source of androgen excess, imaging techniques are used, such as transvaginal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the ovaries and computed tomography and MRI for the adrenals. Bilateral oophorectomy or surgical removal of an adrenal tumor is the main curative treatment and will ultimately lead to a histopathological diagnosis. Mild to moderate symptoms of androgen excess are treated with antiandrogen therapy or specific endocrine therapy depending on diagnosis. This review summarizes the most relevant causes of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women and suggests principles for clinical investigation and treatment.

Treatment

Treatment strategies depend on the cause, symptoms, and distress of androgen excess (Fig. 3). Patients with severe symptoms and testosterone > 5 nmol/L should be managed urgently, especially those with suspected malignancy. A postmenopausal woman with virilizing symptoms and indication of an ovarian source of androgen excess (ovarian tumor, ovarian hyperthecosis) is primarily treated with surgery, in other words, laparoscopic bilateral oophorectomy, with or without hysterectomy. As in the patient case presented, testosterone levels will normalize rapidly within a couple of weeks after surgery while symptoms of androgen excess, including hirsutism and oily skin and acne, will gradually resolve. Although swelling of the clitoris may regress, clitoral hypertrophy usually persists. The same applies to androgenic alopecia; severe hair loss usually remains even after normalized testosterone levels. Deepening of the voice caused by androgen excess is also a symptom that does not regress after treatment. It is therefore important to diagnose at an early stage for prompt management of potentially severe causes of hyperandrogenism, although androgen-producing ovarian tumors are seldom malignant, and to avoid persistent symptoms despite elimination of androgen excess. Metabolic symptoms may improve to some extent but usually do not disappear.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^114eb26M]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

It was recently demonstrated that the androgen derivates 11-ketotestosterone and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone from the adrenal glands are also potent agonists of the human androgen receptor. In contrast to classical androgens (DHEA, DHEAS, A4, and testosterone), 11-keto androgens do not decrease with age. Furthermore, these androgens have shown to be predominant in several disorders of hyperandrogenism, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). However, determination of 11-keto androgens is not yet available as a clinical routine method.

SHBG, a protein secreted by the liver, regulates the bioavailability of testosterone. Around 65% to 70% of circulating testosterone is bound and inactivated by SHBG, 30% to 35% is loosely bound to albumin, and only 0.5% to 3% represents freely circulating testosterone. Since the binding of testosterone to albumin is rather weak, the free and albumin-bound fractions are defined as bioavailable testosterone. The ratio of total testosterone to SHBG multiplied by 100 (the free androgen index) is used as a measure of circulating free testosterone. However, this measure is less relevant when total testosterone is pathologically increased.

During menopausal transition, ovarian theca cell production of testosterone decreases due to follicle depletion, but this loss is compensated by increased LH stimulation of stroma cell production of testosterone. Consequently, ovarian androgen production does not change significantly in relation to menopause. At the same time, SHBG decreases due to the decrease in ovarian estrogen production, and subsequently the free androgen index increases. Overall, this will result in a physiological shift from estrogen dominance to a relative predominance of androgens during menopausal transition. Besides the typical menopausal symptoms, it is not uncommon for healthy postmenopausal women to experience androgen-dependent symptoms, such as increased facial hair growth and hair thinning due to relative androgen excess.

The most common cause of absolute androgen excess in postmenopausal women is PCOS, causing mild to moderate symptoms of hyperandrogenism, whereas virilizing symptoms including, for instance, clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, and breast atrophy besides severe hirsutism and possibly androgenic alopecia (Table 2) are rare and should be carefully investigated. The most relevant causes of hyperandrogenism, of either ovarian or adrenal origin, in postmenopausal women are described below (Table 3).

Androgen-Secreting Adrenal Tumors

Androgen-secreting adrenal tumors are less common than the corresponding ovarian tumors. Benign adrenal adenomas include nonsecretory (incidentalomas) and secretory adenomas, of which the latter can cause hyperandrogenism. Adrenocortical carcinomas, on the other hand, are usually highly malignant tumors, and approximately 25% of cases are associated with severe symptoms of hyperandrogenism leading to virilization (Table 3). The incidence is 1 to 2 cases/million population per year. There is a bimodal age distribution, with peaks before the age of 5 and in the fourth and fifth decade of life.

Adrenocortical carcinomas are considered gonadotropin independent and are manifested by an increase in adrenal androgens, DHEA, and DHEAS. DHEAS concentrations are often more than twice the upper limit, and a value above 19 µmol/L is an indication for further evaluation. Furthermore, testosterone is highly elevated in the male range, as is A4. Cortisol secretion may be increased both in androgen-secreting adenomas and carcinomas, leading to a clinical image of Cushing syndrome in addition to hyperandrogenism.

Adrenal tumors are best visualized by computed tomography (CT) as a unilateral mass. Adenomas are usually small, 2 to 2.5 cm, whereas adrenocortical carcinomas are larger, between 4 and 21 cm.

### Causes, patterns, and severity of androgen excess in 1205 consecutively recruited women [^115fPuoY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of a large consecutive cohort of women undergoing serum androgen measurement for suspected androgen excess, providing unique insights into the diagnostic utility of combined measurement of serum DHEAS, A4, and T concentrations. Thereby, our findings may help to rationalize the need for further investigations such as imaging or functional testing with dexamethasone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone superagonists for adrenal and ovarian androgen suppression, respectively. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering patient age and the severity of biochemical disturbances as predictors of underlying non-PCOS pathology. In premenopausal women, severe androgen excess should significantly increase the clinical suspicion of non-PCOS pathology, whereas after the age of 50, even intermediate androgen excess should prompt further investigations.

Evaluation

Clinical Symptoms

The patient's history of onset and development of symptoms should always be a guide for further investigation. Late onset and rapid development of virilizing symptoms suggest a hormone-producing tumor, whereas slow development of virilizing symptoms in a perimenopausal or postmenopausal woman is typical of ovarian hyperthecosis. In contrast, early symptom onset and slow progression of mild to moderate hyperandrogenic symptoms are more consistent with PCOS or another endocrine disorder (Fig. 3).

Figure 3.
Algorithm for principles of investigation and treatment of different causes of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women. The cut-off of 5 nmol/L for serum testosterone is based on LC–MS/MS measurement. ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; CT, computed tomography; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; 17-OHP, 17-hydroxyprogesterone; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NC CAH, nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome.

Clinical signs of mild to virilizing symptoms of hyperandrogenism are shown in Table 2. Hirsutism has been considered the most effective measure of androgen excess in women. It is defined as excessive facial and body terminal hair in androgen-dependent body areas. Evaluation of hirsutism can be assessed by the modified Ferriman–Gallwey score, 0 (no terminal hair) to 4 (marked hirsutism), in 9 body areas: upper lip, chin and cheeks, upper chest, upper abdomen, lower abdomen, upper arms, thighs, upper back, and lower back (Table 4). A cut-off score of ≥ 4 to 6 on the modified Ferriman–Gallwey was suggested to indicate hirsutism, depending on ethnicity. However, this method has not been validated in postmenopausal women.

Etiology of Hyperandrogenism in Postmenopausal Women

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome

PCOS is considered the most frequent endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age with a prevalence between 8% and 13% depending on diagnostic criteria and population studied. According to the Rotterdam criteria, at least 2 of the following 3 criteria are required for a diagnosis: oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism and acne; and polycystic ovarian morphology. There are no specific criteria to diagnose PCOS after menopause. The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline has therefore suggested that a diagnosis of PCOS in a postmenopausal woman can be based upon a history of oligo/amenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years.

The reproductive phenotype of PCOS usually improves by age due to loss of ovarian follicles, leading to more regular cycles and decreased ovarian volume. However, the decrease in ovarian volume and serum AMH during menopausal transition may be relatively less in women with PCOS than in other women. Consequently, the average age of menopause is approximately 2 years later in PCOS than in healthy controls. As androgen levels gradually decrease by age, symptoms of hyperandrogenism like hirsutism may improve in women with PCOS. Still, the prevalence of hirsutism was significantly higher in postmenopausal women with PCOS than in control women (33% vs 4%) at mean age 81 years in a Swedish long-term follow-up study.

PCOS is considered a relatively mild form of hyperandrogenism since circulating levels of testosterone usually are within the upper normal female range, whereas SHBG is low, resulting in increased levels of free and bioavailable testosterone. Today, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) is recognized as the gold standard method for testosterone determination in serum compared with immunobased clinical methods, which are burdened with cross-reactivity against structurally similar steroid hormones and, moreover, are not sensitive enough for the determination of steroids at relatively low concentrations. Available measurements based on LC–MS/MS indicate that the normal range of testosterone in premenopausal women is 0.1 to 1.8 nmol/L, whereas the upper limit in women with PCOS is 3.1 nmol/L (95% CI one-sided). Although testosterone levels decline with increasing age, most studies have shown higher testosterone levels in postmenopausal women with PCOS than in control women. However, testosterone levels in postmenopausal women with PCOS seldom exceed 2 nmol/L.

### Management of postmenopausal virilization [^111vb4Wj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Mild clinical signs of hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism may appear during the menopausal transition as part of the normal aging process, but the development of frank virilization suggests a specific source of androgen excess, including androgen-secreting tumors.

Patient and Methods

A 68-yr-old postmenopausal woman was referred because of a history of progressive development of hirsutism and frontal balding for the previous 8 yr, together with moderate hyperandrogenemia. Initial imaging procedures depicted a 2-cm solid nodule in the right adrenal gland and normal appearance of both ovaries. To confirm the source of androgen excess, we conducted simultaneous selective venous sampling of adrenals and ovaries. Sampling was consistent with an ovarian source. After bilateral laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral ovarian hyperthecosis. Three weeks after surgery, her androgen levels had decreased to the normal female range.

Conclusion

Diagnosis of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women is challenging. Postmenopausal virilization may be associated with adrenal or ovarian androgen-secreting tumors or with benign conditions. A detailed clinical history is critical to differentiate the progressive development of virilization that characterizes benign causes from the rapid progression that characterizes malignant tumors. Imaging techniques do not always reveal the cause of hyperandrogenism and may even be misleading. Although technically difficult, combined adrenal and ovarian venous sampling may be required to confirm the source of androgen excess before the best surgical approach is determined.

### Hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges [^113nK14u]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a postmenopausal woman with severe hyperandrogenism who responded dramatically to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist.

Methods

Detailed clinical and laboratory findings are presented, and the pertinent literature is reviewed.

Results

A 53-year-old postmenopausal woman with end-stage renal disease, who had undergone kidney transplantation, was referred because of high serum testosterone levels. She presented with worsening acne and hirsutism for the previous 2 years. Her medications included prednisone (7.5 mg every other day). On examination, mild facial acne and hirsutism but no virilizing features were noted. Laboratory results showed generous postmenopausal gonadotropin levels and markedly elevated total and free testosterone levels, which failed to suppress with a 2-day low-dose dexamethasone test. Transvaginal ultrasonography and a computed tomographic scan failed to identify an ovarian or adrenal abnormality. Administration of a GnRH agonist (Depo-Lupron) resulted in a dramatic decline in follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone levels after 1 month, which persisted during the course of 11 months of therapy. The source of marked hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women represents a diagnostic challenge. The absence of a tumor on diagnostic imaging and the inability to perform catheterization studies confound the problem. Androgen levels did not suppress with glucocorticoids. We reasoned that a clear response to a GnRH agonist would indicate a nontumorous ovarian source of hyperandrogenism. Regrettably, the literature has described cases of ovarian tumors and, rarely, adrenal adenomas that are responsive to gonadotropins.

Conclusion

The striking improvement in a postmenopausal woman with severe hyperandrogenism by means of GnRH agonist therapy demonstrates its potential use in poor surgical candidates without necessarily delineating the source of androgen excess.

### Causes, patterns, and severity of androgen excess in 1205 consecutively recruited women [^115yepbR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical or biochemical features of androgen excess are observed in up to 10% of women of reproductive age. Androgen excess manifests clinically with hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, acne, ovulatory dysfunction and, if extreme and prolonged, can lead to overt and severe masculinization. Recent data have also highlighted the lifelong adverse metabolic consequences of chronic androgen excess in women. The overwhelming majority of women presenting with androgen excess have an underlying diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, complex ovarian, adrenal, and pituitary disorders, including neoplasia, must be excluded, particularly in women with more severe androgen excess and relatively rapid onset of symptoms. Detailed clinical history, including acuity of symptom onset, physical examination, biochemical phenotyping, and, where appropriate, radiological investigations are critical in the investigation of those women deemed more likely to harbor more sinister underlying pathology. However, there is a distinct lack of data delineating severity and patterns of androgen excess considered predictive of non-PCOS–related disease.

Testosterone (T) and the even more potent 5 α -dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are biologically active androgens derived from the androgen precursors dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (A4). In women, DHEA, its sulfate ester DHEAS, and its downstream product A4 are produced in large quantities by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex and activated to potent androgens in the ovaries but importantly also in peripheral target tissues of androgen action, such as adipose tissue. Primary adrenal insufficiency is associated with severe deficiency, not only of DHEA and A4 but also of active androgens. Although T can be produced in the adrenal cortex and peripheral tissues, the ovaries are a key contributor to T synthesis, with oophorectomy leading to a major drop in circulating T. Therefore, serum T is traditionally regarded as a biomarker of ovarian androgen production. Conversely, DHEAS is thought to be a marker of adrenal androgen secretion, whereas there is ongoing debate on whether ovary or adrenals are the major source of A4.

Values and preferences for testing for hyperandrogenemia: The suggestion for testing for hyperandrogenemia in all women with hirsutism places a relatively high value on identifying treatable underlying hyperandrogenic diseases, whereas the suggestion for not testing in patients with normal variant unwanted hair for whom hormonal treatment is not contemplated places a relatively high value on avoiding false positives and resulting increases in medical tests and procedures; it places a relatively low value on early detection of mild hyperandrogenemia that will not affect initial management and outcome.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NTN9g]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

Table 2.
Summary of Previously Published Studies That Aimed to Define the Frequency of Disorders Observed in Women Who Had Serum Androgens Measured for Clinically Suspected Androgen Excess

Our study has included all patients in whom serum androgen measurements were requested by any endocrinologist across a large secondary/tertiary care specialist service during a 5-year period. This included patients presenting with clinical features of hyperandrogenism, but also patients assessed for suspected or confirmed endocrine conditions that may be associated with androgen excess, such as adrenal masses or Cushing syndrome, resulting in higher complexity and diversity of the underlying diagnostic spectrum. This recruitment pattern will have contributed to a substantial number of cases with non-PCOS–related causes of androgen excess in our cohort, but may also have resulted in a relevant proportion of postmenopausal women. Our recruitment was very much reflective of the ethnic makeup of the larger region we recruited from, comprising ∼10% of the United Kingdom population. The only exception was a lower than expected number of South Asian women in the postmenopausal age group, potentially indicative of difficulties in accessing health care in this group of older women who often are non-English speaking.

Unsurprisingly, PCOS was the most prevalent cause of androgen excess in the premenopausal cohort and in one-third of postmenopausal women in our study. Although the measurement of serum T is traditionally regarded as a sensible first-line biomarker of circulating androgen burden in women, our data support that simultaneous measurement of DHEAS and A4 alongside T increases the sensitivity for detection of PCOS-related androgen excess. Employing concurrent measurement of DHEAS, A4, and T, our study demonstrated that only 49% of premenopausal and 27% of postmenopausal women with PCOS would have been detected by isolated measurement of serum T, currently recommended as the single diagnostic androgen marker for the diagnosis of PCOS. Our findings corroborate previous reports from our group and subsequently others that A4 is a more sensitive marker of PCOS-related androgen excess than serum T, which has been recognized in the recent European position statement on PCOS. Increased serum DHEAS concentrations were the most prevalent finding in the premenopausal women with PCOS in our study, further highlighting the well-reported significance of serum DHEAS as a major marker of PCOS. In our postmenopausal PCOS cases, serum A4 was the primary androgen marker of PCOS. This shift in androgen excess pattern at menopause may be reflective of the age-related decline in adrenal DHEAS production, the so-called adrenopause, which occurs alongside the menopausal transition.

Figure 2.
Clinical signs of severe hyperandrogenism and virilizing symptoms of hyperandrogenism in a perimenopausal and postmenopausal women including (A) androgenic alopecia, (B) breast atrophy and hirsutism, and (C) clitoromegaly.

Ovarian hyperthecosis is caused by nests of luteinized theca cells in the ovarian stroma producing high amounts of testosterone in the absence of other elevated androgens. Serum testosterone is usually increased above 5 nmol/L, which distinguishes this condition from PCOS (Table 3). The etiology of ovarian hyperthecosis is not known, although a genetic disposition and association with PCOS have been suggested. Several mechanisms behind the increased testosterone production have been proposed. One is related to the "2-cell hypothesis" where ovarian testosterone production by theca cells is uncovered in a postmenopausal woman by the loss of granulosa cell–mediated aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. Another mechanism involves increased gonadotrophin stimulation by elevated levels of LH after menopause. Thirdly, there is support that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may induce stromal luteinization causing androgen overproduction.

The most important differential diagnosis for ovarian hyperthecosis is an androgen-producing tumor, which can be malignant. In both cases, the patient has virilizing symptoms, but progress is usually slow for ovarian hyperthecosis but rapid for an androgen-producing tumor. In addition, testosterone is greatly elevated (> 5 nmol/L) in both disorders, but mostly higher in women with an androgen-producing tumor than in those with ovarian hyperthecosis. Furthermore, other androgens are usually not elevated in ovarian hyperthecosis, whereas androgen-producing adrenal tumors are associated with high levels of DHEAS and A4, and ovarian tumors with high levels of inhibin B. Almost all women with ovarian hyperthecosis have obesity and insulin resistance, but this is not the case of women with an androgen-producing tumor. Ovarian hyperthecosis is also characterized by bilateral increase in ovarian stroma, whereas an ovarian tumor usually presents as a unilateral enlargement. Still, it can be difficult to distinguish ovarian hyperthecosis from an androgen-producing tumor. The diagnosis of ovarian hyperthecosis is therefore confirmed by histopathology.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^114qx1Qk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Women with virilizing symptoms

Testosterone levels tend to be higher (in the lower male range) and gonadotropin levels lower in association with a virilizing ovarian tumor than in ovarian hyperthecosis; however, no cut-off value of testosterone has been proposed for discriminating between a hormone-producing tumor and ovarian hyperthecosis. The next step is therefore to proceed with diagnostic imaging (Fig. 3), see below. Further endocrine evaluation may still be helpful for distinguishing between tumorous and nontumorous causes of virilizing symptoms.

Ovarian hyperthecosis is typically associated with an isolated increase in testosterone, while other androgens usually are within the reference values, see the patient case above. Furthermore, insulin resistance is characteristic for ovarian hyperthecosis, and therefore fasting insulin and glucose for calculating the Homeostatic Model Assessment or HbA1c should be considered. In the case of hormone-producing ovarian tumors, hormones other than testosterone may also be elevated, including inhibin B, AMH, A4, 17-OHP, and estradiol, whereas DHEAS and cortisol are normal. In contrast, androgen-producing adrenal tumors are associated with increased DHEAS levels, often higher than twice the upper normal limit (> 19 µmol/L), together with increases in testosterone, A4, and cortisol.

The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist test can be used for distinguishing androgen-producing ovarian and adrenal tumors and successfully confirm an ovarian source from an adrenal source by suppression of testosterone. However, the test cannot differentiate between ovarian hyperthecosis and an ovarian tumor, as both disorders are gonadotropin dependent and will respond to GnRH with testosterone inhibition.

Selective ovarian and adrenal venous catheterization can localize an androgen-producing tumor by demonstrating differential gradients in androgen levels between ovarian, adrenal, and peripheral veins. However, success rates are poor, and this invasive method carries potential risks. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that there is limited evidence for the use of selective venous sampling in identifying androgen-producing tumors in postmenopausal women.

### Improvement in scalp hair growth in androgen-deficient women treated with testosterone: a questionnaire study [^116G8x5N]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

We suggest, therefore, that our results indicate that testosterone has a positive anabolic effect on hair growth, which is distinct from a possible DHT-dependent deleterious role. The hair follicle is certainly a site of vigorous protein synthesis – the average human scalp produces around 13 km of hair per year. Androgen production in women declines with age and does not vary with menopause. A woman aged 40 years has half the mean plasma total testosterone of a 21-year-old. Mean hair density and hair shaft diameter show a similar age-related distribution in the female populationand the fall in scalp hair density and hair shaft diameter, starting in the early to mid-thirties, parallels androgen levels much more closely than the common explanation relating female hair loss to postmenopausal oestrogen deficiency.

In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of androgens on scalp hair growth in women is complex. Loss of hair may occur in hyperandrogenic states, possibly due to similar genetically determined DHT-driven mechanisms as occur in male balding, although the only evidence of this in our study was the lack of improvement in hair thinning in women with high BMIs. However, androgen deficiency may also lead to thinning hair due to loss of a more general testosterone-dependent anabolic effect on hair growth. This observation needs to be confirmed but potentially opens the way for a new approach to the treatment of female hair loss.

### Hyperandrogenism of ovarian etiology: utilizing differential venous sampling for diagnosis [^117GQC2F]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We report the diagnosis and management of testosterone hypersecretion in the presence of an adrenal mass and no initially discernible ovarian mass.

Case

A 64-year-old woman with severe hyperandrogenism, including serum testosterone 392 ng/dL, male-pattern baldness, and hirsutism, required bilateral ovarian and adrenal venous sampling to determine the source of the testosterone. Once an ovarian origin was confirmed, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed for definitive treatment. The adrenal adenoma was left in situ. There was a dramatic decrease in subjective symptomatology and normalization of testosterone postoperatively.

Conclusion

Preoperative differential venous sampling determined the correct source of testosterone. Subsequent removal of the ovary and steroid cell tumor correctly treated the hyperandrogenism and avoided an unnecessary surgical procedure for the adrenal adenoma.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114Hox5Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Definition of terms — local and patient-important hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, idiopathic hirsutism, and hypertrichosis distinction: Local hair growth is unwanted localized hair growth in the absence of an abnormal hirsutism score, and patient-important hirsutism is unwanted sexual hair growth of any degree that causes sufficient distress for women to seek additional treatment. For this guideline, hyperandrogenism is defined as clinical features that result from increased androgen production and/or action, and idiopathic hirsutism is hirsutism without hyperandrogenemia or other signs or symptoms indicative of a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder. Hirsutism must be distinguished from hypertrichosis — generalized excessive hair growth that may be hereditary or medication related — which is distributed in a generalized, nonsexual pattern and is not caused by excess androgen.

### Evaluating hyperandrogenism: a challenge in acne management [^112zuwdt]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris may be a manifestation of hyperandrogenism. An appropriate, thorough history and physical exam will identify evidence of androgen excess. An understanding of normal androgen production and conditions of androgen excess is critical when evaluating for hyperandrogenism. Laboratory screening for hormonal abnormalities is imperative when clinical signs of hyperandrogenism are present.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^114uKr7g]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 4.
Investigation of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women

Acne is associated with increased androgen levels, although the predictive value of acne for hyperandrogenism has been questioned. Furthermore, there is no universally accepted classification tool for evaluation of acne. It is recommended to assess acne in a patient undergoing evaluation of hyperandrogenism (Table 3).

Androgenic alopecia, or female pattern hair loss, is characterized by thinning of hair in the frontoparietal region of the scalp (Fig. 2). The disorder is dependent on androgens, particularly DHT, and 5α reductase activity in hair follicles. Hair loss on the scalp can be assessed using the Ludwig scale (Table 4) (Fig. 1).

Clitoromegaly is probably the most recognizable sign of virilization (Fig. 2). It has been defined as > 1.5 × 2.5 cm. However, signs of clitoromegaly must be carefully investigated, as they are easy to miss, especially in an obese woman. Other signs of virilization may be breast atrophy and severe hirsutism (Fig. 2).

Endocrine Evaluation

Symptoms of hyperandrogenism and particularly virilizing symptoms (including, eg, clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, and breast atrophy besides severe hirsutism and possibly androgenic alopecia) in a postmenopausal woman should be evaluated by endocrine screening, preferably serum FSH, LH, testosterone, SHBG, A4, DHEAS, estradiol, 17-OHP, and inhibin B (Table 4). For steroid hormone determination, it is highly recommended to use LC–MS/MS instead of immunological methods as mentioned above. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the diagnostic threshold for serum testosterone as measured by LC–MS/MS to identify an androgen-producing tumor was defined as testosterone ≥ 5.1 nmol/L (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 81%). Serum testosterone > 5 nmol/L is clearly associated with virilizing symptoms (Table 2). It is therefore suggested to use this value of testosterone as the cut-off in the first step of investigation to rule out a hormone-producing tumor or a nontumor cause of severe hyperandrogenism such as ovarian hyperthecosis in a postmenopausal woman (Fig. 3).

### The case of the elusive androgen [^112cL3K3]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of androgen excess and discuss the important factors in diagnosis and management.

Methods

A case report is presented of a postmenopausal woman who had had severe hirsutism for 18 months. Her history, clinical and laboratory findings, treatment, and outcome are chronicled. The pertinent literature — especially that related to the differential diagnosis of hyperandrogenism — is also reviewed.

Results

A 62-year-old woman had progressive hirsutism of the face, back, and abdomen as well as alopecia of the scalp, for which spironolactone therapy had proved ineffective. Laboratory studies showed a testosterone level of 644 ng/dL. Preoperative evaluation pointed to an ovarian source of testosterone. After total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy, histologic examination of the ovaries showed bilateral hilar cell hyperplasia. Three months later, the serum testosterone level remained high (556 ng/dL), and repeated computed tomography of the abdomen disclosed a previously unseen 9-mm adenoma of the left adrenal gland, which was removed laparoscopically. Because of a persistently high testosterone value (546 ng/dL), the patient underwent dexamethasone suppression studies, followed by adrenal stimulation with corticotropin; no pathologic findings were demonstrated. Finally, gonadotropin suppression with nafarelin, 200 mg intranasally daily for 6 weeks, yielded a prompt and sustainable decrease in the testosterone level. This result was associated with dramatic clinical improvement.

Conclusion

It is speculated that the patient had residual testosterone-producing tissue originating from primitive mesenchymal cells from the urogenital ridge, which was responsive to gonadotropins, in an unidentified abdominal or pelvic site.

### Severe hyperandrogenism due to ovarian hyperthecosis in a young woman [^111zaJaV]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Hyperandrogenism is a relatively common clinical problem. However, severe hyperandrogenism causing virilisation is rare. A 27-year-old woman presented with generalised hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy and secondary amenorrhoea. She had serum testosterone levels elevated to the adult male range. Administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue resulted in > 50% suppression of serum testosterone which was suggestive of luteinising hormone-dependent ovarian hyperandrogenism. Imaging studies of abdomen and pelvis were normal, and ovarian venous sampling failed to show a gradient between the two sides. A presumptive diagnosis of ovarian hyperthecosis was, therefore, considered. Medical treatment with GnRH analogue and combined oral contraceptive pills was initiated to which an excellent clinical and biochemical response was noted. This case highlights a rare presentation of ovarian hyperthecosis in a young woman with severe hyperandrogenism mimicking a virilising neoplasm.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome-part 2 [^1175qogk]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Androgen Excess Society aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2014. Insulin resistance is believed to play an intrinsic role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The mechanism by which insulin resistance or insulin give rise to oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia, however, is unclear. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies have shown that both obese and lean women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is implicated in the ovulatory dysfunction of PCOS by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Given the association with insulin resistance, all women with PCOS require evaluation for the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the possible risk of clinical events, including acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Obese women with PCOS are at increased risk for MetS with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 31 to 35%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 7.5 to 10%). Rates of progression from normal glucose tolerance to IGT, and in turn to T2DM, may be as high as 5 to 15% within 3 years. Data suggest the need for baseline oral glucose tolerance test every 1 to 2 years based on family history of T2DM as well as body mass index (BMI) and yearly in women with IGT. Compared with BMI- and age-matched controls, young, lean PCOS women have lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) size, higher very-low-density lipoprotein particle number, higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number, and borderline lower LDL size. Statins have been shown to lower testosterone levels either alone or in combination with oral contraceptives (OCPs) but have not shown improvement in menses, spontaneous ovulation, hirsutism, or acne. Statins reduce total and LDL cholesterol but have no effect on HDL, C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in PCOS women, in contrast to the general population. There have been no long-term studies of statins on clinical cardiac outcomes in women with PCOS. Coronary calcification is more prevalent and more severe in PCOS than in controls. In women under 60 years of age undergoing coronary angiography, the presence of polycystic ovaries on sonography has been associated with more arterial segments with > 50% stenosis, but the relationship between PCOS and actual cardiovascular events remains unclear. Therapies for PCOS are varied in their effects and targets and include both nonpharmacologic as well as pharmacologic approaches. Weight loss is the primary therapy in PCOS — reduction in weight of as little as 5% can restore regular menses and improve response to ovulation- inducing and fertility medications. Metformin in premenopausal PCOS women has been associated with a reduction in features of MetS. Clamp studies using ethinyl estradiol/drosperinone combination failed to reveal evidence of an increase in either peripheral or hepatic insulin resistance. Subjects with PCOS have a 1.5-times higher baseline risk of venous thromboembolic disease and a 3.7-fold greater effect with OCP use compared with non-PCOS subjects. There is currently no genetic test to screen for or diagnose PCOS, and there is no test to assist in the choice of treatment strategies. Persistent bleeding should always be investigated for pregnancy and/or uterine pathology — including transvaginal ultrasound exam and endometrial biopsy — in women with PCOS. PCOS women can have difficulty conceiving. Those who become pregnant are at risk for gestational diabetes (which should be evaluated and managed appropriately) and the microvascular complications of diabetes. Assessment of a woman with PCOS for infertility involves evaluating for preconceptional issues that may affect response to therapy or lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and evaluating the couple for other common infertility issues that may affect the choice of therapy, such as a semen analysis. Women with PCOS have multiple factors that may lead to an elevated risk of pregnancy, including a high prevalence of IGT — a clear risk factor for gestational diabetes — and MetS with hypertension, which increases the risk for pre-eclampsia and placental abruption. Women should be screened and treated for hypertension and diabetes prior to attempting conception. Women should be counseled about weight loss prior to attempting conception, although there are limited clinical trial data demonstrating a benefit to this recommendation. Treatment for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility should begin with an oral agent such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor.

### 'What should I do with a 60-year old man with a slightly low serum total testosterone concentration and normal levels of serum gonadotrophins'? [^112kDkJD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The fundamental question in assessing an older man with a slightly low total testosterone and normal gonadotrophin levels is to determine whether or not he has clinical hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome complex, which comprises both symptoms as well as biochemical testosterone deficiency. As symptoms are nonspecific and there are no clear cut-off values for testosterone levels this invariably leads to a clinical dilemma. International guidelines have been published which provide recommendations to aid the clinician in making a diagnosis. Late-onset hypogonadism, the preferred terminology for age-related hypogonadism, can only be made once other causes have been excluded. Evidence shows that low testosterone levels are associated with several common male conditions including erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis and diabetes. Short-term studies have shown benefits of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on body composition, bone metabolism, insulin resistance, sexual function and quality of life. Recommendations give clear advice on safety monitoring, specifically in relation to prostate health. If a diagnosis of hypogonadism is made with borderline testosterone levels then a 3-month trial of TRT can be considered. The diagnosis of hypogonadism associated with borderline testosterone levels and the decision to treat should only be made by an experienced clinician.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^1162d14v]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% to 13% of women globally. It is a condition with metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features, with health impacts across the lifespan. The etiology of PCOS is complex, with an interplay of several factors, including genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life and adiposity-related dysfunction leading to hypothalamic-ovarian disturbance. Diagnosis is recommended based on the International PCOS Guideline criteria, with diagnosis confirmed in adults when 2 of out the following 3 criteria are met: (i) hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical); (ii) irregular cycles; and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. With its clinical heterogeneity, distinct phenotypes, variation across the lifespan and ethnic variation, PCOS diagnosis can present significant diagnostic challenges to clinicians.

### Are the endocrine society's clinical practice guidelines on androgen therapy in women misguided? A commentary [^113fjzko]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines on Androgen Therapy in Women (henceforth referred to as the Guidelines) do not necessarily represent the opinion held by the many health-care professionals and clinicians who are specialized in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of women's health in androgen insufficiency states. The recommendations provided in the published Guidelines are neither accurate nor complete. We disagree with the therapeutic nihilism promoted by these Guidelines. The members of the Guidelines Panel (henceforth referred to as the Panel), in their own disclaimer, stated that the Guidelines do not establish a standard of care. Based on data available in the contemporary literature, on the role of androgens in women's health, we provide in this commentary a point-by-point discussion of the arguments made by the Panel in arriving at their recommendations. It is our view that the Guidelines are not based on the preponderance of scientific evidence. Health-care professionals, physicians, and scientists often disagree when determining how best to address and manage new and emerging clinical issues. This is where we stand now as we endeavor to understand the role of androgens in a woman's health and welfare. Indeed, some basic facts are not in contention. All agree that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) production from the adrenal gland begins during the preteen years, peaks in the mid 20s, then declines progressively over time. In contrast, ovarian androgen (i.e., testosterone) secretion commences at puberty, is sustained during a woman's peak reproductive years and declines as a woman ages, with a more rapid and steep decrease after surgical menopause. However, there are ample data to suggest that adrenal androgens play a role in the development of axillary and pubic hair, and that testosterone is critical for women's libido and sexual function. We take this opportunity to invite members of the Panel on Androgen Therapy in Women to discuss, clarify, comment, or rebut any of the points made in this Commentary. It is our goal to elevate this debate in order to provide women who are afflicted with androgen insufficiency and sexual disorders with the highest quality health care and to relieve their distress and suffering, as well as to improve their quality of life.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113WLzMC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hirsutism — pretest probability and neoplasm red flags: The decision to test for androgen excess depends both on the pretest likelihood that an abnormal value may be found and upon whether a detected abnormality will determine the approach to treatment. Most women with local hair growth and regular menses who have no evidence to suggest an endocrine cause have a very low likelihood of excess androgen production, whereas patients with hirsutism or with clinical features suggesting an underlying endocrine disorder are more likely to have excess androgen production. A rapid pace of development or progression of hirsutism, progression in spite of therapy, or evidence of virilization points to a greater likelihood of an androgen-secreting neoplasm, although some tumors producing only moderately excessive androgen have indolent presentations.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^111GtxeD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Androgen excess is common in women and refers to clinical or biochemical evidence of elevated androgenic steroids such as testosterone. It is associated with underlying polycystic ovary syndrome in the majority of cases. However severe androgen excess is less common and may indicate the presence of underlying adrenal or ovarian neoplasms, genetic disorders or severe insulin resistance syndromes. Currently there are few consensus guidelines to assist clinicians with a standardised management approach to the patient with severe androgen excess.

Design

Clinical practice guideline.

Methods

This guideline has been developed with expertise from colleagues in endocrinology, gynaecology, clinical biochemistry and nursing, and furthermore provides a unique patient perspective to guide clinicians.

Results

The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to collate multi-disciplinary guidance for clinical practitioners in the investigation of severe androgen excess. Recommendations have been made in the areas of clinical assessment, biochemical work up, dynamic testing and imaging, informed where possible by the best available evidence.

Conclusion

This guideline will provide guidance for clinicians in their approach to patients with severe androgen excess.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111QEiwz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

2.1 Evidence

The major clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism include hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia. The history of skin problems should assess the age at onset, the rate of progression, previous long-term treatments (including anabolic agents), any change with treatment or with fluctuations in body weight, and the nature of the skin complaint relative to those of other family members. In rare instances, male pattern balding, increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, or clitoromegaly may occur, suggesting virilizing androgen levels and a possible underlying ovarian or adrenal neoplasm or severe insulin-resistant states (Table 4). Notably, in obese, insulin-resistant women with PCOS, acanthosis nigricans is often present, as are skin tags.

Hirsutism

The prevalence of hirsutism in the general population ranges from 5–15%, with relevant differences according to ethnicity and geographic location. In a large study of patients with clinical hyperandrogenism, 72.1% of 950 patients were diagnosed with PCOS. Therefore, PCOS represents the major cause of hirsutism, but the presence of hirsutism does not fully predict ovulatory dysfunction. Overall, hirsutism is present in approximately 65–75% of patients with PCOS (although lower in Asian populations). Hirsutism may predict the metabolic sequelae of PCOS or failure to conceive with infertility treatment. Hirsutism often tends to be more severe in abdominally obese patients. The most common method of visually assessing hirsutism is still the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — evaluation of markedly elevated androgens: If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, causes of hyperandrogenaemia other than PCOS, including ovarian and adrenal neoplastic growths, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, ovarian hyperthecosis (after menopause), iatrogenic causes, and syndromes of severe insulin resistance, should be considered. The guideline further notes that some androgen-secreting neoplasms are associated with only mild to moderate increases in androgen levels, and that the clinical history of time of onset and/or rapid progression of symptoms is critical in assessing for an androgen-secreting tumour.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic algorithm (Figure 1): Step 1: Irregular cycles + clinical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 2: If no clinical hyperandrogenism, test for biochemical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 3: If ONLY irregular cycles OR hyperandrogenism, adolescents ultrasound is not indicated = consider at risk of PCOS and reassess later, and adults - request ultrasound for PCOM#, if positive (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. The algorithm notes that PCOM = polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound and specifies exclusion of other causes = TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, FSH or if clinically indicated exclude other causes (e.g. Cushing's Syndrome, adrenal tumours); for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, usually due to low body fat or intensive exercise, exclude clinically and with LH/FSH.

### Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome [^114JDqRv]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Since the 1990 National Institutes of Health-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. PCOS remains a syndrome, and as such no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.

Diagnosis of hirsutism — Endocrine Society recommendations emphasize that clinicians should evaluate biochemical hyperandrogenism when clinical suspicion is present and avoid low-yield testing: we suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in all women with an abnormal hirsutism score and, when total testosterone is normal but hair growth is moderate/severe or mild with other hyperandrogenic features, we suggest measuring an early morning serum total and free testosterone by a reliable specialty assay; we suggest screening hyperandrogenemic women for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency with early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone, including in high-risk hirsute patients even if serum total and free testosterone are normal; and we suggest against testing for elevated androgen levels in eumenorrheic women with unwanted local hair growth without an abnormal hirsutism score because of low diagnostic yield.

### Adrenocortical carcinoma: an ominous cause of hirsutism [^115ZyKJb]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Hirsutism is a fairly common medical problem that affects millions of women around the world, and can cause a significant psychological burden. It is defined as an unwanted androgen-dependent hair growth in females, that is on the face, chest and back, which differentiates it from hypertrichosis, a diffuse hair growth. There are many causes of hirsutism, most of which are benign, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the cause in 3 out of 4 hirsute women. However, the aetiology sometimes can be life-threatening, and early detection and treatment is key to avoid detrimental consequences. Table 1 summarises the causes of hirsutism and differentiating features for each one. In this report we present a life-threatening cause of hirsutism, with elaboration on clinical features to differentiate benign causes of hirsutism from those with dire consequences.

### A 27-year-old woman with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111P3mHA]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Ms R, a 27-year-old woman with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed after irregular menses, hirsutism, and polycystic ovaries, is concerned about weight gain despite regular exercise and watching her diet. Prescribed oral contraceptives to regulate her menses and help reduce her androgen levels, she wants to know the alternatives for treatment of PCOS. The varying definitions of PCOS and its heterogeneity confound the interpretation of studies on PCOS. Specific diagnostic criteria have been established based on expert opinion but have not been validated. Several commonly performed laboratory tests are generally unhelpful and the pathophysiology is poorly understood. Treatment options for Ms R, including those that may affect her weight gain, are reviewed and implications for future fertility are discussed.

### A rare cause of postmenopausal hyperandrogenism [^111LgbHZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present an unusual case of mucinous cystadenoma presenting with severe virilisation in a postmenopausal woman. A 71-year-old woman was referred to our outpatient endocrinology clinic because of rapidly progressive androgenic alopecia, clitoromegaly and male pattern pubic hair growth for 1year. Her medical history was unremarkable. The serum testosterone level was 3.35µg/L (normal range, < 0.4µg/L), and the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level was 267µg/L (normal range, 100–800µg/L). MRI of the abdomen revealed a 4×4cm cystic ovarian mass. A bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, and histopathology showed a unilocular cystic structure with a yellowish content, compatible with mucinous cystadenoma. Postoperative testosterone levels quickly normalised (< 0.4µg/L). Rapidly developing postmenopausal hyperandrogenism easily turns into a diagnostic challenge for the clinician. Hormone-secreting neoplasms of the ovary are most commonly of sex cord stromal derivation, but atypical causes must be recognised as well. Cystadenomas are among the most common benign ovarian neoplasms and are classically considered 'non-functional' tumours. Most of these tumours are asymptomatic and found incidentally on pelvic examination or with ultrasound. To date and to the best of our knowledge, there are only five cases of mucinous adenoma causing virilisation in postmenopausal women identified in the literature. This sixth case adds strength to the link between ovarian mucinous cystadenoma and severe, rapidly progressive hyperandrogenism during menopause. In this case, surgical resection is the treatment of choice.

### Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [^113KcFY2]. Human Reproduction (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian syndrome" for polycystic ovary syndrome and amenorrhea.

The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator used for diagnosing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) in women of reproductive age. This diagnostic tool is based on the presence of two out of three criteria: oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The clinical utility of this calculator is to accurately diagnose PCOS, which is a common endocrine disorder in women that can lead to infertility, metabolic syndrome, and increased cardiovascular risk. The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria exclude other etiologies that can cause similar symptoms, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, and Cushing's syndrome.

The Revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) involves evaluating three key symptoms: amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods, clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound.

The diagnostic process involves three possible symptoms:

1. Amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods
2. Clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism
3. Polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound

The algorithm checks combinations of these symptoms to determine if the diagnostic criteria are met for PCOS. The following logical checks are applied:

- Check for the presence of amenorrhea or irregular menstrual periods (A).
- Check for the presence of clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (B).
- Check for the presence of polycystic ovaries on pelvic ultrasound (C).

The criteria are considered met if any two of the three symptoms are present. Specifically:

- If both A and B are true.
- If both A and C are true.
- If both B and C are true.

If at least two conditions out of the three specified are true, the output is:

Diagnostic criteria are met

If fewer than two conditions are met, the output is:

Diagnostic criteria are not met

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hirsutism, more specifically with respect to serum testosterone levels, ES 2018 guidelines recommend to consider measuring early morning serum total and free testosterone by a reliable specialty assay if serum total testosterone levels are normal, if sexual hair growth is moderate/severe, or if sexual hair growth is mild but there is clinical evidence of a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder (such as menstrual disturbance or progression in spite of therapy).

### Screening and management of the hyperandrogenic adolescent: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 789 [^116bDZLa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although androgen excess can manifest in many ways, the most common and recognizable symptoms are hirsutism and acne. Reports of hirsutism and acne should be taken seriously because of their possible association with medical disorders, their substantial effect on self-esteem and quality of life, and the potential for psychosocial morbidity. In patients with symptoms of androgen excess, the differential diagnosis should include physiologic hyperandrogenism of puberty, idiopathic hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). There is a great deal of overlap between the symptoms of PCOS and those of normal puberty, which makes the diagnosis of PCOS in the adolescent difficult. Treatment of acne and hirsutism should not be withheld during the ongoing longitudinal evaluation for possible PCOS. On physical examination, body mass index, blood pressure, and signs of hyperandrogenism, such as acne and hirsutism, should be evaluated. Although guidelines differ on recommended laboratory studies, most include measurement of total testosterone, free testosterone, or both, and screening for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia with a 17-hydroxyprogesterone test. Elevation of the free or total testosterone level higher than the adult female normative values is a key diagnostic feature of biochemical hyperandrogenism. Because treatment is indicated only when symptoms are distressing to the patient, the degree to which acne or hirsutism bothers the patient should be assessed. Before initiation of any medical therapy, expectations of treatment should be discussed with the patient. Anticipatory guidance is critical to help patients understand the timeline for expected responses to therapy.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115PmV5m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Etiology and diagnostic considerations for hirsutism in premenopausal women — most cases are due to androgen excess (≥ 80%), and 70% to 80% have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is defined by the presence of a combination of two of three symptoms or findings: otherwise unexplained chronic hyperandrogenism, oligoovulation, and ultrasonographic polycystic ovarian morphology. Idiopathic hirsutism constitutes 5% to 20% of hirsute women, and among eumenorrheic women with mild hirsutism (Ferriman–Gallwey hirsutism score of 8 to 15), approximately half have idiopathic hirsutism. Routine assay of androgenic steroids other than testosterone has proven to be of little further diagnostic utility in most, but not all, populations, and serum total testosterone correlates well with serum androgenic bioactivity in young women with and without PCOS (r = 0.7 to 0.8). Further workup of the eumenorrheic patient for mild hirsutism with a normal serum total testosterone is only clinically indicated if there is other clinical evidence suggesting a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder. Most women with a twofold or greater elevation of serum androgen levels have some degree of hirsutism or an alternative pilosebaceous response. Other causes are infrequent; NCCAH is present in 4.2% of hirsutagenic women worldwide, and androgen-secreting tumors are present in ∼0.2% of hyperandrogenic women with over half malignant. Clinicians must consider Cushing syndrome, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, and (rarely) hyperprolactinemia, as well as topical androgen exposure by a partner, exogenous androgens or anabolic steroids, or valproic acid when evaluating patients with hirsutism.

### Long-term remission of ovarian hyperandrogenism after short-term treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist [^113ZQqt6]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the long-term effects of GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) therapy in a patient with benign ovarian hyperandrogenism.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University Hospital endocrine outpatient's clinic.

Patient(S)

A 55-year-old postmenopausal woman with hirsutism and virilization of ovarian origin.

Intervention(S)

Treatment with a course of GnRH-a (triptorelin 3.75 mg IM every 28 days for 4 months). Follow-up for 3 years.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Serum gonadotropin and androgen levels, clinical assessment using the Ferriman-Gallwey score, and assessment of ovarian morphology by ultrasonography.

Result(S)

Administration of triptorelin resulted in suppression of serum testosterone and gonadotropin values and relief of the hyperandrogenic symptoms. Upon discontinuation of treatment, the patient's serum gonadotropin levels returned to the postmenopausal range, but the testosterone levels remained normal and the patient was asymptomatic for an observation period of 3 years.

Conclusion(S)

This case is the first example of long-term remission of ovarian hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman, after short-term treatment with GnRH-a. This supports the view that GnRH-a therapy could be used, even in short courses, for the long-term suppression of benign ovarian hyperandrogenism.

### Hyperandrogenism due to ovarian leydig cell tumour presenting with polycythaemia [^117Qc4v2]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A postmenopausal woman in her 60s was referred due to an elevated haemoglobin value found during her annual check-up. On physical examination, characteristic features of hyperandrogenism were observed which were not earlier mentioned. Laboratory investigations revealed polycythaemia accompanied by a normal erythropoietin and a negative analysis for JAK2-V617F mutation. A disproportionally and markedly elevated testosterone in combination with normal levels of adrenal androgens raised the suspicion of an ovarian source. CT scan showed nodular hyperdense lesions in both ovaries. A bilateral oophorectomy was performed and histological evaluation unfolded a Leydig cell ovarian tumour. Testosterone levels and haematological parameters normalised after surgery. Polycythaemia secondary to hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women is an extremely rare condition and patients should be carefully analysed for the presence of androgen-secreting neoplasms. Diagnosis of the underlying pathology requires careful history, physical examination and comprehensive investigation. Treatment for this condition is surgery and resolves polycythaemia.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112BdEua]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Clinical hyperandrogenism — evaluation and assessment specify that the presence of hirsutism alone should be considered predictive of biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults, while healthcare professionals could recognize that female pattern hair loss and acne in isolation (without hirsutism) are relatively weak predictors of biochemical hyperandrogenism. A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism, and healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact and should consider the reporting of unwanted excess hair growth and/or female pattern hair loss as being important. A modified Ferriman Gallwey score (mFG) of 4–6 should be used to detect hirsutism, and healthcare professionals should consider that the severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity but the prevalence appears similar across ethnicities. For clinical scoring, healthcare professionals should be aware that standardized visual scales are preferred when assessing hirsutism and should consider the Ludwig or Olsen visual scales for female pattern hair loss; they should note that only terminal hairs need to be considered in defining hirsutism and these can reach > 5 mm if untreated, and note that new-onset severe or worsening hyperandrogenism requires further investigation and that clinical signs should be monitored for improvement or treatment adjustment during therapy.

### Causes, patterns, and severity of androgen excess in 1205 consecutively recruited women [^111ztA9n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Previous publications in this area have almost exclusively reported immunoassays for androgen measurement, whereas current progress in androgen analysis by mass spectrometry offers the opportunity for simultaneous multisteroid profiling. Our study used tandem mass spectrometry for the combined highly sensitive and specific measurement of A4 and T. The direction of travel in clinical biochemistry is clearly toward the development of even more wide-ranging multisteroid profiling mass spectrometry assays, often confronting the biochemist and clinician with increased analytes that were not specifically requested by the clinician but are automatically measured by the assay. Our findings can serve as some guide for risk stratification in the situation of incidental androgen excess findings. In addition to the classic androgen synthesis pathway from DHEAS via A4 to T and DHT, recent studies have highlighted the significance of the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway. This is initiated by conversion of A4 to 11-hydroxyandrostenedione by adrenal CYP11B1, with further downstream activation to 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-dihydrotestosterone, which bind and activate the androgen receptor with similar affinity and potency as T and DHT. Our own work and that of others has underlined the 11-oxygenated androgens as the major circulating androgens in PCOS and important androgen excess parameters in CAH. In this study, we did not measure 11-oxygenated androgens, as the serum samples were analyzed in the routine clinical biochemistry setting where this assay is not yet available. However, it will be very interesting to analyze the impact of 11-oxygenated androgen measurement on further delineation of condition-specific androgen excess signatures.

A limitation of the study is in the definition of premenopausal and postmenopausal by an age cutoff of 50 years. However, we established the menopausal status in the 378 women with increased androgens as part of the clinical data extraction. Among the 303 women aged < 50 years, only 2 (0.6%) had age-related ovarian failure with increased gonadotropins. Similarly, only 3 (4%) of the 75 women aged > 50 years had persistent menses. We have applied the age cutoff of 50 years to stratify the 827 women with normal androgen results. This enabled us to calculate the proportions of women investigated and of those with abnormal results (Fig. 1). Other limitations of our study include the arbitrary definition of the severity cutoffs and the population bias, as we recruited from a secondary/tertiary care cohort enriched for patients with endocrine disorders associated with androgen excess other than PCOS, which, however, enabled us to analyze a relevant number of cases and make condition-specific observations on androgen excess pattern and severity.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome – part 1 [^1166eTPA]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries. There is need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging. Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should be ideally determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. Value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone are useful for determining a diagnosis of PCOS. Correct diagnosis of PCOS impacts on the likelihood of associated metabolic and cardiovascular risks and leads to appropriate intervention, depending upon the woman's age, reproductive status, and her own concerns. The management of women with PCOS should include reproductive function, as well as the care of hirsutism, alopecia, and acne. Cycle length > 35 days suggests chronic anovulation, but cycle length slightly longer than normal (32 to 35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days) needs assessment for ovulatory dysfunction. Ovulatory dysfunction is associated with increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, in addition to infertility. In PCOS, hirsutism develops gradually and intensifies with weight gain. In the neoplastic virilizing states, hirsutism is of rapid onset, usually associated with clitoromegaly and oligomenorrhea. Girls with severe acne or acne resistant to oral and topical agents, including isotretinoin (Accutane), may have a 40% likelihood of developing PCOS. Hair loss patterns are variable in women with hyperandrogenemia, typically the vertex, crown or diffuse pattern, whereas women with more severe hyperandrogenemia may see bitemporal hair loss and loss of the frontal hairline. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can effectively lower androgens and block the effect of androgens via suppression of ovarian androgen production and by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin. Physiologic doses of dexamethasone or prednisone can directly lower adrenal androgen output. Anti-androgens can be used to block the effects of androgen in the pilosebaceous unit or in the hair follicle. Anti-androgen therapy works through competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or inhibition of 5α-reductase (finasteride) to prevent the conversion of T to its more potent form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. The choice of antiandrogen therapy is guided by symptoms. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is particularly challenging given significant age and developmental issues in this group. Management of infertility in women with PCOS requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of anovulation as well as currently available treatments. Many features of PCOS, including acne, menstrual irregularities, and hyperinsulinemia, are common in normal puberty. Menstrual irregularities with anovulatory cycles and varied cycle length are common due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the 2- to 3-year time period post-menarche. Persistent oligomenorrhea 2 to 3 years beyond menarche predicts ongoing menstrual irregularities and greater likelihood of underlying ovarian or adrenal dysfunction. In adolescent girls, large, multicystic ovaries are a common finding, so ultrasound is not a first-line investigation in women < 17 years of age. Ovarian dysfunction in adolescents should be based on oligomenorrhea and/or biochemical evidence of oligo/anovulation, but there are major limitations to the sensitivity of T assays in ranges applicable to young girls. Metformin is commonly used in young girls and adolescents with PCOS as first-line monotherapy or in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications. In lean adolescent girls, a dose as low as 850 mg daily may be effective at reducing PCOS symptoms; in overweight and obese adolescents, dose escalation to 1.5 to 2.5 g daily is likely required. Anti-androgen therapy in adolescents could affect bone mass, although available short-term data suggest no effect on bone loss.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for polycystic ovary syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ES 2013 guidelines recommend to consider making a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal patients with well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. Look for the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound to provide additional supportive evidence, recognizing that this is less likely to present in menopausal patients.

3 Causes of Androgen Excess in Women (Table 1)

3.1 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

PCOS, with a prevalence between 8% and 13% in women of reproductive age, is the most common cause of androgen excess in women. Hyperandrogenism is one of the key features of PCOS and is directly responsible for most of its features. The 2023 evidence‐based international PCOS guideline based on the Rotterdam criteria require two out of three features for the diagnosis of PCOS: (1) ovulatory dysfunction with irregular menstrual cycles, (2) polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) with increased numbers of antral follicles detected by ultrasonography or increased anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) and (3) clinical or biochemical features of hyperandrogenism. Therefore, hyperandrogenism is not required for the diagnosis of PCOS and up to 20% of those with PCOS do not display features of androgen excess. However, as androgens are thought to have a role in the development of PCOM, it is unclear if those women have increased androgen synthesis or action within the ovary.

Table 1
Causes of androgen excess in women.

Androgens are synthesised in the theca cells of the ovarian follicle under the influence of LH. Although the increased numbers of antral follicles means that there are increased numbers of theca cells in the polycystic ovary, in PCOS each theca cell also has an increased capacity to synthesise androgens. The mechanism of this is unclear but it is likely to be linked to the increased LH concentrations seen in PCOS as well as increased concentrations of insulin which enhances LH‐stimulated androgen synthesis. The aetiology of the increased LH and insulin concentrations is not well understood but it is likely to be prenatally programmed. Free androgens in the circulation are increased when SHBG concentrations are reduced. This is associated with insulin resistance and obesity which are both common in PCOS thereby exacerbating the hyperandrogenic phenotype.

### Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment in postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism of ovarian origin [^117RKzCj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The most frequent cause of virilization in postmenopausal women is excessive androgen production of ovarian origin. Bilateral oophorectomy is usually performed, even in cases of benign tumors or hyperthecosis. This is the first report of a case series of long-term GnRH-agonist treatment of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women.

Objective

We present three women with postmenopausal hyperandrogenism of ovarian origin who were treated with GnRH agonists.

Patients

We describe three cases of postmenopausal women with virilization and hyperandrogenism of presumed ovarian origin, all with slight enlargement of the ovaries but without visualization of a tumor, who had long-term treatment with GnRH agonists. No histological diagnosis was available, and therefore all patients received careful follow-up, including periodic testing of androgen levels and ovarian imaging by computed tomography scans. The three patients responded in different ways to treatment with GnRH agonists.

Conclusions

Long-term GnRH agonist treatment is an acceptable choice for treatment of postmenopausal hyperandrogenism in patients where ovarian origin of androgen excess is ascertained, and especially in those patients who have an increased risk for surgery due to comorbidities or who are unwilling to undergo bilateral oophorectomy.

Evaluation — Changes since the previous guideline include broadened testing and screening: we have broadened the suggestion to determine serum total testosterone to include all women with hirsutism and to determine serum-free testosterone in hirsute women whose serum total testosterone is normal with moderate to severe hirsutism or other clinical evidence of hyperandrogenemia such as progressive growth of hair in androgen-dependent areas; we added a recommendation to screen hyperandrogenemic women for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency by measuring early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the follicular phase or on a random day for those with amenorrhea or infrequent menses; and in high-risk women with hirsutism we suggest screening even if serum total and free testosterone are normal.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114TpmrL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Androgen testing in hirsutism — Local sexual hair growth without other clinical evidence "does not require an endocrine workup before embarking on dermatologic therapy". For laboratory assessment, "An accurate and specific assay, such as mass spectrometry, is the best choice for assessing serum total testosterone concentrations", and reference norms are "standardized for early morning, when levels are the highest, and for days 4 to 10 of the menstrual cycle". "Women with mild hirsutism, a normal total testosterone level, a pelvic ultrasound showing normal ovarian morphology (if performed), and no clinical evidence of other hyperandrogenic endocrine disorders have idiopathic hirsutism". If total testosterone is normal but clinical suspicion remains, "clinicians should test serum free-testosterone levels", and "Assessing free testosterone levels… is the single most useful, clinically sensitive marker of androgen excess in women". Because "Progression of hyperandrogenism in the presence of a normal serum-free testosterone is very unusual", "clinicians should thoroughly reevaluate these patients", and "Unless fertility is an issue (37), demonstrating polycystic ovary morphology to diagnose ovulatory PCOS is unlikely to affect management".

If clinical concern persists, measure "Free testosterone blood level (calculated from total testosterone and SHBG or equilibrium dialysis)" and interpret branches "Free testosterone elevated" versus "Free testosterone normal", with the latter leading to "Re-evaluate if hirsutism progresses", and evaluation for androgen excess via "Androgen excess laboratory work-up†". Major disorders listed are "Polycystic ovary syndrome", "Nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia", "Cushing's syndrome", "Virilizing tumor", and "Hyperprolactinemia".

A better understanding of the different phenotypes and of their endocrine and metabolic characteristics permits investigators to distinguish three main androgen excess disorders: classic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), mild ovulatory PCOS, and idiopathic hyperandrogenism. These androgenic phenotypes differ more for the severity of the endocrine and metabolic alteration than for the etiopathogenetic mechanisms. The appearance of a particular androgenic phenotype is determined by a sum of genetic and environmental factors, but mostly by body weight.

### Ovarian steroid cell tumour inducing virilisation in a postmenopausal woman [^113jCVnE]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Hyperandrogenism with virilisation de novo in postmenopausal women is exceedingly rare, with aetiology oscillating between ovarian tumours, adrenal tumours, ovarian hyperthecosis and, less frequently, Cushing's syndrome. We report a case of a postmenopausal woman in her late 60s, referred from her primary healthcare physician to a gynaecology appointment due to hirsutism and vasomotor symptoms. At physical examination, clitoromegaly was also identified. Blood tests revealed severe hyperandrogenemia, with total testosterone above 200ng/dL, but transvaginal ultrasound and abdominal CT were unremarkable. Three months later, abdominal CT was repeated, revealing a moderate heterogeneous enhancement with 18mm on the left ovary, which was confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy was performed. Histopathological examination reported an ovarian steroid cell tumour not otherwise specified on the left ovary and bilateral ovarian hyperthecosis. Two months later, the patient had normal total testosterone and the hirsutism complaints were completely absent.

### Correlation between biochemical and clinical hyperandrogenism parameter in polycystic ovary syndrome in relation to age [^115zu74z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study had several strengths. First, the clinical hyperandrogenic features in this prospective study were recorded by a single doctor, thus decreasing inter-observer bias. Second, we evaluated our biochemical androgens using LC–MS/MS methods, which are less affected by structurally related steroid metabolites. Third, we evaluated the relationship between clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism features in different age ranges and demonstrated the profound impact of age on the relationship. Fourth, we focused on specific body regions for clinical features, which ensures thorough and concrete evaluation.

This study has some limitations. First, our study was performed at a single center with a limited population. Second, the results only included the East Asian population and may not apply to other ethnicities. Third, free testosterone levels were not measured in our patients. Free testosterone is an important and accurate index for evaluating biochemical hyperandrogenism as recommended by the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS 2018. Measurement of free testosterone would have ensured a more robust evaluation.

1.1 Evidence

PCOS is a common disorder with systemic metabolic manifestations. Its etiology is complex, heterogeneous, and poorly understood. There are three definitions for PCOS currently in use that variably rely on androgen excess, chronic anovulation, and PCO to make the diagnosis (Table 1). However, all criteria are consistent in that PCOS is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. All three sets of diagnostic criteria include hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical, and anovulation. The Rotterdam criteria were the first to incorporate ovarian morphology on ultrasound as part of the diagnostic criteria.

The panel from a recent National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Evidence-Based Methodology workshop on PCOS endorsed the Rotterdam criteria, although they identified the strengths and weaknesses of each of the three cardinal features (Table 2). These criteria allow the diagnosis to be made clinically (based upon a history of hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation) as well as biochemically with androgen assays or with ultrasound examination of the ovaries. We do not endorse the need for universal screening with androgen assays or ultrasound if patients already meet two of the three criteria clinically. It is recommended that the features leading to the diagnosis are documented. We recommend using the current definition of the Rotterdam criteria to document PCO morphology (at least one ovary with 12 follicles of 2–9 mm or a volume > 10 mL in the absence of a dominant follicle > 10 mm), in the absence of age-based criteria.

Disorders that mimic PCOS are comparatively easy to exclude; therefore, all women should be screened with a TSH, prolactin, and 17-OHP level (Table 3). Hyperprolactinemia can present with amenorrhea or hirsutism. Thyroid disease may present with irregular menstrual cycles. In women with hyperandrogenism, nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia should be excluded because it can be found in 1.5–6.8% of patients presenting with androgen excess. In select women who present with amenorrhea, virilization, or physical findings not associated with PCOS, such as proximal muscle weakness (Cushing's syndrome) or frontal bossing (acromegaly), other diagnoses should be considered and excluded (Table 4).

### Renaming PCOS – a two-state solution [^111DNsid]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

It has become evident over the past 30 years that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is more than a reproductive disorder. It has metabolic sequelae that can affect women across the lifespan. Diagnostic criteria based on the endocrine features of the syndrome, hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, identify women at high metabolic risk. The additional phenotypes defined by the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria identify women with primarily reproductive rather than metabolic dysfunction.

Objective

The aim is to discuss the rationale for a separate name for the syndrome that is associated with high metabolic risk while maintaining the current name for the phenotypes with primarily reproductive morbidity.

Intervention

The NIH Office for Disease Prevention-Sponsored Evidence-Based Methodology Workshop on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome recommended that a new name is needed for PCOS. POSITIONS: The authors propose that PCOS be retained for the reproductive phenotypes and that a new name be created for the phenotypes at high metabolic risk.

Conclusions

There should be two names for the PCOS phenotypes: those with primarily reproductive consequences should continue to be called PCOS, and those with important metabolic consequences should have a new name.

### Androgen deficiency in women [^114rKT7T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Physiological and pathological processes as well as iatrogenic interventions may result in androgen deficiency compared with levels in young healthy women. Whether relative androgen deficiency results in a clinical syndrome similar to that reported in men, including osteopenia, increased fat mass, decreased libido, and diminished quality of life, has not been definitively established. However, preliminary data in postmenopausal women suggest that physiological androgen replacement therapy, which involves substantially lower doses than those used in men, may result in increased bone mineral density, increased libido, and improved quality of life. The safety of androgen preparations that result in supraphysiological levels has not been established in women and would be expected to result in hirsutism, acne, and virilization with chronic use. Androgen preparations that avoid liver metabolism and result in physiological serum androgen levels in women with androgen deficiency are not currently available, but are in development. Therefore, although widespread screening and hormone replacement for androgen deficiency cannot be recommended yet, increasing interest in this topic makes consideration of the available data important.

Amenorrhea evaluation — thyroid and androgen testing: TSH is considered among the first-line screening tests in any reproductive-age woman presenting with menstrual abnormalities including secondary amenorrhea, and in settings of pituitary insufficiency free thyroxine levels should additionally be tested; testing should be considered when features of hyperandrogenism accompany secondary amenorrhea, using serum testosterone (total and free) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and screening for 21 hydroxylase deficiency is based on serum levels of 17 hydroxyprogesterone.

### The androgen excess and PCOS society criteria for the polycystic ovary syndrome: the complete task force report [^111ZtH1b]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review all available data and recommend a definition for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) based on published peer-reviewed data, whether already in use or not, to guide clinical diagnosis and future research.

Design

Literature review and expert consensus.

Setting

Professional society.

Patients

None.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

A systematic review of the published peer-reviewed medical literature, by querying MEDLINE databases, to identify studies evaluating the epidemiology or phenotypic aspects of PCOS.

Result(S)

The Task Force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the Androgen Excess and PCOS (AE-PCOS) Society AE-PCOS Board of Directors. No section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence.

Conclusion(S)

Based on the available data, it is the view of the AE-PCOS Society Task Force that PCOS should be defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical), ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries), and the exclusion of related disorders. However, a minority considered the possibility that there may be forms of PCOS without overt evidence of hyperandrogenism, but recognized that more data are required before validating this supposition. Finally, the Task Force recognized and fully expects that the definition of this syndrome will evolve over time to incorporate new research findings.

Adolescence — diagnostic context and natural history in PCOS are outlined: As many as 85% of menstrual cycles are anovulatory during the first year after menarche, and up to 59% are still anovulatory during the third year after menarche; in one study, persisting oligomenorrhea was not predicted by increased androgens, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, or increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, whereas increased body mass index (BMI) was the major risk factor for persistent anovulation; only approximately 40% of adolescent women with menstrual irregularity have polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and investigators suggest that oligoamenorrhea or amenorrhea should be present for at least 2 years after menarche (or primary amenorrhea at age 16 yrs), that ultrasound criteria should include increased ovarian size (> 10 cm³), and that hyperandrogenemia rather than just signs of androgen excess should be documented.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^115J4GtR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Further investigations were pursued to elucidate the source of hyperandrogenism. Computed tomography adrenal imaging incidentally discovered a 13-mm lipid-rich adenoma for which subsequent evaluation of aldosterone to renin ratio (after replacing ramipril to verapamil), plasma metanephrines, and a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test confirmed the nonfunctioning nature of the adrenal lesion. No ovarian tumors were detected on pelvic ultrasound and computed tomography. It is important to note that many androgen- = secreting tumors are often small and difficult to detect on imaging of the ovaries. Androgen profiling revealed persistent hyperandrogenemia with elevated total testosterone levels (5.5 nmol/L) (reference range, 0.1–1.7 nmol/L), an elevated FAI of 24.9 (reference range, 0.2–5.4) and elevated androstenedione levels of 5.2 nmol/L (reference range, 0.5–2.9 nmol/L). DHEAS remained within normal postmenopausal limits at 1.0 umol/L (reference range, 0.2–5.1 umol/L). Additionally, the patient exhibited elevated LH and FSH levels consistent with the postmenopausal range. Secondary causes of hyperandrogenemia were excluded with a 17-OHP level of 3.2 nmol/L (reference range, < 6.0 nmol/L) and normal thyroid function tests.

Overall, the patient's marked hyperandrogenemia, postmenopausal status, history of regular menstrual cycles and absence of PCOM, indicates an alternative diagnosis rather than PCOS. To investigate the source of the excess testosterone, combined adrenal and ovarian vein sampling was undertaken which confirmed bilateral ovarian hypersecretion of testosterone. Given the bilateral hypersecretion, a diagnosis of ovarian hyperthecosis is most likely diagnosis (as opposed to an androgen-secreting ovarian tumor, which is more likely to be unilateral). Consequently, the patient was referred to a gynecologist for consideration of bilateral oophorectomy.

### The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome: the criteria are insufficiently robust for clinical research [^116PgXbM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder but has considerable phenotypic variability and this has led to controversy over its exact definition and diagnosis. The objective of this study was to review the recently proposed diagnostic criteria to determine whether they were sufficiently robust for clinical and research practise. We have reviewed the literature pertaining to clinical measurement and quality of laboratory analysis in relation to clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism. The recently published statements regarding the diagnosis of PCOS assume that the clinical, laboratory and imaging studies are dichotomous variables, without considering the effect of observer subjectivity or measurement variability on the outcome. The data suggest that there is considerable uncertainty of all measurements and lack of clarity of the definition of the term 'hyperandrogenaemia' which can lead to misdiagnosis. The current diagnostic strategies for PCOS are defined too vaguely to ascertain that individuals fit the definition of the syndrome. A pragmatic approach may be taken in the management of an individual depending upon her particular symptoms and needs. However, research into the epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment of PCOS will require the production of robust definitions of the diagnostic criteria. We propose specific criteria that would answer the criticisms that we have raised.

Androgen therapy in women — epidemiology in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and cardiovascular risk: "A retrospective observational study of 21 000 women with hyperandrogenism/PCOS identified an increased risk of diabetes with a median follow-up of 5 years". The "largest observational study reporting the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition did not find an increase in coronary heart disease morbidity or mortality, although they had more CVD risk factors". In the Rancho Bernardo cohort, women "in both the lowest and highest quintiles of bioavailable T demonstrated higher rates of incident CVD than the middle quintile", and "In summary, whereas endogenous free T appears to be associated with an increased risk of CVD in some epidemiological studies, the risk is largely attributable to impaired insulin sensitivity and lowered SHBG levels".

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — hyperandrogenism testing approach: In the workup for hyperandrogenism, familiarity with local reference ranges is important, as assays are not standardized across laboratories; clinicians should obtain total or free testosterone levels (depending on assay reliability and noting that the former is usually more accurate), and clinicians should also consider measuring serum DHEA-S to rule out adrenal etiologies; some experts consider an elevated free testosterone level (measuring both total and free testosterone using a gold standard assay) the most useful indicator of PCOS.

### The association between hyperandrogenemia and the metabolic syndrome in morbidly obese women [^116SNiPg]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrinopathy, affecting 8–12% of women of reproductive age, and 10–35% of obese women. PCOS is associated with infertility, hyperandrogenemia, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. A combination of increased levels of androgens and insulin is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of PCOS. Hyperandrogenemia (HA) comprises the biochemical hallmark of PCOS with elevated free testosterone levels accounting for the majority of the abnormal laboratory findings in women with oligomenorrhea.

Excess body weight is associated with HA. Furthermore, the hyperinsulinemia in obese women may directly increase free testosterone levels by lowering the sex hormone binding globulin synthesis in the liver. On the other hand, rodent models have shown that HA promotes insulin resistance, reduces energy expenditure and, accordingly, increases the risk of abdominal obesity and metabolic risk factors. In a multiethnic sample of more than 2500 U.S. women between 42 and 52 years of age, oligomenorrhea was associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) only when coincident with HA. Conversely, women with HA had a significantly increased risk of the MetS independent of the menstrual frequency status.

The ovaries' response to luteinizing hormone (LH) is the main source of increased androgens in PCOS. Also, the elevated response of adrenal steroids in women with PCOS sustained only with adrenal stimulation of ACTH, suggesting a secondary effect of increased adrenal androgen production rather than adrenal congenital enzyme deficit.

It is not clear how HA may affect cardiovascular disease. Abdominal obese women with PCOS are considered at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and a positive association between coronary artery disease and clinical hyperandrogenism (hirsutism and acne) has been reported. On the other hand, a population based study showed that premenopausal overweight women with PCOS did not have a higher risk of coronary artery disease than those without PCOS. Nevertheless, women with PCOS and HA have a higher prevalence of obesity and adverse metabolic abnormalities compared to those without HA. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the impact of HA on the MetS independent of the presence or absence of PCOS among obese women.

The primary aim of this study was to examine whether treatment seeking premenopausal morbidly obese women with HA had higher odds for MetS and its components (low HDL-cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, raised blood pressure, and dysglycemia) than women without HA, independent of PCOS status.

4.1.6 GnRH analogue test

GnRH analogue testing is a valuable diagnostic tool in the work‐up of suspected ovarian hyperandrogenism, particularly in women with a preferential elevation of serum testosterone as observed in postmenopausal women with OHT. GnRH analogue testing involves administering a single dose of a GnRH analogue such as leuprorelin (3.75 mg) or triptorelin (3 mg) intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Ovarian secretion of androgens is gonadotropin‐dependent even in the context of OHT, and suppression of gonadotropins and consequently T secretion after GnRH analogue therapy strongly supports a suspected diagnosis of benign ovarian hyperandrogenism. GnRH analogues induce prolonged activation of GnRH receptors in the pituitary gonadotrophs, leading to desensitization and resultant downregulation of these receptors. The net effect after 21–28 days is suppression of LH and FSH secretion and inhibition of oestrogen and androgen secretion. Suppression of T by more than 50% at 28 days after administration of a GnRH analogue suggests a benign ovarian source of hyperandrogenism. Postmenopausal women who have suppressed T after GnRH analogue therapy should undergo bilateral oophorectomy unless there is a clear unilateral lesion; in premenopausal women who do not have a radiologically defined unilateral lesion, joint ovarian and adrenal vein sampling should be considered.

There is limited data on whether GnRH analogue testing can differentiate between OHT and VOTs in the literature. Theoretically, the severity of androgen excess with VOTs may be more severe and less likely to be under gonadotropin regulation; therefore, this diagnosis should be considered in patients with a strong suspicion of ovarian hyperandrogenism who fail to suppress their testosterone after GnRH agonist. In very rare cases of adrenal hyperandrogenism, androgen secretion may fall under the control of LH or even GnRH. If the GnRH analogue adequately suppresses testosterone, long‐term GnRH agonist treatment can be considered for use in patients with an increased risk for surgery due to comorbidities or who are unwilling to undergo bilateral oophorectomy.

Endocrine Society hirsutism — screening for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia: We suggest screening hyperandrogenemic women for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency by measuring early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels in the follicular phase or on a random day for those with amenorrhea or infrequent menses (2 ⊕⊕◯◯). In hirsute patients with a high risk of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, we suggest this screening even if serum total and free testosterone are normal (2 ⊕⊕◯◯).

### Total testosterone levels are often more than three times elevated in patients with androgen-secreting tumours [^116ptUxb]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Hirsutism is present in up to 25% reproductive aged women and is most often caused by polycystic ovary syndrome. Less than 5% of patients with hirsutism are diagnosed with rare endocrine diseases including ovarian or adrenal androgen-producing tumours, but these tumours may be malignant and need surgery. Terminal hair growth on lip and chin gradually increases after menopause, which complicates distinction from normal physiological variation. Precise testosterone assays have just recently become available in the daily clinic. We present three women diagnosed with testosterone-producing tumours. Gold standard techniques were used to measure testosterone levels. All tumours originated from the ovaries. Based on the present cases and the existing literature, we suggest that androgen-producing tumours should be suspected in patients with rapid progression of hyperandrogen symptoms, particularly when total testosterone levels are above three times the upper reference limit.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111qWcA6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Therapy with oral contraceptives — androgen suppression and sexual function: Ovarian androgen production is suppressed by hormonal contraception, and oral contraceptives are a mainstay for therapy of hyperandrogenic amenorrhea that suppress T and androstenedione and reduce hirsutism; limited evidence suggests oral contraceptives may also reduce circulating DHEAS, raising adrenal suppression concerns, but there is no evidence this is clinically significant; increases in plasma sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) caused by oral contraceptives are exaggerated in women with sexual dysfunction, limited evidence links androgen suppression while taking oral contraceptives to reduced sexual interest and response, a randomized controlled study did not show different sexual function effects among androgenic versus antiandrogenic progestins, and there is no evidence to support concomitant therapy with T, making the androgen-deficiency model of ovarian suppression by oral contraceptives not compelling.

### Male late-onset hypogonadism: pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^114DHNsa]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Some aging men develop a condition of suppressed serum testosterone levels, which is associated with diffuse sexual, physical and psychological symptoms. Several terms are used for this syndrome, but late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) is preferred. The diagnosis of LOH is often uncertain because symptoms (occurring in 20–40% of men) and low circulating testosterone (found in 20% of men > 70 years of age) seldom occur together. The strict diagnostic criteria for LOH include reproducibly low serum testosterone levels and sexual symptoms, including erectile dysfunction and reduced frequency of sexual thoughts and morning erections. Using these diagnostic criteria, only 2% of 40–80-year-old men have LOH. Obesity and impaired general health (including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frailty) are more common reasons for low testosterone than advanced age per se. It seems logical, therefore, to begin by treating these conditions before testosterone replacement therapy is initiated. Even then, testosterone should only be used if there are no contraindications, such as unstable cardiac disease, serious prostate symptoms and high hemoglobin level. The long-term benefit of testosterone replacement therapy is uncertain, and the experimental nature of the treatment, and its associated risks, must be fully explained to the patient before treatment begins.

### Value of selective venous catheterization in the diagnosis of hyperandrogenism [^113dGCWT]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the clinical utility of ovarian vessel sampling in the context of the evaluation and treatment of ovarian hyperthecosis.

Design

Patient presentation in video format, ovarian vessel sampling demonstration, surgical technique explanation, surgical histology discussion and ovarian hyperthecosis review.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patient(S)

A 30-year-old nulligravid female presented with severe hyperandrogenic features, consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome.

Intervention(S)

During the course of her diagnostic evaluation, she underwent selective ovarian and adrenal vein sampling.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Assessment of ovarian vessel testosterone levels and review of final histologic findings.

Result(S)

Selective ovarian and adrenal vein sampling revealed right ovarian testosterone levels that were 200 times the upper limit of normal. As occult malignancy was a concern, laparoscopy was performed, with nearly complete removal of the right ovarian stroma. Pathology revealed ovarian stromal hyperthecosis without evidence of malignancy.

Conclusion(S)

Selective venous sampling is a technically challenging procedure, which may help localize an occult malignancy in limited circumstances. In utilizing selective venous sampling, one must consider the limitations of the test, potential for false positive results, and possibility of unnecessary surgical interventions.

### FSH receptor variant: an unusual cause of secondary amenorrhea [^117Ejigc]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Secondary amenorrhea with high Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels and low estradiol is typically diagnosed as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in individuals under the age of 40. Low anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels support the diagnosis of POI, but normal AMH levels warrant additional evaluation.

Case Presentation

A 19-year-old female with menarche at age 12 experienced secondary amenorrhea at age 14.5. Initial evaluation showed elevated gonadotropins and low estradiol, which were confirmed on repeat testing. Normal karyotype, no FMR1 repeat expansion, negative autoimmune markers, and normal AMH levels were found. Genetic testing revealed two Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptor (FSHR) gene variants with high suspicion of pathogenicity.

Discussion

Pathogenic variants in the FSHR gene are an uncommon cause of secondary amenorrhea. Atypical POI cases with a normal AMH level should be evaluated with a genetic consultation.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^116twbiM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperandrogenism

Another cardinal feature of PCOS is androgen excess, also referred to as hyperandrogenism, which is present in the majority of patients with the disorder. In a meta-analysis of 41 original studies enrolling a total of 13 796 patients with PCOS we observed that < 20% do not exhibit hyperandrogenism, whether detected in the clinical setting or in medically unbiased populations. Notably, in addition to being part of the diagnostic algorithm, the degree of hyperandrogenism is associated with the risk of metabolic dysfunction and associated cardiometabolic morbidities of PCOS. The presence of hyperandrogenism can be determined either clinically or biochemically.

Clinical Hyperandrogenism

The most common clinical sign of hyperandrogenism is the presence of hirsutism (ie, excess facial or body terminal hair growth in a male-like pattern in a female). Most women with hirsutism have demonstratable biochemical hyperandrogenemia. Alternatively, and as indicated by the 2023 International PCOS Guideline, female pattern hair loss (FPHL) or acne, if in isolation (ie, without hirsutism), are relatively weak indicators of hyperandrogenemia.

While there are a number of methods to assess patients for hirsutism, the most commonly used, and the one recommended by the 2023 International PCOS Guideline, is the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) visual scale. Originally described by Ferriman and Gallwey, the mFG scale assesses terminal hair growth in 9 body areas, with each area assigned a score of 0 (no terminal hairs observed) to 4 (a density of terminal hairs consistent with that of a mature male), and the individual scores summed to provide the total mFG score (Fig. 2). Importantly, when examining patients for hirsutism, clinicians should strive to only assess the presence of terminal, not vellus hairs. While the use of the scale is somewhat subjective, reference to a published visual atlas may be helpful in standardizing measurements.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1176zTxe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In this article, we use a case-based approach to outline the assessment and management of men older than 50 years presenting with features of androgen deficiency and a low testosterone level, based on a review of the literature (PubMed), using the search terms " male hypogonadism", " testosterone deficiency", " androgen deficiency", " functional hypogonadism", " late onset hypogonadism", as well as the clinical experience of the authors. We will focus on the diagnosis and management of possible androgen deficiency (Fig. 1). Fertility will not be discussed. Many of the principles and recommendations that we discuss are pertinent to men under age 50. However, we focus on men ≥ 50 years old in this manuscript because of the following: 1) the prevalence of low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology increases significantly in men starting at age 40–50; 2) most of the high-quality epidemiological and randomized controlled studies of men with low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology were performed in men ≥ 50 years old; 3) the diagnostic evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years old differs from younger because a) evaluation for hypothalamic and pituitary disease with sellar imaging and evaluation for iron overload syndromes is often unnecessary in older men; b) infertility due to HPT dysfunction is less commonly important for men ≥ 50 years old; and c) long-term suppression of the HPT axis (iatrogenic androgen deficiency) is much more likely to occur with exogenous testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years old.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^1144gQ9Y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction and Methodology

Androgen excess is defined as clinical or biochemical evidence of increased production of androgenic steroids in women. It is observed in up to 10% of women of reproductive age and less commonly in postmenopausal women. Androgen excess typically manifests clinically as hirsutism or acne, but more severe and prolonged exposure can lead to overt virilisation, including clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, female pattern hair‐loss (FPHL) or erythrocytosis. Most adolescents and women of reproductive age who present to secondary or tertiary care with androgen excess will have underlying polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, other primary underlying pathologies must be excluded in a subset of patients harbouring red flag clinical features. These include severe biochemical disturbances, rapidly progressive symptoms or signs or presentation in the postmenopausal phase of life. This cohort of patients have increased likelihood of underlying neoplastic ovarian, adrenal or pituitary disease, or occasionally monogenic disorders of insulin signalling or androgen metabolism, compared to those with milder disturbances in the PCOS range. A detailed clinical history, targeted physical examination and careful interrogation of the pattern and severity of biochemical disturbances are critical to rationalise the requirement and strategy for further biochemical, radiological and, where appropriate, genetic investigations. Although androgen excess in women with PCOS is closely correlated with adverse metabolic health outcomes throughout their life course, severe biochemical disturbances or overt virilisation are rarely observed in PCOS. Therefore, a systematic diagnostic approach is required to investigate patients with typical red flag signs and symptoms.

### Circulating testosterone as the hormonal basis of sex differences in athletic performance [^111gYjuB]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The available, albeit incomplete, evidence makes it highly likely that the sex difference in circulating testosterone of adults explains most, if not all, the sex differences in sporting performance. This is based on the dose-response effects of circulating testosterone to increase muscle mass and strength, bone size and strength (density), and circulating hemoglobin, each of which alone increases athletic capacity, as well as other possible sex dichotomous, androgen-sensitive contributors such as mental effects (mood, motivation, aggression) and muscle myoglobin content. These facts explain the clear sex difference in athletic performance in most sports, on which basis it is commonly accepted that competition has to be divided into male and female categories.

The first IAAF hyperandrogenism regulation specified a hormonal eligibility criterion of a serum testosterone of < 10 nmol/L for an androgen-sensitive athlete's participation in the protected category of female athletic events. This threshold was based on serum testosterone measurements by immunoassays. However, no reliable method-independent consensus threshold could be established using commercial testosterone immunoassays, as these assays differ systematically due to method-specific bias arising unavoidably from the specificity of the different proprietary antibodies employed. Based on measurements using the more accurate and specific mass spectrometry methods, if the objective is to require female athletes with congenital conditions that cause them to have serum testosterone concentrations in the normal male range to bring those levels down to the same range as other female athletes, then (allowing for PCOS athletes) the threshold used should not be > 5.0 nmol/L. This represents a conservative criterion that includes all healthy young (< 40 years) women, including those with PCOS. Conversely, this criterion is generous to intersex/DSD females in allowing them to maintain a higher serum testosterone (2 to 5 nmol/L) than most non-PCOS competitors in female events even though increases in muscle mass and strength and hemoglobin would be expected in this range. This is so even though the range remains below the circulating testosterone levels of middle male puberty when the major biological effects of men's higher circulating testosterone begin to be fully expressed. Ongoing compliance with the eligibility criterion is also an important variable because the estrogen-based suppression of circulating testosterone, typically using daily administered estrogen products, has a rapid onset and offset. Adequate monitoring to prevent gaming of eligibility criteria would require regular random rather than announced blood sampling.

### Controversy in clinical endocrinology: diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome: the rotterdam criteria are premature [^112dsYi8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined most commonly according to the proceedings of an expert conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in April 1990, which noted the disorder as having 1) hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, 2) oligoovulation, and 3) exclusion of known disorders. Alternatively, another expert conference held in Rotterdam in May 2003 defined PCOS, after the exclusion of related disorders, by two of the following three features: 1) oligo- or anovulation, 2) clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, or 3) polycystic ovaries. In essence, the Rotterdam 2003 expanded the NIH 1990 definition creating two new phenotypes: 1) ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism, and 2) oligoanovulatory women with polycystic ovaries, but without hyperandrogenism.

Objective

The objective of this study was to ascertain the validity of using the Rotterdam 2003 criteria rather than the NIH 1991 criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS.

Intervention(S)

Interventions included the use of the Rotterdam 2003 criteria for diagnosing PCOS and, in particular, the proposal to define two new phenotypes as PCOS. POSITIONS: Available data suggest that hyperandrogenic ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries tend to have mild insulin resistance and mild evidence of ovarian dysfunction, although significantly less than women with anovulatory PCOS. However, whether these women will have an increased risk of infertility or metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes, remains to be determined. Alternatively, the risk of insulin resistance and long-term metabolic risks of oligoovulatory women with polycystic ovaries is even less well characterized and may be nonexistent.

Conclusions

Because of the paucity of data on the two new phenotypes and their long-term implications and the potential negative impact on research, clinical practice, and patient insurability, the adoption of the Rotterdam 2003 criteria for defining PCOS should be considered premature. However, because polycystic ovaries are a frequent feature of PCOS, a modification of the NIH 1990 criteria is proposed. Additional research characterizing the phenotypes and associated morbidities of PCOS is urgently required.

Hirsutism/acne/alopecia — clinical markers and management in PCOS are described: Hirsutism is a good marker for hyperandrogenism and is present in approximately 70% of women with PCOS, and hyperandrogenemia should be evaluated biochemically in all women suspected of having PCOS; by comparison, acne and alopecia are not commonly associated with hyperandrogenemia and therefore should not be regarded as evidence of hyperandrogenemia; for women with PCOS in whom hirsutism is a major concern, treatment is focused on reduction of androgen production, decreasing the fraction of circulating free testosterone (T), and limiting androgen bioactivity to hair follicles; in those women with PCOS who have acne vulgaris, clinical benefit may be derived from many systemic therapeutic modalities; and because terminal hair turnover occurs slowly, at least 6 months of treatment is generally considered the minimal interval to see a response.

### Interventions for hirsutism (excluding laser and photoepilation therapy alone) [^112WKwR3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism occurs in 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age when there is excessive terminal hair growth in androgen-sensitive areas (male pattern). It is a distressing disorder with a major impact on quality of life. The most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome. There are many treatment options, but it is not clear which are most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (except laser and light-based therapies alone) for hirsutism.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and five trials registers, and checked reference lists of included studies for additional trials. The last search was in June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in hirsute women with polycystic ovary syndrome, idiopathic hirsutism, or idiopathic hyperandrogenism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors carried out study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses.

Main Results

We included 157 studies (sample size 30 to 80) comprising 10,550 women (mean age 25 years). The majority of studies (123/157) were 'high', 30 'unclear', and four 'low' risk of bias. Lack of blinding was the most frequent source of bias. Treatment duration was six to 12 months. Forty-eight studies provided no usable or retrievable data, i.e. lack of separate data for hirsute women, conference proceedings, and losses to follow-up above 40%. Primary outcomes, 'participant-reported improvement of hirsutism' and 'change in health-related quality of life', were addressed in few studies, and adverse events in only half. In most comparisons there was insufficient evidence to determine if the number of reported adverse events differed. These included known adverse events: gastrointestinal discomfort, breast tenderness, reduced libido, dry skin (flutamide and finasteride); irregular bleeding (spironolactone); nausea, diarrhoea, bloating (metformin); hot flushes, decreased libido, vaginal dryness, headaches (gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues)). Clinician's evaluation of hirsutism and change in androgen levels were addressed in most comparisons, change in body mass index (BMI) and improvement of other clinical signs of hyperandrogenism in one-third of studies. The quality of evidence was moderate to very low for most outcomes. There was low quality evidence for the effect of two oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (ethinyl estradiol + cyproterone acetate versus ethinyl estradiol + desogestrel) on change from baseline of Ferriman-Gallwey scores. The mean difference (MD) was -1.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.86 to 0.18). There was very low quality evidence that flutamide 250 mg, twice daily, reduced Ferriman-Gallwey scores more effectively than placebo (MD -7.60, 95% CI -10.53 to -4.67 and MD -7.20, 95% CI -10.15 to -4.25). Participants' evaluations in one study with 20 participants confirmed these results (risk ratio (RR) 17.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 259.87). Spironolactone 100 mg daily was more effective than placebo in reducing Ferriman-Gallwey scores (MD -7.69, 95% CI -10.12 to -5.26) (low quality evidence). It showed similar effectiveness to flutamide in two studies (MD -1.90, 95% CI -5.01 to 1.21 and MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.99 to 2.97) (very low quality evidence), as well as to finasteride in two studies (MD 1.49, 95% CI -0.58 to 3.56 and MD 0.40, 95% CI -1.18 to 1.98) (low quality evidence). Although there was very low quality evidence of a difference in reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores for finasteride 5 mg to 7.5 mg daily versus placebo (MD -5.73, 95% CI -6.87 to -4.58), it was unlikely it was clinically meaningful. These results were reinforced by participants' assessments (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.29 and RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.69 to 175.86). However, finasteride showed inconsistent results in comparisons with other treatments, and no firm conclusions could be reached. Metformin demonstrated no benefit over placebo in reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores (MD 0.05, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.12), but the quality of evidence was low. Results regarding the effectiveness of GnRH analogues were inconsistent, varying from minimal to important improvements. We were unable to pool data for OCPs with cyproterone acetate 20 mg to 100 mg due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies. However, addition of cyproterone acetate to OCPs provided greater reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores. Two studies, comparing finasteride 5 mg and spironolactone 100 mg, did not show differences in participant assessments and reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores (low quality evidence). Ferriman-Gallwey scores from three studies comparing flutamide versus metformin could not be pooled (I² = 62%). One study comparing flutamide 250 mg twice daily with metformin 850 mg twice daily for 12 months, which reached a higher cumulative dosage than two other studies evaluating this comparison, showed flutamide to be more effective (MD -6.30, 95% CI -9.83 to -2.77) (very low quality evidence). Data showing reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores could not be pooled for four studies comparing finasteride with flutamide as the results were inconsistent (I² = 67%). Studies examining effects of hypocaloric diets reported reductions in BMI, but which did not result in reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores. Although certain cosmetic measures are commonly used, we did not identify any relevant RCTs.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatments may need to incorporate pharmacological therapies, cosmetic procedures, and psychological support. For mild hirsutism there is evidence of limited quality that OCPs are effective. Flutamide 250 mg twice daily and spironolactone 100 mg daily appeared to be effective and safe, albeit the evidence was low to very low quality. Finasteride 5 mg daily showed inconsistent results in different comparisons, therefore no firm conclusions can be made. As the side effects of antiandrogens and finasteride are well known, these should be accounted for in any clinical decision-making. There was low quality evidence that metformin was ineffective for hirsutism and although GnRH analogues showed inconsistent results in reducing hirsutism they do have significant side effects. Further research should consist of well-designed, rigorously reported, head-to-head trials examining OCPs combined with antiandrogens or 5α-reductase inhibitor against OCP monotherapy, as well as the different antiandrogens and 5α-reductase inhibitors against each other. Outcomes should be based on standardised scales of participants' assessment of treatment efficacy, with a greater emphasis on change in quality of life as a result of treatment.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^112qun1R]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset hypogonadism — consensus statement: Adult-onset hypogonadism is a measurable syndrome characterized by low testosterone, associated symptoms, and low or normal gonadotropin levels. Men with adult-onset hypogonadism who are candidates for treatment with testosterone should be counseled regarding the benefits and risks of treatment. Patients who are treated should be monitored regularly.

Risk factors for T2D in PCOS — those women who have both androgen excess and anovulation are most vulnerable to developing metabolic dysfunction, including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), whereas women with only polycystic ovaries, PCOS with anovulation but without androgen excess, or hyperandrogenism with regular menses usually have normal insulin sensitivity and metabolic status and presumably are not at the same increased risk; other contributors to diabetes risk include obesity and a family history of T2D.

### Circulating dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, and free testosterone levels and dihydrotestosterone-to-testosterone ratios in healthy women across the menstrual cycle [^113RY3XB]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the circulating androgen levels across the menstrual cycle in healthy women using highly sensitive and accurate methods and report sex differences in the relative levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to testosterone (T) levels.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Research clinic, academic teaching hospital.

Patient(S)

Twenty-one healthy premenopausal women, aged 19–40 years, with regular menstrual cycles.

Intervention(S)

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Serum total T and DHT levels measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, free T levels measured using a standardized equilibrium dialysis method coupled with measurement of the T levels in the dialysate using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and comparison of the DHT-to-T ratio between healthy women and age-matched healthy men.

Result(S)

The serum total and free T levels increased across the follicular phase and peaked at midcycle (total T, 43.6 ± 16.2 ng/dL; free T, 15.6 ± 11.9 pg/mL) and gradually declined in the luteal phase. The DHT level did not significantly change across the menstrual cycle. The DHT-to-T ratios were 1:4 and 1:13 in women and men, respectively.

Conclusion(S)

In healthy premenopausal women, the total and free T levels varied significantly across the menstrual cycle, whereas the DHT levels did not change; the peak total and free T levels in the midcycle period were higher than previously reported, underscoring the importance of establishing menstrual phase-specific reference ranges to avoid misdiagnosis of hyperandrogenism. Women have significantly higher DHT levels relative to total T than men; the significance of this sex difference in the DHT-to-T ratio needs further investigation.

### Correlation between biochemical and clinical hyperandrogenism parameter in polycystic ovary syndrome in relation to age [^1157teDF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Supplement Table 1 shows the comparison of clinical characteristics between the 18–29 and 30–40 year-old groups. PCOS patients aged 18–29 years old presented with a significantly higher mF-G score (4.63 vs. 3.12, P = 0.002) than PCOS patients aged 30–40 years, especially in the lower abdomen (0.90 vs. 0.57, P = 0.007), upper arms (0.36 vs. 0.08, P < 0.001), upper back (0.20 vs. 0.04, P = 0.013), and lower back (0.29 vs. 0.10, P = 0.017). Moreover, PCOS patients aged 18–29 years presented with increased acne, especially in the face and chest. The younger patients had higher levels of biochemical hyperandrogenism. Of these parameters, androstenedione, DHEA, and DHEA-S levels were significantly higher among the younger patients.

Table 1 shows the correlation between mF-G levels and biochemical hyperandrogenism. Considering all 256 study participants, mF-G was positively correlated with FAI (r = 0.316, P < 0.001), DHEA (r = 0.145, P = 0.02), and DHEA-S (r = 0.142, P = 0.023). After selection by BSR, multiple regression showed that mF-G was associated with FAI (beta = 0.20, t = 5.05, p < 0.001) and DHEA (beta = 0.16, t = 2.36, p = 0.019) in all study participants. In those aged 18–29 years (n = 164), mF-G was positively correlated with FAI (r = 0.353, P < 0.001). However, mF-G was less positively correlated with DHEA-S (r = 0.206, P = 0.048) in those aged 30–40 years (n = 92).

### Differences in age-adjusted testosterone levels… [^112wbkVs]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor In their Teachable Moment in a recent issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, 1 Drs Akturk and Nippoldt send the important message that the patient, rather than the testosterone level, should be the indication for exogenous testosterone therapy. That message deserves expansion. Although age-adjusted testosterone levels are not routinely used clinically, it should be acknowledged that total testosterone levels fall at about 1. 6% per year and free bioavaliable testosterone levels decease by
2. 0% to 3. 0% per yer. 2 Therefore, a serum testosterone level of 220 ng/dL in a 45-year-old patient may carry different implications than the same level in a 75-year-old patient. The clinical interpretation is made more cumbersome because of the recognized overlap of symptoms between hypogonadism and normal aging.

Age-related testosterone levels have the potential to make testosterone prescribing in elderly patients more judicious and to prevent oversubscribing by reacting to the "number" without context.
