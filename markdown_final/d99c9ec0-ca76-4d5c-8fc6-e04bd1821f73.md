## Question

anemia with high rdw

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate anemia when the red cell distribution width (RDW) is elevated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming anemia and the significance of RDW. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis by integrating RDW with MCV and reticulocyte count. Next, I will examine iron deficiency anemia (IDA) versus thalassemia trait, followed by macrocytic and normocytic etiologies. After that, I need to check for mixed or complex causes and systemic contributors. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic algorithm, acknowledge prognostic implications, and note special populations and limitations, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the presence and severity of anemia and the meaning of RDW. Anemia is typically defined by hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal for age, sex, and pregnancy status, so I should verify the laboratory's reference interval and the patient's baseline before proceeding [^116SeqRE]. RDW quantifies anisocytosis and is reported as RDW-CV (%) or RDW-SD (fL); an elevated RDW signals heterogeneous red cell size and often reflects nutritional deficiency, hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, or inflammation, so I need to ensure I interpret RDW alongside MCV and reticulocyte parameters rather than in isolation [^1169piWe] [^111jjGLk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should classify by MCV next. Microcytosis (MCV < 80 fL) narrows the field to iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of chronic disease, whereas macrocytosis (MCV > 100 fL) points toward B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, alcohol, medications, or myelodysplasia, and normocytosis broadens to mixed etiologies or early disease. I should double-check that the analyzer's MCV is electronically measured and reliable before anchoring on this axis [^117NHQFZ] [^115u8PZ8].

> I will now examine iron deficiency anemia, where RDW is typically elevated early and may precede MCV decline. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance: RDW > 15% has modest standalone sensitivity/specificity, but pairing RDW with hemoglobin improves accuracy. In children, combining Hb ≤ 10 g/dL with RDW > 15% yields high sensitivity and specificity for IDA, and a brisk hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within 2 weeks of iron therapy strongly supports absolute iron deficiency even if iron studies are equivocal [^113BLgw2] [^116zAhLb] [^114J4SK1]. I should confirm iron deficiency with ferritin and transferrin saturation, remembering ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may be misleading in inflammation, and consider reticulocyte hemoglobin content or soluble transferrin receptor when available to refine the diagnosis [^115gs2r8] [^117DEawE].

> But wait, what if the microcytosis reflects thalassemia trait rather than iron deficiency. RDW is often normal or only mildly elevated in thalassemia trait, whereas IDA shows a higher RDW; I should confirm with RBC count, which tends to be elevated in thalassemia due to microcytosis with preserved or increased RBC mass, and consider simple indices or, when needed, hemoglobin electrophoresis for definitive differentiation, especially in at-risk populations [^117NHQFZ] [^1135enbt].

> Next, I should review macrocytic etiologies. High RDW with macrocytosis suggests megaloblastic processes (B12/folate deficiency), liver disease or alcohol use, or myelodysplastic syndrome. I need to check B12, methylmalonic acid, and folate, review alcohol and medication history, and assess liver function, and if cytopenias or dysplasia are present, I should consider bone marrow evaluation for MDS, where RDW is commonly elevated and reticulocytes are inappropriately low for the degree of anemia [^114EUrzm] [^1169piWe].

> Let me consider normocytic anemia with elevated RDW. This pattern often reflects mixed etiologies such as combined iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease, early nutritional deficiency, hemolysis, or bone marrow stress from systemic illness. I should confirm with reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, LDH, and bilirubin to assess for hemolysis, and use CRP or ESR to gauge inflammation, recognizing that RDW correlates with inflammatory activity in several conditions and may rise even without frank anemia in inflammatory states [^111jjGLk] [^113ykYfu].

> I need to ensure I do not miss complex or mixed causes. Concurrent iron deficiency plus anemia of chronic disease can yield microcytosis or normocytosis with elevated RDW; chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease frequently produce mixed anemias with high RDW, so I should review comorbidities, medications, and organ function and, when indicated, pursue disease-specific pathways such as IBD-focused iron studies or CKD-related erythropoietin deficiency workups [^111Y5frp] [^112f5qvS].

> Let me first confirm the prognostic implications because elevated RDW carries risk beyond diagnosis. High RDW independently associates with mortality across diverse settings, including community cohorts, ICU populations, heart failure, CKD, and COVID-19; in COVID-19, admission RDW > 14.5% conferred a 2.73-fold higher mortality risk and rising RDW during hospitalization tracked worse outcomes, so I should document RDW trends and integrate them into risk discussions and follow-up planning [^114F37x4] [^116K6z5f] [^117GYqDU].

> Next, I should review special populations and caveats. In pediatrics, RDW can help screen for IDA, but performance varies by age and setting, and combining RDW with hemoglobin improves accuracy. In older adults, RDW elevation predicts fractures and mortality independent of anemia. In cirrhosis, macrocytosis and RDW elevation are common and traditional RBC indices may be less reliable for iron deficiency screening, so I should tailor testing and thresholds to the clinical context [^116zAhLb] [^114Xk977] [^1179FRpv] [^116GfecD].

> I will now outline a practical diagnostic algorithm and double-check each branch. Start with CBC, RDW, MCV, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear. If MCV is microcytic, prioritize iron studies and thalassemia evaluation. If macrocytic, assess B12/folate, liver disease, alcohol, and consider MDS. If normocytic with high RDW, evaluate for hemolysis, inflammation, mixed etiologies, and systemic disease. Throughout, use reticulocyte index to distinguish hypoproliferation from hemolysis and escalate to marrow evaluation when cytopenias or dysplasia are present [^1169piWe] [^111Y5frp] [^114EUrzm].

> Hold on, I should verify that my plan aligns with guideline-based care. ECCO and BSG endorse structured anemia workups incorporating RBC indices, reticulocytes, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP, with BSG emphasizing that a hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within 2 weeks of iron therapy strongly supports absolute iron deficiency. This reinforces the value of integrating RDW with clinical response to therapy when iron studies are indeterminate [^115gs2r8] [^114J4SK1].

> In summary, anemia with elevated RDW signals heterogeneous red cell size and should trigger a stepwise evaluation: confirm anemia, classify by MCV, interpret reticulocyte response, and layer in iron studies, hemolysis markers, and disease-specific tests. RDW is both a diagnostic clue and a prognostic marker, so I need to track trends, consider mixed etiologies, and adapt thresholds to special populations to avoid misclassification and to anticipate risk [^1169piWe] [^114F37x4].

Anemia with high RDW reflects **anisocytosis** (red cell size variation) and signals **nutritional deficiency** (iron, B12, folate), hemolysis, or marrow stress [^1169piWe] [^111jjGLk]. High RDW is common in **iron deficiency anemia** and often rises before MCV falls, aiding early detection [^111Y5frp] [^113BLgw2]. It is also elevated in megaloblastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, and chronic inflammation, and is a strong independent predictor of mortality and adverse outcomes across many conditions [^112a7PzD] [^114F37x4]. Evaluation should pair RDW with MCV, reticulocyte count, iron studies, B12/folate, and hemolysis markers to pinpoint the cause and guide therapy [^115gs2r8].

---

## Pathophysiology of high RDW in anemia

High RDW reflects **heterogeneous red cell size** (anisocytosis) from multiple mechanisms:

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Iron, B12, or folate deficiency cause microcytosis or macrocytosis with anisocytosis [^114AKt1p].
- **Hemolysis**: Premature release of variably sized reticulocytes increases RDW [^113ydnkf].
- **Marrow stress**: Inflammation or ineffective erythropoiesis produces heterogeneous red cells [^114DU9GQ].
- **Mixed anemia**: Combined deficiencies or hemolysis plus marrow stress further widen size variation [^111Y5frp].

---

## Clinical significance of high RDW in anemia

High RDW is a **sensitive marker of early iron deficiency**, often rising before MCV declines [^116u1qWg]. It is also elevated in megaloblastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, and anemia of chronic inflammation [^111jjGLk]. Beyond anemia typing, high RDW independently predicts mortality and adverse outcomes in cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, and COVID-19 [^114F37x4] [^115vEnBf] [^117GYqDU].

## Diagnostic approach to anemia with high RDW

A **structured approach** is essential:

1. **CBC with RDW and MCV**: Classify anemia and assess anisocytosis [^1169piWe]
2. **Reticulocyte count**: Assess marrow response; elevated in hemolysis or acute blood loss [^111Y5frp]
3. **Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation)**: Identify iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease [^117DEawE]
4. **Vitamin B12 and folate levels**: Detect megaloblastic anemia [^115u8PZ8]
5. **Hemolysis markers (LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, Coombs test)**: Confirm hemolysis [^114AKt1p]
6. **Peripheral smear**: Visualize anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, schistocytes [^114EUrzm]
7. **Additional tests (e.g. soluble transferrin receptor, bone marrow biopsy)**: Clarify complex or refractory cases [^117DEawE]

---

## Common causes of anemia with high RDW

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Microcytic, hypochromic with high RDW; early marker of iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^116u1qWg].
- **Megaloblastic anemia**: Macrocytic with high RDW from B12/folate deficiency [^1178UgH1].
- **Hemolytic anemia**: Elevated RDW from reticulocytosis and size heterogeneity [^111jjGLk].
- **Anemia of chronic inflammation**: Normocytic or mildly microcytic with high RDW from iron sequestration and inflammation [^111Y5frp].
- **Mixed anemia**: Combined deficiencies or hemolysis plus marrow stress [^111Y5frp].

---

## Prognostic implications of high RDW in anemia

High RDW is a robust, independent predictor of mortality and adverse outcomes across diverse populations, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, and COVID-19 [^114F37x4] [^115vEnBf] [^117GYqDU] [^116K6z5f]. Mechanisms likely include **oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired erythropoiesis** [^1115bkbC].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Iron deficiency**: Iron replacement (oral or IV) and treat the source of blood loss [^notfound].
- **Megaloblastic anemia**: B12/folate replacement [^notfound].
- **Hemolysis**: Treat the cause (e.g. immunosuppression, splenectomy, transfusion) [^notfound].
- **Anemia of chronic disease**: Treat the inflammatory condition; consider erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in selected cases [^notfound].

---

Anemia with high RDW signals **anisocytosis** from nutritional deficiency, hemolysis, or marrow stress and is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. A structured workup pairing RDW with MCV, reticulocytes, iron studies, B12/folate, and hemolysis markers enables accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

Regression models for short-term mortality

With hierarchic modeling, we found that RDW used as a continuous variable was significantly associated with both in-hospital and ICU mortality. The association remained significant after adjusting for SAPS, age, gender, hematocrit, and different comorbidities, including anemia, in a multivariable model (Table 2). Of note, the odds ratio corresponds to a 1-unit (1%) increase in RDW. In both models, RDW was a significant outcome predictor independent of SAPS. We further analyzed the association between RDW and mortality in different predefined subgroups: gender, different age categories, SAPS quartiles, anemia, hematocrit quartiles, and renal failure. Figure 3 shows estimates for the different subgroups. Of note, the results proved to be robust across the different subgroups, particularly also in anemia patients and patients with different hematocrit values.

The multivariable hierarchic model is adjusted for age, gender, hematocrit, and different comorbidities (anemia, renal failure, chronic heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, valvular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, lung embolism, pneumonia, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, paralysis, other neurologic diseases, diabetes, hypothyroidism, liver disease, peptic ulcer, HIV, lymphoma, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, coagulopathy, obesity, weight loss, electrolyte disturbance, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, psychosis, depression).

Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### The association between hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio and asthma and asthma exacerbations: a cross-sectional study [^116e2HLC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease worldwide, characterized by reversible airway constriction and hyperresponsiveness. Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database indicates that in 2019, approximately 262 million people were affected by asthma, with its incidence continuing to rise. One of the most severe consequences of asthma is exacerbation, also known as an asthma attack, which results in a substantial number of emergency department visits. This imposes a significant burden on global healthcare resources and the economy. Therefore, identifying accessible, cost-effective, and highly sensitive biomarkers for asthma and its exacerbations holds significant clinical value.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters have become valuable tools in asthma research in recent years due to their non-invasive nature, affordability, and accessibility. Among them, eosinophil count is recognized as a key biomarker of asthma-related inflammation, with elevated levels often associated with disease exacerbation and chronic inflammation. However, eosinophil count exhibits limited sensitivity at low levels, restricting its predictive utility across all asthma patients. Additionally, RDW an indicator of erythrocyte volume heterogeneity, has been linked to systemic inflammation and hypoxic conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated its association with the prevalence and mortality of several inflammatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatic diseases, sepsis, and heart failure. Similarly, hemoglobin (HGB) primarily functions as an oxygen transport molecule and is widely used as a key biochemical marker for diagnosing anemia.

The HRR is an innovative composite biomarker that integrates HGB and RDW, providing comprehensive information on oxygen transport and inflammation. HRR was initially introduced in cancer research, and has since been demonstrated to be associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, offering greater comprehensiveness and reliability compared to HGB or RDW alone. HRR is influenced by both its components: hemoglobin levels can be altered by anemia, chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies, or hypoxia, while RDW tends to increase under conditions of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, or disrupted erythropoiesis. These factors make HRR a composite marker that captures both oxygen transport capacity and systemic inflammatory burden. Compared to RDW or HGB alone, HRR may offer improved stability and interpretability in reflecting chronic inflammatory conditions. Therefore, HRR may serve as an integrative marker reflecting both oxygen delivery and inflammatory burden.

Given the complex pathological characteristics of asthma and the interplay between systemic inflammation and hypoxia, we hypothesize that HRR may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing disease status in asthma patients. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HRR, asthma, and asthma exacerbations.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of ⁵⁹Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing ⁵⁹Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

Table 2
Published studies/clinical trials evaluating the role of red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel diseases

The first study published in 2008 by Molnar et al was a retrospective study, complementary to that of Clarke et al, that aimed to highlight any relation between RDW and disease activity. The investigators intended to clarify whether its quantitative fluctuations could be correlated with laboratory markers of inflammation and/or clinical indices of activity. They also tried to evaluate the potential of RDW to differentiate CD from UC in both the active state and remission. Mean values of RDW were significantly elevated in the active form of both CD and UC and also in inactive CD cases compared to the normal values of RDW (RDW 11–14%). The authors concluded that RDW could be used as an additional marker able to express active disease, based on the fact that its value was remarkably related to clinical activity indices.

Cakal et al performed a cross-sectional study with primary outcome the evaluation of RDW's potential in the assessment of active disease in IBD patients. In patients with active disease, laboratory indices (RDW, fibrinogen, CRP, ESR, and platelet [PLT] counts) had significantly higher values compared to those with inactive disease and controls (P < 0.05). RDW was the most sensitive and specific parameter indicating active disease in patients with UC. In CD patients, CRP at a cutoff of 0.54 mg/dL was the most accurate parameter in the diagnosis of active disease: sensitivity 92%, specificity 63% (area under the curve 0.92, P = 0.001).

Oustamanolakis et al performed a cross-sectional study to investigate the usefulness of RBC and reticulocyte indices in the evaluation of anemia in IBD patients. Activity was evaluated using the Crohn's disease activity index along with the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) and CRP. The study's results showed that RDW behaved as an accurate diagnostic marker of IDA. Despite the observation that RDW was elevated in the IBD group compared to healthy controls, there were no significant discrepancies between active and inactive disease, while no important correlation with CRP was found.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^11345yZ1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the association of RDW with major composite CV outcomes and mortality in patients with CKD. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower LVEF levels, lower hemoglobin levels, lower albumin levels, and higher serum creatinine levels compared with the normal RDW group. RDW levels exhibited a graded increase across different stages of CKD. RDW ≥ 14.5% was associated with a significantly higher incidence of major composite CV outcomes and a trend toward higher mortality. A greater than 2-fold risk of major composite CV outcomes was observed in the elevated RDW group (HR = 2.581, CI = 1.541–4.322, P < .001). Age and impaired LVEF were additional covariates that were independent predictors of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. The incidence of outcomes is higher than that reported in a previous study, because our patients were confirmed to have CAD.

Patients with higher RDW levels are often considered to have erythropoietic stress. In the general population, patients with higher RDW levels are likely to be older and have smoking habits, higher body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, lower mean corpuscular volume, and higher serum creatinine levels. Elevated RDW was correlated with higher serum levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a larger left atrium, and lower LVEF values in patients with CV risk. RDW levels were also positively associated with C-reactive protein, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, and fibrinogen and negatively associated with albumin levels. Consequently, RDW was supposed to be a marker of inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status.

The pathophysiology of elevated RDW toward unfavorable CV outcomes has not been elucidated. Anemia and elevated serum creatinine, commonly occurring in patients with CKD, were risk factors for CV events. Our results reveal that the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes was independent of hemoglobin and creatinine levels. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies, which have reported that the level of RDW, even within the normal reference range, was associated with a higher risk of CV events and mortality irrespective of anemia, ferritin levels, and renal impairment. There should be other explanations for the poor prognostic effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. Two novel risk factors for CV events, oxidative stress and inflammation, could be possible underlying mechanisms.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^111p1tpc]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Other studies found the sensitivity of RDW to be very high (96–100%) in detecting iron deficiency anemia. On the contrary, there is a report of a limited specificity of RDW for diagnosis of IDA among children with microcytic hypochromic anemia. At a cut-off value of 17.4%, as obtained from the ROC curve, the sensitivity and specificity of RDW in diagnosis of IDA were 81.0% and 53.4% and a positive and negative predictive value of 63.0% and 72.2%, respectively.

One of the other approaches used to predict IDA is the use of indexes such as Mentzler's, discriminant function, Srivastava's, Shine and Lal's, MCV/MCH indices which are based on many hematological parameters instead of one. In our study also, when we used Hb and RDW together the sensitivity and specificity improved considerably with high positive and negative predictive values. These data suggest that the combined approach of using Hb ≤ 10 g/dL and RDW > 15% (sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 90.5% and negative predictive value of 98.9%) performs well obviating the need for using expensive biochemical tests for diagnosing iron deficiency anemia in a low resource setting.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113sYkxy]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have demonstrated that red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often anemic and have high RDW levels. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes among patients with CKD.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients with CKD who were admitted to the department of cardiology of a tertiary hospital in 2011. The patients were divided into 2 groups: normal RDW (RDW < 14.5%) and elevated RDW (RDW ≥ 14.5%). Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, blood investigation results, prescriptions, and outcomes were analyzed after a 3-year follow-up period. Six adjustment levels were performed to evaluate the effect of RDW on outcomes.

Results

This study involved 282 patients with CKD: 213 in the elevated RDW group and 69 in the normal RDW group. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values, lower hemoglobin levels, lower serum albumin levels, and higher creatinine levels, compared with the normal RDW group. A linear trend was observed toward higher RDW in patients with deteriorating renal function. In the final adjusted model, RDW ≥ 14.5%, older age, and lower LVEF were associated with an increased risk of major composite CV outcomes.

Conclusion

RDW is a potentially useful cost-effective indicator of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^114rKA1g]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by persistent and progressive airway inflammation and/or emphysema. This causes airflow limitation, resulting in symptoms like coughing, mucus production, wheezing, and shortness of breath. According to statistics, COPD has become one of the top three causes of death in the world, and many patients have died from it or its complications. In 2019, more than 3.3 million people died from COPD which was the primary cause of deaths from COPD. The global burden of mortality in COPD patients remains substantial, affecting a significant number of individuals worldwide. This disease poses substantial challenges for both patients and healthcare systems, under-scoring the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors to improve outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a simple and inexpensive hematological parameter that reflects the degree of heterogeneity in red blood cell volume, has been traditionally used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of anemia. As a dynamic parameter responsive to internal and external stimuli, RDW levels provide a sensitive gauge of the body's homeostatic mechanisms. Clinical studies have shown that RDW is associated with various diseases and disease outcomes, and RDW is now recognized as a strong independent risk factor for mortality in the general population. Over the past 20 years, multiple studies have confirmed that patients with stable COPD and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease (AECOPD) have higher RDW levels compared with healthy individual. Furthermore, some studies have confirmed that RDW is related to mortality in patients with COPD. Hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) is a new combined biomarker proposed by Sun et al. in their study on the progression of non-small cell lung cancer. HRR is considered an inflammatory marker and is associated with the incidence and adverse events of a variety of diseases. However, the relationship between HRR and mortality in patients with COPD remains unclear. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether HRR is a better predictor of mortality compared to RDW in these patients.

Consequently, our primary objective is to evaluate the association of RDW and HRR with mortality in COPD patients, and to compare their predictive roles for mortality in these patients.

### Red blood cell distribution width: an emerging diagnostic factor of acute appendicitis? [^114WhFUG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Dear editor

We read with great interest the article 'The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study' by Narci et al. They aimed to evaluate whether red cell distribution width (RDW) has a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The authors concluded that if compared to healthy controls, RDW levels were lower in patients with acute appendicitis. Being inexpensive and easy attainability of this parameter may strengthen its utilization in daily practice in the near future. We would like to thank the authors for their contribution.

RDW which is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, is an automated measure of the variability of red blood cell size. Previously it was shown that, RDW is an independent variable of prognosis in patients with cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, strokes, and pulmonary hypertension. In addition, it was also found to be related to mortality and other severe adverse outcomes in renal and infectious diseases. Aging, malnutrition, Iron or vitamin B12 deficiency, bone marrow depression, or chronic inflammation may affect RDW levels. Thus, it would have been better, if the authors had mentioned these RDW affecting factors.

In a previous study, two novel biomarkers, calprotectin (CP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were found to be related to acute appendicitis. Recent studies have demonstrated that Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and mean platelet volume (MPV) are also associated with inflammatory diseases. In this view, it would also be relevant, if the authors included these parameters in the study.

We are of the opinion that the findings of Narci et al. will lead to further research concerning the relationship between RDW and acute appendicitis. Nevertheless, RDW should be considered with other inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, calprotectin) to provide certain information about the inflammatory status of the patient.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a predictive marker for coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease [^114ea4z9]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW), which is a marker of variation in the size of circulating erythrocytes (anisocytosis), is routinely measured in clinical practice as part of the complete blood count (CBC). Traditionally, RDW is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia. In 2007, Felker et al. first discovered that an increase in RDW is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. Growing interest has been expressed in the clinical value of RDW. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that a higher RDW is a prognostic factor for various cardiovascular system diseases, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery ectasia, and congenital heart disease. However, studies on the relationship between RDW and CALs in patients with KD are limited, and these studies mainly focus on the RDW coefficient of variation (RDW-CV). RDW-CV is calculated by dividing the standard deviation (SD) of red blood cell (RBC) volume by mean erythrocyte volume and multiplying by 100% to express the result as a percentage. Because information might be lost by expressing RDW relative to MCV, Hoffmann et al. proposed that future studies on the prognostic value of RDW should focus on RDW-SD. Tonelli et al. suggested that RDW-SD may be more useful as a prognostic marker than RDW-CV in the general population. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between RDW, including RDW-CV and RDW-SD, and CALs in patients with KD.

### Red cell distribution width is a risk factor for hip fracture in elderly men without anemia [^114Xk977]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW), routinely assessed as a component of a complete blood count (CBC), quantifies the variation in the size of red blood cells. It increases with age, and increased RDW predicts many aging-related diseases and mortality. However, whether it also predicts hip fracture is unknown. We prospectively evaluated the association between RDW and hip fracture using data from the Osteoporotic Fracture in Men (MrOS) study. RDW was measured in 3635 men (aged 71 to 99years) along with bone mineral density (BMD) in MrOS. RDW ranged from 11.3% to 32.9% (median 14.0%; interquartile range 13.5% to 14.8%) and was categorized into four groups (≤ 13.0%, 13.1% to 14.0%, 14.1% to 15.0%, ≥ 15.1%). Study participants with a hemoglobin level < 13.0g/dL were classified as having anemia. During an average 8.1years, 164 men suffered hip fractures. The risks of hip fractures increased with increase of RDW category. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between anemia and RDW: An association between RDW and hip fractures was only observed in participants without anemia. In those without anemia, the relative hazard of hip fractures increased with increases in RDW category: Men in the highest RDW category had a 2.8 times higher risk of hip fractures than men in the lowest group (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 7.1). The risks of all-clinical fractures were also increased along with higher RDW values. Additionally, RDW was significantly associated with the risk of having a fall but not with femoral neck or total hip BMD. In conclusion, RDW and anemia defined by hemoglobin are widely available routine laboratory measurements that together could indicate increased risk of hip fracture, reflecting the neuromuscular effects of aging rather than lower hip BMD. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^111LbkCv]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The association of RDW and complicated hospitalization

Ninety five (55.6%) patients with complicated hospitalization had increased RDW as compared with 123 (26%) patients with uncomplicated admissions (P < 0.0001).

Complicated hospitalization and mortality rates were significantly higher among patients with increased RDW regardless of the WBC count (Figure 1); the complicated hospitalization rate was 15.7% in patients with normal RDW and WBC and 20.3% in patients with only abnormal WBC count, as compared with 33.3% in patients with elevated RDW alone (P = 0.001) and 51.2% in patients with combined abnormal leukocyte count and increased RDW (P < 0.001). As shown in Figure 1, the 90-day mortality was higher in patients with elevated RDW regardless of the WBC count; however, once again the combination of abnormal WBC and elevated RDW was significantly associated with the highest mortality rates.

Figure 1
The association between the mortality rate and complicated with RDW and the different white blood cell groups. RDW, red cell width distribution; WBC, white blood cells.

In order to rule out the possibility that RDW effect on severe morbidity and mortality was unrelated to anemia, we compared complicated hospitalization in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) levels less than 110 g/L and higher levels of Hb. The two groups were examined in patients with normal and elevated RDW. As depicted in Figure 2, patients with normal RDW had no difference in severe morbidity or mortality regardless of Hb levels. On the other hand, elevated RDW was associated with a significant increase in both complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality rates irrespective of Hb levels.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^114usJdE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

At present, the specific mechanism underlying the association between RDW, HRR, and mortality remains unclear. As far as we know, the underlying mechanism mainly includes the following aspects: Firstly, research showed that high RDW levels are associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory status. Oxidative stress exerts a significant impact on erythrocyte homeostasis and survival. Consequently, it is plausible that oxidative stress serves as an additional underlying biological mechanism contributing to the elevation of RDW, possibly by accelerating red cell turnover. This, in turn, contributes to the association between anisocytosis and pathological conditions in humans. Inflammation has the potential to influence iron metabolism and bone marrow function, thereby impeding the maturation of erythrocytes induced by erythropoietin. As a result, immature red blood cells are released into circulation, disrupting the clearance process and leading to an increase in RDW. Secondly, elevated RDW is associated with various comorbidities in patients with COPD, such as right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and CVD. The presence of these comorbidities also contributes to an increased risk of mortality in patients with COPD. Other mechanisms that may contribute to increased mortality include hypoxemia, poor nutritional status, and association with exacerbations of COPD. Furthermore, studies have confirmed that hemoglobin levels are associated with the prognosis of patients with COPD, and anemia is associated with adverse outcomes in these patients. Low hemoglobin levels serve as crucial indicators of inflammation processes. HRR is a combined index calculated from hemoglobin and RDW. Therefore, HRR can also reflect the association between these two indicators and COPD. Naturally, additional studies will be required to validate these findings in the future.

### A novel discriminating tool for microcytic anemia in childhood [^1111iHR7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurate and timely interpretation of microcytic anemia can be diagnostically challenging in the primary care setting. We sought to develop a novel model for distinguishing iron-deficiency anemia from thalassemia trait in the modern pediatric population. Demographic history and red blood cell indices were retrospectively characterized for 76 children referred to our pediatric hematology clinic for evaluation of microcytic anemia. Statistically significant variables were sequentially added into a logistic regression model to develop the final model. The final discriminating model incorporates red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell values. Favorable predictive performance is seen in the initial (sensitivity 89.2%, specificity 92.3%) and external validation cohort (sensitivity 84.4%, specificity 88.9%). This novel tool may aid in determining the cause of hypochromic, microcytic anemia in the primary care setting. Finally, the study cohort reflects an underrepresented group in the development of screening tools, and thus offers generalizability.

### Red cell distribution width in alcohol abuse and iron deficiency anemia… [^112mKzwS]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — According to Bessman and McClure, 1 automated blood cell count, when it includes the red cell distribution width, is sufficient to detect iron deficiency in an ambulatory population. This seems to be true, especially with a mean corpuscular volume of 99 fL or less. We have also found that a high RDW is frequently connected with alcohol abuse. The combination of a high MCV and a high RDW may indicate immune hemolytic anemia or a deficiency of folate or vitamin B12. 2 Our previously reported results3 using a Coulter Counter S-Plus IV showed that this combination may, however, also indicate alcohol abuse among male patients, even though the combination is seen more often with pernicious anemia. A combination of four Coulter parameters can distinguish nonanemic, macrocytic alcohol abusers from macrocytic patients with early, nonanemic pernicious anemia; 94% Seppä K, Sillanaukee P.

### Managing discordance between hbAand glucose management indicator [^111oo3Rb]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conditions that affect the rate of turnover include:
Acute blood loss: increased red cell turnover leading to falsely low HbA 1c.
Haemolysis, for example, due to drugs (dapsone or penicillin derivates), irregular RBC antibodies or secondary autoimmune reactions: increased red cell turnover leading to falsely low HbA 1c. Elevated LDH and reduced haptoglobin are markers of haemolysis, and elevated reticulocytes are an indication of high turnover of RBC.
Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA): HbA 1c may be falsely elevated in mild to moderate IDA but may be lower in severe IDA or with the correction of iron deficiency.
Non‐iron deficiency anaemia: HbA 1c may be falsely low due to a non‐iron deficiency anaemia.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end‐stage renal disease (ESRD): ESRD presents a complicated mixed picture; there may be iron deficiency which may increase HbA 1c, but conversely, this is affected by the use of erythropoietin which will stimulate RBC turnover and increase reticulocyte formation. In addition, the reduction of renal function may reduce the RBC lifespan before overt ESRD. Overall, HbA 1c values tend to be lower than expected in those with ESRD and in persons with more severe CKD (CKD 4). The guidelines for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease recommend not to use HbA 1c when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².
Pregnancy: HbA 1c is reduced in the second trimester but is increased in the third trimester.
Homozygous and combined Hb variants (HbSS, HbCC, HbSC etc.): HbA 1c should not be reported if the Hb variant is homozygous, given the pathological processes, including anaemia, increased red cell turnover and transfusion requirements, that adversely impact HbA 1c as a marker of long‐term glycaemic control.

When any condition that could potentially affect RBC turnover is considered, it is important to first correctly identify the issue, then, if possible, treat and resolve the underlying issue before relying on HbA 1c. This may take 6 months, and RBC indices such as red cell distribution width (RDW) can offer a marker of stabilisation of the RBC population.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of anemia, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^112mvrnt]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin concentration (RAR) associated with mortality in the general population?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 469 572 participants at baseline and 44 383 deaths during follow-up periods, higher RAR levels were associated with increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the RAR, assessed via routine laboratory tests, could be a promising indicator that is simple, reliable, and inexpensive for identifying individuals at high risk of mortality in clinical practice.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^111KyyNc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an automatic expression of hematologic analyzers reflecting the size variability of circulating red blood cells (RBC). It is a marker used together with other laboratory parameters to determine and narrow the cause of anemia and it has shown promising potential as an index of disease activity and severity in various pathologic conditions.

The diagnosis and follow up of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are based on a combination of clinical indices, laboratory markers, endoscopy, histology and imaging modalities. However, these have various disadvantages, such as low sensitivity and specificity, high cost, limited availability, absence of simplicity, invasiveness, and lack of reproducibility.

The demand for an index used to recognize and monitor disease activity in IBD that overcomes these disadvantages still remains unmet. Since RDW expresses a lot of attractive characteristics, a number of clinical studies have been performed to evaluate its application as a surrogate marker of disease activity in IBD. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library through December 2019. Search terms included "red cell distribution width", "Inflammatory bowel disease", "Crohn's Disease" and "Ulcerative Colitis", and we critically reviewed all relevant articles published in English. The intention of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the utility of RDW as a marker of activity in IBD.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117SWdKS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the distinction between different causes of anemia is based on a hematological algorithm starting with the interpretation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Accordingly, micro-, macro- or normocytic erythrocyte conditions may hint at different causes for anemia. Besides MCV, basic laboratory parameters should include reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, red cell distribution width, and serum ferritin, TfS and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In patients with postoperative CD or severe ileitis, serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be evaluated. In patients with signs of hemolysis or significant comorbidities, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), creatinine, and urea should be determined accordingly. Some authors have also emphasized a key potential role for early markers of impaired erythropoiesis markers, such as the Hb content in reticulocytes (CHr) or reticulocyte Hb equivalent, measures that are not available as part of conventional laboratory tests and that are further discussed in the outlook section.

### The application value of mean red blood cell volume and red blood cell volume distribution width combined with total serum bilirubin in the early screening of neonatal hemolytic disease [^114rFdCu]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

MCV and RDW are traditionally used in the differential diagnosis and treatment of anemia. Recent studies have also found that MCV and RDW are related to the infection process, and RDW was found to be related to a variety of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, etc. In this study, the TSB, MCV and RDW-CV were independent factors that increased the early detection rate of HDN. The early measurement of MCV and RDW-CV was valuable for improving the detection rate of HDN. The AUC for each index was greater than 0.600. Combined with the TSB (with an AUC of 0.729) for screening HDN, the AUC was 0.841. Joint monitoring could increase the detection rate of early HDN compared with a single index. Although the specificity of each index was not high, the sensitivity was good, and the early value was increased. Contrary to the developmental process of TSB, they complement each other for observation. Therefore, MCV and RDW-CV can be used as early screening indicators, and combined with TSB, has application value in the early screening of the cause of jaundice.

### Diagnosing TMAs by automated red cell morphology analyses [^111K4ZDF]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Notably, Foy et al assessed their algorithms within the clinical disease context and confirmed the ability of their RBC-differentiating algorithm to make specific diagnoses. Using predominant cell types to arrive at a gestalt assessment of the smear pathology, the authors analyzed the RBC-differentiation ability of smears using the peripheral blood from patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome and could distinguish these from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA). Importantly, they went on to demonstrate that schistocyte counts are associated with prognosis. The authors further found that they could correlate schistocyte counts from patients without TMA with all-cause mortality, similar to what had been shown previously for parameters such as red cell distribution width.

There are limitations. As expected, the sensitivity of the classification appears to vary for different cell types, and each will require validation. This system does not account for cells that might change shape within circulation, such as sickle cell anemia. This machine learning algorithm relies heavily on the use of black-white boundary detection to identify different RBC shapes but does not detect or differentiate between RBC inclusions.

Assessing peripheral blood smears requires expertise and is a time-consuming and costly exercise. Although the authors clarify that their RBC-differentiation algorithm is not intended to replace manual review, the idea that an automated, high-level, accurate RBC differential would be useful in a resource-limited setting is very appealing. Even in the United States, there is pressure on hematology laboratories to minimize the number of smears that require review. The intriguing possibility of diagnosing iron deficiency, thalassemia, sickle cell, or immune-hemolytic pathologies via smear further extends the potential utility of RBC-differentiation algorithm. This also paves the way to encourage more scientific research: why do schistocytes correlate with mortality? What causes schistocyte formation in those with nonhematological acute illnesses?

The future is very likely to include some type of accurate RBC differential that will not only be able to make the diagnosis but will also monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy. Classical hematology has frequently been regarded as too difficult and the problems as too emergent. One of the remaining reasons for a hematologist to visit the hospital in the middle of the night is the possibility of seeing schistocytes on a smear, which will help diagnose a TMA, particularly TTP. This could also be a boon to the idea of a better work-life balance for classical hematologists.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Importance of RDW value in differential diagnosis of hypochrome anemias [^1135enbt]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) was studied in adults carrying delta-beta thalassemia traits (deltabeta-TT) who were 20–40 years of age (n = 29), beta thalassemia traits (beta-TT) with an age range of 18–60 years (n = 49), iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in individuals aged 1–18 years (n = 27), and in controls with an age range of 20–40 years (n = 20). Although red blood cell count, MCV, and MCH values showed no statistically significant differences between deltabeta-TT and beta-TT, the mean RDW value was significantly higher in deltabeta-TT (20.14 ± 1.21) compared to beta-TT (14.88 ± 1.77) (P < 0.001). No difference was observed between the means of RDW in deltabeta-TT and IDA (18.00 ± 1.94) (P > 0.05). A significant rise in RDW in IDA 5–7 days after initiation of iron therapy (P = 0.00) which was continued to rise up to the 4(th) week of therapy was suggested as an important tool in differentiation of IDA from deltabeta-TT. These observations could be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of deltabeta-TT from beta-TT and IDA by determining the red blood cell count, red cell indices, and RDW only.

Table 1
Conditions that elevate red cell distribution width

Apart from its usual application as a hematologic parameter, RDW has been extensively studied as an inflammatory marker, along with its capability to express the activity and severity of various disease states and conditions. Probably the first recorded strong correlation of RDW with laboratory indices of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), came after a retrospective study of 3845 outpatient adults performed by Lippi et al.

Cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disorders belong to a group of disorders where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults. Data from the international literature showed that in these clinical entities, an elevated RDW value was related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and could be used as a predictor of an unfavorable disease course.

Despite the encouraging data concerning its potential as a prognostic marker of morbidity, mortality and unfavorable disease course in various pathologic conditions, in everyday clinical practice RDW remains a parameter used to define and differentiate anemias.

Results

Basic demographic and biochemical characteristics of samples with iron deficient anemia and without iron deficient anemia are shown in Table 1. Of the 2091 blood reports of children analyzed, 1026 samples (49.06%) were classified as iron deficient anemia by gold standard. There was a mark difference in the values for various biochemical markers in iron deficient anemic and non-iron deficient anemic children. Mean values of Hb, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), MCV and SFr were markedly higher in non iron deficient anemic children as compared to iron deficient anemic children. As many studies have found SFr and ZnPP as one of the best biochemical indicators of iron deficiency anemia hence we used Hb along with SFr or ZnPP to define IDA for the present analysis.

Demographic and biochemical profile of samples with iron deficient anemia and without iron deficient anemia

Results are given as the mean ± SD unless specified.

Abbreviations: MCH Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCV Mean corpuscular volume, RDW Red cell distribution width, ZnPP Zinc protoporphyrin.

ROC analysis of RDW for detecting iron deficiency anemia is shown in Figure 1. As a marker of overall efficiency, area under the curve for RDW was 83% (95% CI, 81% - 85%; p < 0.001) (Figure 1). Table 2 shows the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values at various cut-offs of RDW against the gold standard definition for iron deficiency anemia. Sensitivity of RDW at cut-off of 18% to detect iron deficiency anemia was 76.5% and specificity of 73.1%. This cut-off yielded a positive predictive value of 73% and negative predictive value of 76%. At a cut-off of RDW 16.4%, the sensitivity was 94.2% and at a cut-off of 21%, the specificity was 95%. The algorithm using RDW value of > 15% with Hb ≤ 10 g/dL was found to be more efficient. A second ROC analysis was performed using this algorithm as a predictor of IDA. Combination of Hb ≤ 10 g/dL and RDW > 15%, yielded a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 90%. The positive predictive value was 90% and the negative predictive value was around 99%.

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

### Red cell distribution width as a potential new biomarker to predict the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis [^112XLdsg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the high patient count and broad inclusion of subjects, the results have limited generalizability particularly to different Hinchey classes, as we were able to analyze only two groups based on this classification (class I versus class II-IV). The retrospective design limits the reliability of some data that were based on hospital records (in spite of the fact that these were electronic records) and retrospective analysis precludes the inclusion of additional biomarkers, clinical variables, and long-term outcomes such as recurrence, complications, and mortality. If a group of patients with diverticulosis had been included, the results of patients with diverticulitis could have been compared to these patients to understand the variations between these groups and the utility of examined parameters in distinguishing cases. Potential confounders that could affect RDW levels, such as iron deficiency, anemia, chronic diseases, malnutrition or other factors, were not evaluated. While we excluded patients with known comorbidities, we did not have access to laboratory data on iron status, renal function, or nutritional markers — all of which may affect RDW. This limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting our results. The exclusion of these factors may represent a limitation in the interpretation of the results. Additionally, the considerable differences in patient numbers between treatment groups may have affected the reliability of statistical comparisons in this regard. Additionally, since this study only included patients with confirmed diverticulitis, we were not able to compare RDW levels to those of a healthy or non-diverticulitis population. This limits our ability to define a general reference range or threshold for RDW in broader clinical settings.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with incident myocardial infarction in a general population: the troms ø study [^113ydnkf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of the variability in size of circulating erythrocytes, is calculated by automated blood cell counters as part of the routine blood cell count analysis. Traditionally, RDW and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, particularly anemias that are microcytic (caused by iron deficiency) or macrocytic (due to vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency). An increased RDW can also result from conditions that modify the shape of red blood cells due to the premature release of immature cells into the bloodstream, to hemoglobinopathies, or to other hematological diseases.

Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. – Consequently, identification of novel risk factors is of great potential value to improve risk stratification and facilitate targeted prevention of MI. In a study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a representative US population, participants with RDW values above the 75th percentile were aggregated in the highest 10‐year Framingham risk category for coronary heart disease. Other observational studies in selected cohorts of patients with heart disease have reported that RDW predicts all‐cause mortality, – cardiac morbidity and mortality, – and adverse outcome in patients with heart failure. – Furthermore, RDW predicted all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in 2 population‐based studies from NHANES. –

The association between RDW and MI has previously been reported mainly in patients with known CV disease or heart failure. – Although growing evidence supports the hypothesis that high RDW is associated with an unfavorable CV risk profile and higher total and CV mortality in various populations, the impact of RDW on the risk of incident MI in a general population is unclear. Consequently, we aimed to investigate whether RDW was associated with risk of first‐ever event of MI in a large prospective study with participants recruited from a general population.

### Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is associated with low cognitive performance in American older adults: NHANES 2011–2014 [^1146BJgr]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The specific biological mechanisms about association between higher RAR and increased risk of low cognitive performance have not yet been fully elucidated, but may be related to chronic inflammation and poor nutritional status. RAR is a composite indicator integrating RDW and albumin, with increases in RDW and decreases in albumin both contributing to elevated RAR levels. Several studies have indicated that elevated RDW is associated with cognitive decline. A cross-sectional study indicated a "J-shaped" relationship between elevated RDW levels and the likelihood of dementia in older adults. Additionally, a prospective cohort study highlighted a causal impact of RDW on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Elevated RDW is commonly associated with systemic inflammatory states, which can affect erythropoiesis, red blood cell lifespan, and red blood cell deformability, leading to increased cell anisotropy and subsequently raising RDW levels. Chronic inflammation is considered one of the key mechanisms underlying low cognitive performance. Abnormal deposition of amyloid proteins can lead to excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes in the central nervous system, triggering neuroinflammatory responses. Prolonged inflammatory conditions result in structural and functional damage to neurons, further contributing to cognitive decline. Additionally, RDW is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, which is considered a contributing factor to CI and Alzheimer's disease. In the condition of anemia, pathological changes in red blood cells, including alterations in quantity, volume, distribution, and overall mass, can reduce the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Hypoxic changes in cerebral blood vessels may be a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, leading to low cognitive performance and dementia. Our study also found that participants with higher RAR often had lower hemoglobin levels and a higher risk of low cognitive performance.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114F37x4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.

Objective

To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥ 80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW > 14.5% vs ≤ 14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.

### The correlation between RDW, MPV and weight indices after metabolic surgery in patients with obesity and DM / IGR: follow-up observation at 12 months [^1178UgH1]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a common indicator in blood routine analysis, which reflects the heterogeneity of red blood cell volume in the circulation. It is calculated as the standard deviation (SD) of the distribution of red blood cell volume divided by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and then multiplied by 100. In previous studies, RDW has been used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of erythrocyte disorders, especially anemia, and for the evaluation of nutritional status. Elevated RDW is commonly seen in iron deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia, etc.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a common indicator of platelet activity in routine blood. Increased MPV is commonly seen in primary thrombocytopenic purpura and myelodysplastic syndrome, while decreased MPV is commonly seen in acute leukemia chemotherapy and aplastic anemia.

In the last decade, RDW and MPV have both been considered new biomarkers for the prognosis of cardiovascular disease. RDW levels were significantly higher in patients with end point events such as death, heart failure and arrhythmia than in those without end point events. Cardiovascular risk score and MPV in nonalcoholic fatty liver patients can accurately predict the risk of acute cardiovascular events within 1 year.

Previous studies have shown a significant correlation between the two indicators and obesity. Elisia et al. found that RDW was significantly higher in people with a BMI > 35 kg·m⁻² than in those with a BMI ≤ 35 kg·m⁻². In individuals with metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity, MPV levels were positively correlated with waist circumference and were significantly higher than in those without metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity.

RDW and MPV are also associated with diabetes. RDW levels in diabetic patients were significantly higher than in control subjects; also, RDW levels in diabetic patients with HbA1c > 7% were significantly higher than in those with HbA1c ≤ 7%. MPV was higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than in those without T2DM and higher in T2DM patients with microvascular complications (retinopathy or microalbuminuria) than in those without.

Obesity is an independent risk factor for the development of T2DM. Metabolic surgery by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become the most effective treatment for patients with T2DM complicated with obesity. A simple and economic indicator that can accurately predict the outcome of surgery in advance may be useful to make the optimum choice of metabolic surgery.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic marker in patients with heart failure and diabetes mellitus [^116sgWrf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of anemia is associated with a special risk in patients with any form of proatherosclerotic condition and heart disease. Despite the fact that clinical and hemodynamical changes due to acute, short-lasting anemia are reversible, chronic anemia can lead to cardiac enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy due to volume overload. Anemia is considered to be a mediator and a marker of a poor outcome in HF, a risk factor for ischemic heart disease, and often coexists in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Notably, in patients with stable coronary artery disease, higher RDW is a strong and independent prognostic marker of mortality. In our study, RDW was an independent, to anemia, prognostic factor for death or rehospitalization.

Study limitations

The sample size of diabetic patients that enrolled in the study was not large (71 patients), albeit every patient not met the study endpoint, had five measurements (admission, discharge, 4, 8 and 12 months). This means that the results should be interpreted under caution and used as a basis for larger studies.

Future directions

Subclinical chronic inflammation is a common feature in the natural course of diabetes and levels of inflammatory biomarkers show promising results regarding this correlation. We strongly believe that the design of larger studies with main focus on "specific" markers of inflammation (such as Leptin, TNF, IL-6, CCL2, Resistin, Adiponectin) and the association with RDW would be of particular importance.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with short-and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis and sepsis [^113CzA9q]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal emergency with a rising global incidence. Epidemiological studies estimate the annual incidence of AP to range from approximately 13 to 135 cases per 100,000 population, depending on regional variations. Globally, the incidence has been increasing at an average annual rate of 3.07%. The most common etiological factors include gallstones, alcohol consumption, hyperlipidemia, and certain medications, such as rifampicin, diuretics, and immunosuppressive agents. Clinically, AP is typically characterized by persistent, radiating abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pathophysiology of AP is complicated, and it is often associated with the activation of gastrointestinal enzymes, kinin system, pancreas damage, and inflammation. While mild cases of AP generally have a favorable prognosis, severe cases — particularly those complicated by sepsis, organ failure, or pancreatic necrosis — are associated with high morbidity and a mortality rate of up to 20%. This systemic involvement creates an environment characterized by oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine release, and impaired microcirculation — all of which can influence hematological parameters. One such parameter is red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a routinely available measure that reflects the variability in red blood cell size.

RDW has been associated with a wide range of clinical conditions. Elevated RDW levels are commonly observed in patients with conditions such as megaloblastic anemia and aplastic anemia. As a key hematological parameter, RDW plays a crucial role in assessing changes in red blood cell volume, thereby aiding clinicians in the classification and diagnosis of different types of anemia. Moreover, elevated RDW has been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. Increased RDW has also been shown to be related to inflammation. Previous studies have suggested that RDW may be associated with the prognosis of sepsis. He et al. showed that RDW is a risk factor in patients with AP, but this study did not address the impact of concurrent sepsis — a common and often fatal complication of severe AP.

Given the high mortality associated with AP and sepsis, and the potential of RDW as an accessible and cost-effective prognostic biomarker, it is essential to investigate its predictive value in this specific population. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether RDW is independently associated with short-term and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with AP and sepsis.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^113XWP4Y]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The results from studies included in this review showed that mean values of RDW were statistically significantly higher in IBD patients compared to controls. With respect to the rather limited data, based on only 2 clinical trials, RDW could be used as an effective marker to differentiate CD from UC in both the active state and remission. In the majority of the aforementioned studies RDW, at different cutoff values, showed a remarkable sensitivity and specificity in detecting active disease, calculated by means of clinical indices, endoscopic scores and laboratory parameters. RDW also showed a positive but variable correlation with well-established inflammatory biomarkers used in everyday clinical practice such as CRP, ESR, and to a lesser extent WBC and PLT, in both anemic and non-anemic IBD patients. Therefore, RDW could be considered an attractive disease activity marker in IBD, as it is calculated automatically in every CBC, has a low cost, is minimally invasive, has no specific technical requirements and can be easily reproduced.

On the other hand, there are certain aspects concerning its broad application that must be elucidated. There was great variability in the thresholds adopted for the assessment of diagnostic accuracy. In addition, the selection of cutoffs was arbitrary and data driven. Most studies were retrospective and were case-control studies. The use of controls in diagnostic accuracy studies usually results in overestimation of both sensitivity and specificity. Large-scale well-designed prospective studies for standardization of the cutoff value of RDW should now be mandatory. It is also necessary to conduct such studies in order to evaluate whether the limited but rather encouraging data are sufficient to establish RDW as a reliable activity index. Finally, there is a need to look deeper and clarify the pathophysiology of this relation. RDW seems to be a promising cost-effective tool that can be used to evaluate and monitor disease activity in IBD, but this requires more extensive and detailed research in the future.

### Red cell distribution width and risk of coronary heart disease events [^1139WhyW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) has emerged as a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality in variety of cardiovascular settings. However, no data are available associating RDW with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in a healthy and nationally representative multiethnic population. A total of 7,556 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999 to 2006 (age 41.5 ± 15.8 years, 60% women) were divided into 3 categories according to their 10-year Framingham risk of hard CHD events: < 10% (n = 6,173, reference category), 10% to 20% (n = 1,093, intermediate-risk category), and > 20% (n = 290, high-risk category). Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed evaluating RDW as a predictor of CHD risk. Each unit increase (0.1) in RDW posed a statistically significant greater odds of being in the intermediate-risk category (odds ratio -1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.45, p < 0.001) and high-risk category (odds ratio -1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.53, p < 0.001) compared to the reference category, after adjusting for race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume. Additional adjustments with serum iron, vitamin B(12), and folic acid levels did not affect the association. Subsequently, we divided participants into 2 categories according to their anemia status (as defined by the World Health Organization) to evaluate its effect. An RDW level greater than the seventy-fifth percentile in both anemic and nonanemic participants was a significant predictor of greater CHD risk while RDW of the seventy-fifth percentile or less in anemic participants failed to predict CHD (compared to nonanemic participants with similar RDW as the reference category). In conclusion, a higher RDW appears to be a powerful independent predictor of future CHD risk.

### Association between red blood cell distribution width and mortality and severity among patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1174pP36]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence has underscored the potential usefulness of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) measurement in predicting the mortality and disease severity of COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the association of the plasma RDW levels with adverse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive literature search from inception to September 2020 was performed to harvest original studies reporting RDW on admission and clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RDW levels were compared between cases (patients who died or developed more severe symptoms) and controls (patients who survived or developed less severe symptoms). A total of 14,866 subjects from 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Higher levels of RDW were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (mean differences = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.47–0.97; I² = 89.51%). Deceased patients had higher levels of RDW compared to patients who survived (mean differences = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.63–1.23; I² = 85.58%). Severely ill COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of RDW, as opposed to patients classified to have milder symptoms (mean differences = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.28–0.94; I² = 82.18%). Elevated RDW levels were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This finding warrants further research on whether RDW could be utilized as a simple and reliable biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity and whether RDW is mechanistically linked with COVID-19 pathophysiology.

### Prognostic value of red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume on mortality in hemodialysis patients [^1119DKue]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are principally used for differential diagnosis of anemia. Limited evidence is available for its prognostic value for mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We aimed to definite the relationship between RDW and MCV and mortality in HD patients.

Method

This cohort study examined all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality with 181 maintenance HD patients from February 2015. Patients were divided into four groups according to the median of RDW and MCV. Pearson analysis was conducted to determine the related factors of RDW and MCV. The independent association of RDW and MCV with mortality was examined with Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis.

Results

This study included 181 HD patients for a median follow-up of 71months. We found RDW was positively related to neutrophil count, C-reaction protein, and ferritin, while negatively related to hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine. Only neutrophil count and ferritin were significantly related to MCV in this study. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the high RDW group was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 3.787; 95% confidence interval, 1.037 to 13.834; p = 0.044). The relationship between RDW and MCV and CV mortality was not significant.

Conclusions

RDW could emerge as an additive risk factor for all-cause mortality in maintenance HD patients, independent of other factors. An absolute value of MCV to predict mortality and the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms should be confirmed in the future.

### Expert perspective: hematologic malignancies and vasculitis [^117UkcaL]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Approach to diagnostic testing when considering

Laboratory testing. Because most patients with vasculitis do not have hematologic malignancy, we do not exhaustively test all patients with a new diagnosis of vasculitis with a bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry, for example. However, we always consider the presteroid complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential and, if available, the historic CBC with differential trend as a vital piece of diagnostic information to integrate with other diagnostic testing that, from our hematologic evaluation minimally, includes erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C‐reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum‐free light chains (SFLC), cryoglobulins, C3, and C4 (Figure 2).

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117DEawE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency without anemia

Iron deficiency with relevant clinical symptoms can be present even before anemia develops as a long-term consequence. In such cases, early changes in the CBC, for example an increased RDW or an MCH close to the lower limit of normal, can represent early manifestations of iron deficiency. As described above, the reticulocyte count can be decreased even before erythrocyte indices are affected. Iron storage indices can also be interpreted in a similar way as in the diagnosis of IDA: in patients with IBD and no clinical, endoscopic or biochemical sign of active disease, a ferritin level below 15–30 μg/liter is diagnostic for iron deficiency. In the case of active disease, a ferritin level up to 100 μg/liter can still be consistent with iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% reflects a reduced availability of iron for erythropoiesis, either due to total iron deficiency or due to functional iron deficiency (e.g. in chronic inflammation or following treatment with erythropoietin). It was suggested that a TfS below 20% with a ferritin below 100 μg/liter defines total iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% and a ferritin above 100 μg/liter were defined as functional iron deficiency. In otherwise unclear cases, sTfR can also be useful.

### Impact of inflammation on anemia in children: a cross-sectional study [^115PyDht]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Using the ROC curve, it was found that the RDW and sTfR values showed the best discrimination between children with and without anemia. RDW can help distinguish iron deficiency from other causes, such as inflammation, and is a practical and routine hematological index used in differential diagnoses of variations in the size and shape of erythrocytes and other hemoglobinopathies. No child with any inflammatory process was excluded from the ROC curve.

The sTfR, in turn, has been characterized as an essential marker in distinguishing between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of inflammation and is a parameter used to assess iron status in the pediatric population. Its concentrations increase in parallel with the decrease in cellular iron levels and may increase slightly during the inflammatory response. Thus, the fact that sTfR shows a good level of discrimination between children with and without anemia suggests the efficacy of this marker in diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. RDW represents the presence of anisocytosis or variation in red blood cell size, which can occur for various reasons, from anemia to chronic diseases. sTfR is characterized as the best biomarker for identifying iron deficiency anemia resulting from the presence of inflammation.

We found a correlation between positive acute phase reactant proteins, such as hs-CRP and Alpha-1 Acid Glycoprotein, and biomarkers of iron-related nutritional status. Although the anemia of inflammation is like an iron deficiency in terms of some biomarkers such as serum iron, it occurs as a disturbance in iron distribution since the macrophages in the liver, spleen and bone marrow responsible for recycling old red blood cells retain their iron stores in the presence of inflammation. A study of 1,375 Cuban preschoolers showed that a third had at least one elevated inflammation biomarker that interfered with the prevalence of anemia.

Alpha-1 Acid Glycoprotein showed a direct correlation with sTfR and an inverse correlation with hemoglobin, serum iron and TSI. sTfR is the soluble form of the transferrin receptor, a protein that plays a crucial role in iron uptake by cells. Its concentration in the blood reflects the cellular demand for iron and is higher in conditions of iron deficiency. Elevated sTfR concentrations are often associated with iron deficiency anemia. When there is inadequate iron availability, cells increase the expression of sTfR to capture more iron in circulation. This adaptive response attempts to compensate for iron deficiency and restore normal hemoglobin levels.

### Multiplicative interaction between mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width in predicting mortality of elderly patients with and without anemia [^1179FRpv]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent studies have shown that an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) is an important predictor of adverse outcomes. However, the strength of this biomarker has not been tested in a large outpatient elderly population. Also since increased RDW can be due to a variety of etiologies, additional biomarkers are needed to refine the prognostic value of this variable. We assembled a cohort of 36,226 elderly (≥ 65yo) patients seen at an outpatient facility within the Einstein/Montefiore system from January 1st 1997 to May 1st 2008 who also had a complete blood count performed within 3 months of the initial visit. With a maximum follow-up of 10 years, we found that an elevated RDW (> 16.6) was associated with increased risk of mortality in both non-anemic (HR = 3.66, p < 0.05) and anemic patients (HR = 1.87, p < 0.05). The effect of RDW on mortality is significantly increased in non-anemic patients with macrocytosis (HR = 5.22, p < 0.05) compared to those with normocytosis (HR = 3.86, p < 0.05) and microcytosis (HR = 2.46, p < 0.05). When comparing non-anemic patients with both an elevated RDW and macrocytosis to those with neither, we observed an elevated HR of 7.76 (higher than expected in an additive model). This multiplicative interaction was not observed in anemic patients (HR = 2.23). Lastly, we constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for each RDW/MCV subgroup and found worsened survival for those with macrocytosis and an elevated RDW in both anemia and non-anemic patients. Based on our results, the addition of MCV appears to improve the prognostic value of RDW as a predictor of overall survival in elderly patients.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

Several explanations were suggested to this surprising finding. Abnormal RDW usually suggests one or more chronic condition that accompanies significant heart failure, such as anemia or nutritional deficit. Another mechanism that was suggested is the release of cytokines in response to inflammatory stress. These cytokines block the activity of erythropoietin and cause production of ineffective red blood cell and elevated RDW. Lippi et al found a correlation between high RDW and elevated indexes of inflammation, such as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). This correlation was independent of concomitant diseases, and was demonstrated even when anemic patients were excluded from the statistical analysis.

Our data demonstrated that RDW is a valuable and sensitive marker for a high level of inflammatory activity in young patients with CAP, and it is independent of hemoglobin levels. The mechanism underlying the association between high levels of RDW and adverse outcome in patients hospitalized with pneumonia is unknown. RDW is elevated in conditions in which there is ineffective red cell production or increased destruction of red blood cell. RDW may indicate a severe inflammatory process, with impact on bone marrow function and iron metabolism. Another option is that RDW is an earlier marker of prognosis, and it may appear earlier in the complex process of anemia than low levels of hemoglobin. As noted before, high RDW levels may represent a culmination of multiple pathophysiologic processes occurring in acute inflammatory and infectious state.

### Red cell distribution width and red cell distribution width to total serum calcium ratio as major predictors of severity and mortality in acute pancreatitis [^113N8stZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In the past, RDW was widely used for differential diagnosis of anemia. Over the last years, RDW has been associated with systemic inflammation due to the high oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines that contribute to RDW elevation by reducing RBC survival and maturation, increasing the release of newer and larger RBC into the peripheral circulation and changing of membrane glycoproteins and ion channels of RBC with consequent morphological alteration. Therefore, RDW reflects the degree of inflammation that occurs in AP and thus, can be used to predict its severity. Despite isolated TSC did not represent a good predictor for AP severity in our study, RDW 0h -to-TSC ratio proved to be an excellent predictor of AP severity and a very good predictor of AP mortality. In fact, hypocalcemia within the first 24 h was associated with AP severity, although its etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood. It has been postulated that hypocalcemia could be related to the calcium soaps formation and parathyroid hormone depletion.

There are some limitations, mainly related to the retrospective nature of this study. However, our study groups' size is within range when compared to other published studies for assessing both severity or mortality in AP. Second, RDW samples were collected from a single center and thus, RDW levels could have been slightly different in other populations studied.

### Independent effects of the hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio on 180-day mortality in critically ill patients with gastrointestinal bleeding: analysis from the MIMIC-IV database [^114gdNFh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a critical medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality, posing a substantial challenge to public health. Clinically, GIB manifests as hematemesis (vomiting of blood), melena (black stools), or occult blood in the stool. Internally, it results in blood loss, which may lead to hemodynamic instability or symptomatic anemia, both of which can be life-threatening. Effective management of GIB relies on rapid diagnosis and accurate risk stratification to optimize patient outcomes. Studies have shown that the emergency mortality rate for GIB can be as high as 10%. Given this high mortality rate, it is essential to pay closer attention to the prevention and management of GIB in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The primary etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) include inflammation, esophagitis, esophagogastric varices, erosive gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and colitis. Additionally, previous studies have demonstrated significant associations between inflammatory markers and the development and prognosis of GIB. These markers include interleukin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).

The hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio (HRR) is an emerging biomarker of chronic inflammation, calculated by dividing the level of hemoglobin (Hb) by the red cell distribution width (RDW), this ratio reflects erythrocyte heterogeneity and may predict underlying inflammatory processes. Previous studies have shown that HRR is associated with poor prognosis in a range of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, kidney injury, and depression. However, the relationship between HRR and prognosis in critically ill patients with GIB remains understudied.

This study aims to investigate the association between the HRR and the 180-day mortality rate in critically ill patients with GIB. Our research has the potential to transform clinical practice by offering a simple blood test to predict long-term outcomes in patients with GIB.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^112DJuwu]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, RDW > 15% and hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL measured using a simple coulter can be used as a valuable screening tool for identifying children with iron deficiency anemia in a low socio-economic setting. Although it needs to be further investigated in other populations, there is no reason to believe that results will vary from the present study. If these findings are confirmed in other settings as well, it offers a very useful tool for screening iron deficient anemic children without need for more expensive iron status marker investigations.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112f5qvS]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a coefficient of variation in red blood cell (RBC) volume, is routinely available in reports of complete blood count. RDW is commonly increased because of erythropoiesis deficits or accelerated RBC destruction. RDW increase is often considered as an indicator of anemia caused by iron, cobalamin, or folate deficiency. Recent studies have indicated that patients with higher RDW levels were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and new-onset stroke. Moreover, the level of RDW was positively correlated with mortality in patients with acute or critical illnesses, in those with chronic diseases, and in healthy cohorts. Patel et al. reported a 14% increased risk of death for each 1% increment in RDW in a community-based elderly population.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia are well-known risk factors for CV events and mortality. RDW significantly increases when CKD progresses from stage 1 to stage 5. According to our review of the relevant literature, few reports have focused on RDW in patients with CKD. Hsieh et al. revealed that RDW was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and infection mortality in CKD stages 3–5. Inadequate erythropoietin production is the primary feature of anemia in patients with CKD. Anemia reduces oxygen delivery and increases cardiac workload, which exacerbates heart failure and increases the risk of CV events. However, anemia is not the only possible explanation of elevated RDW in patients with CKD. The association of RDW with CV events and mortality was observed to be significant after adjustment for hemoglobin. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes during CKD stages 1–5. We hypothesized that elevated RDW is an independent risk factor for CV events and mortality in patients with CKD.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^11693D6F]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Prognostic value of red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio for predicting mortality in adult patients meeting sepsis-3 criteria in intensive care units [^115kdJ7j]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In health care systems around the world, sepsis — a life-threatening condition — is significantly linked to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Notably, sepsis caused 11.0 million deaths in 2017. Thus, 19.7% of all fatalities in that year were due to sepsis. In China, Weng et al. reported that the annual standardized incidence of hospitalized sepsis was 421.85 cases per 100,000 in 2019. The mortality rate is extremely high among patients with sepsis, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs). A meta-analysis published in 2020 revealed that 41.9% of patients with sepsis treated in the ICU die before hospital discharge. However, it is important to note that the morbidity and mortality of sepsis are still underreported. In many cases, deaths owing to sepsis are coded as the original underlying infection, leading to the omission of these implicit cases from epidemiological studies. The lack of sepsis epidemiological data in developing countries also contributes to the underestimation of sepsis' morbidity and mortality. Identification of patients with a high mortality risk is crucial for reducing sepsis-related mortality. Some biomarkers have been shown to have prognostic relevance; however, these methods are difficult to generalize owing to testing costs and complexity in the low- and middle-income countries that bear most of the sepsis burden. Therefore, the discovery of useful biomarkers with high predictive accuracy is urgently needed to identify patients at high risk of death.

Multiple studies in recent years have indicated that red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is not only a reasonably priced measure for the differential diagnosis of anemia but also a potential marker of inflammation. Indeed, elevated RDW has been reported in inflammation-related diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune liver diseases, and sepsis. Having anti-inflammatory effects, serum albumin is a protein that represents the inflammation and nutritional state. Recent research has demonstrated that the relationship between RDW to albumin ratio (RAR) and the prognosis of many diseases, including aortic aneurysm, diabetic retinopathy, and shock, and is a nonspecific parameter that can provide effective risk stratification in patients with complicated diseases.

To date, data related to the prognostic value of RAR for sepsis are scarce, and it remains to be proven whether combining the RDW with albumin level can more precisely predict the mortality of patients with sepsis relative to the RDW alone. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the RAR and the prognosis of patients with sepsis using real-world data.

### Differential diagnosis and management of anemia in the newborn [^1152gK26]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum. Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

### The role of automated measurement of RBC subpopulations in differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia and β-thalassemia screening [^115RnnzV]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Cell counter-based formulas have been used in the differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia. The measurement of RBC subpopulations is now available on the Sysmex XE 5000 analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). We describe the new formulas: % microcytic - % hypochromic; and % microcytic - % hypochromic - red cell distribution width (RDW), derived from the percentages of microcytic and hypochromic RBCs. The present study aimed to prospectively evaluate the reliability of these new formulas in the differential diagnosis of microcytosis and β-thalassemia screening compared with already published indices. The indices were calculated for a set of 250 iron-deficient patients and 270 β-thalassemia carriers. Independent samples t test and receiver-operating characteristics analysis were applied. The % microcytic - % hypochromic - RDW, % microcytic - % hypochromic, and Green and King indices provided higher areas under the curve. The % microcytic - % hypochromic - RDW was the most reliable index evaluated, with 100% sensitivity and 92.6% specificity. This index can be used to efficiently screen patients with microcytosis for further hematologic studies to confirm β-thalassemia.

### Utility of red cell distribution width in screening for iron deficiency [^116u1qWg]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the sensitivity of an adult-derived red cell distribution width (RDW) reference limit in the detection of iron deficiency in young children.

Methods

Haematological analysis performed on a cohort of 13-month-old healthy term infants of North European ancestry.

Results

21/98 infants were iron-deficient (> 2.5% hypochromic red cells). Of the remaining 77, 35 with RDW > 13.9% also had evidence of incipient iron deficiency on the basis of significantly lower haemoglobin (11.5 vs 11.8 g/dl, p = 0.046), mean cell volume (75.6 vs 77.8 fl, p = 0.002) and mean cell haemoglobin (25.4 vs 26.2 pg, p = 0.002) values and higher zinc protoporphyrin (55 vs 44 μmol/molhaem, p < 0.001) values than those of the 42 with RDW ≤ 13.9%.

Conclusions

An adult-derived RDW reference limit has utility in screening for iron deficiency at the age of 13 months. The incidence of non-anaemic iron deficiency in this group was 52.8%.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^114TeR5A]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency among Indian preschool children contributing to increased burden of morbidity and mortality and the most significant negative consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Recent NFHS–III surveys (2005–06) have shown that 70–85% (approx. 79.2%) of Indian young children have anemia. IDA is attributed to inadequate iron intake, poor bioavailability of iron or high nutritional needs during childhood which is further exacerbated by chronic intestinal blood losses due to helminth infections and in many areas due to severe malarial infections. Studies have shown that iron deficiency causes delay in cognitive development and poor motor and sensory system functioning and that iron supplementation in early years may prevent these complications among children. Conversely, there is an evidence suggesting that routine iron treatment in non-iron deficient children may have adverse consequences for morbidity and infections. Therefore, it is very important to detect iron deficiency (ID) at its earliest stage in children especially in a low resource setting and replenish the iron stores by proper supplementation, thereby preventing many of the adverse developmental and behavioral effects caused by IDA. Currently, the detection of IDA is largely dependent upon quantification of biochemical markers like serum ferritin (SFr), serum transferrin (STr) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) which are not routinely available and affordable in developing countries due to high costs. Moreover, these tests are altered by inflammation, which limits their applicability for clinical interpretation, especially in areas with high infection rates. Another limitation of the commonly used hematological tests is their poor sensitivity or specificity as they can be modified by conditions other than iron deficiency. Studies have shown that RDW in addition to other hematological markers like mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin can be used as a differential diagnostic tool for identification of iron deficiency anemia. Various studies also show that the onset of iron deficiency anemia can be predicted using automated blood analyzers, as a low haemoglobin level along with a high level of anisocytosis detectable by red cell distribution width prove to be good indicators of changes in blood due to depleted iron stores. It seems that the earliest hematological manifestation of iron deficiency is marked by an elevated level of RDW and reports have shown that it is a cost-effective screening tool for early diagnosis of IDA in comparison to SFr and ZnPP. The red blood cell (RBC) distribution width, a measure of variations in the width of circulating RBCs, reported as a part of complete blood count has been known to be of value in the discrimination of iron deficiency anemia from other causes of microcytic anemia, but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the discriminative ability of RDW diagnostic test for detecting iron deficiency anemia among children aged 1–3 yrs in a low socio-economic setting using receiver's operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^117NHQFZ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10¹²/l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Impact of red cell distribution width and red cell distribution width / albumin ratio on all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and foot ulcers: a retrospective cohort study [^112Er9w9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common and life-threatening complication of diabetes, leading to hospitalization, high health-care costs, and a high rate of amputation. DFUs exhibit a 5 — year mortality comparable to cancer. Individuals with DFUs have a 2.5-fold increase in the risk for death compared with patients who have diabetes but no DFUs. The excess mortality cannot be fully explained by other known comorbidities and complications of diabetes. It is therefore important to identify and evaluate additional risk factors that influence mortality in patients with DFUs.

The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple and easily-obtained parameter, representing the heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume, and is traditionally used for differential diagnosis of anemia. However, in more recent years, RDW was found to be associated with multiple disease processes and prognoses. RDW was associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes. RDW was also associated with diabetes-related complications. RDW can predict mortality and cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes. However, this observation failed to be corroborated in another population, which may be due to the population heterogeneity. RDW/albumin (ALB) ratio is a new combined parameter that can predict mortality in patients undergoing burn surgery, and patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetes-related complications were associated with an increased inflammatory burden. RDW seems to be a new inflammatory marker. Elevated RDW was found in inflammation-related diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, and autoimmune liver diseases. Although a definitive mechanism for the association of RDW, RDW/ALB ratio, and mortality has not yet been established, RDW and RDW/ALB seem to be nonspecific parameters that have the potential to provide effective risk stratification in patients with serious diseases.

To date, research related to the prognostic value of RDW with DFUs is scarce. Similarly, there are no previous studies on RDW/ALB ratio in patients with DFUs. In this study, we sought to explore the impact of RDW and RDW/ALB ratio on all-cause mortality in a relatively large cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes and foot ulcers.

### The automated complete blood cell count… [^1169piWe]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The availability of automated blood cell analyzers that provide an index of red blood cell volume distribution width and a mean platelet volume has led to new approaches to patients with anemia and thrombocytopenia. The RDW, which measures heterogeneity of the red blood cell population, complements the mean corpuscular volume in the differential diagnosis of anemia based on peripheral blood analysis. The MPV varies inversely but nonlinearly with the platelet count in normal individuals and is of value in assessing platelet production in the thrombocytopenic patient. The clinical applications of the RDW and MPV, which are currently reported on most routine blood cell counts, are discussed. Karnad A, Poskitt TR.

### Detailed association between red blood cell distribution width and heart failure [^116h4wa4]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liang et al.demonstrated that red blood cell distribution width (RDW) independently predicted mortality in patients with heart failure in combination with N‐terminal pro‐B‐terminal natriuretic peptide (NT‐pro BNP) levels. Several concerns have been raised to improve their findings.

Anisocytosis, which is indicated by higher RDW values, might cause the progression of heart failure and incremental mortality due to erythrocyte deformability and impaired oxygen‐carrying capacity. Recently, hypoxia‐inducible factor‐prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors and sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve renal anemia. These medications might affect clinical outcomes including RDW levels in the heart failure cohorts. Were these medications administered to some of the participants?

Heart failure itself also has a considerable impact on the increase in RDW levels. Heart failure‐related chronic inflammation impairs iron metabolism and bone marrow function, both of which would increase RDW levels. Thus, heart failure and RDW levels have a deep association. Could the authors explain the reason why plasma NT‐pro BNP levels and RDW were "independently" associated with clinical outcomes despite their deep association? A baseline comparison between those with high RDW and those with low RDW among those with elevated plasma NT‐pro BNP might approach the mechanism. Such a comparison might clarify some therapeutic targets to improve RDW levels and clinical outcomes.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^116GfecD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Full blood count

The approach begins with the full blood count (FBC). Hb determination is the most widespread screening method for IDA and the World Health Organization places the lower limit of normal for Hb concentration at 12 g/dL for non-pregnant women, below 11 g/dL in pregnant women and 13 g/dL for men. However, FBC has many limitations when used alone, because of its low specificity and sensitivity. For that reason, in the diagnostic workup of anemia, erythrocyte parameters such as MCV, MCH and RDW are measured and evaluated in combination with Hb. For example hypochromia and microcytosis combined with low ferritin makes the diagnosis of IDA fairly easy, but in patients with cirrhosis MCV is increased because of vitamin deficits and membrane deposition of lipoproteins. In a cross-sectional study of 72 patients with liver cirrhosis Intragumtornchai et al found that 48% of patients with ID, proved by bone marrow aspiration, had an MCV greater than 100 fL.

Another parameter of erythrocytes that is often used together with the MCV results is the RDW, which depicts the variation of red blood cell width. Unfortunately, this tool is also not useful in cirrhotic patients, as was shown by a retrospective study of 241 patients with liver cirrhosis and anemia. In this study Milic et al did not manage to prove any clinical value of RDW in the differentiation of anemia, or any statistically significant increase of RDW in relation to the severity of the disease.

Likewise, the thrombocytosis that exists in both IDA and anemia of inflammatory conditions, due to the effect of erythropoietin and interleukin-6 on megakaryocytes, is not seen in patients with CLD and portal hypertension because of spleen sequestration.

### Biology of anemia, differential diagnosis, and treatment options in human immunodeficiency virus infection [^1151tzEi]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most common hematologic manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The causes of HIV-related anemia are multifactorial and include direct and indirect effects of HIV infection. HIV-related anemia generally is due to reduced red blood cell (RBC) production, secondary to a variety of causes, but it may also involve nutritional deficiencies, increased RBC destruction, or a combination of these problems. Evaluation of hemoglobin level, reticulocyte count, bilirubin, and mean corpuscular volume value and review of the peripheral blood smear are necessary for diagnosis. Treatment of HIV-related anemia should address the correctable underlying causes of this disorder, such as modifications of offending medications, nutritional deficiencies, and parvovirus infection. Patients with HIV infection have a blunted erythropoietin response to anemia. Therapeutic modalities for anemia that is not amenable to correction include blood transfusion and recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa).

### Modulation of red blood cell population dynamics is a fundamental homeostatic response to disease [^1115bkbC]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Increased red blood cell (RBC) volume variation (RDW) has recently been shown to predict a wide range of mortality and morbidity: death due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, renal disease, and more; complications in heart failure and coronary artery disease, advanced stage and worse prognosis in many cancers, poor outcomes in autoimmune disease, and many more. The mechanisms by which all of these diseases lead to increased RDW are unknown. Here we use a semi-mechanistic mathematical model of in vivo RBC population dynamics to dissect the factors controlling RDW and show that elevated RDW results largely from a slight reduction in the in vivo rate of RBC turnover. RBCs become smaller as they age, and a slight reduction in the rate of RBC turnover allows smaller cells to continue circulating, expanding the low-volume tail of the RBC population's volume distribution, and thereby increasing RDW. Our results show that mildly extended RBC lifespan is a previously unrecognized homeostatic adaptation common to a very wide range of pathologic states, likely compensating for subtle reductions in erythropoietic output. A mathematical model-based estimate of the clearance rate may provide a novel early-warning biomarker for a wide range of morbidity and mortality.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^114EUrzm]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Red cell distribution width improves the simplified acute physiology score for risk prediction in unselected critically ill patients [^116K6z5f]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recently, red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of erythrocyte size variability, has been shown to be a prognostic marker in critical illness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adding RDW has the potential to improve the prognostic performance of the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) to predict short- and long-term mortality in an independent, large, and unselected population of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

This observational cohort study includes 17,922 ICU patients with available RDW measurements from different types of ICUs. We modeled the association between RDW and mortality by using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, hematocrit, and severity of illness by using the SAPS.

Results

ICU-, in-hospital-, and 1-year mortality rates in the 17,922 included patients were 7.6% (95% CI, 7.2 to 8.0), 11.2% (95% CI, 10.8 to 11.7), and 25.4% (95% CI, 24.8 to 26.1). RDW was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR per 1% increase in RDW (95%CI)) (1.14 (1.08 to 1.19), P < 0.0001), ICU mortality (1.10 (1.06 to 1.15), P < 0.0001), and 1-year mortality (1.20 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.26); P < 0.001). Adding RDW to SAPS significantly improved the AUC from 0.746 to 0.774 (P < 0.001) for in-hospital mortality and 0.793 to 0.805 (P < 0.001) for ICU mortality. Significant improvements in classification of SAPS were confirmed in reclassification analyses. Subgroups demonstrated robust results for gender, age categories, SAPS categories, anemia, hematocrit categories, and renal failure.

Conclusions

RDW is a promising independent short- and long-term prognostic marker in ICU patients and significantly improves risk stratification of SAPS. Further research is needed the better to understand the pathophysiology underlying these effects.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^112AWSe3]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

A 16‐year‐old female (P‐IIIA) with a past medical history of asthma presented to the hematology clinic with mild macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10 g/dL, red blood cells [RBC] 3.19 × 10⁶/μL, mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 103 femtoliters [fL], and red cell distribution width [RDW] of 12.9%). Platelet and white blood cell counts were normal. Two complete blood counts (CBC) tested within the previous 3 years on two occasions, once for a syncopal episode and the other for abdominal pain, had demonstrated similar findings. She was referred to hematology after her macrocytic anemia was noted during an attempted blood donation. At the hematology clinic, along with the CBC results noted above, she was found to have a negative direct antiglobulin test, a mildly elevated ferritin (158 ng/mL), with normal renal function, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC, 322 μg/dL), and iron saturation (30%). She reported mild occasional fatigue and intermittent thoracic back pain but was otherwise asymptomatic. She denied bleeding symptoms. Her examination was unremarkable, and she did not have evidence of splenomegaly. At the time of evaluation, she had transitioned to a pescatarian diet for 7 months, eating also vegetables and dairy. Her grandmother (P‐I), mother (P‐II), and younger sister (P‐IIIB) were also noted to have mild macrocytic anemia, while P‐II had also been found to have elevated ferritin of unclear etiology (reaching 646 ng/mL, but improved after phlebotomy every 6 weeks for a year).

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD, evaluation, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular volume, and transferrin saturation in the diagnosis of iron deficiency… [^116s2PF4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The usefulness of the red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular volume, and the transferrin saturation in diagnosing iron deficiency anemia were evaluated in a retrospective study of 247 anemic hospitalized patients, many of whom had chronic liver disease. A red cell distribution width greater than 15% had a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 54% for iron deficiency as diagnosed by a low serum ferritin or bone marrow examination. A mean corpuscular volume less than 80 femtoliters had a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 84%. Transferrin saturation less than 16% had a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 86%. Because the sensitivities and specificities of these tests are less than reported in studies of healthier populations, they cannot be relied on for screening for iron deficiency in sick hospitalized patients.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^111jjkFJ]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The red cell distribution width (RDW) reflecting MCV heterogeneity (quantitative index of anisocytosis, i.e. the percentage coefficient of MCV variation) can be considered another parameter of ID. Increased RDW is, however, typical not only for anaemia due to ID, but also anaemia resulting from deficiencies in vitamin B 12 and folic acid, of chronic diseases and sideroblastic anaemia. In HF patients, there are associations between high RDW, and reduced haemoglobin, low MCV, reduced Tsat, increased mortality and hospitalization rates. –

Owing to pathophysiological links and overlaps in regulatory mechanisms of erythropoietin and iron metabolism, – subjects with ID frequently have increased circulating erythropoietin levels, which can be considered another index of iron-restricted erythropoiesis in HF patients, being related to poor outcomes.

Increased soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is another sensitive indicator of ID. Soluble transferrin receptor is the truncated form of transmembrane protein, a receptor for iron–transferrin complex and the major system responsible for the intracellular iron import. It is present on virtually all cells, but a vast majority is localized on erythroid precursors. When iron delivery to target tissues is insufficient for metabolic requirements, the expression of the transferrin receptor increases in order to facilitate intracellular iron influx. Consequently, circulating sTfR (originating from all cells metabolizing iron) quantitatively reflects both the tissue iron demand (tissue iron balance) and the erythroid proliferation rate (total erythroblast mass), but not body iron stores. No study has used this biomarker to indicate and/or guide therapy, and so it should be regarded as a research tool.

Because serum ferritin is a surrogate of iron stores and serum sTfR reflects the tissue iron demand, there is evidence that the combination of these two parameters may describe the iron status more accurately.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^115Hh1of]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that in young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels on admission either alone or in combination with abnormal levels of WBC are associated with significant higher rates of mortality and complicated hospitalization. RDW level as a prognostic marker was unrelated to hemoglobin levels on admission.

RDW is a simple laboratory test used to evaluate variance in the size and form of red blood cells. It is an important marker in the differential diagnosis of anemia. However, RDW was shown to be a predictor of severe morbidity and mortality in several cardiac problems. There is a large body of evidence showing that RDW is a strong predictor for an adverse outcome in these conditions, equivalent to other known markers, such as low ejection fraction, high New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) score and elevated serum B-Type Natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Moreover, it was recently reported that RDW is a strong predictor of mortality in several other conditions such as obesity, malignancies, and chronic kidney disease. Concordant with our findings, Wang et al. reported recently that a graded independent relation between higher RDW and adverse outcomes in ICU patients.

### Red cell distribution width in alcohol abuse and iron deficiency anemia-reply… [^116yNz2r]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In Reply. — Dr Seppä and Mr Sillanaukee suggest that high RDW and normal MCV may herald early alcohol abuse. It is true that liver disease has been described as a common cause of isolated increased RDW. 1, 2 The challenge would now be to distinguish alcohol abuse per se from the liver disease that commonly results from alcohol abuse. Another point to note is that both early pernicious anemia and alcohol abuse-liver disease tend to be associated with high normal MCV, unlike early iron deficiency, which is associated with lownormal MCV. 1 As in many other analyses with broad normal ranges, different parts of "normal" mean different things. We would concur that a high-normal MCV and high RDW suggest liver disease — alcohol abuse, early megaloblastic deficiency, and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy. As shown in our data, early iron deficiency with a normal MCV is predominantly found in the lower half. Bessman JD, McClure S.

### Bone marrow synoptic reporting for hematologic neoplasms: guideline from the college of American pathologists pathology and laboratory quality center [^1146eZDx]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Table 5. Extended — hematologic parameters with prognostic or diagnostic value: In Ph+ pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), low-risk on d1 defined by peripheral blood WBC < 100 000 and bone marrow blast < 5% was associated with significantly better event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), with EFS: 55% low risk, 18% high risk; OS: 79% low risk, 27% high risk. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), hemoglobin (Hgb) thresholds are prognostic, as Hgb > 10 g/dL is associated with better OS in Int-1 and Int-2 MDS, and in MDS, significantly different survival and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was associated with Hgb < 10 g, platelet count (Plt) < 100 000, and absolute neutrophil count < 0.8. Baseline thrombocytopenia < 100 000 was associated with 39% transfusion independence versus 73% without thrombocytopenia, and the odds ratio for decreased cytogenetic response with, versus without, thrombocytopenia was 4.78. For differentiating aplastic anemia (AA) from hypoplastic MDS in adults, peripheral blood Plt, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, and percentage of lymphocytes are significantly different, and red cell distribution width (RDW) values differ with mean RDW, 16.8% severe AA; 17.4% nonsevere AA; versus 20.4% MDS.

### The diagnostic red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia [^112a7PzD]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a marker that describes the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Because it is part of the routine automated output of blood cell counters, the RDW is included in the diagnostic work-up of most hematologic diseases and is easily and inexpensively assessed. Red blood cells (RBCs) typically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, which is why a delayed clearance of older erythrocytes leads to higher RDW levels. Subsequently, a higher RDW mirrors a dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis with either impaired erythropoiesis (including reticulocytosis and macrocytosis; eg, due to toxic effects) or abnormal (prolonged) RBC survival. Although, historically, the clinical meaning of the RDW was limited to the differential diagnosis of anemia, a wider applicability recently became evident. Increased RDW levels are associated with a higher mortality in healthy people, which has been linked to oxidative stress, poor nutritional status, and older age. Data also suggest that a high RDW defines a proinflammatory state, leading to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality, as well as a greater likelihood of developing a variety of malignancies.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^114sG8qq]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RDW is one of the parameters in complete blood count (CBC) that measures variation in red blood cell size or volume (anisocytosis). The most common cause of an elevated RDW is anemia [evaluated in association with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in differential diagnosis]. Regardless of that higher than normal RDW has also been described as a risk factor for unfavourable clinical course in various diseases in children. RDW is known to be a prognostic marker in adult with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the PAH pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in management.

### Red blood cell distribution width and the platelet count in iron-deficient children aged 0.5–3 years [^1176j4RB]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Early detection of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in young children is important to prevent impaired neurodevelopment. Unfortunately, many biomarkers of ID are influenced by infection, thus limiting their usefulness. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the platelet count for detecting ID(A) among otherwise healthy children. A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in the Netherlands to investigate the prevalence of ID(A) in 400 healthy children aged 0.5–3 years. ID was defined as serum ferritin (SF) < 12 μg/L in the absence of infection (C-reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L) and IDA as hemoglobin < 110 g/L combined with ID. RDW (%) and the platelet count were determined in the complete blood cell count. RDW was inversely correlated with SF and not associated with CRP. Calculated cutoff values for RDW to detect ID and IDA gave a relatively low sensitivity (53.1% and 57.1%, respectively) and specificity (64.7% and 69.9%, respectively). Anemic children with a RDW > 14.3% had a 2.7 higher odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–6.3) to be iron deficient, compared with anemic children with a RDW < 14.3%. The platelet count showed a large range in both ID and non-ID children. In conclusion, RDW can be helpful for identifying ID as the cause of anemia in 0.5- to 3-year-old children, but not as primary biomarker of ID(A). RDW values are not influenced by the presence of infection. There appears to be no role for the platelet count in diagnosing ID(A) in this group of children.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^114DU9GQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

RDW in IBD

There are different proposed mechanisms that attempt to explain why RDW is elevated in active IBD and how this is correlated with disease activity. The most probable encountered etiologies involve anemia, and especially iron deficiency anemia (IDA), as well as the impact of inflammation and oxidative stress on the normal process of erythropoiesis.

Anemia in IBD seems to be multifactorial, with an estimated prevalence between 9–74%, while IDA represents the commonest type. Causes implicated include continuous microscopic or macroscopic blood loss from the ulcerated intestinal mucosa, nutritional deficits of vitamins and minerals (iron, folate, B12) due to decreased intake or absorption, effects of medication, and inflammatory insults in the process of hematopoiesis. The RDW value is directly affected and subsequently elevated in IDA, as well as in situations of B12 and folate deprivation, while it is known that the degree and severity of anemia in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are linked to disease activity.

IBD are chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation through the exertional effect of cytokines — interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ — may cause impaired erythropoietin (EPO) production, alterations of red blood cell life span, diminished responsiveness of bone marrow to EPO and impaired iron metabolism, disrupting the normal process of hematopoiesis. Data from the international literature suggest that anemia in IBD is multifactorial and is considered to be a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), caused by a series of negative effects of an activated immune system at different levels of erythropoiesis.

The presence of RBC populations with marked heterogeneity in size, as a result of anemia and deficient erythropoiesis due to direct and indirect effects of inflammation and oxidative stress, seems to be an attractive hypothesis that can possibly explain the correlation of RDW with disease activity. The international literature contains a rather small number of publications that aimed to investigate RDW as an index of activity in IBD, or its correlation with clinical and laboratory markers used to express active disease (Table 2).

### The value of shear wave elastography combined with red blood cell distribution width in evaluating arterial erectile dysfunction [^112heRfR]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The erection process is an intricate neurovascular process that involves the coordination of the neurological, endocrine, psychological and circulatory systems. The inability of a man to achieve and/or sustain a penile erection that is sufficient for sexual engagement and for an acceptable sexual performance is known as erectile dysfunction(ED). ED can be classified as being psychogenic, organic (i.e. neurogenic, hormonal, arterial, cavernous, or drug-induced), or a mixture of psychogenic and organic. Vascular variables are crucial in organic ED because of the microcirculation of the penile corpus cavernosum (CCP). Arterial ED(AED), venous ED, and mixed ED are the three subtypes of vascular ED, with AED being the most prevalent.

The diagnosis of ED is therefore very complex, a process that requires differentiating among types of ED and identifying the causes, associated risk factors and potential life-threatening comorbidities. At present, it is mainly diagnosed through history taking, physical examination, laboratory assessment, and specific investigations.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is one of the quantitative parameters of routine complete blood cells and reflects the heterogeneity of red blood cells. It is a typical marker for differential diagnosis of different types of anemia. Recent studies have shown that RDW can be used as an independent diagnostic marker to predict cardiovascular diseases(CVD) (e.g. hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary syndrome), tumours, metabolic syndromes and inflammatory diseases. As a condition intimately associated with cardiovascular factors, some scholars believe that ED is an early symptom of subclinical CVD or even an independent marker. According to the association between ED and CVD, we hypothesized that clinically pertinent hematological parameters that can be used to predict or evaluate CVD would also be applicable to ED.

The features of shear wave elastography (SWE) include non-invasion quantification, convenience and high repeatability. SWE has been widely investigated to estimating thyroid, breast, and liver mass stiffness. A number of previous researches have investigated the feasibility of using SWE to quantitatively evaluate CCP stiffness for the diagnosis of ED. SWE provides noninvasive quantitative data on CCP stiffness and its change with age, as demonstrated by Inci et al. Hu et al found that compared with normal tissues, two-dimensional SWE can differentiate CCP lesions secondary to hyperlipidemia by quantifying elastic quantitative values.

### Red cell distribution width is predictive of mortality in trauma patients [^111kwDMo]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a component of the complete blood count (CBC) that is traditionally used to identify iron-deficiency anemia. RDW has been shown to predict mortality in patients with multiple different medical conditions and in general populations. It is unknown whether RDW predicts outcomes in trauma patients. This study tested whether RDW predicts mortality in a trauma population at a Level I trauma center.

Methods

Trauma patients with a CBC from October 2005 to December 2011 were evaluated. Sex-specific 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and RDW were studied using Cox regression adjusted for age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), hospital length of stay, blunt versus penetrating trauma, and other CBC parameters.

Results

A total of 3,637 females and 5,901 males were evaluated at 30 days and 1 year. With full adjustment, RDW predicted 30-day mortality in males (for RDW quintiles 1–5: 2.2%, 1.8%, 3.6%, 4.8%, 10.1%, respectively; p < 0.001) but not in females (3.4%, 1.9%, 3.0%, 3.9%, 6.2%; p = 0.036). At 1 year, RDW predicted mortality in both males (p < 0.001; 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.8%, 1.7%, and 8.3%) and females (p < 0.001; 0.5%, 2.1%, 3.0%, 4.2%, and 8.8%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis found c = 0.705 in males and c = 0.625 in females at 30 days and c = 0.820 in males and c = 0.723 in females at 1 year.

Conclusion

RDW independently predicted mortality in trauma patients at this single Level I trauma center. RDW may reveal underlying health status and be clinically useful for prognostication. The mechanistic relationship between RDW and mortality in trauma remains unknown and should be further evaluated.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with incident myocardial infarction in a general population: the troms ø study [^112wnauc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency in itself is also a common cause of high RDW. In 1981, Sullivan proposed that iron deficiency could protect against MI. Some later studies supported this hypothesis, whereas others did not find any relationship or even an inverse relationship between iron deficiency and MI. Iron deficiency without anemia has been shown to affect health issues – and may specifically attenuate iron‐dependent scavenger functions of oxidative stress that may promote inflammation. Consequently, the impact of iron status on RDW and subsequent MI should be investigated in future studies.

It has been reported that increased CV mortality by RDW is confined to those with anemia. To explore the impact of anemia on the relationship between RDW and risk of MI in our study, we included hemoglobin in our multivariable model and performed analyses in which anemic participants were excluded. The risk estimates for MI by RDW in our study were not affected by adjustment for hemoglobin or by excluding participants with anemia. This demonstrates that anemia does not explain the strong association between RDW and MI. Furthermore, results from an elderly outpatient cohort implied that the association between extremely high RDW (> 16.6%) and mortality was particularly strong in those with nonanemic macrocytosis (MCV > 96 fL) or microcytosis (MCV < 80 fL). We found no association between RDW and risk of MI in nonanemic participants with macrocytosis (893 participants with 85 MI events) or microcytosis (254 participants with 14 events).

Alternatively, RDW may exert a more direct effect in the pathway toward MI. The erythrocytes contain large amounts of free cholesterol, and pathological changes in the erythrocyte membrane may potentially lead to accumulation of erythrocytes within the atheromatous plaque. The erythrocyte membrane promotes atherosclerosis by deposition of free cholesterol to atherosclerotic plaques, thereby providing lipid rich membranes to foam cell formation, and by propagation of the inflammatory cascade. – Accumulation of erythrocytes promotes plaque instability.– The concept is supported by higher levels of total cholesterol in the erythrocyte membrane from patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome compared with patients with chronic stable anginaand a positive association between cholesterol content of erythrocyte membranes and RDW values in patients with coronary disease. An association between the total cholesterol content of the erythrocyte membrane and the severity of coronary artery disease has also been reported. The mechanisms whereby RDW could influence development of atherosclerosis remain unsettled.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^116zAhLb]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current strategy to identify iron deficiency anemia relies on markers involving high costs. Reports have suggested red cell distribution width (RDW) as a potential screening test for identifying iron deficiency anemia (IDA) but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Our study elucidates the discriminative ability of RDW for detecting IDA among young children.

Methods

2091 blood reports of children aged 1–3 years from an urban low socio-economic population of Delhi were analyzed to evaluate the sensitivity of RDW in discriminating IDA using receiver's operating characteristic curve. Hemoglobin and RDW were estimated using coulter, zinc protoporphyrin with AVIV fluorometer and serum ferritin by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

A total of 1026 samples were classified as iron deficient anemia using gold standard. As a marker of overall efficiency, area under the curve for RDW was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81–0.84; p < 0.001). Sensitivity of RDW at cut-off of 18% to detect iron deficiency anemia was 76.5% and specificity 73.1% yielding a positive predictive value of 73% and negative predictive value of 76%. At a cut-off of RDW 16.4%, the sensitivity was 94% and at a cut-off of 21%, the specificity was 95%. Combination of hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL and RDW > 15%, yielded a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 90%. These data suggest that simple coulter analysis estimating hemoglobin and RDW can be used for identification of children in need for iron therapy.

Conclusions

In India and similar settings, RDW > 15% with hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL identifies iron deficient anemic children without need for iron status markers which could help reduce cost of management especially in poor settings.

Stratified analyses were performed based on sex (male, female), age (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years), smoking status (never smokers, former smokers, current smokers), hypertension (yes, no), CVD (yes, no), and diabetes (yes or no). The results revealed that the association of RDW and HRR with the risk of all-cause mortality was generally consistent across subgroups (Table 3–4). Although the P values were < 0.05 for the interaction of RDW and all-cause mortality in age and CVD subgroups, the trends in both subgroups indicate consistency in our data. This suggests that, despite some variability in statistical significance, our findings support the positive association of RDW with the risk of all-cause mortality.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-RDW ratio with contrast-associated acute kidney injury in patients undergoing coronary angiography: a retrospective study [^116PoqGn]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Contrast‐associated acute kidney injury (CA‐AKI) is a significant concern in medical practice, ranking as the third leading cause of hospital‐acquired acute kidney injury. Its prevalence varies, affecting 1%–2% of the general population, but the risk can be significantly higher, up to 50%, in high‐risk groups. Several established risk factors, including severe chronic kidney disease, hypotension, excessive contrast medium, anemia, and diabetes, have been linked to an increased likelihood of CA‐AKI and have been incorporated into risk stratification models.

Inflammation has been identified as a key player in the development and progression of various diseases, including cardiovascular conditions like CA‐AKI. Numerous studies have highlighted the prognostic value of systemic inflammatory markers in CA‐AKI patients, independent of traditional risk factors. These markers include C‐reactive protein (CRP), interleukin‐6, and white blood cell count.

In addition to established inflammatory markers, red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has gained attention as an informative and cost‐effective indicator of systemic inflammation. A growing body of research has demonstrated the prognostic significance of RDW in inflammation‐related cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and ischemic cardiac conditions. Hemoglobin, on the other hand, is a critical parameter reflecting anemia, which is a traditional risk factor for CA‐AKI. Hemoglobin‐to‐RDW ratio (HRR), a novel metric introduced by Sun et al. is a novel indicator of chronic inflammation combining the prognostic information from hemoglobin and RDW. Accordingly, the accessibility of RDW and HRR in clinical practice for CA‐AKI seems reasonable and potentially valuable.

Therefore, this retrospective study set out to determine the associations of RDW and HRR with CA‐AKI in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), for the sake of aggressive management to reduce the risk of CA‐AKI.

### The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study [^115frxdq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

CRP is a sensitive acute phase protein that lacks specificity due to increased levels in all acute inflammatory processes. Its concentration increases with the duration and extent of the inflammation. In a meta-analysis examining the accuracy of CRP level in the diagnosis of AA, Hallan and Asberg found a wide range of sensitivity (40%-99%) and specificity (27%-90%). Similar to the literature, this study found a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 41% for CRP in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Among the assessed parameters, CRP had the highest sensitivity and the lowest specificity.

RDW is commonly used to discriminate between microcytic anemia's due to iron deficiency and those due to thalassemia or hemoglobinopathies. Increased RDW levels are related to impaired erythropoiesis or erythrocyte degradation. The typical reference range spans between 11.6 and 15.5%. Recent studies have demonstrated that higher RDW levels, even within the normal reference range, were associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and stroke independent of hemoglobin values. Furthermore RDW has been studied as a surrogate marker in many pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and celiac disease. Although the exact pathophysiological basis of this relationship is unclear, chronic inflammation, aging, malnutrition, and anemia are proposed underlying factors in this topic.

### Red cell distribution width and dementia among rural-dwelling older adults: the MIND-China study [^111DJaRc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia affects over 50 million people worldwide, and nearly 60%of all dementia patients live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Notably, the number of people with dementia is projected to increase faster in LMICs than in high-income countries in the coming decades. Since the 1990s the prevalence of dementia in China has increased steadily in all age groups from 60 years of age. The total annual expenditure for dementia in China was estimated at US$168 billion. The prevalence of dementia was notably higher in the rural than urban communities. Given that there is currently no curative therapy available for dementia, identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for preventive and therapeutic interventions to delay the onset of dementia and slow cognitive decline.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of circulating erythrocyte volume. It is routinely calculated by the overwhelming majority of hematologic analyzers according to red blood cell (RBC) volume and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A normal RDW suggests homogeneous RBC size, whereas an elevated RDW indicates heterogeneous RBC size, known as anisocytosis. RDW in combination with MCV can used for differential diagnosis of anemia. An elevated RDW is often related to anemia due to nutrient deficiency (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) and sideroblastic anemia, and a normal RDW is often related to anemia from chronic disease, thalassemia heterozygosity, and aplastic anemia. Studies have shown that an increased RDW is associated with mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. The association of RDW with adverse health outcomes may depend on anemia or hemoglobin levels. Of note, the cross-sectional data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project found that elevated RDW was associated with dementia, especially among non-anemic participants. In addition, evidence has been accumulating over the last decade that anemia or low hemoglobin is related to cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. However, most population-based studies of anemia and dementia have been conducted among high-income countries. In particular, the relationship of abnormal RDW with dementia and cognitive function as well as the interplay of increased RDW and anemia in cognitive aging has yet to be explored among LMICs.

Therefore, in this population-based cross-sectional study of older adults living in the rural communities in China, we sought 1) to evaluate the associations of RDW and anemia with dementia and global cognitive function; and 2) to explore whether their association varied by anemia status.

### Red cell distribution width and mortality in Hemodialysis Patients [^117GYqDU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an index of red blood cell volume variability that has historically been used as a marker of iron deficiency anemia. More recently, studies have shown that elevated RDW is associated with higher mortality risk in the general population. However, there is lack of data demonstrating the association between RDW and mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We hypothesized that higher RDW is associated with higher mortality in HD patients.

Study Design

Retrospective observational study using a large HD patient cohort.

Setting & Participants

109,675 adult maintenance HD patients treated in a large dialysis organization from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011.

Predictor

Baseline and time-varying RDW, grouped into 5 categories: < 14.5%, 14.5% to < 15.5%, 15.5% to < 16.5%, 16.5% to < 17.5%, and ≥ 17.5%. RDW of 15.5% to < 16.5% was used as the reference category.

Outcome

All-cause mortality.

Results

Mean age of study participants was 63 ± 15 (SD) years and the study cohort was 44% women. In baseline and time-varying analyses, there was a graded association between higher RDW and incrementally higher mortality risk. Receiver operating characteristic, net reclassification analysis, and integrated discrimination improvement analyses demonstrated that RDW is a stronger predictor of mortality as compared with traditional markers of anemia, such as hemoglobin, ferritin, and iron saturation values.

Limitations

Lack of comprehensive data that may be associated with both RDW and HD patient outcomes, such as blood transfusion data, socioeconomic status, and other unknown confounders; therefore, the possibility of residual confounding could not be excluded. Also, lack of information for cause of death; thus, cardiovascular mortality outcomes could not be examined.

Conclusions

In HD patients, higher RDW is associated with incrementally higher mortality risk. RDW is also a stronger predictor of mortality than traditional laboratory markers of anemia. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the association between RDW and mortality.

### Red blood cell distribution width predicts long-term outcome regardless of anaemia status in acute heart failure patients [^115vEnBf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To study the long-term prognostic value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF) and to compare the value of this measurement with haemoglobin levels and anaemia status.

Methods and Results

During a 2-year period, we studied 628 consecutive patients (aged 71 years [interquartile range, IQR: 61–77], 68% male) hospitalized with AHF. Demographic, clinical, echocardiographic, and laboratory characteristics were registered at discharge and patients were closely followed-up for 38.1 months [16.5–49.1]. Median RDW was 14.4% [13.5–15.5] and was higher among decedents (15.0% [13.8–16.1] vs. 14.2 [13.3–15.3], P < 0.001). After adjustment for other prognostic factors in a multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model, RDW remained a significant predictor (P = 0.004, HR 1.072, 95% CI 1.023–1.124); whereas, haemoglobin or anaemia status did not add prognostic information. RDW levels above the median were associated with a significantly lower survival rate on long-term follow-up (log rank < 0.001). These levels were predictive of death in anaemic patients (n = 263, P = 0.029) and especially in non-anaemic patients (n = 365) (P < 0.001, HR 1.287, 95% CI 1.147–1.445), even after adjustment in the multivariable model.

Conclusion

Higher RDW levels at discharge were associated with a worse long-term outcome, regardless of haemoglobin levels and anaemia status.
