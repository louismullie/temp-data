## Question

Can ascites and recent fluid removal influence GFR?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ascites and recent fluid removal (paracentesis) can influence GFR. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hemodynamic effects of cirrhosis and ascites on renal perfusion and baseline GFR. Then, I should examine how paracentesis acutely perturbs these dynamics, including paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction and its renal consequences. Next, I will quantify the impact on kidney function and address the pitfalls of estimating GFR in cirrhosis. After that, I need to verify the evidence for albumin to prevent GFR decline and review alternatives like TIPS and alfapump. Finally, I should synthesize clinical implications, monitoring, and guideline-concordant strategies to preserve GFR, while double-checking for any caveats or exceptions in special populations [^114WSCDL] [^115PJ6BY] [^116ssnSb].

> Let me first confirm the baseline pathophysiology. In advanced cirrhosis, marked splanchnic arterial vasodilation lowers effective arterial blood volume and provokes neurohormonal activation (RAAS, sympathetic nervous system, and vasopressin), which drives renal vasoconstriction and impairs renal perfusion, reducing GFR even before any procedure takes place; this functional phenotype encompasses hepatorenal syndrome–AKI in the appropriate clinical context of cirrhosis with ascites, and it is largely hemodynamic rather than structural at onset [^114WSCDL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fluid removal yet; I should examine its acute effects. Large-volume paracentesis abruptly decreases intra-abdominal pressure but can also worsen effective hypovolemia via fluid shifts, leading to paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, which is characterized by heightened RAAS activity, hyponatremia, encephalopathy, and critically, AKI with a fall in GFR; historically, I used to think this was primarily a risk only when more than 5 liters are removed, but wait, let me verify whether smaller volumes can also trigger this in high-risk patients [^115PJ6BY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the threshold issue. A randomized study in ACLF showed that even modest-volume paracentesis under 5 liters caused PICD in 70% without albumin versus 30% with albumin, with AKI occurring in 62.5% versus 30%, respectively, indicating that high-risk phenotypes can experience significant GFR decline after smaller volume taps; this corrects my initial assumption that only large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis is dangerous, and it emphasizes the hemodynamic fragility in ACLF and decompensated cirrhosis [^111BMk6r] [^115PJ6BY].

> I will now examine how these hemodynamic shifts translate to measurable kidney function changes. The rise in plasma renin activity after paracentesis reflects circulatory stress and correlates with PICD and AKI risk; clinically, creatinine often rises and urine output falls when intravascular volume is not supported, signaling a true decrease in GFR in many patients; but wait, I should confirm whether we can rely on creatinine to quantify the GFR drop accurately in cirrhosis, given known biomarker limitations [^111BMk6r] [^115PJ6BY] [^114WSCDL].

> Let me consider the accuracy of GFR assessment here. Serum creatinine systematically overestimates true GFR in cirrhosis due to reduced creatinine production, increased tubular secretion, and low muscle mass; a classic appraisal estimated a median 95% overestimation, so eGFRcr can appear "reassuring" even when true GFR is reduced, particularly in ascites, and this can obscure both baseline renal dysfunction and procedure-related declines; I should also verify modern performance data, which show that eGFRcr-cys equations outperform creatinine-only estimates across comorbidities including liver disease, meaning cystatin C or combined markers can improve detection of true declines, although even these can be imperfect when GFR is rapidly changing [^1149m3ny] [^112zTzYw] [^116mbjfY] [^113kdZn5].

> Next, I should review prevention: does albumin preserve GFR after fluid removal. Albumin expansion counters the effective hypovolemia after paracentesis and reduces PICD, AKI, and even short-term mortality in high-risk settings; guideline-concordant dosing is typically 8 g per liter of ascites removed when more than 5 liters are tapped, and in patients at high risk (for example ACLF or evolving AKI), albumin may be reasonable even for less than 5 liters, which aligns with the physiologic fragility seen in ACLF; I need to ensure dose and indications match major guidance, including EASL, AASLD, and ADQI/ICA consensus [^111BMk6r] [^115PJ6BY] [^112TSw1H] [^116ssnSb] [^113snnRy] [^111NwMJZ] [^113NBDUZ].

> But wait, what if repeated taps perpetuate harm despite albumin. Let me reconsider alternatives that might stabilize renal hemodynamics. TIPS decompresses portal hypertension, improves effective arterial filling, and can improve kidney function in appropriate patients, with matched data showing a roughly 21 mL/min/1.73 m² increase in eGFR at 90 days when baseline eGFR was below 60 compared with serial paracentesis; alfapump reduces the need for LVP but can precipitate AKI if early drainage rates are excessive, implying the need for careful rate settings and sometimes adjunct albumin to avoid chronic effective hypovolemia; these options must be individualized based on candidacy, infection risk, encephalopathy risk, and access to close monitoring [^115qLWfN] [^113NBDUZ] [^113n9Xj3] [^113Q9tPo].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic work-up and monitoring are rigorous before and after paracentesis. I should confirm intravascular volume status, follow blood pressure, heart rate, urine output, weight, and electrolytes, and monitor creatinine and, when feasible, cystatin C or combined eGFRcr-cys to mitigate the known limitations of creatinine alone; where the clinical stakes are high and resources allow, measured GFR or repeated cystatin C can help clarify true function, while timely consideration of HRS-AKI criteria and early vasoconstrictor therapy is crucial if renal dysfunction progresses despite appropriate volume management, as emphasized by ADQI/ICA and EASL guidance, with staging and trajectory informing urgency and interventions [^114WSCDL] [^116gmDqe] [^111oHM3r] [^112zTzYw].

> Synthesizing this, I should double-check that the direct answer is clear. Yes, ascites reflects a hemodynamic state that reduces effective arterial volume and predisposes to renal vasoconstriction with lower baseline GFR, and recent fluid removal can acutely worsen this via PICD unless intravascular volume is protected; albumin mitigates this risk, while strategies like TIPS can durably improve renal hemodynamics and reduce reliance on repeated paracenteses, whereas alfapump requires cautious titration to avoid ongoing effective hypovolemia and AKI; accurate assessment of GFR is essential because creatinine often misleads in cirrhosis, and cystatin C or combined equations perform better for decision-making [^114WSCDL] [^115PJ6BY] [^111BMk6r] [^112TSw1H] [^112zTzYw].

> Final check and clinical implications I should emphasize. Always plan paracentesis with hemodynamic monitoring and albumin when indicated, consider earlier TIPS evaluation for refractory ascites to protect renal function, use nuanced GFR assessment beyond creatinine alone, and escalate promptly for suspected HRS-AKI with guideline-directed vasoconstrictors and transplant evaluation; this stepwise, reference-based approach reduces the risk of GFR decline tied to ascites and fluid removal while addressing the limitations of biomarker estimation in cirrhosis [^111NwMJZ] [^113NBDUZ] [^112zTzYw] [^114WSCDL].

Yes, ascites and recent fluid removal can **significantly affect GFR**. Ascites causes **renal hypoperfusion** and neurohormonal activation [^114WSCDL], reducing GFR and risking HRS-AKI [^116gmDqe]. Large-volume paracentesis without albumin can trigger **PICD and AKI** [^115PJ6BY], further lowering GFR [^111BMk6r]. Albumin infusion during paracentesis is essential to prevent **PICD** [^112TSw1H] and preserve **renal function** [^113snnRy]. Creatinine-based eGFR is often inaccurate in cirrhosis with ascites; use **cystatin C–based or combined equations** for better GFR estimation [^1149m3ny] [^112zTzYw].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking ascites to reduced GFR

Ascites reflects advanced portal hypertension and cirrhosis, characterized by **splanchnic vasodilation** and reduced effective arterial blood volume [^117Xp4gp]. This activates the **RAAS, SNS, and vasopressin** [^114WSCDL], leading to renal vasoconstriction, sodium and water retention, and reduced GFR [^116gmDqe]. Persistent hypoperfusion can lead to **HRS-AKI**, a functional renal failure with high mortality [^114WSCDL].

---

## Impact of recent fluid removal (paracentesis) on GFR

Paracentesis relieves symptoms but can cause **PICD**, defined by a ≥ 50% increase in plasma renin activity or aldosterone within 6 days post-procedure [^111BMk6r]. This leads to renal hypoperfusion, AKI [^112TSw1H], and reduced GFR [^111BMk6r].

- **Large-volume paracentesis (LVP)**: Removing > 5 L without albumin increases PICD and AKI risk, reducing GFR [^111BMk6r] [^115PJ6BY].
- **Albumin infusion**: 8 g/L removed (typically 40 g for 5 L) [^112TSw1H] prevents PICD and preserves renal function [^113NBDUZ] [^113snnRy].
- **Modest-volume paracentesis**: Even < 5 L can cause PICD in ACLF [^111A3RqX]; albumin reduces this risk [^111BMk6r].

---

## Clinical evidence of GFR changes after paracentesis

Studies show **transient GFR decline** after paracentesis, especially without albumin [^115PJ6BY]. In ACLF, PICD occurred in 70% without albumin versus 30% with albumin, with higher AKI and mortality in the no-albumin group [^111BMk6r]. An albumin dose of **8 g/L removed** is recommended [^112TSw1H] to prevent PICD and maintain GFR [^113snnRy].

---

## Accuracy of GFR measurement methods in ascites

Creatinine-based eGFR is often **inaccurate in cirrhosis** due to low muscle mass, altered creatinine metabolism, and fluid shifts [^111NHckj], leading to overestimation of true GFR [^1149m3ny]. Cystatin C–based or combined equations are **more accurate** in this setting [^11382Shg] [^112zTzYw].

| **GFR measurement method** | **Accuracy in ascites** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Creatinine-based eGFR | Low | Overestimates GFR due to low muscle mass and fluid shifts [^1149m3ny] |
| Cystatin C–based eGFR | Moderate | Less affected by muscle mass; more accurate in cirrhosis [^112zTzYw] |
| Combined creatinine-cystatin C eGFR | High | Most accurate in cirrhosis with ascites [^112zTzYw] |
| Measured GFR (iohexol clearance) | High | Resource-intensive; not widely available [^112zTzYw] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the risk of **renal dysfunction** associated with ascites and paracentesis, clinicians should:

- **Monitor renal function**: Track serum creatinine, cystatin C, and urine output after paracentesis [^116gmDqe].
- **Use albumin infusion**: 8 g/L removed during LVP [^112TSw1H] to prevent PICD and preserve GFR [^113snnRy].
- **Consider TIPS**: For refractory ascites to reduce paracentesis needs and improve renal function [^115qLWfN].
- **Adjust medications**: Avoid nephrotoxins and dose renally cleared drugs appropriately [^114WSCDL].

---

Ascites and recent fluid removal can **reduce GFR** via **hemodynamic instability** and neurohormonal activation [^113NBDUZ]. Albumin during paracentesis **prevents PICD** and preserves renal function, while cystatin C–based or combined equations improve GFR estimation in cirrhosis with ascites [^112zTzYw].

**Recommendations**: Albumin (as a 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of more than 5 liters is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin per liter of ascites removed (quality of evidence: high; recommendation: strong). Albumin (as a 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of less than 5 liters at a dose of 8 g albumin per liter of ascites removed in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) or a high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury (quality of evidence: low; recommendation: weak). In patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and either increased serum creatinine or rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin per kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g per kg on day 3, is recommended (quality of evidence: low; recommendation: weak).

### Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction with modest-volume paracentesis is partly ameliorated by albumin infusion in acute-on-chronic liver failure [^111BMk6r]. Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) is a serious complication of large-volume (> 5 L) paracentesis in cirrhosis and is reduced with albumin infusion. There is a lack of data on PICD in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Because ACLF patients have greater hemodynamic derangements than patients with decompensated cirrhosis, we investigated whether PICD could develop with modest-volume paracentesis (MVP) and the role of albumin infusion.

A total of 80 ACLF patients undergoing < 5 L paracentesis were randomized to receive albumin (8 g/dL of ascitic fluid; n = 40) or no albumin (n = 40) and serially followed to detect PICD. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, including volume of ascitic tap (4.16 ± 0.23 versus 4.14 ± 0.27 L; P = 0.72) and plasma renin activity (PRA; 20.5 ± 7.03 versus 23.2 ± 8.24 ng/mL/hour; P = 0.12). PICD was more frequent in the no-albumin group than the albumin group (70% versus 30%; P = 0.001), with higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (50% versus 27.5%; P = 0.04), hyponatremia (67.5% versus 22.5%; P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (62.5% versus 30%; P = 0.001), and in-house mortality (62.5% versus 27.5%; P = 0.003). PRA of 25.15 ng/mL at day 3 had sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 68%, respectively, for development of PICD at day 6. Albumin infusion decreased the incidence of PICD at day 6 (odds ratio, 0.068; 95% confidence interval, 0.011–0.43; P = 0.005).

In conclusion, PICD is common and develops even with MVP in ACLF patients. Albumin infusion decreases the incidence of PICD.

### Accuracy of GFR estimating equations based on creatinine, cystatin C or both in routine care [^112zTzYw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

New equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate based on creatinine (eGFRcr), cystatin C (eGFRcys), or both (eGFRcr-cys) have been developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and the European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC). There is a need to evaluate the performance of these equations in diverse European settings to inform implementation decisions, especially among people with key comorbid conditions.

- **Methods**: We performed a cross-sectional study including 6174 adults referred for single-point plasma clearance of iohexol in Stockholm, Sweden, with 9579 concurrent measurements of creatinine and cystatin C. We assessed the performance of the CKD-EPI 2009/2012/2021, EKFC 2021/2023, revised Lund-Malmö (RLM) 2011, and Caucasian, Asian, Pediatric and Adult (CAPA) 2014 equations against measured GFR (mGFR).

- **Results**: Mean age was 56 years, median mGFR was 62 mL/min/1.73 m², and 40% were female. Comorbid conditions were common: cardiovascular disease (30%), liver disease (28%), diabetes (26%), and cancer (26%). All eGFRcr-cys equations had small bias and P30 (the percentage of estimated values within 30% of mGFR) close to 90%, and performed better than eGFRcr or eGFRcys equations. Among eGFRcr equations, CKD-EPI 2009 and CKD-EPI 2021 showed larger bias and lower P30 than EKFC 2021 and RLM. There were no meaningful differences in performance across eGFRcys equations. Findings were consistent across comorbid conditions, and eGFRcr-cys equations showed good performance in patients with liver disease, cancer, and heart failure.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and International Club of Ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^114WSCDL]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

HRS phenotype describes renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and ascites (a sine qua non in the diagnosis of HRS), caused by reduced renal perfusion through hemodynamic alterations in the arterial circulation and overactivity of the endogenous vasoactive systems. Systemic inflammation contributes to neurohumoral and vasodilatory derangements resulting in functional AKI (HRS-AKI) that persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation and may be reversible with vasoconstrictive therapy.

In patients with cirrhosis and ascites who present with AKI, HRS-AKI is an essential part of the differential diagnosis and may not always occur in isolation. Even where other etiologies of AKI coexist, HRS-AKI may be the primary cause of AKI. Therefore, appropriate and rapid work-up and diagnosis of the cause of AKI are crucial in ensuring timely recognition and treatment of HRS-AKI.

Intravascular volume should be assessed in all patients who present with AKI. In those with clinical and hemodynamic evidence of intravascular volume depletion, assessment of response to fluid resuscitation should be completed within 24 hours, to ensure early diagnosis and initiation of treatment for HRS-AKI. In patients who are euvolemic or have evidence of intravascular fluid overload, 48 hours of albumin infusion for the diagnosis of HRS-AKI is not appropriate and will lead to fluid accumulation. In addition, 48 hours of systematic administration of albumin may also delay the initiation of terlipressin in patients who are euvolemic at baseline.

### Comparison of performance of improved serum estimators of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to Tc-DTPA GFR methods in patients with hepatic cirrhosis [^113kdZn5]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurements are critical in patients with hepatic cirrhosis but potentially erroneous when based on serum creatinine. New equations for estimated GFR (eGFR) have shown variable performance in cirrhotics, possibly due to inaccuracies in reference methods for measured GFR (mGFR). The primary objective was to compare the performance of four improved eGFR equations with a 1-compartment, 2-sample plasma slope intercept 99m Tc-DTPA mGFR method, to determine whether any of the eGFR calculations could replace plasma 99m Tc-DTPA mGFR in patients with cirrhosis. The secondary objective was to test the hypothesis that mGFR using voluntary voided urine collections introduces error compared with plasma-only methods.

Methods: Fifty-four patients with hepatic cirrhosis underwent mGFR determinations from two plasma samples at 1 and 3 hours after intravenous administration of 185 MBq of 99m Tc-DTPA. GFR was also generated by a UV/P calculation derived from blood and urine samples. These mGFRs were compared with the eGFRs generated by four estimating equations: MDRD (Modified Diet in Renal Disease), CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration) (serum creatinine [SCr]), CKD-EPI (cystatin [CysC]), and CKD-EPI (CysC+SCr). eGFRs were compared with mGFRs by Pearson correlation, precision, bias, percentage bias, and accuracy (eGFRs varying by < 10% [p10], < 20% [p20], or < 30% [p30] from the corresponding mGFR).

Results: All eGFRs showed poorer performance when the UV/P 99m Tc-DTPA mGFR was used as the reference than when the plasma 99m Tc-DTPA mGFR was used.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112Vb3M7]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, specifically in relation to the evaluation of renal impairment, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend establishing the diagnosis of AKI in patients with cirrhosis based on the adapted KDIGO criteria. Diagnosis should be made based on either an increase in serum creatinine of > 0.3 mg/dL from baseline within 48 hours or an increase of ≥ 50% from baseline within 3 months.

### Goal-directed fluid therapy does not improve early glomerular filtration rate in a porcine renal transplantation model [^113Jt1Pq]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Individually guided fluid therapy (IGDT) is defined as fluid administration tailored to hemodynamic parameters, such as stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), and cardiac output. The administration of norepinephrine (NE) has also been explored as a strategy to optimize renal blood flow, but there is no clear evidence of beneficial effects on graft function.

Using a porcine renal transplantation model, we studied both interventions in a vascular system comparable to humans. Our hypothesis was that IGDT would improve early glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in pigs undergoing renal transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of IGDT versus high-volume fluid therapy (HVFT) used intra- and postoperatively on early GFR post-transplantation. We also evaluated kidney tissue oxygenation, vascular glycocalyx integrity, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation.

### Measurement and estimation of GFR for use in clinical practice: Core curriculum 2021 [^111NHckj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is fundamental to clinical practice, public health, and research. The kidney has several critical functions; GFR is used as an overall assessment of these kidney functions. GFR is used to diagnose, stage, and manage chronic kidney disease (CKD); ascertain the prognosis for chronic kidney disease-related events and mortality; and determine drug dosages. GFR is the rate at which the glomerulus filters plasma to produce an ultrafiltrate and can be assessed from clearance or serum levels of filtration markers. Clearance measurements using exogenous filtration markers are difficult to perform in routine clinical practice, so GFR is more commonly estimated through equations based on serum concentrations of endogenous filtration markers, most commonly creatinine. These GFR estimates are reasonably accurate, but optimal care for patients may require a confirmatory test for a more accurate GFR assessment. Confirmatory tests currently available include cystatin C-based equations, urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers, or urinary clearance of creatinine. Appreciation of the concept of GFR and methods for optimal assessment in routine practice or special circumstances, and their strengths and limitations, are critical in making judicious use of the available tools.

### Changes in kidney function after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts versus large-volume paracentesis in cirrhosis: A matched cohort analysis [^115qLWfN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites have physiological and hormonal dysregulation that contributes to decreased kidney function. Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can reverse these changes and potentially improve kidney function. We sought to evaluate the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) following TIPS placement.

- **Study design**: Retrospective, matched cohort analysis.

- **Settings & participants**: Patients who underwent first-time TIPS placement for refractory ascites from 1995 to 2014. Frequency matching was used to generate a comparator group of patients with cirrhosis and ascites treated with serial large-volume paracentesis (LVP) in a 1:1 fashion.

- **Predictor**: TIPS placement compared to serial LVP.

- **Outcome**: Change in eGFR over 90 days' follow-up.

- **Measurements**: Multivariable regression stratified by baseline eGFR < 60 versus ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m²; analysis of effect modification between TIPS placement and baseline eGFR.

Results indicated that 276 participants (TIPS, n = 138; serial LVP, n = 138) were analyzed. After 90 days, eGFRs increased significantly after TIPS placement in participants with baseline eGFRs < 60 mL/min/1.73m² compared to treatment with serial LVP (21 [95% CI, 13–29] mL/min/1.73m²; P < 0.001). There was no difference in those with eGFRs ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m² (1 [95% CI, -9 to 12] mL/min/1.73m²; P = 0.8). There was significant effect modification between TIPS status and baseline eGFR (P = 0.001) in a model that included all participants.

- **Limitations**: Outcomes were restricted by clinically recorded data.

### Plasma expanders for people with cirrhosis and large ascites treated with abdominal paracentesis [^115PJ6BY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Plasma volume expanders are used in connection with paracentesis in people with cirrhosis to prevent the reduction of effective plasma volume. This reduction may trigger deleterious effects on hemodynamic balance and increase morbidity and mortality. Albumin is considered the standard product, against which no plasma expansion or other plasma expanders — such as other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol — have been compared. However, the benefits and harms of these plasma expanders are not fully clear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of any plasma volume expanders, such as albumin, other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus no plasma volume expander or versus another plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until January 2019. Furthermore, we searched FDA, EMA, WHO (last search January 2019), www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and www.controlled-trials.com/ for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials, no matter their design or year of publication, publication status, and language, assessing the use of any type of plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites were included.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^115o9h96]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for all patients with new-onset ascites. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on the pretest probability of a specific diagnosis.

- **Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis**:
	- Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission.
	- A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, fever, or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function.
	- An ascitic neutrophil count greater than 250/mm³ remains the gold standard for diagnosing SBP. This can be performed either manually through microscopy or by using automated counts based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells.

### Better with ultrasound: Paracentesis [^114ho7ij]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure and generally considered to be low risk. Despite its overall favorable safety profile, the use of ultrasound has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of complications, especially in higher-risk patients. Many individual ultrasound techniques have been described in the literature, each with the goal of making paracentesis safer. This article presents a systematic approach for incorporating many of these tools into bedside practice and includes a series of illustrative figures and narrated video presentations to demonstrate the techniques described.

### Goal-directed fluid therapy does not improve early glomerular filtration rate in a porcine renal transplantation model [^114Vvejj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Insufficient fluid administration intra- and postoperatively may lead to delayed renal graft function (DGF), while fluid overload increases the risk of heart failure, infection, and obstipation. Several fluid protocols have been suggested to ensure an optimal fluid state. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the clinical impact of these regimens. This study aimed to determine whether individualized goal-directed fluid therapy (IGDT) positively affects initial renal function compared to high-volume fluid therapy (HVFT) and to examine the effects on renal endothelial glycocalyx, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, and medullary tissue oxygenation. The hypothesis was that IGDT improves early glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in pigs subjected to renal transplantation.

- **Methods**: This was an experimental randomized study. Using a porcine renal transplantation model, animals were randomly assigned to receive IGDT or HVFT during and until 1 hour after transplantation from brain-dead donors. The kidneys were exposed to 18 hours of cold ischemia. The recipients were observed until 10 hours after reperfusion, which included GFR measured as clearance of chrom-51-ethylendiamintetraacetat (51 Cr-EDTA), animal weight, and renal tissue oxygenation by fiber optic probes. The renal expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers as well as glomerular endothelial glycocalyx were analyzed in the graft using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and immunofluorescence.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and International Club of Ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^116b5nX2]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Various markers have been assessed in patients with cirrhosis. Measurement of the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) to differentiate acute tubular injury (ATI) from hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) has been thought to be unhelpful since FENa 220 μg/g of creatinine. Notably, these studies have shown overlap between different phenotypes. This may be due to a combination of patient population heterogeneity, the presence of underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD), differences in assays used, and results based on adjudicated gold standards rather than histopathological diagnosis. It may also reflect possible progression along a continuum from functional to structural causes of AKI.

Combining markers such as urinary kidney injury molecule-1, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL), and cystatin C (CysC) was found to be more effective than using one marker alone in identifying HRS-AKI, especially after adding clinical parameters.

### Improvement in quality of life and decrease in large-volume paracentesis requirements with the automated low-flow ascites pump [^113Q9tPo]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Several patients in the study were still receiving diuretics, which may have precipitated hyponatremia, as many of these episodes were chronologically related to the use of diuretics. Future studies should focus on fine-tuning the alfapump drainage rate to match the patient's rate of ascites accumulation, thereby avoiding concomitant diuretic use and potentially reducing electrolyte abnormalities and AKI. In contrast to the published randomized controlled trial or the postmarketing observation study, there were no AKI episodes within the first 7 days following implantation in this study. This difference in AKI occurrence cannot be readily explained on the basis of the severity of liver disease or renal dysfunction, as all three studies enrolled patients with similar Child-Pugh and MELD scores. Other parameters that are not readily comparable include the frequency of diuretic use and doses, as well as the alfapump rates and albumin use not associated with LVPs. All of these could affect the volume status of these patients and, hence, the risk for AKI development. The fact that two cases of AKI associated with the alfapump therapy resolved with a reduction of the drainage rate suggests that excessively high drainage rates should be avoided, especially in patients with borderline baseline renal dysfunction.

Once ascites was under control, there was a significant improvement in quality of life, which was obvious as early as 1 month and well maintained into 3 months. The improvement was attributed to a reduction in abdominal symptoms and an increase in activity score.

### Alfapump® system vs. large volume paracentesis for refractory ascites: A multicenter randomized controlled study [^113n9Xj3]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with refractory ascites (RA) require repeated large volume paracenteses (LVP), which involves frequent hospital visits and is associated with a poor quality of life. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of an automated, low-flow pump (alfapump® [AP]) compared with LVP as the standard of care (SoC).

A randomized controlled trial was conducted across seven centers, with a six-month patient observation period. The primary outcome was the time to the first LVP. Secondary outcomes included paracentesis requirement, safety, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and survival. Nutrition, hemodynamics, and renal injury biomarkers were assessed in a sub-study at three months.

Sixty patients were randomized, and 58 were analyzed (27 AP, 31 SoC, mean age 61.9 years, mean MELD 11.7). Eighteen patients were included in the sub-study. Compared with the SoC, the median time to the first LVP was not reached after six months in the AP group, indicating a significant reduction in LVP requirement for the AP patients (AP, median not reached; SoC, 15.0 days (HR 0.13; 95% CI 13.0–22.0; p < 0.001). AP patients also showed significantly improved Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) scores compared with SoC patients (p < 0.05 between treatment arms). Improvements in nutritional parameters were observed for hand-grip strength (p = 0.044) and body mass index (p < 0.001) in the sub-study. Compared with SoC, more AP patients reported adverse events (AEs; 96.3% vs. 77.4%, p = 0.057) and serious AEs (85.2% vs. 45.2%, p = 0.002). AEs consisted predominantly of acute kidney injury in the immediate post-operative period.

### Effect of paracentesis of ascitic fluids on urinary output and blood indices in patients with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^111T2Cgy]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the isolated effect of abdominal paracentesis of ascitic fluid in women with severe OHSS on urine production and blood indices, a retrospective interventional study was conducted at the gynecology department of the Lis Maternity Hospital, affiliated with Tel Aviv University. The study included thirty women with severe OHSS who underwent abdominal paracentesis according to clinical indications.

- **Main outcome measures**: Urinary output, blood urea nitrogen, and a complete blood count were measured before and following the procedure.

Results indicated an increase in urinary output from 1890 ± 128 mL per 24 hours on the day before paracentesis to 2660 ± 226 mL per 24 hours after the procedure. Blood urea nitrogen values decreased from 8.9 ± 0.56 mg/dL to 7.8 ± 0.53 mg/dL following paracentesis. Additionally, the white blood cell count decreased from 15.4 ± 1.1 (x 10^3 cells/mm^3) to 13.3 ± 0.9 (x 10^3 cells/mm^3) after the procedure. Hematocrit levels also showed a significant reduction from 35.2 ± 1.0% before paracentesis to 33.4 ± 0.8% afterward.

The study concludes that paracentesis of ascitic fluids in women with severe OHSS has an isolated effect in improving renal function, as evidenced by the increased urinary output and reduced blood urea nitrogen.

### Goal-directed fluid therapy does not improve early glomerular filtration rate in a porcine renal transplantation model [^113M5WJC]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Baseline data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and treatment effect is shown as mean ± 95% confidence interval (CI). All continuous data and data on glycocalyx were analyzed using a linear mixed regression effects model. This model allowed for repeated measures, considering the study design and analysis of parameters containing missing data. The model compared outcomes between intervention groups, with intervention group and time as fixed effects and donor as a random effect. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using the Scheffe method. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Inflammatory marker data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Scheffe post hoc test, while oxidative stress data were analyzed by paired t test. Data analysis was performed in Stata/IC 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

The power calculation was conducted with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as the primary endpoint. It was conducted for a 2-sided ANOVA for repeated measurements, with a power of 80%, using an α of 1.25% to reduce the risk of an overall type 1 error. The number of repeated measures was set at 12, with a correlation between measurements of 0.4. Based on prior experiments at our facilities, we expect a variance explained by GFR to be approximately 0.44, and the variance of the error to be approximately 1. This yields a sample size of 6 in each of the 4 groups.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and International Club of Ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^116Diyxu]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Strong evidence for an alternative explanation, such as septic shock requiring vasopressors, acute glomerular injury, obstruction, or nephrotoxin-induced AKI (where an improvement in renal function is expected after withdrawal of drugs) as the primary cause of AKI should be sought. Analysis of urinary sediment and damage markers may be useful to detect acute glomerular and/or severe tubular damage, although the thresholds for biomarkers remain to be determined. Given the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome and diabetes-related kidney disease, isolated proteinuria might be related to comorbidities in the patient, and pre-existing CKD and/or proteinuria does not rule out HRS-AKI.

We acknowledge that clinical uncertainty will persist in some cases, and while enrolment in clinical trials requires that many uncertain cases are excluded in the best interest of advancing science, clinical practice mandates that uncertainty is managed in the best interest of the patient. There will be cases where a provisional diagnosis of HRS-AKI is made on the best available evidence and is excluded later as more information becomes available. Since HRS-AKI can coexist with other causes of AKI, patients with co-existing structural damage may still respond to treatment with vasoconstrictors given the presence of altered haemodynamics. Thus, although a lack of HRS-AKI-targeted vasoconstrictor response should trigger re-evaluation for other causes of AKI, non-response does not exclude a coexisting diagnosis of HRS-AKI.

### Impact of race-independent equations on estimating glomerular filtration rate for the assessment of kidney dysfunction in liver disease [^116mbjfY]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is commonly associated with impaired kidney function. Renal dysfunction in the context of CLD is a predictor of mortality and a strong prognostic predictor of orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) outcomes. The influence of renal dysfunction is so well-defined that it is a component of the Model of End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) prognostic score. Furthermore, the degree of renal dysfunction in CLD has wide-reaching clinical decision implications, such as appropriate drug dosing, therapeutic interventions, and suitability for OLT. Most treatments for complications of liver disease, such as nephrotoxic antibiotics, diuretics, and paracentesis, have further negative effects on renal function with the potential to precipitate or aggravate renal failure. An accurate measure of renal function is, therefore, crucial in patients with CLD.

Tracer-measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) is considered the gold standard for determining GFR. However, it is not readily available in most centers. Hence, renal function is estimated using biomarker-based eGFR equations in clinical routine settings. Most eGFR equations are based on models containing either serum creatinine (Cr), cystatin C (Cys), or both. Leading examples are the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) eGFR equations, which employ creatinine, age (A), and sex (S), with or without race (R) [eGFRcr(ASR) or eGFRcr(AS)] or both creatinine and cystatin C [eGFRcr-cys(ASR) or eGFRcr-cys(AS)].

Unfortunately, serum creatinine is inaccurate in the diagnosis of…

### Diagnosis and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Revised consensus recommendations of the International Club of Ascites [^117CSr97]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Revised ICA diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury" is utilized in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury and hepatorenal syndrome in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. This scoring system is specifically designed for patients with liver cirrhosis who have developed ascites, characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, and are suspected of having hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure in individuals with severe liver disease.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in aiding the early and accurate diagnosis of HRS-AKI, which is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment and management strategies. The Revised ICA diagnostic criteria for HRS-AKI consider factors such as the absence of shock, no recent treatment with nephrotoxic drugs, and no signs of parenchymal kidney disease.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include patients without cirrhosis and ascites, those with shock, those who have been treated with nephrotoxic drugs, and those showing signs of parenchymal kidney disease.

The process evaluates potential cases of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury using six specific diagnostic criteria. Each criterion presents a requirement that must be addressed:

- **Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and ascites**: Patients must have confirmed liver cirrhosis and the presence of ascites.
- **Diagnosis of acute kidney injury**: Notable by an increase in serum creatinine levels from baseline measurements.

### Comparison of methods for estimating glomerular filtration rate in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^114KHLG7]. Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

In critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, estimates of kidney function are used to modify drug dosing, adjust nutritional therapy and provide dialytic support. However, estimating glomerular filtration rate is challenging due to fluctuations in kidney function, creatinine production and fluid balance. We hypothesized that commonly used glomerular filtration rate prediction equations overestimate kidney function in patients with acute kidney injury and that improved estimates could be obtained by methods incorporating changes in creatinine generation and fluid balance.

Methods

We analysed data from a multicentre observational study of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. We identified 12 non-dialysed, non-oliguric patients with consecutive increases in creatinine for at least 3 and up to 7 days who had measurements of urinary creatinine clearance. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, Jelliffe equation and Jelliffe equation with creatinine adjusted for fluid balance (Modified Jelliffe) and compared to measured urinary creatinine clearance.

Results

Glomerular filtration rate estimated by Jelliffe and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation correlated best with urinary creatinine clearances. Estimated glomerular filtration rate by Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Jelliffe overestimated urinary creatinine clearance was 80%, 33%, 10%, respectively, and Modified Jelliffe underestimated GFR by 2%.

### Estimated GFR associates with cardiovascular risk factors independently of measured GFR [^113V4FuP]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Estimation of the GFR (eGFR) using creatinine- or cystatin C-based equations is imperfect, especially when the true GFR is normal or near-normal. Modest reductions in eGFR from the normal range variably predict cardiovascular morbidity. If eGFR associates not only with measured GFR (mGFR) but also with cardiovascular risk factors, the effects of these non-GFR-related factors might bias the association between eGFR and outcome.

To investigate these potential non-GFR-related associations between eGFR and cardiovascular risk factors, we measured GFR by iohexol clearance in a sample from the general population (ages 50 to 62 years) without known cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or kidney disease. Even after adjustment for mGFR, eGFR associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors in multiple regression analyses. More risk factors influenced cystatin C-based eGFR than creatinine-based eGFR, adjusted for mGFR. Some of the risk factors exhibited nonlinear effects in generalized additive models (P < 0.05).

These results suggest that eGFR, calculated using standard creatinine- or cystatin C-based equations, partially depends on factors other than the true GFR. Thus, estimates of cardiovascular risk associated with small changes in eGFR must be interpreted with caution.

### Impact of race-independent equations on estimating glomerular filtration rate for the assessment of kidney dysfunction in liver disease [^113Q7ejQ]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

The performance of eGFR equations was evaluated in terms of correct CKD staging (G1 to G5) using mGFR as a reference. This evaluation was conducted across the whole population, in subgroups with preserved versus reduced liver function, and according to various liver and renal dysfunction parameters. These parameters included:

- **Severity of liver dysfunction**: This was based on the Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, with a threshold of MELD > 15 indicating liver dysfunction.
- **Presence or absence of ascites**
- **Renal dysfunction**: Defined as mGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²

Other relevant clinical parameters are listed in Table 1, which details the patients' characteristics according to liver function.

- **Abbreviations**: AS - age and sex, ASR - age, sex, and race, BMI - body mass index, BP - blood pressure, CKD - chronic kidney disease, CP class - Child–Pugh class, DBP - diastolic blood pressure, eGFR - estimated glomerular filtration rate, MELD - Model for End-stage Liver Disease, mGFR - measured glomerular filtration rate, SBP - systolic blood pressure, SD - standard deviation

Notes:

- Two out of 205 samples had no assigned Child–Pugh (CP) score and were therefore omitted from the calculations (see Fig. 1).
- Preserved liver function is defined as CP class A without ascites.
- Reduced liver function is defined as CP class A with ascites, CP class B, or CP class C.
- Statistical tests performed include the chi-square test of independence, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and Fisher's exact test.
- Benjamini & Hochberg correction was used for multiple testing.
- mGFR is measured in ml/min/1.73 m² of body surface area.

### Improvement in quality of life and decrease in large-volume paracentesis requirements with the automated low-flow ascites pump [^1149z4Zc]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Between April 2015 and January 2017, 36 patients were screened, and 30 were enrolled. Fifteen of these patients had diuretic-resistant ascites, while the remaining 15 had diuretic-intolerant ascites. The results provide statistical analyses for the first 12-month period after alfapump implantation and descriptive information for events that occurred during the 12–24 month period. Figure 1 shows patient disposition, and Table 1 presents patient demographics and baseline laboratory data. Patients were mostly middle-aged men, with a median paracentesis history of 11.9 months (range, 2.5–104.9 months). The baseline Child-Pugh score was 7.9 ± 0.9, and the MELD score was 11.4 ± 2.7.

The median observation time for all patients was 360.5 days (interquartile range, 152.0–380.0 days). Of the 18 patients who were withdrawn over the 24-month period, 10 were due to serious adverse events (SAEs); 3 underwent liver transplantation; 1 experienced resolution of ascites following eradication of hepatitis C virus infection; and 4 died due to causes unrelated to the pump. Of the patients withdrawn for SAEs, 1 in 10 subsequently died, resulting in a total of 5 deaths.

The 14 nonfatal withdrawals resulted in pump explants: 3 at liver transplantation; 1 because of ascites resolution; and 10 due to SAEs of pump failure or catheter-related complications (n = 3), infections (n = 4), or skin erosion at the pump pocket site (n = 3). All patients who had the pump explanted preferred that the pump remain in place.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and International Club of Ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^116VWc3h]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Fluid choice should be individualized and guided by the specific patient condition. Blood products are recommended in cases of gastrointestinal bleeding, crystalloids (preferentially balanced solutions such as lactated Ringer's or PlasmaLyte) in cases of volume depletion, and 20–25% albumin in those with SBP or HRS-AKI, with close attention to patient hemodynamics and volume status. Albumin is often used with the notion that it is more likely to maintain oncotic pressure than crystalloids. However, numerous RCTs in critically ill patients have failed to demonstrate any difference in 30-day or 90-day mortality or need for RRT between groups.

In patients with advanced cirrhosis, not only does serum albumin concentration decrease, but its structure and antioxidant functions are also altered, reducing its capacity to bind to bacterial products and reactive oxygen species, potentially exacerbating systemic inflammation. Experimental studies suggest that infusion of normal "exogenous" albumin has beneficial effects on controlling systemic inflammation and improving circulatory status, which could also contribute to the prevention or reversal of AKI. However, this effect has not been observed in clinical practice. Results from two RCTs comparing albumin to crystalloids in patients with cirrhosis and sepsis-induced hypotension have been conflicting. This may be explained by differences in the type of albumin solution (5% vs. 20%), type of crystalloid (0.9% saline vs. PlasmaLyte), and the short duration of the studies (7 vs. 28 days).

### Crizotinib effects on creatinine and non-creatinine-based measures of glomerular filtration rate [^115dCCdf]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Rapid reductions in creatinine-based estimates of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) have recently been reported secondary to crizotinib use. Whether these reflect drug-induced changes in the true GFR or the validity of creatinine as a measure of kidney function in the presence of crizotinib is unknown.

- **Methods**: Two anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer patients (one with pre-existing renal impairment) were identified during periods on and off crizotinib. Creatinine- and iothalamate-based estimates of renal function were conducted in the presence and absence of crizotinib.

- **Results**: Crizotinib is associated with both acute and chronic effects on kidney function. Chronic creatinine changes seem to reflect a true reduction in the GFR. In contrast, acute effects include a reduction in creatinine-based estimates of the GFR without a reduction in non-creatinine-based measurements (consistent with, e.g. an acute effect of crizotinib on creatinine secretion) and some reduction in the true GFR; this latter effect appears more prominent with pre-existing renal impairment.

- **Conclusion**: If crizotinib-associated changes in creatinine-based kidney function suggest a change in dosing with either crizotinib or concomitant medications that are renally excreted, the use of a non-creatinine-based assessment of kidney function, such as iothalamate assessments, should be considered before making a final decision.

### Reporting the eGFR and its implication for CKD diagnosis [^1164PVLh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The process of diagnosing chronic kidney disease using the estimated GFR involves several pitfalls. The estimated GFR laboratory report should be requested only by practitioners who are familiar with how to interpret the result. Until a more reliable method is available to estimate the GFR, the classification of chronic kidney disease should be revised by reducing the central role of the GFR cutoff levels.

### Home-based drainage of refractory ascites by a permanent-tunneled peritoneal catheter can safely replace large-volume paracentesis [^112uYk3T]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Refractory ascites has a poor prognosis. Large-volume paracentesis is the standard of care; however, it results in circulatory and renal dysfunction, often necessitating hospitalization. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement is not an option for many patients due to contraindications. The placement of a tunneled peritoneal drainage catheter has proven effective in patients with malignant ascites, but data for patients with nonmalignant refractory ascites are scarce.

We followed 24 consecutive patients in whom tunneled peritoneal drainage catheters were placed in the Endoscopy Unit at Hannover Medical School between June 2013 and December 2014.

- **Results**: Catheters were placed in 24 patients with refractory ascites in end-stage liver disease who had contraindications to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. Placement was technically successful in all patients. The dosage of diuretics was significantly reduced. The frequency of paracentesis decreased from 2.2 ± 1 to 0 per week, while the volume of daily ascites removal remained stable at 2 liters. Despite frequent drainage of ascites, kidney function, serum sodium, and serum albumin remained stable. Seven adverse events occurred in six (25%) patients. Five patients listed for liver transplantation underwent successful transplantation without any negative impact.

- **Conclusion**: The tunneled peritoneal drainage catheter placement is a viable and effective treatment alternative for patients.

### Assessing renal function in cirrhotic patients: Problems and pitfalls [^1149m3ny]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by common creatinine-based methods is potentially very inaccurate in patients with cirrhosis. Cirrhotic patients have several underlying conditions that contribute to falsely low serum creatinine concentrations, even in the presence of moderate to severe renal impairment, often causing creatinine-based methods to overestimate true GFR. Such underlying conditions include decreased creatinine production secondary to decreased hepatic creatine synthesis, increased tubular creatinine secretion, and decreased skeletal muscle mass. These factors contribute to serum creatinine concentrations that often do not accurately reflect renal function. Serum creatinine level, measured creatinine clearance, and calculated creatinine clearance may all significantly overestimate GFR; the degree of GFR overestimation was a median of 95% in published studies. Until more accurate methods of estimating GFR in cirrhotic patients are adequately validated, care should be exercised in the management of these patients because of the potential for severely impaired renal function, even in the face of normal serum creatinine concentrations.

### Impact of race-independent equations on estimating glomerular filtration rate for the assessment of kidney dysfunction in liver disease [^11382Shg]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

The alternative biomarker cystatin C, a non-glycosylated basic protein produced at a constant rate by all nucleated cells, has been introduced to estimate GFR. Unlike creatinine, cystatin C is less influenced by body mass, sex, age, or serum bilirubin, and is mainly influenced by GFR. Therefore, cystatin C is considered to be a superior GFR marker that can provide a more accurate prediction of GFR than creatinine. Studies have demonstrated the superiority of estimating GFR using cystatin C in CLD patients compared to creatinine, and particularly the eGFRcys(ASR) for patients with ascites or significant renal disease. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis in cirrhosis patients indicated that eGFR equations based on both creatinine and cystatin C were less biased than those based on creatinine alone, which overestimate GFR; and cystatin C alone, which tend to underestimate GFR.

Recently, an eGFR equation has been developed and validated based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement of serum myo-inositol, valine, and creatinine, in addition to the immunoturbidometric quantification of serum cystatin C, age, and sex (GFR NMR). NMR represents a multiplex analyzer capable of precisely quantifying multiple unlabeled metabolites in a simultaneous physical measurement step. In this sense, GFR NMR interprets biomarkers of glomerular filtration rate in combination with biomarkers reflecting CKD-associated metabolic comorbidities. Additionally, the quantification of serum creatinine in addition to serum valine and myo-inositol by NMR limits the complexity of working streams.

### Refining GFR estimation: A quest for the unobservable truth [^115D3Jas]. Kidney International (2024). Low credibility.

Assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is central to evaluating kidney health, remains challenging. Measured GFR is not widely available and lacks standardization. Estimated GFR can be highly inaccurate for some patients and has limited applicability to many patient populations, such as those who are acutely ill. Recent metabolomic advances show promise for identifying new filtration markers that might enhance GFR estimation. Improving GFR assessment will require refinement in both GFR measurement and estimation methods.

Accurate assessment of true kidney function allows for the early identification, management, and prognostication of persons at risk of kidney disease. Estimation of glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine-based equations is frequently used in clinical practice.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and International Club of Ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^113NBDUZ]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Compared to alternative treatments, administration of 20–25% albumin (6–8 g for every liter over 5 L of ascites removed) during large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is associated with a lower incidence of post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, a known trigger for acute kidney injury (AKI), specifically hepatorenal syndrome-AKI (HRS-AKI). In patients with refractory ascites, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been shown to be effective at controlling ascites and may thereby prevent the development of HRS-AKI. An implantable medical device, alfapump® (Sequana Medical NV, Ghent, Belgium), enables mobilization of ascitic fluid to the bladder for urinary excretion and has been shown to reduce the frequency of LVPs in patients with refractory ascites. However, it is not widely available and has been associated with AKI if the volume of ascites removed early after insertion is high; thus, regular administration of albumin may be required to prevent AKI.

- **Consensus statements**: We recommend using similar tools for the diagnostic work-up for AKI in patients with cirrhosis as used in those without cirrhosis (best practice statement). We suggest using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equation without the race variable, and preferably with cystatin C (CysC), for assessment of kidney function, though the performance at low GFR and in those with ascites may be suboptimal (weak recommendation, grade B). In addition to serum creatinine (SCr), we suggest complementary use of functional and damage-related markers to aid in timely detection.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and International Club of Ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^116gmDqe]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis are prone to developing acute kidney injury (AKI), a complication associated with markedly increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality, along with a risk of progression to chronic kidney disease. Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of developing any phenotype of AKI; however, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a specific form of AKI (HRS-AKI) in patients with advanced cirrhosis and ascites, carries an especially high mortality risk. Early recognition of HRS-AKI is crucial, as administration of splanchnic vasoconstrictors may reverse the AKI and serve as a bridge to liver transplantation, the only curative option.

In 2023, a joint meeting of the International Club of Ascites (ICA) and the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) was convened to develop new diagnostic criteria for HRS-AKI. The meeting aimed to provide graded recommendations for the work-up, management, and post-discharge follow-up of patients with cirrhosis and AKI, and to highlight priorities for further research.

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: This is a critical indicator.
- **Shock**: Immediate attention is required in such cases.
- **Fever or other signs of systemic inflammation**: These symptoms should prompt diagnostic paracentesis.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: The presence of these symptoms necessitates further investigation.
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: This is a significant concern in cirrhotic patients.
- **Worsening liver or renal function**: Deterioration in these functions is a key indicator for performing the procedure.

### Improvement in quality of life and decrease in large-volume paracentesis requirements with the automated low-flow ascites pump [^112j99iV]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

The appearance of ascites in cirrhosis heralds the onset of decompensation; it predisposes the patient to the development of bacterial peritonitis, hyponatremia, and acute kidney injury (AKI), and reduces survival. Abdominal fullness leads to early satiety, reduced caloric intake, and eventual malnutrition, whereas tense ascites predisposes the patient to the development of hernias with their specific complications. This results in patients with ascites having a poor quality of life (QoL).

The treatment of ascites refractory to diuretic therapy involves either repeated large-volume paracentesis (LVP) with albumin infusions, or the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in appropriate patients. The definitive treatment for difficult-to-control ascites with liver dysfunction is liver transplantation. However, patients with ascites and a low Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score have a low priority for liver transplantation. Thus, many patients are dependent on LVP as the only means of managing their ascites, which imposes a significant health care burden without improving their long-term QoL.

The automated low-flow ascites pump (alfapump; Sequana Medical NV, Ghent, Belgium) is a subcutaneous, implantable, and rechargeable device that automatically transfers ascitic fluid into the urinary bladder, which is then discharged as urine. The device effectively carries out continuous low-rate paracentesis for approximately 16 hours per day. With an expected battery life of 3 years or more, the alfapump can potentially keep patients relatively…

### A comparison of CKD-EPI estimated glomerular filtration rate and measured creatinine clearance in recently admitted critically ill patients with normal plasma creatinine concentrations [^114uRMy3]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of renal function is a priority in the management of critically ill patients. Clinicians regularly utilize such information to help guide drug dosing, optimize fluid, acid–base, and electrolyte management, tailor nutritional requirements, and assess the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Rising plasma creatinine (CR) concentrations often trigger clinical interventions, including dose reduction of renally eliminated agents. In contrast, plasma CR concentrations within the reported reference range appear to be less useful. Normal values in the critically ill have been associated with both augmented creatinine clearance (CL CR) and occult acute kidney injury (AKI).

Driven primarily by a desire to more effectively monitor and screen for chronic kidney disease (CKD), formulae using simple demographic variables have been developed to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The most commonly applied include the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and newer CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. Their application is based principally on large cohort studies that effectively stratify patients in terms of long-term clinical risk. This has led to recommendations for widespread laboratory reporting of eGFR.

While these initiatives represent key developments in improving the quality of care for patients with CKD, some clinicians have expressed concern about the ubiquitous application of eGFR, particularly in dose modification. Use of formulae to help guide drug dosing represents an attractive approach, although an…

### Effect of large weight reductions on measured and estimated kidney function [^117L3QNd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is important both to evaluate the progression of renal disease and to monitor the effect of intervention on kidney function, as well as to inform drug dosing and patient counseling. However, optimal methods of measuring kidney function in the setting of obesity or longitudinally in the setting of weight change are uncertain.

Plasma creatinine is frequently used to estimate GFR, as it has proven to be an inexpensive and reliable index of kidney function. The primary determinant of creatinine generation/production is skeletal muscle mass, where the final catabolite of muscular energetic metabolism is creatinine. Therefore, if body weight — and muscle mass in particular — changes over time and leads to changes in plasma creatinine, this may affect estimates of kidney function without actual changes in accurately measured GFR. Whether these factors impact estimated GFR (eGFR) could depend on the equations applied, as the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations include plasma creatinine and would not be affected by body weight changes alone. Cystatin C is a filtration marker that is less influenced by changes in muscle mass and may be a more suitable marker of renal function in subjects experiencing fast and large weight reductions.

In this prospective intervention study, we investigated the effect of a large weight loss (after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB)) on measured GFR (mGFR) using 51 Cr-EDTA plasma clearance and on estimated GFR.

### Treatment and management of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome: an update [^117Xp4gp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Ascites and renal dysfunction are frequent complications experienced by patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Ascites is the pathologic accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and is one of the cardinal signs of portal hypertension. The diagnostic evaluation of ascites involves assessment of its granulocyte count and protein concentration to exclude complications such as infection or malignancy and to allow risk stratification for the development of spontaneous peritonitis.

Although sodium restriction and diuretics remain the cornerstone of the management of ascites, many patients require additional therapy when they become refractory to this treatment. In this situation, the treatment of choice is repeated large-volume paracentesis. Alteration in splanchnic hemodynamics is one of the most important changes underlying the development of ascites. Further splanchnic dilation leads to changes in systemic hemodynamics, activating vasopressor agents and leading to decreased renal perfusion.

Small alterations in renal function influence the prognosis, which depends on the cause of renal failure. Prerenal failure is evident in about 70% of patients, whereas in about 30% of patients the cause is hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is associated with a worse prognosis. Therefore, effective therapy is of great clinical importance. Recent data indicate that the use of the new definition of acute kidney injury facilitates the identification and treatment of patients with renal insufficiency more rapidly than the use of the criteria for HRS.

### Validation of glomerular filtration rate measurement with blood sampling from the injection site [^111NRSVN]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2019). Low credibility.

Measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the plasma clearance of a radionuclide-labeled tracer is reliable and accurate. However, to avoid contamination of the blood samples with radioactivity remaining at the injection site, venepuncture at two or more sites is required: one for tracer administration and the others for blood sampling. This requirement is uncomfortable for patients, particularly when venous access is difficult. The objective of this study was to validate the use of a single site of venous access in combination with injection site imaging for GFR measurement.

- **Methods**: Twenty-two adults (≥ 18 years) who were referred for GFR determination were included prospectively. GFR was measured from the plasma clearance of 99m Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid according to international guidelines. After administration of the tracer through an intravenous cannula, a 60-second static image of the injection site was acquired. A second intravenous cannula was inserted into the contralateral arm. Venous blood samples were collected at 2, 3, and 4 hours after administration of the radiotracer from both the injection site (experimental) and the contralateral arm (conventional). GFR was calculated using slope-intercept and single-sample methods. The median conventional and experimental plasma counts (decay- and background-corrected) were compared for the 2-, 3-, and 4-hour venous samples. Conventional and experimental GFRs were then compared, with a more than 10% difference between conventional and experimental GFRs being regarded as significant.

- **Results**: Four individuals had vi[results cut off].

### Impact of race-independent equations on estimating glomerular filtration rate for the assessment of kidney dysfunction in liver disease [^1144HyzY]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

The overall performance of eGFR equations was evaluated by comparing the global performance of GFR NMR to four CKD-EPI equations on n = 205 collected samples. The median bias of GFR NMR differed significantly from all four CKD-EPI equations (p-values between 0.0024 and < 0.0001).

The median bias was lowest for GFR NMR and eGFRcr(ASR), with values of -1 (-3 to 1) and 1 (-1 to 3) ml/min/1.73 m², respectively. Furthermore, the race-free GFR NMR equation displayed a lower median bias than its race-free CKD-EPI counterparts, eGFRcr(AS) (4 ml/min/1.73 m², p < 0.0001) and eGFRcr-cys(AS) (-4 ml/min/1.73 m², p = 0.0024).

- **Key performance indicators (KPIs) overall (n = 205) and by liver function**:
	- Preserved liver function: n = 143
	- Reduced liver function: n = 60

	- Precision was defined as the interquartile range (IQR) of the difference to mGFR (ml/min/1.73 m²). Bias was determined as the median difference to mGFR (ml/min/1.73 m²). P10 and P30 accuracy were defined as the percentage of samples within an error tolerance to mGFR of 10% (P10) or 30% (P30), respectively. Numbers in brackets show the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (n = 1000). Bold values represent the best KPI value for each subgroup across the five equations. The symbol * signifies statistical significance (p-values < 0.05) in pairwise tests against GFR NMR for each KPI.
