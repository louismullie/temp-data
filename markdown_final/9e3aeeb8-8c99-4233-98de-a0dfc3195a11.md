## Question

Hep A AB IGM

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting Hepatitis A IgM (Hep A AB IGM) results and how to act on them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the test measures and its diagnostic role. Then, I should verify the kinetics of IgM appearance and decline. Next, I will examine the clinical context and pretest probability. After that, I need to check for false positives and low-level reactivity. Then, I should review confirmatory strategies, including HAV RNA and avidity testing. I will also consider special populations and post-vaccination scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and summarize key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm what the test measures and its diagnostic role. Anti-HAV IgM is the serologic marker of acute hepatitis A virus infection; its presence in a patient with compatible symptoms and epidemiology confirms acute HAV, whereas total anti-HAV reflects cumulative immunity from past infection or vaccination and cannot distinguish acute from remote infection by itself [^114URhTh] [^114vtRyC] [^115nEEUF].

> I need to verify the kinetics next. IgM anti-HAV typically becomes detectable within 5–10 days after symptom onset, peaks around 1 month, and generally declines to undetectable within 6 months, although rare persistence beyond 6 months has been reported, which can complicate interpretation if clinical context is lacking [^114URhTh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; pretest probability is critical. I should confirm that testing is reserved for patients with clinical features of acute hepatitis or plausible fecal–oral exposure risk, because in low-prevalence settings or in patients without compatible illness, the positive predictive value of IgM falls and false positives become more likely [^114URhTh] [^112EPaYt] [^113HNQCv].

> Next, I should review false positives and low-level reactivity. Low-level or equivocal IgM results are frequently false positives and often reflect nonspecific polyclonal immune activation; in one study, all confirmed acute cases had IgM values above a defined cutoff, whereas low-level reactivity was associated with alternative diagnoses when clinical data were available, so I need to ensure I interpret low-level results with caution and correlate clinically [^112kMVB7] [^1125NRG7] [^116aSgs1].

> Wait, let me verify confirmatory strategies when results are discordant or the clinical picture is atypical. HAV RNA by NAAT on serum or stool can confirm active infection and is particularly useful when IgM is positive but the phenotype is atypical or when IgM is negative early in disease; avidity testing for anti-HAV IgG can help distinguish low-avidity antibodies of acute infection from high-avidity antibodies of remote infection or immune reactivation, which is helpful in ambiguous serologies or older adults [^113HNQCv] [^1136idNU] [^112sQUCT].

> I should double-check special populations and post-vaccination scenarios. Vaccination can induce transient IgM detectable in 8–20% of adults 2–3 weeks after a dose; therefore, I need to avoid testing for IgM in recently vaccinated, asymptomatic persons to prevent false positives, and in people with HIV or other immunocompromised states, I should consider that serologic responses may be blunted and that total antibody responses to vaccination should be checked to ensure immunity [^1121W6A4] [^112UbjWS] [^112ULWpB].

> Let me consider the window period and repeat testing. Early after symptom onset, IgM may be negative; repeating IgM in 1–2 weeks increases diagnostic yield, and in patients with high clinical suspicion but negative initial serology, correlating with ALT/AST, bilirubin, and epidemiologic risk improves accuracy and reduces missed acute cases [^115hEJCB] [^114URhTh].

> I will now examine how to integrate clinical and laboratory data. Confirmed acute HAV typically presents with jaundice or marked aminotransferase elevations alongside a positive IgM; in contrast, isolated enzyme elevations without jaundice or compatible symptoms should prompt reconsideration of alternative etiologies and restraint in ordering IgM unless exposure risk is strong, to avoid false positives and unnecessary public health actions [^112kMVB7] [^112EPaYt] [^114URhTh].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has severe liver disease? In pregnancy with acute hepatitis, HAV IgM testing is appropriate, and if maternal infection occurs within 2 weeks of delivery, neonatal HAV immunoglobulin is recommended; in patients with chronic liver disease or high risk for severe HAV, post-exposure prophylaxis with vaccine and/or immunoglobulin should be considered promptly after exposure [^117R3Mdu] [^112fmf5D] [^113AcJHW].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. If the patient has compatible symptoms and epidemiologic risk, a positive IgM confirms acute HAV; if symptoms are present but IgM is negative early, repeat IgM and consider HAV RNA; if the patient is asymptomatic or has low pretest probability, a positive IgM — especially low-level — should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed with HAV RNA or avidity testing before labeling as acute infection; if recent vaccination occurred within 2–3 weeks, avoid IgM testing altogether to prevent false positives [^114URhTh] [^113HNQCv] [^1121W6A4].

> Key takeaway: I need to ensure that IgM anti-HAV is ordered only when clinically and epidemiologically indicated, interpret low-level or isolated positives with great caution, and use HAV RNA or IgG avidity when results are discordant or the stakes are high; this approach maximizes diagnostic accuracy and minimizes false positives that can trigger unnecessary interventions [^114URhTh] [^112kMVB7] [^113HNQCv].

The Hepatitis A IgM antibody (Hep A AB IgM) test detects **acute HAV infection** [^115nEEUF] by identifying IgM antibodies that appear within 5–10 days of symptom onset [^114URhTh], peak at 1 month, and typically disappear within 6 months. A positive IgM result indicates **current or recent infection** [^113HNQCv], whereas a negative result with positive total anti-HAV indicates past infection or vaccination [^114URhTh]. False positives can occur [^113HNQCv], especially in low-prevalence settings or with nonspecific binding [^113HNQCv] [^112HAbqm]; confirm with clinical context, ALT/AST, and HAV RNA if needed [^113HNQCv] [^1136idNU]. Testing is recommended for patients with **acute hepatitis symptoms** or epidemiologic risk [^112EPaYt], and not for routine screening or in asymptomatic patients [^114URhTh].

---

## Clinical significance of Hep A Ab IgM

- **Acute infection marker**: IgM anti-HAV appears 5–10 days after symptom onset, peaks at ~1 month, and usually disappears within 6 months [^114URhTh].

- **Diagnosis of acute HAV**: A positive IgM result confirms acute or recent HAV infection [^113HNQCv].

- **Differentiation from past infection**: IgM is absent in past infection or vaccination; total anti-HAV (IgG ± IgM) indicates immunity but does not distinguish acute from past infection [^114URhTh].

---

## Laboratory methods for detecting Hep A Ab IgM

- **Enzyme immunoassay (EIA)**: Most common, high sensitivity/specificity for acute HAV [^notfound].

- **Chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA)**: Automated, rapid, and widely used [^notfound].

- **Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)**: Useful in resource-limited settings but may have lower sensitivity/specificity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical indications for hep a ab IgM testing

- **Acute hepatitis symptoms**: Jaundice, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, elevated ALT/AST [^112fC6io].

- **Epidemiologic risk**: Travel to endemic areas, exposure to contaminated food/water, or outbreaks [^114vtRyC].

- **Exclusion of acute HAV**: In patients with abnormal liver tests or suspected drug-induced liver injury [^114iFmfH].

---

## Interpretation of hep a ab igm test results

| **Test result** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| Positive IgM | Acute or recent HAV infection | Confirm clinically; report to public health; provide supportive care [^114URhTh] |
| Negative IgM | No acute infection | Consider other causes of hepatitis; if suspicion remains, repeat IgM or test HAV RNA [^113HNQCv] |
| Positive total anti-HAV, negative IgM | Past infection or vaccination | Immune; no acute infection [^114URhTh] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **False positives**: Occur due to nonspecific binding, cross-reactivity, or low prevalence settings [^112HAbqm] [^113HNQCv].

- **False negatives**: Early testing before IgM appears or very late testing after IgM declines [^115hEJCB] [^114URhTh].

- **Persistence of IgM**: Rarely persists beyond 6 months, complicating interpretation [^114URhTh].

---

## Clinical management of acute hepatitis A

- **Supportive care**: Rest, hydration, and symptom control; no specific antiviral therapy [^117R3Mdu].

- **Public health measures**: Report to health authorities; trace contacts; provide post-exposure prophylaxis [^112fC6io].

- **Prevention**: Vaccination and hygiene measures to prevent transmission [^114URhTh].

---

## Public health implications

Surveillance relies on **mandatory reporting** of confirmed cases to track outbreaks and guide control measures [^112fC6io]. Prevention centers on vaccination, safe water, sanitation, and hygiene to reduce transmission [^114URhTh]. Outbreak control involves rapid case identification, contact tracing, and targeted vaccination or immunoglobulin administration [^112BZrsf].

---

## Recent advances and developments

Molecular epidemiology uses **HAV RNA detection and genotyping** to confirm infection and trace outbreaks [^113MN2fV] [^112xVzuR]. Improved assays have enhanced sensitivity and specificity, reducing false results [^notfound]. Point-of-care tests enable rapid, field-based diagnosis in outbreak settings [^111kKCJQ].

---

The Hep A AB IgM test is the **cornerstone for diagnosing acute HAV infection** [^115nEEUF]; positive results indicate current or recent infection, whereas negative results with positive total anti-HAV indicate past infection or vaccination [^114URhTh]. False positives can occur, so results must be interpreted in clinical context, with confirmatory HAV RNA testing when needed [^113HNQCv].

### Positive test results for acute hepatitis A virus infection among persons with no recent history of acute hepatitis – United States, 2002–2004 [^116aSgs1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis A is a nationally reportable condition, and the surveillance case definition includes both clinical criteria and serologic confirmation. State health departments and CDC have investigated persons with positive serologic tests for acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection (i.e. IgM anti-HAV) whose illness was not consistent with the clinical criteria of the hepatitis A case definition. Test results indicating acute HAV infection among persons who do not have clinical or epidemiologic features consistent with hepatitis A are a concern for state and local health departments because of the need to assess whether contacts need postexposure immunoprophylaxis. This report summarizes results of three such investigations, which suggested that most of the positive tests did not represent recent acute HAV infections. To improve the predictive value of a positive IgM anti-HAV test, clinicians should limit laboratory testing for acute HAV infection to persons with clinical findings typical of hepatitis A or to persons who have been exposed to settings where HAV transmission is suspected.

### Multiple factors contribute to positive results for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M antibody [^1125NRG7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

In the United States, a successful vaccination program for hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has decreased both its incidence and the true positive rate for diagnostic immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to HAV in acute hepatitis.

Objective

To survey positive results of HAV IgM tests and determine the effect of changing ordering options.

Design

We reviewed all positive results for IgM antibody to HAV between January 2007 and December 2010. Patient demographics, clinical history, and laboratory data were recorded and the encounter, order, and reason for test reviewed. Each result was categorized as indicating acute, recent, resolved, or indeterminate HAV infection.

Results

A total of 10,735 tests were performed; 35 patients had 49 positive results. Most positive test results were associated with outpatient visits and were ordered in the assessment of patients with liver disease, but not clinical acute hepatitis. In the final analysis, 4 patients had acute hepatitis A and 20 individual patients had recent and/or resolved hepatitis. All but 1 of the remaining 11 patients had another established cause of liver disease with a positive IgM HAV antibody test result; data to determine causality were insufficient. The total number of tests requested annually decreased more than 35% with the introduction of computerized physician order entry.

Conclusions

Current assays for IgM HAV antibodies are overused in the absence of clinical acute hepatitis; future clinical decision support may improve patterns of order entry. Most patients have findings consistent with HAV exposure but not acute hepatitis; dormant viral infection may be a continuing source of antigen.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers and Diagnosis of HAV Infection

Hepatitis A cannot be differentiated from other types of viral hepatitis on the basis of clinical or epidemiologic features alone. Diagnosis of HAV infection requires the detection of either immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HAV in serum or HAV RNA in serum or stool. IgM anti-HAV, a marker of acute illness, becomes detectable within 5–10 days of the onset of symptoms in the majority of persons, usually peaks within 1 month of illness, and decreases to undetectable levels within 6 months after infection (,–) (Figure 2). However, positive tests for IgM anti-HAV in persons > 1 year after infection have been reported, as have likely false-positive tests in persons without evidence of recent HAV infection. Therefore, to reduce false-positive tests, persons should only be tested for IgM anti-HAV if they are symptomatic and suspected of having HAV infection. Total anti-HAV or immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-HAV testing is used in epidemiologic studies to measure the prevalence of previous infection or clinically to determine whether a person with an indication for preexposure prophylaxis is already immune. IgG anti-HAV is produced either in response to natural infection or after vaccination with HepA vaccine, appearing early in the course of infection, remaining detectable for the person's lifetime, and providing lifelong protection against the disease. The antibody test for total anti-HAV measures both IgG anti-HAV and IgM anti-HAV. Although assays for the detection of IgG anti-HAV are available, in the absence of an IgG anti-HAV test, a total anti-HAV–positive sample from a symptomatic person should be subsequently tested for IgM anti-HAV to establish the acute stage of HAV infection. Persons who test positive from a total anti-HAV test and negative from an IgM anti-HAV test are considered immune, either from past infection or vaccination.

### Window period of anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M antibodies in diagnosing acute hepatitis a… [^115hEJCB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is made on the basis of the presence of anti-HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in patients with clinical features of acute hepatitis. Some patients show a negative serology at initial presentation, which may complicate the diagnosis of hepatitis A (HA). The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of HA patients with an initially negative anti-HAV IgM test result.

Materials and Methods

Patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis who underwent IgM anti-HAV testing at a single center were enrolled consecutively, with tests repeated in patients with negative initial serology.

Results

A total of 684 patients with acute hepatitis were tested, of whom 620 patients were initially or eventually diagnosed with HA. Anti-HAV IgM was initially negative in 67 of the 620 HA patients (10.9%), but was later confirmed by subsequent retests. These patients had on average a shorter time lapse from the onset of symptoms to the initial test, a higher rate of fever, and lower alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels compared with those with a positive initial serology. Cutoff index (COI) values of anti-HAV IgM were correlated positively with the duration of time from the onset of symptoms to the initial test. Fever, lower bilirubin levels, and higher COI values were predictive of seroconversion to anti-HAV positivity in patients with a negative initial serology.

Conclusion

Taking into account the window period of HAV infection, anti-HAV IgM tests should be repeated, particularly in patients with features of the initial phase of hepatitis and a high COI value of anti-HAV IgM.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

* - = negative test result; + = positive test result.

† To ensure that an HBsAg-positive test result is not false positive, samples with repeatedly reactive HBsAg results should be tested with a neutralizing confirmatory test cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

Viral Hepatitis

Hepatitis A Virus Infection

HAV infection has an incubation period of approximately 28 days (range: 15–50 days). HAV replicates in the liver and is shed in high concentrations in feces from 2–3 weeks before to 1 week after the onset of clinical illness. HAV infection produces a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection or chronic liver disease. However, approximately 10% of patients experience a relapse of symptoms during the 6 months after acute illness. Acute liver failure from hepatitis A is rare (overall case-fatality rate: 0.5%). The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with approximately 70% of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infection. Antibody produced in response to HAV infection persists for life and confers protection against reinfection.

HAV infection is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route, by either person-to-person contact or through consumption of contaminated food or water. Transmission of HAV during sexual activity probably results from fecal-oral contact. Although viremia occurs early during infection and can persist for weeks after symptom onset, bloodborne transmission of HAV is uncommon. Transmission by saliva has not been demonstrated.

In the United States, of the hepatitis A cases accompanied by risk information, a particular risk was identified among only 23.8%. Among cases with a risk factor identified, a recognized foodborne or waterborne outbreak was the most commonly identified risk (49.6%). Other infection sources identified in the United States include MSM; persons who use injecting drugs; sexual and household contacts; those experiencing homelessness; international travelers; those with children attending a nursery, childcare, or preschool; and persons working in such settings.

Diagnostic Considerations

Diagnosis of HAV infection cannot be made on a clinical basis alone but requires serologic testing. Presence of IgM antibody to HAV is diagnostic of acute HAV infection. A positive test for total anti-HAV indicates immunity to HAV infection but does not differentiate current from previous HAV infection. Although usually not sensitive enough to detect the low level of protective antibody after vaccination, anti-HAV tests also might be positive after hepatitis A vaccination.

### Improving the accuracy of clinical interpretation of serological testing for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A infection [^112kMVB7]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatitis A (HA) remains a common infection globally that results in a self-limiting hepatitis with gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. Direct detection of the virus in blood or stool is often not possible once symptomatic. Serological testing is frequently performed to investigate abnormal liver function tests - and interpretation of equivocal and low-level positive anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM is difficult even in the context of accurate epidemiological and clinical information.

Objectives

The aim of this project was to characterise the association between low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results and clinical disease.

Study Design

Anti-HAV serology results recorded over 22 months were analysed. Equivocal and positive Architect anti-HAV IgM results were matched with available clinical and demographical data to identify confirmed and probable cases of acute HAV infection.

Results

Reactive anti-HAV IgM results were recorded for 88/7661 (1.15%) samples. Using clinical and laboratory data, 35 patients were confirmed to have acute HAV infection. Acute HA was associated with a mean Architect anti-HAV IgM value of 9.4 (SD 6.8–12.0). Cases of HA had a mean peak ALT value of 1920 (SD 682–3158). All confirmed cases (35/35) of acute HAV were associated with at least one clinical indicator, with 28/31 cases (90%) having a documented jaundice. All 35 (100%) cases of acute HAV infection had anti-HAV IgM > 4.0. A diagnosis other than acute HA was identified in 7/11 (63.6%) of low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results (clinical data unavailable for further 4/11, 36.3%). Where clinical information was available, acute HA was excluded in all 31 patients with equivocal or low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results.

Conclusions

The accuracy of reports sent out to the clinician showed room for improvement. An interpretive algorithm is proposed including a clinically significant cut-off value for anti-HAV IgM.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113HNQCv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV/HEV) laboratory diagnosis notes that diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is confirmed by detecting HAV IgM antibody, which may persist for up to 6 months after exposure. However, false-positive HAV IgM antibody results can occur in populations with low prevalence (eg, < 5%) of acute hepatitis A, and NAAT for HAV RNA may be necessary to confirm diagnosis. The presence of HAV IgG antibody indicates either past or resolved hepatitis A infection or immunity to this viral infection from vaccination, and the same hepatitis A status can be deduced by the presence of HAV total antibodies in an asymptomatic patient with normal liver tests and/or absence of HAV IgM antibody. Specimen handling in Table 58 includes EDTA tube, RT, ≤ 2 h; PPT tube, RT, ≤ 6 h; Clot or SST tube, RT, ≤ 2 h; and for HEV RNA, quantitative (viral load), SST tube, RT, ≤ 2 h.

Detection of Anti-HAV after Vaccination

Correlate of protection. The correlate of protection is defined as an immune response (i.e. IgG anti-HAV titer) that is responsible for and statistically interrelated with protection. Anti-HAV levels are measured in comparison with a World Health Organization reference IG reagent and are expressed as milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). Seroconversion (response to vaccination) is defined as achieving a detectable and quantifiable postvaccination IgG anti-HAV level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL by standard assays. Seroprotection is considered a surrogate of clinical protection and persists when IgG anti-HAV levels remain higher than the correlate of protection.

The absolute lower limit of anti-HAV needed to prevent HAV infection has not been determined, although the limit is likely quite low because IG provides about 90% efficacy in preventing hepatitis A, and very low levels of anti-HAV are detected in IG recipients. The concentrations of anti-HAV achieved after passive transfer by IG or active induction by vaccination are tenfold to 100-fold lower than those produced in response to natural infection. Clinical studies have yielded limited data from which a minimum protective antibody level can be derived because vaccine-induced levels of antibody are usually high and few infections have been detected among vaccinated persons (i.e. vaccine failure). Antibody levels of 10–33 mIU/mL using different assays have been proposed as the threshold for protection from HAV infection in humans, although one study proposed that any detectable level of IgG anti-HAV might suggest protection. Because no absolute protective level has been defined, the lower limit of detection of the particular assay being used has generally typically been considered the protective level; postvaccination studies use ≥ 10 mIU/mL as the minimum protective level.

IgM anti-HAV after vaccination. HepA vaccination can induce detectable IgM anti-HAV, particularly if the test is conducted within a few weeks after vaccination. IgM anti-HAV has been detected 2–3 weeks after administration of 1 dose of vaccine in 8%–20% of adults (CDC, unpublished data, 1995). To reduce false-positive tests, persons should only be tested for IgM anti-HAV if they are symptomatic and suspected of having HAV infection.

### Epidemiology of hepatitis A virus infections, Germany, 2007–2008 [^112HAbqm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The results of our study also provide information on specificity of surveillance data. Especially among older hospitalized patients, frequently without jaundice, IgM-positive serum samples were mostly negative for HAV RNA, which suggests false-positive serologic results. HAV IgM–positive samples that showed negative results by reverse transcription–PCR probably showed false-positive HAV IgM results for patients with persisting HAV IgM, cross-reactions in the test (e.g. in acute-phase infections with Epstein-Barr virus), or nonspecific polyclonal activation of memory cells. As a bias favoring stability, this overestimate of numbers of cases has limited consequences for surveillance purposes. However, for the individual patient, specificity of IgM in serum samples should be strongly considered.

The main conclusion of this study is that existing vaccination recommendations for travelers to areas endemic for hepatitis should be emphasized. Furthermore, immunization of travelers should be made more accessible to risk groups through information campaigns and removal of financial barriers (insurance payments for pretravel advice and vaccinations are not universal). If removal of these barriers to vaccination of all travelers is deemed unlikely, the general vaccination of children against HAV should be considered, given the high number of imported infections among children and the evidence of secondary autochthonous transmission.

Efforts to communicate recommendations to previously unaware population groups, especially, but not exclusively, persons with migration backgrounds, have the capacity to strongly reduce the number of HAV infections in Germany. However, as long as vaccination recommendations are applied only to travelers and overall immunity in the population remains low or decreases further, risk for secondary transmission of imported infections remains high.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^112EPaYt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — viral hepatitis testing in abnormal liver chemistries specifies assays and high‑risk groups. Testing for chronic hepatitis C is with anti‑HCV and confirmation by HCV‑RNA nucleic acid testing; acute hepatitis C testing is with anti‑HCV and HCV RNA. Risk factors for hepatitis C include those born between 1945 and 1965. For hepatitis B, chronic infection is evaluated with HBsAg, and acute infection with HBsAg and IgM anti‑HBc; high‑risk groups include persons from areas with HBsAg prevalence > 2%. Testing for acute Hepatitis A (IgM HAV) should occur in patients with acute hepatitis and possible fecal–oral exposure. All items are labeled Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### RNA testing for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A during the 2017 outbreak in France [^1136idNU]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is based on the detection of anti-HAV IgM without testing for the pathogen itself. We evaluated the usefulness of HAV RNA testing for confirmation of acute hepatitis A and to provide indications about the level of HAV replication in HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects during an unprecedented outbreak of HAV observed in France in 2017. HAV RNA was detected in 38 out of 41 (92.6%) subjects with a clinical diagnosis of acute hepatitis A, whereas nine cases tested positive for anti-HAV IgM in whom the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A was not retained were found negative for HAV RNA. All subjects in the control group were also tested negative for HAV RNA. HAV viremia was correlated to ALT peak (r = .64; P < .0001). HIV-infected patients have similar HAV RNA levels but were less likely to have prolonged international normalized ratio of prothrombin time when compared to the HIV-uninfected group (P = .016), suggesting a less severe course of acute hepatitis. HAV RNA was detected in the serum of most of the patients with acute hepatitis A, indicating that the direct detection of HAV can be used to confirm hepatitis A in patients tested positive for anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Nucleic acid tests should serve more broadly during the diagnosis workup of acute hepatitis A to improve the predictive values of HAV in vitro diagnostic tests and to confirm acute hepatitis A in patients tested positive with IgM with moderate or low S/CO values.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Accuracy assessment of total or IgG immunoglobulin to hepatitis A virus tests around immunity threshold [^116tpYDs]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody titers at 20 IU/L are assumed to correlate with protection against HAV challenge.

Methods

We examined the accuracy and precision of currently in use immunoassays for total or anti-HAV IgG determination, by repeated testing of dilutions of the international anti-HAV standard, within a 10–50 IU/mL concentration range.

Results and Conclusion

Eight immunoassays were evaluated. All could confidently identify people who need to be vaccinated, or who might benefit from a booster vaccine: no positive interpretation for the 10 and 15 IU/mL concentrations. However, qualitative interpretation may differ from test to test in the 15–30 IU/mL range. This variation has to be taken into account when comparing seroprevalence data.

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis A virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunization (post-vaccination testing), CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain testing for anti-HAV antibody after vaccination if subsequent clinical management depends on the immune status or revaccination might be indicated (such as patients with HIV infection and other immunocompromising conditions).

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig). As such, clinical assessment and evaluation may be warranted".

Acute hepatitis B virus infection with recovery

In certain persons, anti-HBc is the only serologic marker detected. Isolated anti-HBc-positivity can be detected following HBV infection in persons who have recovered but whose anti-HBs levels have waned; in populations with a high prevalence of HBV infection, isolated anti-HBc likely indicates previous infection with loss of anti-HBs. Some chronically infected persons with isolated anti-HBc-positivity have circulating HBsAg that is not detectable by a laboratory assay. HBV DNA has been detected in < 10% of persons with isolated anti-HBc, although the presence of detectable HBV DNA might fluctuate. These persons are unlikely to transmit infection except under circumstances in which they are the source of a large exposure, such as a blood transfusion. Persons who are HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive can experience reactivation of infection during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, with reappearance of HBsAg. Infection with a mutant HBV strain can result in positive laboratory tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA, with a negative IgM anti-HBc.

Perinatal HBV infection in a child aged ≤ 24 months is typically asymptomatic although fulminant hepatitis can occur; a positive HBsAg test, positive HBeAg test, or detectable HBV DNA may be considered laboratory evidence of perinatal HBV in an infant born to an HBV-infected mother if timing criteria are met. Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and who do not become infected might have detectable anti-HBc for up to 24 months after birth from passively acquired maternal antibody.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1139d42c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Understanding the presence of false-positive antibodies in acute hepatitis [^116R7K5U]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Although false-positive antibodies (FPAs) have been well described in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), this has not been evaluated in acute viral hepatitis. Patients with acute viral hepatitis underwent antibody testing for other causes of liver disease and sexually transmitted diseases. Those with antibody positivity underwent confirmatory testing and monitoring. Patients with FPAs were compared with patients with acute hepatitis C infection without FPAs. In total 7 of 24 patients (29%) had FPAs. FPAs during acute viral hepatitis are associated with higher IgM levels and higher ESR in acute HCV. This has both mechanistic and clinical implications and should be evaluated further.

### Unexpected long-lasting anti-HEV IgM positivity: is HEV antigen a better serological marker for hepatitis E infection diagnosis? [^116BRRez]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the leading cause of acute hepatitis worldwide. The minimum criterion for diagnosis of acute infection is detection of anti-HEV antibodies, although there are scant data on IgM duration. Our aim was to assess the persistence of HEV markers after acute self-limited hepatitis E. HEV serological tests (IgM by Mikrogen and Wantai and HEV-Ag) and HEV RNA were carried out in two cohorts: (a) patients with prior acute hepatitis E (ALT > 10 x ULN plus positive IgM ± HEV RNA) currently self-limited and (b) 50 blood donors with positive HEV RNA. Among 25 cases of prior acute hepatitis E, after a median follow-up of 34 months, all presented undetectable HEV RNA. However, anti-HEV IgM remained detectable in 14 (56%) by Mikrogen, 6 (24%) by Wantai and none for HEV-Ag. Anti-HEV IgM tested positive in 80%-100% within the second year and 17%-42% over 3 years later, by Wantai and Mikrogen, respectively. Among HEV RNA-positive donors, 12 (25%) tested positive for either IgM by Mikrogen or Wantai, 9 (18%) for both and 18 (36%) for HEV-Ag. HEV-Ag positivity was more likely as HEV RNA was higher (14% if < 2.2 log IU/mL; 64% if RNA ≥ 3.7). Overall, HEV-Ag performed best, with a positive predictive value of 100% and diagnostic accuracy of 57%. Anti-HEV IgM exhibited unexpectedly long persistence after a self-limited acute hepatitis E. HEV-Ag had the best performance and could be especially useful in settings where HEV RNA is not available.

### Diagnostic relevance of immunoglobulin G avidity for hepatitis A virus [^112sQUCT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is based on the detection of HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM). However, IgM could be detected due to nonspecific polyclonal activation of the immune system. An avidity test for anti-HAV IgG was developed to distinguish acute infection, where low-avidity antibodies are detected, from immune reactivation. The assay was tested on 104 samples, including 11 sera from patients with past infection, 15 sera from patients with acute infection and 4 collected after recovery, 10 sera from vaccinated subjects, 4 sera from patients with suspected immune reactivation, and 60 unselected HAV-IgM positive sera, collected over 1 year in a routine laboratory. The avidity index (AI) was expressed as percentage. The results were provided as the mean ± one standard deviation. Patients with a history of prior infection had AIs of > 70% (mean, 86% ± 10), whereas the mean AI was 36% ± 16 during acute HAV infection (P < 0.001). Within the first month after the onset of hepatitis, avidity was either noncalculable due to a very low IgG titer or < 50%. In patients with immune reactivation, avidity was > 70% (88% ± 10%), a finding consistent with a prior infection. Among the 60 unselected sera, 35 (58%) had a noncalculable or < 50% avidity, and most of them had a detectable HAV RNA, confirming HAV infection. In contrast, 16 (27%) had an avidity of > 70%, and none was reverse transcription-PCR positive, suggesting immune reactivation. These 16 patients were significantly older than the others (50 ± 16 years versus 26 ± 14 years). The new anti-HAV IgG avidity assay we developed could improve HAV infection diagnosis, particularly in elderly patients.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1146p3dU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

### Coexistence of IgM antihepatitis A virus and IgM antihepatitis E virus in acute viral hepatitis: a prospective, multicentre study in Korea [^111LeU3L]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

This study investigated the clinical, serological and molecular characteristics of coexistence of both immunoglobulin M (IgM) antihepatitis A virus (HAV) and IgM antihepatitis E virus (HEV) in acute viral hepatitis using a prospective, multicentre design. Among a total of 771 symptomatic cases with acute viral hepatitis enrolled in a Korean city from September 2006 to August 2008, coexistence of IgM anti-HAV and IgM anti-HEV was found in 43 patients (A+E group; 6%), while the existence of IgM anti-HAV alone was found in 595 patients (A group; 77%) and that of IgM anti-HEV alone in 14 patients (E group; 2%). Clinical data analysis and measurement of IgM and IgG anti-HEV were performed using two different commercial kits, and HAV RNA and HEV RNA were detected in available serum or stool samples. The clinical features of the A+E group were similar to those of the A group. HAV RNA detection rates in the A+E and A group were similar, while HEV RNA was detected only in the stool samples of the E group, not in the A+E group. Comparative testing of anti-HEV using two different ELISA kits showed markedly discordant results for IgM anti-HEV positivity and consistently low positivity for IgG anti-HEV in the A+E group. Coexistence of IgM anti-HEV measured by the Genelabs ELISA kit in the setting of hepatitis A appears to yield false-positive results in nonendemic areas of HEV infection. Diagnosis of hepatitis E using IgM anti-HEV should be made with caution.

Isolated anti‑HBc interpretation — Some persons may test positive for anti‑HBc but not HBsAg or anti‑HBs, and isolated anti‑HBc can reflect different states: it may indicate chronic HBV infection with undetectable HBsAg but detectable HBV DNA (more so in the liver than in serum), it may be a marker of immunity after recovery with an anamnestic response after one dose of HBV vaccine, it may be a false‑positive particularly in low‑prevalence persons with no risk factors, or it may be the only marker during the window phase of acute hepatitis B where anti‑HBc IgM should be positive.

WHO recommends considering the introduction of hepatitis A vaccination for individuals aged 12 months or older based on the following criteria: transition from high to intermediate endemic level; an increasing trend of acute hepatitis, including severe disease among older children, adolescents or adults; and evidence of cost-effectiveness. Our survey findings indicate that most Indian states have intermediate endemicity of infection. We identified six studies in which patients with acute liver failure were tested for anti-HAV IgM and other hepatotropic viruses. The studies reported that HAV infection accounted for 21.4%–65.9% of acute liver failure cases. All the studies highlighted that HAV as one of the commonest causes of acute liver failure in both children and adults.,(Appendix p 19) However, these studies were limited to a few major cities, and there is a lack of data on the burden of symptomatic and severe disease across diverse geographic regions in India. There is a need for research to address this gap by generating evidence on the burden of symptomatic and severe HAV disease at the national level through existing surveillance systems and hospital-based data sources.

### Diagnosis of hepatitis E [^111iKE12]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis E, caused by infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV), is a common cause of enterically-transmitted acute hepatitis in developing countries. Occasional cases of sporadic hepatitis E have been increasingly recognized in developed countries over the past decade. These cases differ from those in developing countries in being possibly caused by zoonotic transmission, often affecting people with a suppressed immune system and occasionally leading to persistent HEV infection. The commonly used tests for HEV infection include detection of IgM and IgG anti-HEV antibodies and detection of HEV RNA. IgM anti-HEV antibodies can be detected during the first few months after HEV infection, whereas IgG anti-HEV antibodies represent either recent or remote exposure. The presence of HEV RNA indicates current infection, whether acute or chronic. Although several diagnostic assays for anti-HEV antibodies are available, they have undergone fairly limited testing and often provide discordant results, particularly for IgG antibodies. Thus, although the available antibody assays might be useful for case diagnosis in areas with high disease endemicity, their use for case diagnosis in areas with low endemicity and for seroprevalence studies remains problematic. Improved validation of existing anti-HEV antibody assays or development of new assays with superior performance characteristics is urgently needed.

Cost-effectiveness is the third criterion for introducing HAV vaccine into the immunization program. A systematic review of 43 economic evaluation studies on the HAV vaccination, including 15 from middle-income countries, found that universal childhood vaccination without screening was cost-effective. However, the review noted a lack of studies from India. A recent study conducted in Kerala evaluated the cost-effectiveness of various HAV vaccination strategies compared to the no vaccination scenario. The findings indicated that vaccination was cost-saving for both one-year-old children and 15-year-old individuals, regardless of whether serological screening was used prior to vaccination. There is a need for national-level economic evaluation studies in India to inform and guide the vaccination policy.

Our study has a few limitations. First, we did not include children under six years of age. However, seroprevalence among children aged 6–30 years was sufficient to classify HAV endemicity in line with WHO guidelines. Second, the sample sizes for estimating state-level prevalence — our secondary objective — may not have been sufficient, particularly for smaller states and in age groups with lower prevalence, such as children aged 6–10 and 11–15 years, to precisely estimate age-specific seroprevalence. Third, although the age and gender distribution of our sample was comparable to the 2011 census data, the proportion of participants from rural areas was higher (76.0%) than reported in the census (68.8%) (Appendix p 21). Fourth, we did not test samples for IgM antibodies, which could have provided insights into recent or ongoing HAV transmission. Future studies could include testing for both IgG and IgM antibodies to have a more comprehensive understanding of HAV epidemiology, particularly in the 6 to 10-year age group. Lastly, we could not explore factors associated with seropositivity in our analysis due to limited metadata.

In conclusion, our study findings indicate an intermediate level of endemicity for HAV infection in India. Our findings also suggest an intermediate level of endemicity in most Indian states, with high endemicity in Uttar Pradesh and low endemicity in Kerala. While this supports consideration of hepatitis-A vaccination, further data on disease burden and cost-effectiveness are needed to guide evidence-based policy decisions.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers

Serologic markers for HBV infection include HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and immunoglobulin class G (IgG) anti-HBc (IgG anti-HBc). At least one serologic marker is present during the different phases of infection. HBV DNA is a measure of viral load and reflects viral replication (Table 1). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be detected in persons with acute or chronic HBV infection; the presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) correlates with the loss of replicating virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity can occur.

Individuals exhibiting hepatitis-like symptoms (fatigue or loss of appetite) lasting for three or more consecutive days underwent ALT testing. Suspected hepatitis cases were defined as those with ALT levels at least 2.5 times the ULN, indicating acute hepatitis. Preliminary hepatitis typing tests, including assays for HBsAg, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis A virus IgM antibody, hepatitis C virus IgG antibody and anti-HEV IgM, was performed on the first serum sample from each suspected case. A second serum sample was required to be collected 2–6 weeks later and also tested for anti-HEV IgM. Any positive result for anti-HEV IgM in either of the two samples prompted regular follow-up sampling until ALT levels normalized or symptoms resolved. All serial serum samples were sent to a central laboratory for hepatitis E diagnosis. A positive diagnosis for hepatitis E was made if at least two acute HEV markers were present (i.e. HEV RNA, IgM anti-HEV, and a fourfold or greater increase in IgG anti-HEV).

Introduction

Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is primarily transmitted through faecal-oral route, mainly due to faecal contamination of food or drinking water. HAV infections are common in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with poor sanitary conditions. The virus can cause both sporadic infections and large-scale outbreaks. In LMICs, most children (90%) are infected with HAV by 10 years of age, through asymptomatic or mild infections. Hence, unexposed adolescents and adults could be at higher risk for symptomatic disease.

In 2021, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that there were 160 million (95% CI: 152–170) HAV infections globally, leading to 26,901 deaths (95% CI: 18,387–42,454) and 1.8 million (95% CI: 1.3–2.8) disability-adjusted life years. India accounted for 19% of the global HAV infections, with an estimated 30.6 million cases (95%CI: 27.7–33.4) and 13,658 deaths (range: 8508–24,358), contributing to nearly half of the global HAV mortality.

Several hospital-based studies across India have reported a high burden of symptomatic acute HAV infections confirmed by the presence of anti-HAV IgM antibodies among children and adolescents. Between 2014 and 2017, the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Network (VRDL) tested 24,000 specimens from suspected viral hepatitis cases and found that 3017 (12.6%) were HAV reactive, with 74.6% of these cases occurring among individuals aged below 19 years. Seven studies from tertiary care hospitals across India tested patients with acute viral hepatitis for IgM antibodies against HAV. Four studies included all age groups, two focused only on adults, and one included only children. The overall HAV IgM seropositivity ranged between 7.7% and 70.0%. These studies reported high seropositivity among children, adolescents and adults less than 30 years of age.,(Appendix p 3) A review of published HAV outbreaks from India also revealed a high attack rate among children and adolescents, except in Kerala, where the attack rates were higher among adults (Appendix p 4–5). These findings suggest a shift in the epidemiology of HAV infection in India, with increasing symptomatic infections in adolescents and adults.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112fLM8J]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

Hepatitis B — serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic "window" from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient's response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

Abbreviations: ALT = alanine aminotransferase; HAV = hepatitis A virus; IgG = immunoglobulin G; IgM = immunoglobulin M.

Biochemical evidence of hepatitis includes elevated levels of serum bilirubin and serum hepatic enzymes, including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Elevations in AST and ALT levels usually occur 5–10 days before symptom onset. Serum bilirubin and aminotransferase levels usually return to normal by 2–3 months after illness onset.

Molecular epidemiologic technologies, when applied in combination with conventional epidemiologic methods, have been useful in investigating outbreaks and determining transmission links. The detection and sequencing of HAV RNA from water, food, and blood or stool of infected persons provide important information for tracing and characterizing HAV strains and identifying the source of water and foodborne hepatitis A outbreaks. HAV RNA can be detected using NAAT technologies in the blood and stool of the majority of persons during the acute phase of infection using NAAT technologies. HAV RNA in liver biopsies, cell cultures, or environmental samples can also be detected using various NAAT-based research methodologies. Growth of HAV in cell culture requires a long adaptation period and is associated with acquisition of various adaptive mutations in the viral genome. However, detection of serologic markers is sufficient for routine surveillance.

### Serology versus nucleic acid amplification to diagnose acute hepatitis E, United kingdom, 2014–18 [^1172JxxS]. The Journal of Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Diagnosing hepatitis E infection usually involves specific IgM testing, but sensitivity/specificity concerns mean many guidelines and practices include confirmatory tests. We studied whether additional information confirmatory tests provide justifies their use.

Methods

We examined 9131 records of anti-hepatitis E IgM assays, 7615 of IgG assays, and 1726 of RT-PCR assays from our regional laboratory, spanning October 2014-October 2018. We paired 495 IgM assay results with a RT-PCR result. We examined whether IgM results predicted PCR results, reviewed discrepant pairs, and investigated the correlation between IgG and PCR results in patients with strongly reactive IgM assays.

Results

Anti-hepatitis E IgM titres are bimodal. A high cut-off value optimises prediction of RNA detectability. 7/404 low-IgM samples had detectable RNA, 6 from immunosuppressed patients. 26/91 high-IgM samples did not have detectable RNA. In high-IgM samples, RNA detectability was not associated with IgG titre (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.14).

Conclusions

In immunocompetent patients, tests beyond IgM seldom add clinically useful information. In patients with immunocompromise, IgM and RNA could contribute information. Additional tests' extra costs/intervention delays cannot be justified. IgM assay cut-offs should reflect titres' bimodal distribution, with values standardised using international units.

### Use of molecular epidemiology to inform response to a hepatitis A outbreak-los angeles county, California, October 2018-April 2019 [^112xVzuR]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The findings in the report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the CA Cls A strain is a commonly identified cause of many national hepatitis A outbreaks, indicating that it might be an endemic strain. Therefore, it is possible that the outbreak-associated cases linked to the senior living campus represent a chain of transmission distinct from the cases among persons experiencing homelessness or using drugs. Second, HAV strain results must be interpreted in the context of the epidemiologic information. The interpretation of genotyping results from this investigation might have been limited by patients' not disclosing certain risk factors or exposures. Finally, the sensitivity of molecular testing for confirming hepatitis A can be reduced by improper specimen handling or if specimens are obtained after a substantial time has elapsed since symptom onset. Thus, it is possible that some anti-HAV IgM-positive cases were misclassified as false-positive case reports.

This outbreak response illustrates the value of using rapid HAV molecular testing to characterize an outbreak and guide the public health response to contain the outbreak. HAV genotyping can be helpful in identifying and interrupting the chain of transmission early in an outbreak when there are few cases. HAV genotyping in other contexts might provide additional insights into its optimal use for outbreak prevention and control.

### False-positive serologies for acute hepatitis A and autoimmune hepatitis in a patient with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection [^1131JoXd]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute hepatitis remains a diagnostic challenge, and numerous infectious, metabolic and autoimmune diseases need to be effectively excluded. We present a case of a young woman with malaise, fever, jaundice and deranged liver function tests. Testing for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) virus capsid antigen IgM/IgG was positive. Total IgG was elevated, along with positive serology for anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV)-IgM, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and soluble liver antigen (SLA) leading to the differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis A and autoimmune hepatitis. No specific treatment was started and liver function gradually improved. At week 4, HAV IgG and IgM were negative. At month 4, ANA and SLA were negative and total IgG normalised; EBV nuclear antigen became positive. Testing for EBV is an investigation required at baseline in acute hepatitis and physicians should carefully evaluate serological results, including those for viral and autoimmune hepatitis that may be falsely positive in infectious mononucleosis.

### High prevalence of autoantibodies in hepatitis A infection: the impact on laboratory profiles [^116nu4T3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

In the absence of IgM antibodies against hepatitis A virus (HAV), HAV infections can be regarded as autoimmune hepatitis when they show positive autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and lack other viral markers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, titres and impact of autoantibodies in Korean patients with HAV infection.

Methods

The study involved a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of 73 patients with HAV at Konkuk University Hospital from August 2005 to September 2008. The presence and pattern of anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody and anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibody were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence on Hep-2 cells and mouse/kidney sections.

Results

Of the 73 patients with hepatitis A, 65 (89.0%) showed positive indirect immunofluorescence tests. Of note, most of the positive tests (95.5%) showed a cytoplasmic pattern with filamentous staining of cytoplasmic fibres. There was no significant difference between groups in age or sex. In patients positive for autoantibodies, alanine aminotransferase and leucocyte count were significantly higher, while the increase in globulin was not statistically significant. In terms of titres, globulin was significantly higher in patients with ≥ 1:160 titres than in those with ≤ 1:80 titres (mean (SD) 3.4 (0.5) versus 2.8 (0.4) g/dl, respectively; p = 0.000).

Conclusions

The study demonstrated a high prevalence of anticytoplasmic autoantibodies in patients with acute hepatitis A. These data would be useful to aid interpretation of indirect immunofluorescence testing in patients with acute hepatitis, especially in areas with a high prevalence of HAV.

### Active surveillance for acute viral hepatitis in rural villages in the nile delta [^116H9jMZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute viral hepatitis is less frequent in Egypt than serum antibody levels suggest. Because acute viral hepatitis has a wide clinical spectrum, we tested the hypothesis that many cases are undetected because of mild illness caused by initial, early-childhood exposure to hepatitis viruses.

Methods

During active case detection among 20,000 inhabitants of rural villages in Egypt, we screened 1715 symptomatic patients for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Viral hepatitis markers were tested in 47 subjects who had ALT levels that were least twice the normal level.

Results

Of the 47 individuals tested, 4 children aged 3–5 years had immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV IgM). One also had a possible false-positive result to a test for IgM antibodies to hepatitis E virus. None had serological evidence of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, 33 of the remaining 43 had active HCV infection, having both antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and HCV RNA. Four others anti-HCV without HCV RNA, and 2 others had seroconversion to anti-HCV during follow-up. Two patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen had chronic HBV infection. Only 3 with elevated ALT levels had no evidence of acute or chronic infections with known hepatitis viruses. Immunoglobulin G antibodies to hepatitis E virus was detected in 40 patients.

Conclusion

Active surveillance covering approximately 50,000 person-years detected only 4 cases of acute HAV infection. Almost all persons with mild symptoms and elevated ALT levels had serological evidence of chronic viral hepatitis, most often associated with HCV. Many of these cases were probably "flare-ups" of HCV infection or incidental illness in patients with chronic HCV infection, but some could have been caused by difficult-to-confirm initial HCV infections. Although serological evidence for exposures was highly prevalent, hepatitis viruses seldom caused acute viral hepatitis in these communities.

3.3 Testing and case confirmation

Testing guidelines for HEV have been published by EASL, the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology and British Transplantation Society. ECDC's expert group agreed with the recommendations that all patients with symptoms consistent with viral hepatitis and specific groups at risk for chronic HEV should be tested for HEV. Such specific groups include immunosuppressed patients with unexplained abnormal LFTs, patients with suspected drug-induced liver injury, neuralgic amyotrophy, Guillain-Barré syndrome and encephalitis/myelitis as well as patients with unexplained acute neurological symptoms and a raised ALT. Testing should generally follow national recommendations, which will take national risk assessments into account.

A broad and unspecific range of symptoms has been described for HEV infection, not only including signs of viral hepatitis, but also neurological and other extra-hepatic manifestations. Therefore, only laboratory criteria were considered relevant for case confirmation. The source of information, e.g. whether a case was reported by a physician or laboratory or derives from blood donor screening, should be reported as this may help to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Fifteen EU/EEA Member States have either case definitions or clinical criteria for the confirmation of an acute case. A national case definition for acute cases is available for 12 countries with laboratory confirmation required in all of them. Ireland and the UK (England and Wales) also have a case definition for chronic cases.

For surveillance purposes, the ECDC expert group suggested anti-HEV IgM and IgG positivity as minimum criteria to confirm an acute case. However, for reasons of cost, not all laboratories perform subsequent IgG testing in IgM-positive patients with symptoms indicative of viral hepatitis. Detection of HEV RNA by PCR, even in the absence of serological testing, can be considered sufficient to confirm an acute case, but the expert group assumed that PCR testing might not be available in all laboratories and countries. IgM positivity indicates a recent infection and specimens with a low level of IgM are often PCR negative. In a minority of cases, IgM may persist for 6–12 months, while virus RNA is only detectable by PCR for 1–2 months. In 2017, anti-HEV IgM testing was undertaken in 22 countries and anti-HEV IgG testing in 21 countries. Of these, 19 countries also performed PCR testing.

Supplemental Testing for HCV Antibody

If testing is desired to distinguish between true positivity and biologic false positivity for HCV antibody, then, testing may be done with a second HCV antibody assay approved by FDA for diagnosis of HCV infection that is different from the assay used for initial antibody testing. HCV antibody assays vary according to their antigens, test platforms, and performance characteristics, so biologic false positivity is unlikely to be exhibited by more than one test when multiple tests are used on a single specimen.

### Diagnostic performance of five assays for anti-hepatitis E virus IgG and IgM in a large cohort study [^112duGDH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Determination of anti-hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) antibodies is still enigmatic. There is no gold standard, and results obtained with different assays often diverge. Herein, five assays were compared for detection of anti-HEV IgM and IgG. Serum samples from 500 Swedish blood donors and 316 patients, of whom 136 had suspected HEV infection, were analyzed. Concordant results for IgM and IgG with all assays were obtained only for 71% and 70% of patients with suspected hepatitis E, respectively. The range of sensitivity for anti-HEV detection was broad (42% to 96%); this was reflected in the detection limit, which varied up to 19-fold for IgM and 17-fold for IgG between assays. HEV RNA was analyzed in all patients and in those blood donors reactive for anti-HEV in any assay, and it was found in 26 individuals. Among all of the assays, both anti-HEV IgG and IgM were detected in 10 of those individuals. Twelve had only IgG and, in 7 of those 12, IgG was only detected with the two most sensitive assays. Three of the HEV-RNA-positive samples were negative for anti-HEV IgM and IgG in all assays. With the two most sensitive assays, anti-HEV IgG was identified in 16% of the blood donor samples and in 66% of patients with suspected HEV infection. Because several HEV-RNA-positive samples had only anti-HEV IgG without anti-HEV IgM or lacked anti-HEV antibodies, analysis for HEV RNA may be warranted as a complement in the laboratory diagnosis of ongoing HEV infection.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113qm2ZT]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10^4 IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log10 IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

Serologic markers for HBV — HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-HBc immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) — are interpreted as follows: Self-limited infections are usually eliminated in 1 to 2 months, whereas chronic infections are persistently positive beyond 6 months with no detectable anti-HBs in individuals who have never been vaccinated; anti-HBc IgM appears 1 to 2 weeks after HBsAg; anti-HBc IgG persists for life and passively transferred maternal anti-HBc IgG is detectable in infants up to 24 months after birth; anti-HBs develops during convalescence in self-limited infections, indicates immunity from HBV infection, and after post–recovery from natural infection both anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG are present, whereas after postvaccination without prior infection detectable anti-HBs but no anti-HBc or HBsAg are present, and inadvertent vaccination after recovery from HBV infection yields detectable anti-HBs and anti-HBc upon postvaccination testing.

Competing causes of liver injury — recommended testing and key mimickers: Testing for acute viral hepatitis is recommended for all patients with suspected DILI including hepatitis A IgM, HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody IgM, and HCV RNA; in the DILIN cohort, 1.3% of adjudicated cases tested positive for HCV RNA. Another mimic is acute HEV; anti-HEV IgM seroprevalence was 3% in adjudicated cases and testing for acute HEV infection should be considered in selected instances, including cases without a clear suspect agent or in cases with very high aminotransferase values arising in older adults. All patients with suspected DILI should also undergo screening for sporadic autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with autoantibodies and serum Ig levels. Patients with recent hypotension, sepsis, or heart failure are at risk for ischemic liver injury with a characteristic laboratory course. In younger patients, Wilson disease can be considered using recommended testing. In cholestatic cases, testing for antimitochondrial antibody is recommended to assess for primary biliary cholangitis. In patients with a predominance of AST greater than ALT, alcohol-associated hepatitis should be considered, especially if aminotransferase elevations come close (e.g. AST generally < 300 U/L) and associated with high gamma-glutamyltransferase levels.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1112Bw2z]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

### Hepatitis A immunisation in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis a… [^1158P7ka]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In many parts of the world, hepatitis A infection represents a significant cause of morbidity and socio-economic loss. Whilst hepatitis A vaccines have the potential to prevent disease, the degree of protection afforded against clinical outcomes and within different populations remains uncertain. There are two types of hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine, inactivated and live attenuated. It is important to determine the efficacy and safety for both vaccine types.

Objectives

To determine the clinical protective efficacy, sero-protective efficacy, and safety and harms of hepatitis A vaccination in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis A.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to November 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing HAV vaccine with placebo, no intervention, or appropriate control vaccines in participants of all ages.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were undertaken by two authors and verified by a third author. Where required, authors contacted investigators to obtain missing data. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinically apparent hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis). The secondary outcomes were lack of sero-protective anti-HAV immunoglobulin G (IgG), and number and types of adverse events. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Dichotomous outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using intention-to-treat analysis. We conducted assessment of risk of bias to evaluate the risk of systematic errors (bias) and trial sequential analyses to estimate the risk of random errors (the play of chance).

Main Results

We included a total of 11 clinical studies, of which only three were considered to have low risk of bias; two were quasi-randomised studies in which we only addressed harms. Nine randomised trials with 732,380 participants addressed the primary outcome of clinically confirmed hepatitis A. Of these, four trials assessed the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (41,690 participants) and five trials assessed the live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine (690,690 participants). In the three randomised trials with low risk of bias (all assessing inactivated vaccine), clinically apparent hepatitis A occurred in 9/20,684 (0.04%) versus 92/20,746 (0.44%) participants in the HAV vaccine and control groups respectively (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30). In all nine randomised trials, clinically apparent hepatitis A occurred in 31/375,726 (0.01%) versus 505/356,654 (0.18%) participants in the HAV vaccine and control groups respectively (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.17). These results were supported by trial sequential analyses. Subgroup analyses confirmed the clinical effectiveness of both inactivated hepatitis A vaccines (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30) and live attenuated hepatitis A vaccines (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17) on clinically confirmed hepatitis A. Inactivated hepatitis A vaccines had a significant effect on reducing the lack of sero-protection (less than 20 mIU/L) (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.03). No trial reported on a sero-protective threshold less than 10 mIU/L. The risk of both non-serious local and systemic adverse events was comparable to placebo for the inactivated HAV vaccines. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions on adverse events for the live attenuated HAV vaccine.

Authors' Conclusions

Hepatitis A vaccines are effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A in susceptible individuals. This review demonstrated significant protection for at least two years with the inactivated HAV vaccine and at least five years with the live attenuated HAV vaccine. There was evidence to support the safety of the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine. More high quality evidence is required to determine the safety of live attenuated vaccines.

### Simultaneous detection of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM antibodies against hepatitis E virus (HEV) is highly specific for diagnosis of acute HEV infection [^113oPj4w]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Serum samples collected from 68 patients (age, mean ± the standard deviation [SD], 56.3 ± 12.8 years) at admission who were subsequently molecularly diagnosed as having hepatitis E and from 2,781 individuals who were assumed not to have been recently infected with hepatitis E virus (HEV; negative controls; 52.9 ± 18.9 years), were tested for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgA classes of antibodies to HEV (anti-HEV) by in-house solid-phase enzyme immunoassay with recombinant open reading frame 2 protein expressed in the pupae of silkworm as the antigen probe. The 68 patients with hepatitis E had both anti-HEV IgM and anti-HEV IgA. Among the 2,781 controls, 16 (0.6%) had anti-HEV IgM alone and 4 (0.1%) had anti-HEV IgA alone: these IgA/IgM anti-HEV-positive individuals were not only negative for HEV RNA but lack IgG anti-HEV antibody as well (at least in most of the cases). Periodic serum samples obtained from 15 patients with hepatitis E were tested for HEV RNA, anti-HEV IgM, and anti-HEV IgA. Although HEV RNA was detectable in the serum until 7 to 40 (21.4 ± 9.7) days after disease onset, both IgM and IgA anti-HEV antibodies were detectable until 37, 55, or 62 days after disease onset in three patients and up through the end of the observation period (50 to 144 days) in 12 patients. These results indicate that detection of anti-HEV IgA alone or along with anti-HEV IgM is useful for serological diagnosis of hepatitis E with increased specificity and longer duration of positivity than that by RNA detection.

### Positive Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus IgM assays in primary HIV infection [^1149wXTr]. Journal of Medical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

We report three cases with misleading cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) results during primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We determined the rate of positive anti-CMV IgM assays or anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in sera from a group of well-characterized subjects with primary HIV infection as 2.9% (1/35; 95%CI: 0.15–16.6%) for each infection. The rate of positive anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in subjects with positive hepatitis A virus IgM assays was 30% (6/20; 95%CI: 14.6–51.9%). Clinicians need to consider the limitations of IgM assays for diagnosis of herpesvirus infections, and consider testing for other infections with overlapping clinical manifestations.

Anti-HEV IgM testing may be considered in selected patients with heightened clinical suspicion, noting that performance of available commercial tests is not clear (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend testing for acute cytomegalovirus, acute Epstein–Barr virus, or acute herpes simplex virus infection if classical viral hepatitis has been excluded or if atypical lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy suggest such causes (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend evaluation for Wilson disease and Budd–Chiari syndrome when clinically appropriate (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

### Hepatitis A exposure response and outbreak prevention in a large urban jail-los angeles county, California, may-July 2023 [^112BZrsf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Public Health Practice

The infection control response initially included a plan to offer hepatitis A vaccine and Ig to persons who were immunocompromised, aged > 60 years, or both; however, Ig could not be obtained within the indicated time frame because of logistic issues. Future infection control planning at CHS involves maintaining a supply of hepatitis A Ig for emergency use in case of an exposure or outbreak. A major limitation of the CHS hepatitis A surveillance process was that reactive IgM anti-HAV laboratory results from LAGMC did not appear in CHS communicable disease laboratory reports because of the different electronic health record identifiers used by the two facilities. A modified communicable disease surveillance report that retrieves reactive IgM anti-HAV results from LAGMC conducted on CHS patients that contains CHS-specific identifiers was created after the response to help prevent delays in identifying cases and planning for exposure response and mitigation. This exposure response highlights the importance of initiating a rapid response to hepatitis A exposure in a jail setting to minimize risk for transmission and help prevent an outbreak. Having relevant laboratory results for reportable communicable diseases consistently and seamlessly communicated electronically across different health systems with mutual patients and using serology and vaccination records from electronic health records and state immunization registries can facilitate and optimize the response to a potential exposure by ensuring the timely administration of postexposure prophylaxis to those who are at greatest risk.

### Serological cross reactivity to CMV and EBV causes problems in the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E virus infection [^116Fd6JL]. Journal of Medical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is an important public health concern as a major cause of enterically-transmitted hepatitis worldwide. The detectable window of viraemia is narrow, and HEV IgM and IgG rise simultaneously in acute infection. Furthermore, previous investigators have shown HEV IgM false positive reactions occur against EBV, CMV and potentially hepatitis A. A retrospective analysis of HEV serology testing was performed at a London tertiary referral hospital over a 3-year period. A thousand four hundred and twenty three serum samples were tested for HEV serology, with 33 samples HEV IgM positive and 28 HEV IgM equivocal. One hundred and eleven samples were HEV IgG positive but IgM negative suggesting past infection. No patients with HEV IgM positivity had false positive reactions against hepatitis A. A high degree of EBV and CMV cross reactivity was noted, with 33.3% and 24.2% of HEV IgM positive samples also testing positive for EBV and CMV IgM, respectively. HEV RNA was detected in four HEV IgM positive samples, indicating true positivity, although three demonstrated cross reactivity against EBV. Only 13.3% of samples with positive HEV IgM were HEV PCR positive, highlighting a low positive predictive value of serology testing. Overall a high level of HEV, EBV and CMV IgM cross reactivity was demonstrated, indicating that serology is unreliable in the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis. It is concluded that that the diagnosis of viral hepatitis should be based on clinical features, raised transaminases, serology, and confirmatory PCR testing.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^116xEw1T]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Competing causes of liver injury

Testing for acute viral hepatitis is recommended for all patients with suspected DILI including hepatitis A IgM, HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody IgM, and HCV RNA to exclude acute hepatitis C infection (Figure 1). In fact, 1.3% of adjudicated cases in the initial analysis of the DILIN cohort tested positive for HCV RNA. Another mimicker of DILI is acute HEV infection, which is increasingly reported in developed nations because of exposure to HEV genotype 3 infections. Of note, anti‐HEV IgM seroprevalence was 3% in adjudicated cases in the DILIN database. Although there are concerns regarding reliability of the commercially available serologic tests, testing for acute HEV infection should be considered in selected instances, including cases without a clear suspect agent or in cases with very high aminotransferase values arising in older adults. All patients with suspected DILI should also undergo screening for sporadic autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), with testing for autoantibodies (e.g. antinuclear and anti–smooth muscle antibodies) and serum Ig levels, although there are some drugs that can manifest an AIH‐like picture.–

Patients with recent hypotension, sepsis, or heart failure are at risk for ischemic liver injury, usually characterized by rapid and a marked increase in serum aminotransferase values followed by rapid decline with normal or near‐normal bilirubin levels. In younger patients, Wilson disease can be considered using recommended testing. In cholestatic cases, testing for antimitochondrial antibody is recommended to assess for primary biliary cholangitis. In patients with a predominance of AST greater than ALT, alcohol‐associated hepatitis should be considered, especially if aminotransferase elevations are modest (e.g. AST generally < 300 U/L) and associated with high gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase and erythrocyte macrocytosis. Furthermore, testing for serum creatinine phosphokinase levels in this setting is recommended. All patients with suspected DILI should undergo some type of liver imaging, typically starting with an abdominal ultrasound to assess for presence of cirrhosis, biliary obstruction, or other focal liver changes. Additional imaging, such as CT or MR cholangiography, may be used to assess for vascular abnormalities or pancreaticobiliary disease.

### The prevalence of HEV among non-A-C hepatitis in Qatar and efficiency of serological markers for the diagnosis of hepatitis E [^117XGE71]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, our data suggest that HEV-IgM positivity represents the main biological marker of HEV acute infection in the clinical setting of developed countries as it showed the best overall performance and best concordance with RT-PCR with a kappa value of 0.71, which denotes substantial agreement. Although Wantai HEV-Ag is the only commercial assay that is currently present in the market for the diagnosis of acute HEV-Ag, the employment of this assay with such a low sensitivity (36.36%) could erroneously fail to confirm HEV-IgM results and could cause drastic underestimation of acute HEV infection cases.

### Evaluation of a new rapid immunochromatographic assay for serodiagnosis of acute hepatitis E infection [^114G7ymx]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2005). Low credibility.

A rapid and reliable diagnostic assay for acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is needed. We evaluated a rapid, immunochromatographic assay for IgM antibodies to HEV (ASSURE HEV IgM Rapid Test) using acute-phase HEV samples (n = 200) from Indonesia and Nepal and convalescent-phase HEV samples (n = 70) from Nepal. Blood donors in Thailand (n = 100), individuals with hepatitis A (n = 80), hepatitis B (n = 45), and hepatitis C (n = 50) in Thailand and Nepal, acute-phase sera of individuals with Epstein-Barr virus infection (n = 20), and rheumatoid factor-positive blood (n = 26) served as negative controls. The assay had a sensitivity of 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.5–96.1%) and a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI = 98.3–100%). The positive and negative predictive values were 99.5% (95% CI = 97.1–100%) and 95.8% (95% CI = 93.1–97.7%), respectively. These results suggest that this assay is a sensitive and specific tool for the rapid diagnosis of acute HEV infection.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing of perinatally exposed children and siblings — recommendations state that all children born to women with acute or chronic hepatitis C should be tested for HCV infection, with antibody-based testing recommended at or after 18 months of age (I, A). Testing with an HCV-RNA assay can be considered in the first year of life, but the optimal timing of such testing is unknown (IIa, C), and testing with an HCV-RNA assay can be considered as early as 2 months of age (IIa, B). Repetitive HCV-RNA testing prior to 18 months of age is not recommended (III, A). Children who are anti-HCV-positive after 18 months of age should be tested with an HCV-RNA assay after age 3 to confirm chronic hepatitis C (I, B). The siblings of children with vertically acquired chronic hepatitis C should be tested for HCV infection if born from the same mother (I, C).

Blood tests

A panel of tests is required to identify current or past hepatitis infection. Patients should be tested for HCV antibody and, if positive, should undergo HCV RNA testing for confirmation; the presence of HCV RNA indicates active infection. The following tests are recommended for HBV: hepatitis B surface antigen, which is indicative of HBV infection; hepatitis B surface antibody, which reflects immunity to infection; hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) immunoglobulin G (IgG), which may indicate current or previous HBV infection; and HBcAb immunoglobulin M (IgM), which may be the only detectable indicator of HBV during the period of acute infection. In hepatitis B surface antigen–positive patients, it is necessary to test for HBV DNA (which confirms chronic infection if present) and hepatitis D virus antibody, which, if positive, implies the need to assay hepatitis D virus (HDV) RNA to confirm coinfection/superinfection with HDV causing a higher rate of cirrhosis and its complications than HBV monoinfection. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is confirmed by the detection of IgM (active infection) and IgG (past infection) antibodies for HAV.HBV and HAV vaccinations are recommended for unexposed and unvaccinated patients.

### Seroepidemiology of hepatitis E virus in patients with non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis in Hungary [^115qU8g5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Many cases of acute hepatitis remain undiagnosed and the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is emerging in industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to assess the role HEV as causative agent in acute non-A, non-B, and non-C hepatitis patients in Hungary. 10.5% of the 264 acute non-A, non-B, and non-C hepatitis patients tested had anti-HEV IgG and 1.9% had anti-HEV IgM as tested by ELISA. After confirmation by Western blot 6.1% of the acute non-A, non-B, and non-C hepatitis patients had anti-HEV IgG antibodies only and 1.1% of the patients had both IgG and IgM. All 19 patients that were positive for anti-HEV IgG and/or IgM tested negative for HEV RNA by PCR. Only a small proportion of the acute hepatitis cases in the southwest of Hungary are assumed to be attributed to HEV infection, however, hepatitis E should be considered along with hepatitis A, B, and C in the diagnosis of acute hepatitis.

### Acute hepatitis E infection associated with a false-positive serology against Epstein-Barr virus [^115Jx3dX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus is a major cause of acute viral hepatitis. The diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis E is based essentially on antibodies and hepatitis E virus RNA. We describe herein a case of acute hepatitis E associated with a false-positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This case report suggests that anti-viral capsid antigen IgM must be interpreted with caution in acute E hepatitis. When positive, EBV RNA polymerase chain reaction can be useful as a false positivity of anti-viral capsid antigen IgM and can be misinterpreted as an acute infection. EBV false positivity was probably related to polyclonal stimulation of the immune system, favoured by hepatitis E.

### Diagnosis of acute hepatitis E by antibody and molecular testing: a study on 277 suspected cases [^1153K2fw]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute hepatitis due to hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is both indigenous and imported to Europe. Few studies provide information about the role of HEV as an agent for acute hepatitis in Spain.

Objectives

To investigate the frequency of the HEV infection among patients displaying acute hepatitis of unexplained origin in Spain, comparing the performance of two different diagnostic approaches.

Study Design

Specific IgM antibody and HEV RNA tests were used to study samples from 277 patients with acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology received during a six-year period. Samples were sent by 52 hospitals from almost all regions of Spain.

Results

Evidence of acute infection by HEV was obtained for 30 patients in total (10.8%), and 16 cases were unrelated to recent international travel. On samples from 158 patients tested for both anti-HEV IgM and HEV RNA at admission, the yield of IgM antibody testing (11.4%) was higher than the yield of HEV RNA testing (9.5%).

Conclusions

HEV could be responsible in Spain of about 11% of cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin overall, and of about 8% of cases unrelated to international travel or immigration. India and neighbour countries represent the highest risk for import of epidemic HEV strains into Spain. Both antibody assays and molecular tests are required to optimise the final yield of laboratory diagnosis.

### Diagnostic performance and kinetics of hepatitis E viral RNA and IgM antibody test positivity in a genotype 1 outbreak in south Sudan [^111kKCJQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnostics are essential for understanding hepatitis E epidemiology, but the field performance of available tests remains unclear. We evaluated the performance of PCR, IgM ELISA, and the Assure HEV IgM rapid diagnostic test (RDT) during a HEV genotype 1 outbreak and assessed the duration of viremia and antibodies responses.

Methods

We used data from enhanced surveillance at a health facility in Bentiu internally displaced persons camp, South Sudan (March-December 2022). As part of a vaccine effectiveness study suspected hepatitis E cases underwent testing with all three diagnostics at enrolment with a follow-up sample. We used a latent class model to estimate test performance and accelerated failure time models to estimate time from jaundice onset to a negative test for PCR and ELISA.

Findings

Among 893 suspected cases, test sensitivity declined with time from jaundice onset. Within 30 days of jaundice onset, PCR sensitivity was 73% (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 27, 90), compared to 86% for RDT (95% CrI: 74, 93), and 95% for ELISA (95% CrI: 91, 98). Specificity was high across tests: PCR at 98% (95% CrI: 98, 99), RDT at 95% (95% CrI: 93, 96), and ELISA at 95% (95% CrI: 93, 96). Median time from jaundice onset to negative test was 19 days (95% CI: 17, 21) for PCR and 113 days (95% CI: 87, 163) for ELISA.

Interpretation

The Assure IgM RDT showed higher sensitivity for identifying hepatitis E than PCR and similar specificity to IgM ELISA, supporting its use in surveillance. Care seeking delays can greatly influence the interpretation of diagnostic tests.

### The prevalence of HEV among non-A-C hepatitis in Qatar and efficiency of serological markers for the diagnosis of hepatitis E [^113Sph8y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Even though the Wantai HEV-IgG resulted in a significantly higher seroprevalence (Table 3), it showed the weakest performance compared to the rest of the assays (sensitivity = 63.6%, specificity = 72.1%, and kappa = 0.29). The reason behind this might be because all the samples were collected in the acute phase of the infection, where HEV-IgG immunoglobulins are yet below the detectable limits. In other words, HEV IgG appears shortly after the IgM response, which appears one week to two months after the onset of illness. Similar to our results, in a series of 44 children with acute HEV (confirmed with HEV viremia in serum and stool by cell culture and RT-PCR), only 35 percent of patients tested positive for HEV-IgM in serum and only 3 percent were positive for HEV-IgG. In another study, HEV-RNA was detected in 23% of patients, followed by the detection of specific HEV-IgM in 17% and HEV-IgG in 13% of patients. This might explain the high discordance between assays of HEV-IgG antibody (depending on the time of sample collection) as compared with assays for HEV-IgM antibody. Another reason, IgG positivity could be due to a previous infection, especially those that are HEV-RNA and HEV-IgM negative samples.

### A comprehensive molecular and serological investigation of hepatitis A virus among patients with suspected acute hepatitis: a Brazilian study [^113CQYCf]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Patients and Samples

The study population consisted of individuals sequentially attended from October 2019 to May 2023 and were seeking care with clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of acute liver disease in a network of assistance to viral hepatitis, distributed throughout the five Brazilian regions: North, Northeast, South, Southeast, and Central West. They were sequentially attended from October 2019 to May 2023 and undergo tests for HAV (anti‐HAV IgG/IgM and PCR) from blood samples collected through the observational, prospective, and multicenter study entitled "Study of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of acute viral hepatitis in Brazilian healthcare services".

The eligibility criteria were defined as: (1) Symptomatic jaundice: sudden appearance of jaundice within 6 months before the start of the study, with or without additional symptoms such as fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, acholic stools, and dark urine; in laboratory investigations, the patient had an increase in aminotransferase levels ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal‐ ULN); (2) Symptomatic non‐jaundice: participants without jaundice but presenting with one or more symptoms such as fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, myalgia; in laboratory investigations, they had an increase in aminotransferase levels ≥ 1.5 times the ULN); (3) Asymptomatic non‐jaundice: participants without jaundice or symptoms suggestive of acute hepatitis, but with a sudden increase in aminotransferase levels ≥ 1.5 times the ULN and/or participants with a known recognized close contact with a patient with confirmed viral hepatitis.

Blood samples collected by venipuncture, were properly identified with sequential labels provided and identified with the patients' full names and then centrifuged for serum or plasma separation. After collection, the samples were adequately processed, stored, and subsequently sent for analysis along with the completed documents to the Albert Einstein Clinical Pathology Laboratory in São Paulo, capital city of São Paulo State, Brazil.

This study was approved by the institutional research boards of all participating institutions (CONEP‐CAAE 00952818.4.1001.0071) and was previously described. The inclusion criteria were individuals aged ≥ 18 years who signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) or had their fingerprint collected in the ICF from illiterate patients. ICF was signed by a close relative if the patient was bedridden or unable to sign it. The study protocol conforms to the ethical guides of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki reflected in a priori approval by the institution´s human research committee.

Table 4 — interpretation of HBV serologic markers — HBV surface antigen negative, HBV core antibody negative, and HBV surface antibody negative indicates not infected and not immune. HBV surface antigen negative, HBV core antibody positive, and HBV surface antibody positive indicates previous HBV infection, now cleared (i.e., no viremia) and leading to natural immunity. HBV surface antigen negative, HBV core antibody negative, and HBV surface antibody positive indicates successful HBV vaccination leading to immunity. HBV surface antigen positive, HBV core antibody positive (IgM), and HBV surface antibody negative indicates acute active HBV infection. HBV surface antigen positive, HBV core antibody positive (IgM negative, IgG positive), and HBV surface antibody negative indicates chronic active HBV infection. HBV surface antigen negative, HBV core antibody positive, and HBV surface antibody negative has four possibilities: 1. Resolved infection and immune (most common) 2. False positive 3. Occult chronic infection 4. Resolving acute infection.

### The prevalence of HEV among non-A-C hepatitis in Qatar and efficiency of serological markers for the diagnosis of hepatitis E [^117NR5xL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Acute HEV infection can be diagnosed by the detection of anti-HEV antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) by enzyme immunoassays. However, till now, there are plethora of issues regarding the performance of HEV serological assays that require urgent attention, such as, the specificity of certain assays is not optimal, cross reactivity with other viruses (EBV and CMV), and anti-HEV IgM on its own is not a sufficiently robust marker for diagnosis. Therefore, serology assays alone are unreliable in the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis. Thus, the European Association of the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommends using a combination of serology and nucleic acid test (NAT) testing to diagnose HEV infection in immunocompetent patients, while it recommends NAT testing to diagnose chronic HEV infection in immunocompromised patients. In the present paper, we conducted a study on sporadic cases of acute non-A-C hepatitis in Qatar by comparing the performance of four dominant, commercially available Wantai HEV-IgM, Wantai HEV-IgG, Wantai HEV-Ag assays, and MP HEV-Total Ab test to RT-PCR to evaluate the current status of their performance.

Acute HEV infections were identified in 23.1% of the non-A-C hepatitis patients in our study. However, this prevalence of HEV-RNA could be underestimated. That is, the HEV-RNA can be detected in serum only during the viremia stage and last for a very short period during the early convalescence stage. For instance, three samples in our study showed positive HEV-IgM, HEV-IgG, HEV-Total Ab and high ALT value, but negative RT-PCR results. These 3 patients could be in an early convalescence stage, where RNA disappeared or could be due to the low level of HEV-RNA in their serum. As the HEV-RNA detected for a longer period in the stool than the blood during the acute stage, any future study should include stool samples from these patients for better estimation of the HEV prevalence.

### Hepatitis E virus antigen detection as an early diagnostic marker: report from India [^114YLXiq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is implicated in many outbreaks of viral hepatitis in the Indian subcontinent. The conventional diagnosis of such outbreaks rests on the detection of anti-HEV IgM antibodies. However, IgM antibodies develop after 4–5 days of infection. An early-diagnostic marker is imperative for timely diagnosis of the outbreak and also initiation of control measures. This study aimed to determine the use of hepatitis E virus antigen detection as an early diagnostic marker in an outbreak in comparison to anti-HEV IgM and RT-PCR analyses. Forty samples were collected during a suspected outbreak of viral hepatitis due to HEV. A total of 36 samples were positive for one or more HEV markers. The positivity for anti-HEV IgM, HEV antigen, and RT-PCR was 91.6%, 69.4%, and 47.2% respectively. RT-PCR and HEV antigen detection gave the highest positive results (100%) in the first 3 days of illness. Positive HEV PCR declined to 54% by Days 4–7, whereas HEV antigen and IgM detection were 88% and 100%, respectively. Sequencing of representative HEV samples indicated that the strains responsible for this outbreak belonged to genotype I, subtype 1a. HEV antigen was found to be an early diagnostic marker of acute infection. HEV antigen was detected in three additional cases in the early phase (1–3 days), and they had no detectable anti-HEV IgM antibodies. These three samples were also positive for HEV RNA. After Day 7, anti-HEV IgM was the main diagnostic indicator of infection.
