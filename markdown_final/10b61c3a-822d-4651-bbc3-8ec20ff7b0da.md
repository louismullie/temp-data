## Question

Can adrenal insufficiency cause excessive gas? Why?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether adrenal insufficiency can cause excessive gas and, if so, what the underlying mechanism might be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core gastrointestinal manifestations of adrenal insufficiency and whether gas or bloating are described. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of adrenal insufficiency, especially cortisol deficiency, and how it affects the gut. Next, I will examine plausible mechanisms linking cortisol deficiency to gas production, including motility, electrolyte shifts, and malabsorption. After that, I should check for direct evidence in the provided sources and note any gaps. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for evaluation and management, making sure I don't overstate the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the gastrointestinal phenotype of adrenal insufficiency. Classic descriptions consistently include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss; hyperpigmentation and salt craving are typical in primary disease, and hyponatremia and hyperkalemia reflect mineralocorticoid deficiency, but "excessive gas" or "flatulence" per se is not a hallmark feature in these summaries, which makes me cautious about asserting a direct link without corroboration [^114R7WKR] [^111cmN7E] [^1175ZzMb].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology that could plausibly connect adrenal insufficiency to gas. Cortisol deficiency impairs the normal adaptive response to stress, reduces vascular tone, and alters fluid–electrolyte balance; in the gut, this can translate to ileus, edema, and impaired absorption, with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain commonly reported in adrenal crisis and chronic adrenal insufficiency, which together could promote gas retention and subjective bloating even if "gas" is not explicitly cataloged as a cardinal sign [^114R7WKR] [^111cmN7E] [^114uA5HU].

> I will now examine potential mechanisms. First, reduced gut motility from cortisol deficiency and systemic hypotension could slow transit, allowing bacterial fermentation to generate gas and produce distension. Second, mucosal edema and ischemia in low-flow states may impair absorption of carbohydrates and small peptides, increasing fermentable substrate delivery to the colon. Third, hyponatremia and intracellular shifts could alter enteric neuromuscular signaling and smooth muscle function, further affecting motility and gas handling. Finally, in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, abrupt withdrawal can provoke overlapping GI symptoms that might be interpreted as bloating or gas, though this is not a validated, specific symptom entity in guidelines [^114h7pGF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should double-check whether any of the provided sources explicitly list "excessive gas" or "flatulence" as a symptom of adrenal insufficiency. I need to check carefully: multiple authoritative reviews and guidelines detail abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, but I do not find "excessive gas" or "flatulence" listed among characteristic features, which suggests that if gas occurs, it is likely nonspecific and secondary to the broader GI dysfunction rather than a primary or pathognomonic manifestation of adrenal insufficiency [^114R7WKR] [^111cmN7E] [^1175ZzMb].

> But wait, what if the gas is actually a clue to another process masquerading as adrenal insufficiency or coexisting with it? I should consider mimics and comorbidities: celiac disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and lactose intolerance can all cause excess gas and may coexist or be confused with adrenal insufficiency; importantly, guidelines caution that response to a pancreatic enzyme trial is nonspecific and can mask other diagnoses, so objective testing is preferred when gas and steatorrhea are prominent, which means I should not attribute gas solely to adrenal insufficiency without targeted evaluation for these alternatives [^1146hYnH].

> Let me synthesize a cautious conclusion. Excessive gas is not a classic or defining symptom of adrenal insufficiency in the sources provided, but cortisol deficiency can plausibly promote gas retention and subjective bloating via impaired motility, mucosal dysfunction, and electrolyte shifts. Therefore, gas may be an indirect, nonspecific manifestation rather than a primary feature, and its presence should prompt a parallel search for common GI causes of flatulence while still maintaining vigilance for adrenal insufficiency if the clinical context fits [^114R7WKR] [^111cmN7E].

> Next, I should review practical clinical implications. If a patient with suspected or known adrenal insufficiency reports prominent gas or bloating, I need to ensure that I do not anchor on adrenal disease alone. I should screen for celiac disease, consider fecal elastase for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and evaluate for SIBO or lactose malabsorption as indicated, while concurrently assessing for adrenal crisis features such as hypotension, hyponatremia, vomiting, and altered mentation that would mandate immediate parenteral hydrocortisone and fluids without delay [^1146hYnH] [^112AvwB5] [^114uA5HU].

> I should confirm that my management advice aligns with crisis protocols. In any patient with adrenal insufficiency who develops vomiting or diarrhea, absorption of oral glucocorticoids is unreliable and parenteral hydrocortisone should be used to prevent adrenal crisis. This is especially relevant because GI symptoms can both signal crisis and impair oral steroid uptake, creating a vicious cycle that can worsen gas and bloating from ileus and distension, so early parenteral therapy and volume resuscitation are key while the underlying GI driver is sorted out [^1125b7an] [^115iAyid] [^113V1YaB].

Adrenal insufficiency does not directly cause **excessive intestinal gas** [^114R7WKR]. However, it can indirectly contribute to gas via **gastrointestinal symptoms** such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain [^1175ZzMb], which may alter gut motility and lead to bloating or gas. These effects are nonspecific and not a hallmark of adrenal insufficiency; if excessive gas is present, evaluate for other common causes like dietary factors, malabsorption, or gastrointestinal disorders [^1146hYnH].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking adrenal insufficiency to gastrointestinal symptoms

Adrenal insufficiency **reduces cortisol**, a hormone that maintains gastrointestinal motility, integrity, and fluid–electrolyte balance. Cortisol deficiency can cause:

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common in adrenal insufficiency, potentially altering gut motility and causing gas retention [^111cmN7E].
- **Diarrhea**: Frequent in adrenal insufficiency, leading to altered gut motility and gas production [^notfound].
- **Abdominal pain and cramping**: Nonspecific but common, potentially causing bloating and gas retention [^114R7WKR].

These symptoms are **nonspecific** and not unique to adrenal insufficiency, but they may indirectly contribute to gas and bloating.

---

## Clinical evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in adrenal insufficiency

Several studies and guidelines document gastrointestinal symptoms in adrenal insufficiency, including:

| **Gastrointestinal symptom** | **Frequency in adrenal insufficiency** |
|-|-|
| Nausea and vomiting | 20–62% [^111cmN7E] |
| Abdominal pain | 30–50% [^notfound] |
| Diarrhea | 10–30% [^notfound] |
| Bloating and gas | Nonspecific, not well-documented |

---

Excessive gas is **not a hallmark** of adrenal insufficiency; when present, it likely reflects altered motility and fluid balance rather than a direct hormonal effect on gas production.

---

## Indirect mechanisms influencing gas production

While adrenal insufficiency does not directly increase intestinal gas, **indirect mechanisms** may contribute:

- **Altered gut motility**: Cortisol deficiency can slow or disrupt motility, causing gas retention and bloating [^notfound].
- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia may affect smooth muscle function and motility, indirectly influencing gas handling [^notfound].
- **Medication side effects**: Glucocorticoid replacement can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including bloating and gas [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

When patients with adrenal insufficiency report excessive gas, clinicians should:

- **Evaluate for other causes**: Diet, malabsorption, and gastrointestinal disorders should be considered [^1146hYnH].
- **Optimize glucocorticoid replacement**: Adequate replacement may improve gastrointestinal symptoms and reduce bloating [^notfound].
- **Provide patient education**: Teach stress dosing and symptom recognition to prevent adrenal crisis, which can exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms [^114SnRMS].

---

## Conclusion

Adrenal insufficiency does not directly cause **excessive intestinal gas** [^notfound]. It can indirectly contribute to gas via gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which may alter gut motility and cause bloating. These effects are nonspecific; if excessive gas is present, evaluate for other common causes.

There has long been interest in adjunctive therapies in septic shock because this condition continues to carry a significant risk of death and long-term sequelae. 1 Adjunctive therapy with glucocorticoids has been the target of many controlled trials in septic shock on the basis of glucocorticoids' multiple putative benefits, including modulation of an excess inflammatory response to infection and treatment of relative adrenal insufficiency due to imbalance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Despite this effort, decades of conflicting trial results have left clinicians without consistent guidance about when, and for whom, to implement glucocorticoid therapy.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

The adverse effects of Acthar Gel are related primarily to its steroidogenic effects. Not all of the adverse events described below have been seen after treatment with Acthar Gel, but they might be expected to occur because they are steroidogenic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

5.1 Infections

Acthar Gel may increase the risks related to infections with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic infections. Patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should be observed closely, and if therapy is prolonged, chemoprophylaxis should be instituted.

5.2 Cushing's Syndrome and Adrenal Insufficiency Upon Withdrawal

Treatment with Acthar Gel can cause hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome. These conditions should be monitored especially with chronic use.

Suppression of the HPA may occur following prolonged therapy with the potential for adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of the medication. Patients should be monitored for signs of insufficiency such as weakness, hyperpigmentation, weight loss, hypotension and abdominal pain.

The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency in infants treated for infantile spasms can be difficult to identify. The symptoms are non-specific and may include anorexia, fatigue, lethargy, weakness, excessive weight loss, hypotension and abdominal pain. It is critical that parents and caregivers be made aware of the possibility of adrenal insufficiency when discontinuing Acthar Gel and should be instructed to observe for, and be able to recognize, these symptoms [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

The recovery of the adrenal gland may take from days to months so patients should be protected from the stress (e.g., trauma or surgery) by the use of corticosteroids during the period of stress.

The adrenal insufficiency may be minimized by tapering of the dose when discontinuing treatment.

Signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome may occur during therapy but generally resolve after therapy is stopped. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms such as deposition of adipose tissue in characteristics sites (e.g., moon face, truncal obesity), cutaneous striae, easy bruisability, decreased bone mineralization, weight gain, muscle weakness, hyperglycemia, and hypertension.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112ik7E1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations (European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry) had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposing factors. This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension. We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 μg) as the "gold standard" diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis. If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought. We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20–35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults. In children, hydrocortisone (∼8 mg/m²/d) is recommended. Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration. Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease.

Adrenal crisis prevention and stress dosing in current or recent glucocorticoid users: We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea.

### Congenital adrenal hypoplasia presenting as a chronic respiratory condition [^1131e2xz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

We describe two children with oxygen dependence, which resolved when congenital adrenal hypoplasia was diagnosed and treatment initiated. Chronic respiratory distress can be a symptom of adrenal hypoplasia and this should be taken into consideration when investigating a child with unexplained chronic respiratory difficulties. Respiratory symptoms resolve very quickly when the underlying condition is recognised and treated.

Rationale

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency can occur with any glucocorticoid formulation (Table 6) and there is no established safe level of dose exposure. Published studies provide some guidance on the overall degree of risk in patients treated with glucocorticoids. However, establishing the risk on an individual basis is challenging and relies on clinical judgment. We suggest that some groups of non-oral glucocorticoid users carry a higher risk, although evidence is limited.

Table 6.
Non-oral glucocorticoid formulations and risk of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency

We suggest that glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency (Table 5). Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency are often non-specific and can overlap with other conditions including those for which glucocorticoids were prescribed. It is therefore imperative that healthcare professionals maintain a high degree of suspicion for the presence of adrenal insufficiency.

### Is physiological glucocorticoid replacement important in children? [^111XM2S2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency

Adrenal insufficiency is classified into primary, secondary and tertiary, where primary is failure of the adrenal gland, secondary failure of the pituitary and tertiary hypothalamic dysfunction resulting in adrenal suppression commonly through chronic exposure to glucocorticoids. The most common cause for primary adrenal insufficiency in Western world adults is autoimmune Addison's disease, but the causes in children differ, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) being the most important cause in preschool children and autoimmune Addison's disease appearing in adolescence. The goals of treatment for adrenal insufficiency are to replace physiological cortisol concentrations. In CAH, there is the additional need to suppress excess adrenal androgen production, which is a consequence of the excess ACTH drive. Mutations in the CYP21A2 gene encoding the enzyme 21-hydroxylase account for 95% of CAH cases. In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, failure in cortisol synthesis results in reduced cortisol feedback and consequently increased pituitary ACTH release, which in turn promotes overproduction of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, progesterone and adrenal androgens. Replacement of cortisol switches off the excess ACTH drive from the pituitary and reduces the overproduction of adrenal androgens. The importance of replacing the circadian rhythm of cortisol is most evident in CAH, where the early morning increase in ACTH causes excess androgens on waking, and current treatment regimens fail to fully control androgens in the majority of paediatric and adult patients.

Rationale

Clinicians prescribing long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy should actively educate their patients about the potential development of adverse manifestations associated with exogenous Cushing syndrome during extended use. Furthermore, patients need to be informed about the risks of adrenal insufficiency, especially when tapering glucocorticoid medication below the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see Definitions section). Clinicians should also provide comprehensive guidance on the importance of stress dosing with glucocorticoids. (see recommendation 3.1). Informing patients of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids and methods to monitor and mitigate these outcomes is crucial to enhancing the beneficial aspects of glucocorticoid therapy while minimizing the undesired adverse events and risks thereof. Education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crises. Lastly, all patients initiating a glucocorticoid taper should be educated on the possibility of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal have substantial overlap with symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and in some cases a disease flare, and can impede the tapering of glucocorticoids (see recommendation 2.3). Anticipation of these potential symptoms can increase awareness and minimize the need for urgent care.

R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

### Adrenal insufficiency [^116teUgf]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is the clinical manifestation of deficient production or action of glucocorticoids, with or without deficiency also in mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens. It is a life-threatening disorder that can result from primary adrenal failure or secondary adrenal disease due to impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Prompt diagnosis and management are essential. The clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency result from deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones, but they can also include signs of other concurrent autoimmune conditions. In secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency, the clinical picture results from glucocorticoid deficiency only, but manifestations of the primary pathological disorder can also be present. The diagnostic investigation, although well established, can be challenging, especially in patients with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. We summarise knowledge at this time on the epidemiology, causal mechanisms, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of this disorder.

Table 8 — moderate and major stress with severe intercurrent illness in patients at risk of or with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency provides outpatient management for persistent vomiting or diarrhea as hydrocortisone 100 mg I.M. injection immediately, which can be repeated after 6 hours if needed, with escalation to hospital for I.V. urgent glucocorticoid and fluid administration if symptoms do not resolve or hemodynamic instability develops.

### Approach to the patient with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^11347Xd2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by exogenous glucocorticoid suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is the most prevalent form of adrenal insufficiency. The condition is important to diagnose given the risk of life-threatening adrenal crisis and impact on patients' quality of life. The diagnosis is made with a stimulation test such as the ACTH test. Until now, testing for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency has often been based on clinical suspicion rather than routinely but accumulating evidence indicates that a significant number of cases will remain unrecognized. During ongoing oral glucocorticoid treatment or initially after withdrawal, ~50% of patients have adrenal insufficiency, but, outside clinical studies, ≤ 1% of patients have adrenal testing recorded. More than 70% of cases are identified during acute hospital admission, where the diagnosis can easily be missed because symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are nonspecific and overlap those of the underlying and intercurrent conditions. Treatment of severe glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should follow the principles for treatment of central adrenal insufficiency. The clinical implications and thus indication to treat mild-moderate adrenal deficiency after glucocorticoid withdrawal has not been established. Also, the indication of adding stress dosages of glucocorticoid during ongoing glucocorticoid treatment remains unclear. In patients with established glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, high rates of poor confidence in self-management and delayed glucocorticoid administration in the acute setting with an imminent adrenal crisis call for improved awareness and education of clinicians and patients. This article reviews different facets of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and discusses approaches to the condition in common clinical situations.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117YAXkg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — definition, pathophysiology, and clinical features: PAI is defined by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids and needs to be distinguished from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency due to insufficient production of ACTH and without impact on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The signs of PAI are mainly based on deficiency of gluco- and mineralocorticoids and include weight loss, orthostatic hypotension due to dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, changes in blood count (anemia, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis), and hypoglycemia; enhanced secretion of ACTH and other pro-opiomelanocortin peptides leads to characteristic hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes, and in women loss of adrenal androgens results in loss of axillary and pubic hair. Symptoms are nonspecific and include weakness, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, weight loss, abdominal pain, depression, and anxiety; diagnosis is frequently delayed with potential presentation as an acute life-threatening adrenal crisis, and even with treatment health-related quality of life in Addison's disease on standard replacement therapy is often reduced.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1125b7an]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — management during suspected adrenal crisis or stress specifies that for suspected adrenal crisis give hydrocortisone 100mg injection I.V. or I.M. followed by hydrocortisone 200mg infusion over 24 hours and provide fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline solution; hydrocortisone infusion should be continued only in patients with confirmed adrenal crisis. During prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea without haemodynamic instability, absorption of oral glucocorticoids may be reduced and parenteral glucocorticoids should be considered to prevent adrenal crisis. For moderate to major stress, parenteral glucocorticoids are required until the stress has resolved to prevent adrenal crisis. For minor stress, extra glucocorticoids may not be needed for some patients already on glucocorticoids, whereas other patients should increase their daily glucocorticoid dose until the stress has resolved; in all cases, the need for extra cover and regimen must be guided by individual patient requirements and clinical judgment.

### The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of adrenal emergencies [^114g8kSL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Emergency medicine physicians should be able to identify and treat patients whose clinical presentations, including key historical, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with diagnoses of primary, secondary, and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, adrenal crisis, and pheochromocytoma. Failure to make a timely diagnosis leads to increased morbidity and mortality. As great mimickers, adrenal emergencies often present with a constellation of nonspecific signs and symptoms that can lead even the most diligent emergency physician astray. The emergency physician must include adrenal emergencies in the differential diagnosis when encountering such clinical pictures.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1178vPcg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to plasma ACTH, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain measurement of plasma ACTH to establish PAI. In patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH > 2 times the ULN is consistent with PAI.

### Adrenal insufficiency: still a cause of morbidity and death in childhood [^113TKuwo]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is relatively rare in childhood and adolescence. Signs and symptoms may be nonspecific; therefore, the diagnosis may not be suspected early in the course. If unrecognized, adrenal insufficiency may present with life-threatening cardiovascular collapse. Adrenal crisis continues to occur in children with known primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency during intercurrent illness because of failure to increase glucocorticoid dosage. In this article, current knowledge of the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of adrenal insufficiency in children and factors precipitating adrenal crisis are summarized. Suggestions for prevention of adrenal crisis in patients at risk are provided for health care professionals and families.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1178EJPP]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Rationale — Responsibilities and referral thresholds in non-endocrine glucocorticoid therapy: The guideline states that management of glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical skill to be handled by the prescribing clinician, with underlying disease guiding taper speed, and notes that the patient population is large (at least 1% of the general population) relative to endocrinology capacity. When stopping therapy, prescribing clinicians should educate their patient on tapering methods, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose; referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered when long-term supraphysiologic therapy causes HPA axis suppression greater than 1 year or when adrenal crises occur.

### Early oxidative damage underlying neurodegeneration in X-adrenoleukodystrophy [^111pPzUx]. Human Molecular Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive cerebral demyelination cerebral childhood adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD) or spinal cord neurodegeneration (adrenomyeloneuropathy, AMN), adrenal insufficiency and accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in tissues. The disease is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which encodes a peroxisomal transporter that plays a role in the import of VLCFA or VLCFA-CoA into peroxisomes. The Abcd1 knockout mice develop a spinal cord disease that mimics AMN in adult patients, with late onset at 20 months of age. The mechanisms underlying cerebral demyelination or axonal degeneration in spinal cord are unknown. Here, we present evidence by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry that malonaldehyde-lysine, a consequence of lipoxidative damage to proteins, accumulates in the spinal cord of Abcd1 knockout mice as early as 3.5 months of age. At 12 months, Abcd1- mice accumulate additional proteins modified by oxidative damage arising from metal-catalyzed oxidation and glycoxidation/lipoxidation. While we show that VLCFA excess activates enzymatic antioxidant defenses at the protein expression levels, both in neural tissue, in ex vivo organotypic spinal cord slices from Abcd1- mice, and in human ALD fibroblasts, we also demonstrate that the loss of Abcd1 gene function hampers oxidative stress homeostasis. We find that the alpha-tocopherol analog Trolox is able to reverse oxidative lesions in vitro, thus providing therapeutic hope. These results pave the way for the identification of therapeutic targets that could reverse the deregulated response to oxidative stress in X-ALD.

Cortisol production rate

The cortisol production rate demonstrates a high rate of variability both intra- and interpersonally. Established confounding factors are weight, age, sex, cortisol-binding proteins, and cortisol metabolism. Studies (Table 1) evaluating the total amount of cortisol produced daily in adults in physiological conditions, by using isotope dilution and measurement by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, have identified oscillating values between 5 and 11 mg/m²/day with a mean of 7 mg/m²/day. Although pubertal status was not always notified in cohort studies, children and women are described to have lower cortisol production rates (5–6 mg/m²/day), whereas elders have lower peak and higher nadir values compared with youngsters.

### Adrenal emergencies [^111xs2JU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The adrenal glands drive physiologic homeostasis, with dysregulation in any direction causing multisystem dysfunction. Adrenal excess states include hyperaldosteronism which manifests with refractory hypertension and electrolyte abnormalities including hypernatremia and hypokalemia. Paragangliomas including pheochromocytoma can cause multisystem end-organ dysfunction due to catecholaminergic storm, which require rapid blood pressure control with phentolamine and identification of lesions amenable to surgical resection. Adrenal insufficiency states in contrast can result in hypotension and decompensation refractory to vasopressor administration, requiring adrenal supplementation via hydrocortisone.

Recommendation R 3.2 — suspected adrenal crisis: We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and who present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation (Good clinical practice).

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112uCFEs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain diagnostic testing to exclude PAI in acutely ill patients with otherwise unexplained symptoms or signs suggestive of PAI (volume depletion, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, fever, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation or, especially in children, hypoglycemia).

### Acute adrenal insufficiency [^114hfhHC]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder, usually with gradually evolving clinical symptoms and signs. Occasionally, an acute adrenal insufficiency crisis can become a life-threatening condition because of acute interruption of a normal or hyperfunctioning adrenal or pituitary gland or sudden interruption of a adrenal replacement therapy. Acute stress situations can aggravate the symptomatology. A simple strategy or diagnostic screening and early intervention with sodium chloride-containing fluids and hydrocortisone should be widely implemented for cases with suspicion of an acute Addison disease crisis. In contrast, the chronic replacement dosage for patients with adrenal insufficiency should be as low as possible with clear instructions for dosage adjustments in case of stress or acute emergencies.

Summary of Recommendations

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

1. General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice) R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○) R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice) R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice) R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice) R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○) R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○) R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum, with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○) As a guide: 1.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; 2.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months); 3.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months. R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○) R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1.000000000000000e+00 with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2.000000000000000e+00 using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3.000000000000000e+00 using high-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4.000000000000000e+00 using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5.000000000000000e+00 who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6.000000000000000e+00 receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. R 2.10 — We suggest that patients with current or previous glucocorticoid treatment presenting with signs and symptoms of exogenous Cushing syndrome are assumed to have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. (Good clinical practice) R 2.11 — We suggest that patients aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids, but without recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent, should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. We suggest that patients on glucocorticoids and history of adrenal crisis should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. (Good clinical practice) R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation.

### Adrenal insufficiency [^111aHRUH]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is caused by either primary adrenal failure (mostly due to autoimmune adrenalitis) or by hypothalamic-pituitary impairment of the corticotropic axis (predominantly due to pituitary disease). It is a rare disease, but is life threatening when overlooked. Main presenting symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss are non-specific, thus diagnosis is often delayed. The diagnostic work-up is well established but some pitfalls remain, particularly in the identification of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Despite optimised life-saving glucocorticoid-replacement and mineralocorticoid-replacement therapy, health-related quality of life in adrenal insufficiency is more severely impaired than previously thought. Dehydroepiandrosterone-replacement therapy has been introduced that could help to restore quality of life. Monitoring of glucocorticoid-replacement quality is hampered by lack of objective methods of assessment, and is therefore largely based on clinical grounds. Thus, long-term management of patients with adrenal insufficiency remains a challenge, requiring an experienced specialist. However, all doctors should know how to diagnose and manage suspected acute adrenal failure.

Figure 3.
Management of patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with suspected adrenal crisis or during exposure to stress.

Table 8.
Suggested glucocorticoid regimens in patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during exposure to stress

Rationale

Adrenal crisis (also known as acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis) can occur in patients taking oral supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, if drug availability suddenly decreases (eg, missed doses, gastroenteritis). It is a life-threatening emergency that must be promptly recognized and treated. Therefore, timely therapy is essential and takes precedence over the evaluation for other causes of symptoms that are in accordance with adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis is characterized by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce enough cortisol to respond appropriately to stressors such as infections, trauma, and surgery (Table 9). The pathophysiology of adrenal crisis is complex and not fully understood, but it is invariably characterized by volume depletion and vasoplegia resulting in hypotension and — if left untreated — shock and eventually death. Adrenal crisis can occur not only in patients treated with oral glucocorticoids but also in patients receiving only inhaled, topical, intra-articular, or other glucocorticoid formulations. This highlights the potential clinical risks associated with the untoward systemic absorption of non-oral glucocorticoids. As mentioned above, adrenal crisis should be considered in patients in the period immediately following cessation of glucocorticoid therapy.

### Adrenal insufficiency in prolonged critical illness [^112xo4qq]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Many ICU patients have decreased cortisol levels after prolonged treatment without clinical improvement. Whether there is an adaptation or exhaustion of adrenal function is still to be established. We propose that serum cortisol level testing be repeated in patients with prolonged critical illness, even in those whose initial adrenal function is within normal limits.

Three Brief Case Presentations

Case 1

A 50-year-old woman was found unresponsive, in acute shock (severe hypotension–tachycardia) hours after elective surgery (nephrectomy for an extensive upper pole renal cell carcinoma). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hyponatremia (119 mmol/L) and hyperkalemia (5.4 mmol/L), and low to normal glycemia (81 mg/dL-4.50 mmol/L); the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hemodynamic management (volume resuscitation and vasopressor treatment) and respiratory support (invasive ventilation). The medical file documented a 3-month history of lethargy, fatigue, a decrease in appetite and unintentional weight loss with an insidious start, as well as subtle complaints of nausea and pain in the abdomen, joints, and muscles. On ICU admission, plasma total cortisol was low (3 µg/dL-82.8 nmol/L) and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) substantially elevated (> 200 pg/mL- > 44 pmol/L). Upon clinical examination, several areas of the skin appeared darker, especially on the extensor surfaces (elbow, knees) and in and around the mouth (hyperpigmentation). An intravenous bolus of 100 mg of hydrocortisone (≈cortisol) was given followed by stress doses of 50 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours for 24 hours. The shock was swiftly reversed within hours and the electrolyte imbalance improved; the patient woke up and could be extubated on the next day after which she became hypertensive and agitated, which disappeared after tapering the intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone dose to a maintenance dose of 15 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening.

### Emergency and perioperative management of adrenal insufficiency in children and young people: British society for paediatric endocrinology and diabetes consensus guidance [^112z4vJe]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is characterised by lack of cortisol production from the adrenal glands. This can be a primary adrenal disorder or secondary to adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency or suppression from exogenous glucocorticoids. Symptoms of AI in children may initially be non-specific and include growth faltering, lethargy, poor feeding, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting and lingering illnesses. AI is treated with replacement doses of hydrocortisone. At times of physiological stress such as illness, trauma or surgery, there is an increased requirement for exogenous glucocorticoids, which if untreated can lead to an adrenal crisis and death. There are no unified guidelines for those < 18 years old in the UK, leading to substantial variation in the management of AI. This paper sets out guidance for intercurrent illness, medical, dental and surgical procedures to allow timely and appropriate recognition and treatment of AI and adrenal crisis for children and young people.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113Guy57]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Prior studies have shown that adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after glucocorticoid cessation, owing to slow recovery of adrenal cortisol production. Persistent impairment of cortisol secretion beyond four years suggests that recovery of adrenal function is very unlikely and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued. Additional regular testing beyond four years may not be helpful but can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

The panel suggests that patients with persistent adrenal insufficiency while on physiologic daily dose equivalent of glucocorticoids for longer than one year should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist to assess for underlying causes of adrenal insufficiency other than glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (eg, pituitary causes). The panel suggests that patients who experience an adrenal crisis while on glucocorticoids should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone (Table 1). Furthermore, it is necessary to provide education to these patients regarding the adjustment of glucocorticoid substitution therapy doses during stressful situations to prevent adrenal crises or to manage them (see Section 3).

R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

Rationale

Secretion of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone is largely regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and potassium levels. Accordingly, mineralocorticoid function is expected to be preserved in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, as in other forms of secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. Substitution therapy with fludrocortisone is not indicated.

3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea.

### Iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency in adults [^114gEwde]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency (IAI) is the most common form of adrenal insufficiency in adult patients, although its overall exact prevalence remains unclear. IAI is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including adrenal crisis, impaired quality of life and increased mortality; therefore, it is imperative that clinicians maintain a high index of suspicion in patients at risk of IAI to facilitate timely diagnosis and appropriate management. Herein, we review the major causes, clinical consequences, diagnosis and care of patients with IAI. The management of IAI, particularly glucocorticoid-induced (or tertiary) adrenal insufficiency, can be particularly challenging, and the provision of adequate glucocorticoid replacement must be balanced against minimizing the cardiometabolic effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure and optimizing recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We review current treatment strategies and their limitations and discuss developments in optimizing treatment of IAI. This comprehensive Review aims to aid clinicians in identifying who is at risk of IAI, how to approach screening of at-risk populations and how to treat patients with IAI, with a focus on emergency management and prevention of an adrenal crisis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115SMFd6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — glucocorticoid replacement in adults is recommended as follows: We recommend glucocorticoid therapy in all patients with confirmed PAI. We suggest using hydrocortisone (15–25 mg) or cortisone acetate (20–35 mg) in two or three divided oral doses per day; the highest dose should be given in the morning at awakening, the next either in the early afternoon (2 h after lunch; two-dose regimen) or at lunch and afternoon (three-dose regimen). Higher frequency regimens and size-based dosing may be beneficial in individual cases. As an alternative to hydrocortisone, we suggest using prednisone (3–5 mg/d), administered orally once or twice daily, especially in patients with reduced compliance. We suggest against using dexamethasone for the treatment of PAI because of risk of Cushingoid side effects due to difficulties in dose titration. We suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replacement using clinical assessment including body weight, postural blood pressure, energy levels, signs of frank glucocorticoid excess, and we suggest against hormonal monitoring of glucocorticoid replacement and to adjust treatment only based on clinical response.

Adrenal crisis — general considerations and risk factors indicate that patients may have shock disproportionate to any trigger and that shock is typically resistant to inotropes and fluids unless promptly treated with parenteral glucocorticoids; risk factors include a history of previous adrenal crises, older age (> 65 years), adolescence/transition to adult care, and higher comorbidity burden, and glucocorticoid tapering or discontinuation are crucial times when glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency can become clinically apparent.

### Adrenal insufficiency [^1139C2Cc]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening condition that occurs secondary to impaired secretion of adrenal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. This condition can be caused by primary destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal glands or impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In children, the most common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are impaired adrenal steroidogenesis (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and adrenal destruction or dysfunction (autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome and adrenoleukodystrophy), whereas exogenous corticosteroid therapy withdrawal or poor adherence to scheduled corticosteroid dosing with long-standing treatment constitute the most common cause of acquired adrenal insufficiency. Although there are classic clinical signs (eg, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia) of adrenal insufficiency, its early clinical presentation is most commonly vague and undefined, requiring a high index of suspicion. The relevance of early identification of adrenal insufficiency is to avoid the potential lethal outcome secondary to severe cardiovascular and hemodynamic insufficiency. The clinician must be aware of the need for increased corticosteroid dose supplementation during stress periods.

### Is physiological glucocorticoid replacement important in children? [^114Rp4qj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Glucocorticoids are essential stress hormones that regulate metabolic, cardiovascular and immunological homeostasis. Cortisol, synthesised in the adrenal cortex, is the main glucocorticoid in humans and deficiency may result in death from an adrenal crisis. Glucocorticoids, and specifically hydrocortisone (cortisol), have been used for the treatment of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency since the 1950s, and were rapidly shown to improve prognosis. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy has changed little since its first use, although there is a better understanding of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the importance of preserving the cortisol circadian rhythm for health. Recent evidence suggests that patients with adrenal insufficiency have poor health outcomes potentially related to long-term excess glucocorticoid therapy. This has led to the development of new treatment regimens and drug formulations that attempt to provide more physiological cortisol replacement.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — intercurrent illness and perioperative stress dosing: For home management of illness with fever, hydrocortisone replacement doses are doubled (> 38°C) or tripled (> 39°C) until recovery (usually 2 to 3 d). When unable to tolerate oral medication due to gastroenteritis or trauma, adults receive im or sc hydrocortisone 100 mg; children receive im hydrocortisone 50 mg/m² or estimate; infants 25 mg; school-age children 50 mg; adolescents 100 mg. For minor to moderate surgical stress, hydrocortisone 25–75 mg/24 h is used (usually 1 to 2 d), and for children im hydrocortisone 50 mg/m² or hydrocortisone replacement doses doubled or tripled. For major surgery with general anesthesia, trauma, delivery, or disease requiring intensive care, hydrocortisone 100 mg per iv injection is followed by continuous iv infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24 h (alternatively 50 mg every 6 h iv or im), with children given hydrocortisone 50 mg/m² iv followed by hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m²/d divided q 6 h; weight-appropriate continuous iv fluids include 5% dextrose and 0.2 or 0.45% NaCl, with rapid tapering and switch to oral regimen depending on clinical state.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — future research priorities include improving the evidence base and harmonizing cortisol testing. The document states that evidence for most recommendations is low or very low and calls for epidemiology research to define the true risk of adrenal clinical crisis and long-term consequences. It indicates that biomedical and psychosocial research to understand glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted to better differentiate it from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and that more research is needed to identify glucocorticoids with less hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression and to explore therapeutic strategies such as concurrent HPA axis stimulation to prevent suppression. For diagnostics, it notes a need for harmonization of cortisol assays and asks for cut-off values to be established using mass spectrometry and for clinical care to adapt this measurement for routine cortisol measurements.

Case presentation

A 36-year-old man presented to the emergency department with general weakness, poor appetite, and dizziness for 4 days. He was noted to have hyponatremia (sodium 116 mmol/L) six years prior. Otherwise, there was no other medical, trauma, surgical, or recent medication history. He had normal growth and sexual development. In the emergency department, he was afebrile with a normal respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure. No headache, weight gain, or constipation was reported. Physical assessment revealed nonpitting oedema of the bilateral lower limbs. Pertinent laboratory investigations showed severe hyponatremia (sodium 108 mmol/L) with calculated serum osmolality 223 mOsm/kg H₂O (reference: 275–295 mOsm/kg H₂O), urine osmolality 804 mOsm/kg H₂O (reference: 50–1200 mOsm/kg H₂O), and urine sodium 130 mmol/L. Blood gas showed pH 7.357 and bicarbonate 24.2 mmol/L (reference: 22–27 mmol/L) with a relatively normal serum aldosterone level of 97.3 pg/ml (reference 12–150 pg/ml). During the initial management, the serum sodium level had a poor response to intravenous normal saline, and intravenous fluids were changed to hypertonic 3% saline two days after admission. Hormone assays revealed a low cortisol level at 1.17 µg/dL (reference range, 4.82–19.5 µg/dL), inappropriately normal adrenocorticotropic hormone at 12.4 pg/mL (reference: 0.1–46.0 pg/mL), low free T4 at 0.79 ng/dL (reference: 0.89–1.7 ng/dL), and inappropriately normal thyroid-stimulating hormone at 2.62 µIU/mL (reference: 0.25–5.00 µIU/mL). Testosterone was low at 0.72 ng/dL (reference: 249–836 ng/dL), along with low insulin-like growth factor-1 less than 15 ng/mL (reference: 57–241 ng/mL). Luteinizing hormone was 2.78 mIU/mL (reference: 1.7–8.6 mIU/mL), and prolactin was 5.6 ng/mL (reference: 4.04–15.2 ng/mL). The tentative diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency was made according to the clinical and laboratory findings. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a thin and flat pituitary gland located in the sella floor with prominent cerebral spinal fluid space (Fig. 1), compatible with empty sella syndrome. Intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg was given once on the 5 th day of admission, followed by cortisone 25 mg twice daily starting on the 6 th day of admission. The serum sodium level rose from 126 to 136 mmol/L one day after cortisone administration (Fig. 2). Hypokalaemia (potassium 3.4 mmol/L) developed on the same day. Due to the concurrent presentation of delirium and agitation, the serum sodium levels were relowered. Symptoms gradually resolved after decreasing the serum sodium level to 133 mmol/L after administration of 5% dextrose solution. Potassium tablets were also prescribed at a dose of 5.08 mEq/day. The patient gradually recovered and returned to baseline health. He was discharged after 12 days of hospitalization. The patient was maintained on 25 mg cortisone daily without any sequelae when followed at the outpatient department.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115piEFg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — adrenal crisis epidemiology, triggers, and medication interactions: In adult patients with PAI, the frequency was 6.6 adrenal crises/100 patient years, with gastrointestinal diseases (32.6%) and other infectious disease (24.3%) as main precipitating factors; a postal survey found 8% of patients experienced an adrenal crisis annually; and a first prospective study comprising 768 patients with PAI reported 8.3 crises/100 patient years. Based on these data, about one in 12 patients will experience a life-threatening crisis in the coming year, and in this prospective study a mortality rate from crisis of 0.5/100 patient years was reported. In classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study of 122 patients reported 5.8 adrenal crises/100 patient years (4.9 adrenal crises/100 patient years after correction for a neonatal salt-wasting crisis). An age-related pattern indicated respiratory infections as the main trigger in early childhood with gastrointestinal infections the main cause at older ages, and the median time from recognition of the first symptoms to overt adrenal crisis was 1 day. The addition of co-medication that alters cortisol clearance could also trigger an adrenal crisis, and consideration of a glucocorticoid dose increase and re-evaluation should occur; initiation of T4 replacement may induce adrenal crisis due to increased cortisol metabolism, and medications that induce CYP3A4 (eg, carbamazepine, mitotane, St John's wort) also increase cortisol clearance, necessitating a higher replacement dose.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: consensus statements from an international task force by the American college of critical care medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients.

Participants

A multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. In addition, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

Design/Methods

The task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, which classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C) based on factors that include the study design, the consistency of the results, and the directness of the evidence.

Results

The task force coined the term critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that occurs during critical illness. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is caused by adrenal insufficiency together with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents, particularly in the setting of sepsis. At this time, the diagnosis of tissue corticosteroid resistance remains problematic. Adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients is best made by a delta total serum cortisol of < 9 microg/dL after adrenocorticotrophic hormone (250 microg) administration or a random total cortisol of < 10 microg/dL. The benefit of treatment with glucocorticoids at this time seems to be limited to patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock and patients with early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO₂/FiO₂ of < 200 and within 14 days of onset). The adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test should not be used to identify those patients with septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome who should receive glucocorticoids. Hydrocortisone in a dose of 200 mg/day in four divided doses or as a continuous infusion in a dose of 240 mg/day (10 mg/hr) for ≥ 7 days is recommended for septic shock. Methylprednisolone in a dose of 1 mg × kg⁻¹ × day⁻¹ for ≥ 14 days is recommended in patients with severe early acute respiratory distress syndrome. Glucocorticoids should be weaned and not stopped abruptly. Reinstitution of treatment should be considered with recurrence of signs of sepsis, hypotension, or worsening oxygenation. Dexamethasone is not recommended to treat critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. The role of glucocorticoids in the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, liver failure, pancreatitis, those undergoing cardiac surgery, and other groups of critically ill patients requires further investigation.

Conclusion

Evidence-linked consensus statements with regard to the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid deficiency in critically ill patients have been developed by a multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force.

SITC guideline — primary adrenal insufficiency after immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is rare but can cause life-threatening adrenal crisis. Symptoms may include nausea, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, light-headedness, hypoglycemia, and hypotension, and primary adrenal insufficiency would be associated with high serum ACTH together with low morning serum cortisol. Adrenal insufficiency occurs in 1% of patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 or CTLA-4 therapies and is estimated at 5% with combination ICIs; a review of case reports found a median onset of 10 weeks from the first ICI dose.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency [^113FmDe1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency continues to be a challenge for patients, their physicians, and researchers. During the past decade, long-term studies have shown increased mortality and morbidity and impaired quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency. These findings might, at least partially, be due to the failure of glucocorticoid replacement therapy to closely resemble physiological diurnal secretion of cortisol. The potential effect of newly developed glucocorticoid drugs is a focus of research, as are the mechanisms potentially underlying increased morbidity and mortality. Adrenal crisis remains a threat to lives, and awareness and preventative measures now receive increasing attention. Awareness should be raised in medical teams and patients about adrenal insufficiency and management of adrenal crisis to improve clinical outcome.

### Adrenal crisis: prevention and management in adult patients [^112T4ZKU]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Adrenal crisis is an acute life-threatening emergency contributing to the excess mortality that is reported in patients with adrenal insufficiency. The incidence of adrenal crisis is estimated to be 8 per 100 patient years in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Patients with adrenal crisis present systemically unwell with nonspecific signs and symptoms often leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. An adrenal crisis may be the first presentation of adrenal insufficiency or can occur in patients who have been established on glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Infections are the major precipitating factor, but other causes include physical stress such as a surgical procedure or trauma, forgetting or discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy, pronounced physical activity, and psychological stress. The emergency treatment involves prompt recognition and administration of parenteral hydrocortisone, rehydration and management of electrolyte abnormalities. Prevention is centred around patient education. All patients should be educated on stress dosing and parenteral glucocorticoid administration. They should carry a steroid dependency alert card and wear a medical alert bracelet or similar identification. Despite many improvements in the management of patients with adrenal insufficiency, adrenal crisis continues to occur and represents a major source of morbidity, mortality and distress for patients. Improved patient and clinician education and measures to facilitate parenteral hydrocortisone self-administration in impending crisis are central to the management of this life-threatening event.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — testing indications and urgent management are summarized as follows: We recommend diagnostic testing to exclude primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) in acutely ill patients with otherwise unexplained symptoms or signs suggestive of PAI. We recommend confirmatory testing with the corticotropin stimulation test in patients with clinical symptoms or signs suggesting PAI when the patient's condition and circumstance allow. In patients with severe adrenal insufficiency symptoms or adrenal crisis, we recommend immediate therapy with iv hydrocortisone at an appropriate stress dose prior to the availability of the results of diagnostic tests. We suggest that the etiology of PAI should be determined in all patients with confirmed disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113wyTJH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — stress dosing and emergency glucocorticoid administration is guided as follows: For the prevention of adrenal crisis, we suggest adjusting glucocorticoid dose according to severity of illness or magnitude of the stressor. During febrile illness, the glucocorticoid dose is typically taken orally at double or triple the usual daily dose, until recovery, usually of 2- to 3-day duration. If oral intake is not possible, early parenteral (intravenous [iv], intramuscular [im], or subcutaneous [sc]) injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone is indicated, and mineralocorticoid replacement is not required if the hydrocortisone dose exceeds 50 mg/24 hours. In a randomized crossover study, sc and im hydrocortisone had similar pharmacokinetics, but sc required two single injections (vs one im injection) and had slower time to reach a cortisol level > 1000 nmol/L (> 36 μg/dL), (22 vs 11 min). Alternative routes have been reported: rectal suppositories (prednisolone 100 mg) or enemas (prednisolone 20 mg/100 mL or hydrocortisone acetate enema 10%) have been successfully used but should not be used with diarrhea and are not widely available (eg, not available in the United States).

Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome — this table contrasts overlapping presentations: glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome includes general malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, and mood change, with signs such as Cushingoid features common, especially earlier in the glucocorticoid taper; adrenal insufficiency shows signs including weight loss, hypotension, and orthostasis, and the risk of adrenal crisis is present if not optimally treated with glucocorticoid therapy; timing differs, with withdrawal symptoms occurring at any point during glucocorticoid taper and with higher risk after long-term supraphysiologic exposure, whereas adrenal insufficiency appears only when not treated with optimal glucocorticoid therapy; biochemistry in withdrawal shows normal electrolytes with possible glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, while adrenal insufficiency shows hyponatremia and hypoglycemia; HPA axis testing is not recommended in withdrawal, and in adrenal insufficiency there are initially low ACTH and cortisol with later normal-elevated ACTH and low cortisol; general remarks note that patients may be asymptomatic at baseline but can develop symptoms — from mild to life-threatening adrenal crisis — after triggers, and recurrence of underlying autoimmune diseases can occur during tapering, with symptom overlap between adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

Epidemiology of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency summarizes risk and clinical consequences across settings. A meta-analysis reported pooled risks by route: 4.2% (95% CI 0.5–28.9) for nasal administration, 48.7% (95% CI 36.9–60.6) for oral use, and 52.2% (95% CI 40.5–63.6) for intra-articular administration. In asthma cohorts, risk increased with higher dose from low dose 2.4% to high dose 21.5% and with longer duration from 1.4% (< 28 days) to 47.2% (> 1 year). Population exposure context noted that an estimated minimum of 1% of adults in the United States and United Kingdom use oral glucocorticoids at any time. Symptom data were limited: seven of 74 studies assessed symptoms in 551 patients; among 98 with biochemical adrenal insufficiency, 10 (10%) reported symptoms and 88 (90%) did not. A Danish self-controlled case series of 286 680 persons discontinuing prolonged (≥ 3 months) oral glucocorticoids found increased incidence rate ratios after cessation: 2.5 (95% CI 1.4–4.3) for hypotension, 1.7 (95% CI 1.6–1.9) for gastrointestinal symptoms, 2.2 (95% CI 0.7–7.3) for hypoglycemia, and 1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.0) for hyponatraemia. A United States survey reported a median of 0 (IQR 0–0.33) adrenal crises per person-year in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency compared with 0.07 (IQR 0–0.25) in primary and 0 (IQR 0–0.14) in secondary adrenal insufficiency.

### Molecular basis of adrenal insufficiency [^113CEH5a]. Pediatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Defective production of adrenal steroids due to either primary adrenal failure or hypothalamic-pituitary impairment of the corticotrophic axis causes adrenal insufficiency. Depending on the etiologies of adrenal insufficiency, clinical manifestations may be severe or mild, have gradual or sudden onset, begin in infancy or childhood/adolescence. Adrenal crisis represents an endocrine emergency, and thus the rapid recognition and prompt therapy for adrenal crisis are critical for survival even before the diagnosis is made. The recognition of various disorders that cause adrenal insufficiency, either at a clinical or molecular level, often has implications for the management of the patient. Recent molecular-genetic analysis for the disorder that causes adrenal insufficiency gives valuable insights into the adrenal organogenesis, the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis, and the developmental and reproductive endocrinology. In this review we present the latest information on the molecular basis of adrenal insufficiency, with special emphasis on congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, P450-oxidoreductase deficiency, and adrenal hypoplasia congenita.

Background

Adrenal insufficiency and its deceiving appearance were originally described by Addison. Addison's compelling characterisation still persists; the discolouration of the skin, faintness, loss of appetite and extreme debility that the 'body wastes' and that 'the patient at length gradually sinks and expires' (figure 1). Nevertheless, over one and a half century later, we still struggle to recognise the clinical presentation and still fear the potentially fatal nature.

### Understanding adrenal crisis [^112JeD4V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Incidence and mortality

Approximately 5–17 cases of adrenal crisis (AC) occur per 100 patient years in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI). The mortality rate is estimated to be between 0.5% and 2%. Norwegian data indicate that overall, 1 in 7 patients with Addison's disease eventually dies from AC. It is estimated that AC will account for 5500–10,600 excess deaths in the European Union in the next decade. Often, these are preventable deaths in relatively young patients in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU) occurring from cardiorespiratory arrest in hypovolemic shock after delayed or insufficient steroid replacement, contributing to the excess mortality in patients at risk.

Adequate treatment of AC using stress-dose intravenous steroids is often delayed, even when AI is known and patients present their emergency card to EDs or retrieval services (European Steroid Emergency Card).

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review [^111cmN7E]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Adrenal insufficiency is a syndrome of cortisol deficiency and is categorized as primary, secondary, or glucocorticoid induced. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, affecting less than 279 per 1 million individuals, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is common.

Observations

Primary adrenal insufficiency, which involves deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones, is caused by autoimmune destruction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pharmacological inhibition (eg, high doses of azole antifungal therapy), infection (eg, tuberculosis, fungal infections), or surgical removal of adrenal cortical tissue. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disorders affecting the pituitary gland, such as tumors, hemorrhage, inflammatory or infiltrative conditions (eg, hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), surgery, radiation therapy, or medications that suppress corticotropin production, such as opioids. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue (50%-95%), nausea and vomiting (20%-62%), and anorexia and weight loss (43%-73%). Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning (approximately 8 am) measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is typically characterized by low morning cortisol levels (< 5 µg/dL), high corticotropin levels, and low DHEAS levels. Patients with secondary and glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency typically have low or intermediate morning cortisol levels (5–10 µg/dL) and low or low-normal corticotropin and DHEAS levels. Patients with intermediate early-morning cortisol levels should undergo repeat early-morning cortisol testing or corticotropin stimulation testing (measurement of cortisol before and 60 minutes after administration of cosyntropin, 250 µg). Treatment of adrenal insufficiency involves supplemental glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 15–25 mg daily, or prednisone, 3–5 mg daily). Mineralocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone, 0.05–0.3 mg daily) should be added for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal crisis, a syndrome that can cause hypotension and shock, hyponatremia, altered mental status, and death if untreated, can occur in patients with adrenal insufficiency who have inadequate glucocorticoid therapy, acute illness, and physical stress. Therefore, all patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed how to increase glucocorticoids during acute illness and prescribed injectable glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 100 mg intramuscular injection) to prevent or treat adrenal crisis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is a common condition. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency involves early-morning measurement of cortisol, corticotropin, and DHEAS. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with glucocorticoids and instructed how to prevent and treat adrenal crisis.

Adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis

Primary AI occurs due to pathologies of the adrenal glands (such as autoimmune Addison's disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)) and is usually associated with both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency. Hyperpigmentation from ACTH excess may occur in primary AI. Secondary AI is due to pathologies of the pituitary gland where a lack of ACTH leads to cortisol deficiency (eg, hypopituitarism). Suppression of ACTH leading to AI may also result from exogenous high dose glucocorticoid use. Symptoms of AI may initially be non-specific and include growth faltering, lethargy, poor feeding, abdominal pain, vomiting and weight loss. Infants may develop hypoglycaemia irrespective of the cause of AI. A recent review provides a comprehensive summary of causes of AI in children and adults.

An acute AC is a life-threatening deterioration due to glucocorticoid insufficiency which may result in cardiovascular instability, abnormalities of plasma electrolytes and seizures. The features are not attributable to any other illness and show significant improvement following parenteral glucocorticoids. Most estimates of AC are derived from adult populations where approximately 1 in 12 individuals with AI will experience a life-threatening AC within the next year, of who 1 in 200 will die from an AC. In children, the literature is limited but the main risk factors for AC are younger age at diagnosis, primary AI, requirement for mineralocorticoid treatment and recurrent hospital admissions. Children presenting with diarrhoea and vomiting are at particular risk of AC, which may be refractory to standard oral stress dosing, due to lack of absorption of glucocorticoid treatment. Other risk factors include new onset seizures, trauma and fractures.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — additional monitoring requirements suggests routine specialty follow-up and education. Adults and children should be seen by an endocrinologist or a healthcare provider with endocrine expertise at least annually, and infants at least every 3 to 4 months (Ungraded best practice statement). Patients should be evaluated annually for symptoms and signs of over- and under-replacement (Ungraded best practice statement). Periodic screening for autoimmune diseases known to be more prevalent in PAI is suggested when autoimmune origin has not been excluded, with the optimal frequency unknown but noted that screening can be done annually; conditions listed include thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, premature ovarian failure, celiac disease, and autoimmune gastritis with vitamin B12 deficiency (2|⊕⊕○○). Education is suggested about increasing glucocorticoid dosage during intercurrent illness, fever, and stress, including recognizing precipitating symptoms and signs and how to act in impending adrenal crisis (Ungraded best practice statement). Genetic counseling is suggested for patients with PAI due to monogenic disorders (Ungraded best practice statement).

Hallmark clinical features are unintentional weight loss, anorexia, postural hypotension, profound fatigue, muscle and abdominal pain, and hyponatraemia. Additionally, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency usually develop skin hyperpigmentation and crave salt. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is usually delayed because the initial presentation is often non-specific; physician awareness must be improved to avoid adrenal crisis. Despite state-of-the-art steroid replacement therapy, reduced quality of life and work capacity, and increased mortality is reported in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Active and repeated patient education on managing adrenal insufficiency, including advice on how to increase medication during intercurrent illness, medical or dental procedures, and profound stress, is required to prevent adrenal crisis, which occurs in about 50% of patients with adrenal insufficiency after diagnosis. It is good practice for physicians to provide patients with a steroid card, parenteral hydrocortisone, and training for parenteral hydrocortisone administration, in case of vomiting or severe illness. New modes of glucocorticoid delivery could improve the quality of life in some patients with adrenal insufficiency, and further advances in oral and parenteral therapy will probably emerge in the next few years.

Additional monitoring requirement — primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI): We suggest that adults and children with PAI be seen by an endocrinologist or a healthcare provider with endocrine expertise at least annually, and infants should be seen at least every 3 to 4 months; we suggest that PAI patients be evaluated annually for symptoms and signs of over- and under-replacement; and we suggest periodic screening for autoimmune diseases known to be more prevalent in PAI patients in whom autoimmune origin of PAI has not been excluded, noting that the optimal frequency of screening is unknown.

Summary of Methods Used for Guideline Development

The methods used for establishing the guideline have been described in detail previously. In short, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as a methodological basis. The first step was to define the clinical questions (see below) followed by systematic literature searches. We estimated an average effect for specific outcomes where possible and rated the quality of the evidence behind the recommendations as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), or strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Not all recommendations were formally graded (see below).

Considered for the recommendations were the quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and individual values and preferences (patient preferences, goals for health, costs, management inconvenience, feasibility of implementation). The recommendations are worded as "recommend" (strong recommendation) or "suggest" (weak recommendation). The meaning of a strong recommendation is that all reasonably informed persons (clinicians, policy makers and patients) would want the management in accordance with the recommendation, while for a weak recommendation, most persons would still act in accordance with the guideline, but a substantial number would not. Formal evidence syntheses were performed and graded only for recommendations addressing our initial clinical questions (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints" section). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded, but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all. Consensus was reached upon discussion; minority positions were considered in the rationale behind recommendations.

Review Process

A draft of the guideline was reviewed by four experts in the field (see "Acknowledgments" section) and was distributed to all ESE and ES members for commenting. All comments and suggestions were then discussed and implemented as thought appropriate by the guideline working group (Supplementary Table S9; see section on Supplementary Material).

Introduction

At least 1% of the population use chronic glucocorticoid therapy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Virtually every discipline of medicine applies glucocorticoids via multiple modes of administration (including oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, topical, and intravenous), and frequently for prolonged duration. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is an inevitable effect of chronic exogenous glucocorticoid therapy and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency necessitates careful education and management, and in the rare cases of adrenal crisis, prompt diagnosis and therapy. Considering the widespread use of glucocorticoids and the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, the present clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid the endocrinology specialists, as well as general practitioners and other specialists involved in the care of these patients.

Evidence regarding the incidence of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is limited (see introduction). Some data suggest that the risk is low considering the relatively small number of hospital admissions for adrenal crisis recorded in patients on long-term glucocorticoids. The preserved aldosterone production and some residual cortisol production in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency may explain these observations. One study found a higher incidence of adrenal crisis — precipitated by infections in about half of cases — in patients with established glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency compared to other causes of adrenal insufficiency, but this was not observed in other studies.

A significant proportion of patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency may be undiagnosed; as such, adrenal insufficiency symptoms and adrenal crisis can be missed. A population-based study found an increased incidence of potential manifestations of untreated adrenal insufficiency (hypotension, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia) after discontinuation of long-term oral glucocorticoids. Individuals exposed to infections — common triggers of adrenal insufficiency symptoms — and older individuals taking higher glucocorticoid doses for longer periods prior to discontinuation carried a higher risk of developing these manifestations. Another study found a sharp mortality increase in the first 3–6 months after cessation of long-term oral glucocorticoids. Whilst it is not possible to establish how many deaths were due to unrecognized adrenal crisis, these data highlight the need for close clinical monitoring of patients coming off long-term glucocorticoid therapy.

Adrenal crisis prevention is one of the main goals of the management of any patient with adrenal insufficiency and is achieved through regular patient education about its signs and symptoms, possible precipitating factors (see recommendations 1.2 and 1.3, Table 9), when and how to increase glucocorticoid dose (sick day rules), and the provision of patient-held prompts to healthcare professionals should they become seriously ill or unconscious (eg, ESE steroid emergency card:). When compared to other adrenal insufficiency etiologies, patients with an established diagnosis of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency were found to be less aware of their diagnosis, to engage less with preventative strategies (possession of emergency injectable hydrocortisone, wearing medical alert gear), experienced considerably more delays during emergency treatment for adrenal crises, and generally had more difficulty in managing their condition with poorer self-perceived health. These observations highlight the need for prevention strategies and education of patients and healthcare professionals alike.

Adrenal crisis prevention and stress dosing with current or recent glucocorticoid use — we recommend that patients who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when exposed to stress, with oral glucocorticoids used for minor stress without hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting/diarrhea and parenteral glucocorticoids for moderate to major stress, anesthesia, prolonged avoidance/inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting/diarrhea. Such patients under minor stress or local anesthesia will require coverage with stress doses of oral glucocorticoids, and the recommended stress dose is double the physiologic replacement dose (ie, hydrocortisone 40 mg daily).
