## Question

69 yr female: eGFR 75

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an eGFR of 75 mL/min/1.73 m² in a 69-year-old woman, including whether this value indicates chronic kidney disease, what stage it might correspond to, and what monitoring or actions are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the KDIGO diagnostic criteria for CKD and how age affects interpretation. Then, I should verify the GFR-based staging categories and where 75 falls. Next, I will consider age-related physiology and the risk of overdiagnosis in older adults. After that, I need to check for markers of kidney damage, especially albuminuria, to determine if CKD is present despite a "normal" eGFR. Finally, I will outline practical next steps, monitoring intervals, and when to consider confirmatory testing or referral, making sure I align with current guidelines and risk tools.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic threshold for CKD. By KDIGO, CKD is defined as either eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² sustained for at least 3 months or the presence of kidney damage such as albuminuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging, regardless of eGFR, again persisting beyond 3 months, so a single eGFR value cannot establish CKD on its own [^117NcKTA].

> Wait, let me verify the staging framework so I don't misclassify this patient. KDIGO 2024 retains the GFR categories: G1 is ≥ 90, G2 is 60–89, G3a is 45–59, G3b is 30–44, G4 is 15–29, and G5 is < 15 mL/min/1.73 m², and these categories are combined with albuminuria to stratify risk, so an eGFR of 75 sits squarely in the G2 "mildly decreased" range if confirmed on repeat testing [^114KtcHN] [^111iavoL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "disease" just because the number is below 90. I need to consider age-related physiology. GFR declines by roughly 0.5–1.0 mL/min/1.73 m² per year after age 30, so an eGFR of 75 at age 69 can be physiologic rather than pathologic, and using a fixed < 60 threshold in older adults risks overdiagnosis. Age-adapted thresholds and careful confirmation of chronicity mitigate this problem [^1158msPy] [^1131gsUb] [^116tRdTE].

> I should confirm whether there is kidney damage because CKD can exist even with eGFR ≥ 60 if albuminuria or other markers are present. Let me check the albumin-to-creatinine ratio on a spot urine. If ACR is ≥ 30 mg/g on at least two of three tests over 3 months, that meets a marker of kidney damage and would establish CKD even with eGFR 75, whereas ACR < 30 mg/g with stable eGFR ≥ 60 would not meet CKD criteria by damage alone [^117NcKTA] [^115kXe8a] [^112cYWvN].

> Next, I should review how to confirm chronicity and stability. I need to ensure the eGFR of 75 is not transient by repeating creatinine in about 3 months. If eGFR remains ≥ 60 and there is no albuminuria, CKD is not diagnosed, and I should continue routine monitoring rather than label this as disease, given the risk of overdiagnosis in older adults with isolated, mild eGFR reductions [^117NcKTA] [^1131gsUb] [^116tRdTE].

> Let me think about risk stratification if CKD is ultimately confirmed. KDIGO uses a "heat map" combining GFR and albuminuria categories to estimate progression risk. For example, G2 with A1 (normal to mildly increased albuminuria) carries low risk, whereas G2 with A2–A3 has higher risk, and this informs the intensity of follow-up and preventive therapy, so I should double-check the albuminuria category before assigning risk [^114KtcHN] [^111iavoL].

> I will now examine whether confirmatory testing is warranted. If the eGFR were < 60 or if there is diagnostic uncertainty, adding cystatin C and using a combined creatinine–cystatin C equation improves accuracy; however, at eGFR 75 with no albuminuria, that step is not routinely required, though it can be considered if clinical decisions hinge on precise GFR or if creatinine-based estimates are suspected to be misleading [^114Li3Qz] [^111JFmQK] [^112Aq1Tb].

> Next, I should review practical management and monitoring. If CKD is not diagnosed, I should treat cardiovascular risk factors per general adult preventive care and recheck kidney function annually or sooner if clinical status changes. If CKD is diagnosed by albuminuria or if eGFR later falls below 60, I should follow guideline-based CKD care including blood pressure targets, glucose control if diabetic, medication dose adjustments, and vaccination updates, and I should monitor eGFR and ACR at least annually, increasing frequency with higher risk or lower eGFR [^111vd3mt] [^114Cgs1r] [^111XL8Yu].

> But wait, what if the patient has diabetes or hypertension. I should confirm that patients with diabetes have ACR and eGFR checked 1–4 times yearly depending on CKD stage, and that those with hypertension or CVD also undergo periodic CKD screening, because early detection changes management and outcomes even when eGFR is modestly reduced [^111XL8Yu] [^114MUoHU] [^113cvcXB].

> I need to ensure I am not missing a need for nephrology referral. Referral is generally indicated for eGFR < 30, rapidly declining kidney function, or refractory albuminuria, so with eGFR 75 and no albuminuria, referral is not indicated unless there are atypical features or suspected rare kidney disease; I should double-check for red flags like hematuria with proteinuria, systemic features, or family history before escalating care [^116q89xW] [^111vd3mt].

> In summary, an eGFR of 75 mL/min/1.73 m² in a 69-year-old woman most likely represents a physiologic, age-related decline rather than CKD, provided there is no albuminuria or other marker of kidney damage and the value is stable over time. I should confirm chronicity with repeat testing, check a urine ACR, and if both eGFR remains ≥ 60 and ACR is normal, avoid labeling her as having CKD and continue routine monitoring and cardiovascular risk management [^117NcKTA] [^1131gsUb] [^111vd3mt].

A 69-year-old woman with an eGFR of 75 mL/min/1.73 m² has **mildly reduced kidney function** consistent with CKD stage G2, which is common with aging and often reflects a **physiologic decline** [^1131gsUb]. This level alone does not indicate kidney disease unless there is **albuminuria or structural damage** [^117NcKTA] [^111kypbT]. Management should focus on **annual monitoring** of eGFR and albuminuria, optimizing blood pressure and glycemic control, and reviewing medications for renal dosing; nephrology referral is not indicated unless there is rapid progression, albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g, or other concerning features [^114Cgs1r] [^116q89xW].

---

## Clinical significance of eGFR 75 mL/min/1.73 m² in a 69-year-old woman

- **Normal aging**: GFR declines ~0.5–1.0 mL/min/1.73 m² per year after age 30; an eGFR of 75 at 69 is often physiologic [^1158msPy].
- **CKD staging**: eGFR 60–89 with no albuminuria is CKD G2, indicating mildly reduced function [^114KtcHN].
- **Risk context**: Mortality and ESRD risks rise as eGFR falls below 60; at 75, relative risks are modest and modulated by albuminuria and comorbidities [^114ALJug].

## Factors influencing eGFR in elderly women

Several factors influence **eGFR in elderly women**, including:

| **Factor** | **Impact on eGFR** |
|-|-|
| Age | Physiologic decline (~0.5–1.0 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) [^notfound] |
| Sex | Lower muscle mass can lower creatinine and affect eGFR estimates [^117Hm447] |
| Comorbidities | Hypertension, diabetes, and CVD reduce eGFR [^notfound] |
| Medications | NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics can alter eGFR [^115FPwCr] |
| Hydration status | Dehydration elevates creatinine and lowers eGFR |

---

## Clinical implications and risks associated with eGFR 75 mL/min/1.73 m²

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Lower eGFR associates with higher CVD risk, but at 75 the absolute risk increase is modest [^1171wmis].
- **Progression risk**: Without albuminuria, progression to advanced CKD is low; albuminuria is the strongest predictor of progression [^111USAJq].
- **Medication dosing**: Some drugs require dose adjustment below 60; at 75, most agents are safe, but monitor for nephrotoxicity [^notfound].

---

## Recommended clinical actions and monitoring strategies

- **Confirm CKD**: Repeat eGFR in 3–6 months and check albuminuria to confirm chronicity and stage [^1166eoYH] [^1114aWnu].
- **Annual monitoring**: Track eGFR and albuminuria; more frequent if rapid decline or high albuminuria [^notfound].
- **Risk factor control**: Optimize BP, glycemia, and lifestyle; use ACEi/ARB if hypertension or albuminuria is present [^notfound].
- **Medication review**: Avoid nephrotoxins and adjust renally cleared drugs as needed [^111vd3mt].
- **Patient education**: Teach symptom recognition and lifestyle measures to preserve kidney function [^notfound].

---

## Indications for nephrology referral

Nephrology referral is indicated for **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, **rapid eGFR decline > 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year**, or **albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g** [^114W85y1]. Referral is also appropriate when there is **uncertain diagnosis or atypical features** or when the patient is preparing for dialysis or transplant [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and life expectancy

Prognosis at **eGFR 75** is generally favorable; mortality risk is modestly higher than those with eGFR ≥ 90, especially with comorbidities or albuminuria [^114ALJug]. Life expectancy remains near-normal for many women at this level, though comorbidities and albuminuria can modify risk [^115Vmc15].

---

An eGFR of 75 mL/min/1.73 m² in a 69-year-old woman reflects **mildly reduced kidney function** — often age-related — and warrants **annual monitoring** with attention to blood pressure, glycemic control, and medications; nephrology referral is not needed unless albuminuria is high or the eGFR declines rapidly [^114KtcHN] [^111vd3mt].

### Association of age with risk of kidney failure in adults with stage IV chronic kidney disease in Canada [^114fx2nC]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

With population aging, the burden of many age-related chronic conditions, including kidney failure, is increasing globally.

Objective

To investigate the risks of kidney failure and death in adults with incident stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study obtained data recorded between July 30, 2002, and March 31, 2014, from the linked laboratory and administrative data set of Alberta Health in Alberta, Canada. All adults of the province of Alberta with stage IV CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 15–30 mL/min/1.73 m2) were eligible for inclusion. Included individuals were followed up from study entry until the date of kidney failure, death, or censoring, whichever occurred first. Observations were censored at the date of emigration from the province, the study end date (March 31, 2017), or at 10 years after study entry. Data analyses were performed from January 2020 to June 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was kidney failure, defined as the earlier of either renal replacement (dialysis or kidney transplant) initiation or severe kidney impairment (eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2). Incidence of stage IV CKD in Alberta was examined over time, along with the association between age at study entry and the competing risks of kidney failure and death. Cumulative incidence functions (95% CIs) were estimated to summarize absolute risks over time across categories of age, accounting for sex, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, eGFR, and albuminuria.

Results

The study included 30 801 adults (mean [SD] age, 76.8 [13.3] years; 17 294 women [56.1%]) with stage IV CKD. Of these, 5511 developed kidney failure (17.9%) and 16 285 died (52.9%). The incidence rate of stage IV CKD increased sharply with advancing age; the absolute risk of kidney failure decreased with advancing age, and the risk of death increased, especially in those aged 85 years or older. Compared with the 5-year risk of death, the 5-year risk of kidney failure was higher in people younger than 65 years, similar in people aged 65 to 74 years, and lower for older age groups. For those aged 75 years or older, the risk of death was much higher than the risk of kidney failure: 6-fold higher among those aged 75 to 84 years (0.51 [95% CI, 0.5–0.52] vs 0.09 [95% CI, 0.08–0.09]) and 25-fold higher among those aged 85 years or older (0.75 [95% CI, 0.74–0.76] vs 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02–0.03]). The risk of death was higher than the risk of kidney failure by 24-fold among those aged 85 to 94 years (0.73 [95% CI, 0.72–0.74] vs 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02–0.03]) and by 149-fold among those aged 95 years or older (0.89 [95% CI, 0.87–0.92] vs < 0.01 [95% CI, < 0.01 to 0.01]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that, although the incidence rate of stage IV CKD increased with advancing age, the absolute risk of kidney failure decreased. Unlike other age-related conditions, the expected increase in the burden of kidney failure in the older adults may be less dramatic than expected.

SCREENING: TARGETED TO HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS?

Current guideline recommendations for chronic kidney disease screening

One approach for CKD screening would be to screen in high-risk populations. This is also regarded as targeted screening, in which screening is performed in populations with common CKD risk factors that are essentially at high risk for CKD progression. For some years, national and international guidelines have recommended CKD screening (i.e. assessment of eGFR and albuminuria) for individuals with individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and CVD, which can be considered opportunistic screening. It is generally accepted that CKD screening in these high-risk groups is likely to be cost-effective. Additionally, as concluded by the KDIGO Controversies Conference on Early Detection and Intervention in CKD in 2021, screening should be performed in individuals with other risk factors, such as older age, systemic diseases, genetic risk factors, lower socioeconomic status, and high-risk occupational and environmental exposure. The KDIGO 2024 guideline has adopted this recommendation and provides a screening algorithm for the diagnosis and staging of CKD in adults at risk for CKD, giving the highest priority for CKD screening to individuals with hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. Screening is advised to be performed annually, but this advice is an expert-based opinion. Whether annual screening is the most appropriate and cost-effective time interval needs additional study.

### Kidney disease in the elderly: update on recent literature [^115ty4Bm]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review recent literature on the epidemiology and outcomes of chronic kidney disease in the elderly and discuss implications for management.

Recent Findings

Chronic kidney disease is common in the elderly and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The prognostic significance of a given level of estimated glomerular filtration rate, however, varies substantially by age. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease at the population level and estimates glomerular filtration rate at the individual level are exquisitely sensitive to the methods used to arrive at these estimates. At present there is no clear consensus on the optimal approach to estimating glomerular filtration rate in elderly individuals in the clinical setting. Available evidence to guide management of chronic kidney disease is based largely on trials in younger individuals. It is unclear to what extent the results of these trials can be extrapolated to older individuals with chronic kidney disease.

Summary

We advise caution in applying current guidelines to the care of the large number of individuals aged 70 years and older with chronic kidney disease. Ideally, the care of these patients should be individualized and carefully integrated with the management of other comorbid conditions and with patient preferences.

CKD IN MEN AND WOMEN

Although it is becoming increasingly clear that CKD is more common among women than men, at least in part to their longer life expectancy, there still appear to be major differences in terms of detection, monitoring, referral and therapy-related adverse event rates. In a North European study, women with newly detected CKD were less likely to be monitored for their kidney function, receive a clinical diagnosis, be referred to nephrologist care or initiate antiproteinuric treatment compared with equal men. Such differences are worrisome and should be further investigated (and if present corrected) in other countries.

Non-fatal estimation

We defined prevalent CKD as an abnormality of kidney function, indicated by low eGFR based on serum creatinine measurement, elevated ACR, or both. We modelled six categories of prevalent CKD, defined by level of eGFR and ACR or renal replacement therapy. The categories defined in GBD are CKD stages 1–2, stage 3, stage 4, and stage 5, ESKD on maintenance dialysis, and kidney transplantation. The GBD definition of CKD differs from that presented in the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guidelines, because the GBD definition uses only one measurement of eGFR and ACR and, thus, does not formally fit the KDIGO duration requirement of abnormalities for more than 3 months. The GBD definition also does not take into account markers of kidney damage other than ACR, since these are often not reported in epidemiological studies used to estimate disease occurrence. The criteria used to define CKD categories in GBD, and how these entities correspond with KDIGO guidelines, are presented in table 1.

Table 1
CKD staging definitions in the GBD study and correspondence with KDIGO categories

Building on past data collection efforts for GBD, we updated the systematic review of the literature for cross-sectional or cohort studies reporting population-representative prevalence of each stage of CKD based on serum creatinine measurements or eGFR and ACR values. New data for dialysis and transplantation were largely obtained from national registries for ESKD. We included 216 unique data sources for the prevalence of CKD stages 1–2, stage 3, stage 4, and stage 5 and 193 sources of data for incidence and prevalence of renal replacement therapy. A full list of sources used in the CKD non-fatal estimation process is available through the.

We modelled each stage of CKD separately in DisMod-MR 2.1, which is a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression tool developed specifically for GBD by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (Seattle, WA, USA). DisMod uses input data for several epidemiological parameters, including prevalence, incidence, remission rate, and excess mortality rate, to make consistent estimates of each parameter. We also ran a DisMod-MR 2.1 model for the prevalence of CKD stages 3–5 combined and scaled estimates for the prevalence of CKD stage 3, stage 4, and stage 5 to sum to the prevalence of stages 3–5 combined for each country–year–age–sex group.

### Age affects outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^1117s4hu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common among the elderly. However, little is known about how the clinical implications of CKD vary with age. We examined the age-specific incidence of death, treated end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among 209,622 US veterans with CKD stages 3 to 5 followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Patients aged 75 years or older at baseline comprised 47% of the overall cohort and accounted for 28% of the 9227 cases of ESRD that occurred during follow-up. Among patients of all ages, rates of both death and ESRD were inversely related to eGFR at baseline. However, among those with comparable levels of eGFR, older patients had higher rates of death and lower rates of ESRD than younger patients. Consequently, the level of eGFR below which the risk of ESRD exceeded the risk of death varied by age, ranging from 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) for 18 to 44 year old patients to 15 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) for 65 to 84 year old patients. Among those 85 years or older, the risk of death always exceeded the risk of ESRD in this cohort. Among patients with eGFR levels < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at baseline, older patients were less likely than their younger counterparts to experience an annual decline in eGFR of > 3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). In conclusion, age is a major effect modifier among patients with an eGFR of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), challenging us to move beyond a uniform stage-based approach to managing CKD.

### The prevalence of chronic kidney disease in Iceland according to KDIGO criteria and age-adapted estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds [^116tRdTE]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Most epidemiological studies on chronic kidney disease (CKD) are based solely on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Few studies have included proteinuria, while the chronicity criterion is usually omitted. To explore this, we examined the prevalence of CKD stages 1–5 in Iceland based on multiple markers of kidney damage. All serum creatinine values, urine protein measurements and diagnostic codes for kidney diseases and comorbid conditions for people aged 18 years and older were obtained from electronic medical records of all healthcare institutions in Iceland in 2008–2016. CKD was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline using diagnoses indicative of a chronic kidney disease, proteinuria and/or an eGFR under 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for over three months. Mean annual age-standardized prevalence of CKD stages 1–5 was calculated based on the KDIGO criteria and age-adapted eGFR thresholds from 2,120,147 creatinine values for 218,437 individuals, 306,531 proteinuria measurements for 86,364 individuals and 6973 individuals carrying a kidney disease diagnosis. Median age was 63 years (range, 18–106) and 47% were male. The mean annual age standardized CKD prevalence was 5.13% for men and 6.75% for women using the KDIGO criteria but by age-adapted eGFR cut-offs, the prevalence was 3.27% for men and 4.01% for women. Thus, our nationwide study, defining CKD in Iceland with strict adherence to the KDIGO criteria, demonstrates a lower prevalence of CKD than anticipated from most previous studies.

### Presence of early CKD-related metabolic complications predict progression of stage 3 CKD: a case-controlled study [^113zKNge]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

During the last decade the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased considerably and is estimated to range from about 10–15% of the elderly population. Only a portion of patients with early stage 3 CKD progress to stage 4 where the risk of cardiovascular disease, end stage renal disease (ESRD), or death becomes substantially higher. Identifying the subset of patients who enter stage 3 and are most likely to progress to stage 4 CKD could both improve outcomes, by allowing more appropriate referrals for specialist care, as well as spare those unlikely to progress the adverse effects and costliness of an unnecessarily aggressive approach. This issue is particularly important in the geriatric population in whom it is unclear whether a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the stage 3 range is associated with the poor outcomes of renal disease and in whom advancing age is associated with slower progression of kidney disease.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, patients at risk, DoD/VA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining testing for CKD (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and eGFR) in patients with ≥ 1 of the following associated risk factors:

- age ≥ 60 years

- diabetes

- hypertension

- CVD, including HF.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117NcKTA]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.

### How to interpret an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 2020? [^111kypbT]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure and function proven to be chronic. The prevalence of CKD in the majority of studies is 10%-16%, neglecting the chronicity character. Jonsson et al., in a nationwide study defining CKD adhering strictly to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, found a clearly lower prevalence of CKD (6%). This indicated that to obtain a correct CKD prevalence, one should start by correctly applying the KDIGO guidelines.

### Renal function decline in older men and women with advanced chronic kidney disease-results from the EQUAL study [^115e2PTr]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analyses

We performed a number of sensitivity analyses. First, in addition to the CKD-EPI equation, we also repeated the analyses using the full age spectrum equation and the revised Lund–Malmö equation to estimate GFR. Secondly, we studied the association between sex and GFR decline estimated from 24-h urine collection. Thirdly, as age is an important variable in all estimating GFRs, we also considered the relationship between sex and 1/creatinine over time. Lastly, due to the wide range in individual follow-up time, we also repeated the analyses in patients with at least 1 year of follow-up.

BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Progression of kidney disease

There is no consistent definition of what constitutes renal progression in the literature. Many studies have used a doubling of serum creatinine, corresponding to an approximate halving of GFR, as an end-point defining progression, but this is insufficiently sensitive to be useful in clinical practice. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) have defined progression as a move to a higher disease category (e.g. stage 3A [GFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2] to stage 3B [GFR30–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2]) confirmed by a fall in GFR of greater than or equal to 25%, an increase in albuminuria, a greater than 25% decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or a greater than 10%/year decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to less than 54 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in one year). NICE defined progression as a decline in GFR of more than 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year, or more than 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 averaged over 5 years.

Progression is not necessarily common even amongst people with known CKD e.g. amongst people with stage 3 CKD only 1.3% progressed to stage 5 CKD (established renal failure, typically requiring dialysis or transplantation) over 5 years. Amongst community dwelling older (greater than 65 years) adults with stage 3 CKD mean GFR declines of 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year have been reported respectively in male and female subjects with diabetes and somewhat lower values amongst subjects without diabetes (1.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year amongst males and females respectively). In the REIN study proteinuric (greater than 1 g/24 h) non-diabetic subjects with GFRs in the approximate range 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a decline of GFR of 7.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year with slightly lower values being observed in those receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade.

Outcomes — For the first key question, the critical outcome is point prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by risk factor and patient demographics/characteristics, and important outcomes include probability of decline in eGFR, incident/worsening of albuminuria, or kidney failure; incidence rates of CKD diagnosis; CKD stage at diagnosis; kidney failure (treatment by dialysis or kidney transplant); and CKD diagnosis rate at different predefined timepoints. For the second key question, critical outcomes are risk of CKD progression to ESKD and validated surrogate markers/predictors of CKD progression, and important outcomes are mortality and cardiovascular composite outcome (e.g. MACE).

RESULTS

Patient characteristics

Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of 1682 patients by sex. On average, patients were 76 years old at inclusion (IQR 71–81), two-thirds were men and the eGFR at baseline was 17.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (IQR 14.5–20.4). Women were older, had a slightly higher BMI, higher values of serum calcium, cholesterol and potassium, but lower levels of haemoglobin. Diabetes and glomerular disease accounted for a lower proportion of primary renal disease in women compared with men, whereas tubulo-interstitial disease and hypertension were more common in women. Women had higher baseline renal function and lower ACR. Regarding co-morbidity, more men had diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris.

Risk-based testing for chronic kidney disease (CKD) — recommendation and supporting data: We suggest testing for chronic kidney disease (i.e., urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients with one or more of the following associated risk factors: Age over 60 years, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended). In a general-population cohort in the Netherlands, testing those with diabetes, hypertension, and CVD history resulted in 16% of the population being tested and identified 36% of those with CKD; by adding those aged > 60 years, 29% of the population were tested and 59% of those with CKD were identified. In a U.S. cohort meeting eGFR criteria for stage G3 CKD using the TriNetX database, 81% had hypertension, 38% had type 2 diabetes, 18.7% had established CVD, 16.4% had heart failure, and 64.3% of patients with stage G3 CKD were undiagnosed.

### Accounting for age in the definition of chronic kidney disease [^1131gsUb]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Using the same level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to define chronic kidney disease (CKD) regardless of patient age may classify many elderly people with a normal physiological age-related eGFR decline as having a disease.

Objective

To compare the outcomes associated with CKD as defined by a fixed vs an age-adapted eGFR threshold.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study was conducted in Alberta, Canada and used linked administrative and laboratory data from adults with incident CKD from April 1, 2009, to March 31, 2017, defined by a sustained reduction in eGFR for longer than 3 months below a fixed or an age-adapted eGFR threshold. Non-CKD controls were defined as being 65 years or older with a sustained eGFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 for longer than 3 months and normal/mild albuminuria. The follow-up ended on March 31, 2019. The data were analyzed from February to April 2020.

Exposures

A fixed eGFR threshold of 60 vs thresholds of 75, 60, and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for age younger than 40, 40 to 64, and 65 years or older, respectively.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Competing risks of kidney failure (kidney replacement initiation or sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for > 3 months) and death without kidney failure.

Results

The fixed and age-adapted CKD cohorts included 127 132 (69 546 women [54.7%], 57 586 men [45.3%]) and 81 209 adults (44 582 women [54.9%], 36 627 men [45.1%]), respectively (537 vs 343 new cases per 100 000 person-years). The fixed-threshold cohort had lower risks of kidney failure (1.7% vs 3.0% at 5 years) and death (21.9% vs 25.4%) than the age-adapted cohort. A total of 53 906 adults were included in both cohorts. Of the individuals included in the fixed-threshold cohort only (n = 72 703), 54 342 (75%) were 65 years or older and had baseline eGFR of 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 with normal/mild albuminuria. The 5-year risks of kidney failure and death among these elderly people were similar to those of non-CKD controls, with a risk of kidney failure of 0.12% or less in both groups across all age categories and a risk of death at 69, 122, 279, and 935 times higher than the risk of kidney failure for 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, and 80 years or older, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study of adults with CKD suggests that the current criteria for CKD that use the same eGFR threshold for all ages may result in overestimation of the CKD burden in an aging population, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary interventions in many elderly people who have age-related loss of eGFR.

### Relative risks of chronic kidney disease for mortality and end-stage renal disease across races are similar [^113EFv3W]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Some suggest race-specific cutpoints for kidney measures to define and stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), but evidence for race-specific clinical impact is limited. To address this issue, we compared hazard ratios of estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) and albuminuria across races using meta-regression in 1.1 million adults (75% Asians, 21% Whites, and 4% Blacks) from 45 cohorts. Results came mainly from 25 general population cohorts comprising 0.9 million individuals. The associations of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria with mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were largely similar across races. For example, in Asians, Whites, and Blacks, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for eGFR 45–59 versus 90–104ml/min per 1.73m(2) were 1.3 (1.2–1.3), 1.1 (1.0–1.2), and 1.3 (1.1–1.7) for all-cause mortality, 1.6 (1.5–1.7), 1.4 (1.2–1.7), and 1.4 (0.7–2.9) for cardiovascular mortality, and 27.6 (11.1–68.7), 11.2 (6.0–20.9), and 4.1 (2.2–7.5) for ESRD, respectively. The corresponding hazard ratios for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30–299mg/g or dipstick 1+ versus an albumin-to-creatinine ratio under 10 or dipstick negative were 1.6 (1.4–1.8), 1.7 (1.5–1.9), and 1.8 (1.7–2.1) for all-cause mortality, 1.7 (1.4–2.0), 1.8 (1.5–2.1), and 2.8 (2.2–3.6) for cardiovascular mortality, and 7.4 (2.0–27.6), 4.0 (2.8–5.9), and 5.6 (3.4–9.2) for ESRD, respectively. Thus, the relative mortality or ESRD risks of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria were largely similar among three major races, supporting similar clinical approach to CKD definition and staging, across races.

### Age and association of kidney measures with mortality and end-stage renal disease [^114ALJug]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in older individuals, but the risk implications of low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and high albuminuria across the full age range are controversial.

Objective

To evaluate possible effect modification (interaction) by age of the association of eGFR and albuminuria with clinical risk, examining both relative and absolute risks.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Individual-level meta-analysis including 2,051,244 participants from 33 general population or high-risk (of vascular disease) cohorts and 13 CKD cohorts from Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North/South America, conducted in 1972–2011 with a mean follow-up time of 5.8 years (range, 0–31 years).

Main Outcome Measures

Hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) according to eGFR and albuminuria were meta-analyzed across age categories after adjusting for sex, race, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, and smoking. Absolute risks were estimated using HRs and average incidence rates.

Results

Mortality (112,325 deaths) and ESRD (8411 events) risks were higher at lower eGFR and higher albuminuria in every age category. In general and high-risk cohorts, relative mortality risk for reduced eGFR decreased with increasing age; eg, adjusted HRs at an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 were 3.50 (95% CI, 2.55–4.81), 2.21 (95% CI, 2.02–2.41), 1.59 (95% CI, 1.42–1.77), and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.23–1.48) in age categories 18–54, 55–64, 65–74, and ≥ 75 years, respectively (P < .05 for age interaction). Absolute risk differences for the same comparisons were higher at older age (9.0 [95% CI, 6.0–12.8], 12.2 [95% CI, 10.3–14.3], 13.3 [95% CI, 9.0–18.6], and 27.2 [95% CI, 13.5–45.5] excess deaths per 1000 person-years, respectively). For increased albuminuria, reduction of relative risk with increasing age was less evident, while differences in absolute risk were higher in older age categories (7.5 [95% CI, 4.3–11.9], 12.2 [95% CI, 7.9–17.6], 22.7 [95% CI, 15.3–31.6], and 34.3 [95% CI, 19.5–52.4] excess deaths per 1000 person-years, respectively by age category, at an albumin-creatinine ratio of 300 mg/g vs 10 mg/g). In CKD cohorts, adjusted relative hazards of mortality did not decrease with age. In all cohorts, ESRD relative risks and absolute risk differences at lower eGFR or higher albuminuria were comparable across age categories.

Conclusions

Both low eGFR and high albuminuria were independently associated with mortality and ESRD regardless of age across a wide range of populations. Mortality showed lower relative risk but higher absolute risk differences at older age.

### Referral criteria for chronic kidney disease: implications for disease management and healthcare expenditure-analysis of a population-based sample [^114B3r2Q]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a prevalence of approximately 9% in adults worldwide. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is used to grade kidney function in stages G1-G5. Due to age-dependent decline of kidney function, the prevalence of CKD stages 3–5 increases with age and reaches up to 45% in the age group 75–84 years. GFR and proteinuria can be used to grade the severity of CKD and monitor the decline of kidney function. The majority of CKD patients are older than 60 years with early stage CKD and are mainly consulting in primary care, where the prevalence is estimated to be nearly 30%. Only a few patients progress to ESRD (end stage renal disease) requiring dialysis. Referral to specialist care more than one to six months prior to initiation of dialysis was found to reduce mortality and hospitalisation, and improve preparation of dialysis.

Internationally, there are numerous clinical practice guidelines and recommendations on management of CKD, with varying referral criteria to specialist nephrology services, reflecting differences in health care systems. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO, 2012), the British guideline from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2014) guideline and the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (DEGAM, 2019) recommend referral from stage 4 (GFR < 30 ml/min) onwards. They also recommend referral with an GFR of 30–59 ml/min and varying additional criteria. The German Societies of Nephrology (DGfN) and Internal Medicine (DGIM) issued a short manual with recommendations in 2015 recommending referral with an eGFR < 45 ml/min. In 2021 the NICE guideline was updated and suggested the use of kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) to estimate the 5-year risk of needing renal replacement therapy. A risk of 5% is suggested as a threshold for referral.

Discussion

In this study with results generalizable to the US adult population, we had several key findings. First, 1.04 million US adults who do not meet laboratory-based criteria for CKD have a high risk (risk ≥ 5%) of CKD progression, and this risk is driven by factors other than eGFR or albuminuria. Second, 60% of US adults with CKD are classified as CKD on the basis of albuminuria alone (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). In this group, over 3.73 million (24%) have a high risk of CKD progression. Importantly, 1.51 million (41%) of them do not have diabetes and would not qualify for UACR testing according to current Merit-based Incentive Payment System Clinical Quality Measures quality metrics. Third, 55% of US adults with CKD belong to stage G3a-A1, and 94% of them have a low risk of CKD progression (risk < 5%). Even among the 1.40 million adults with stage G3b-A1, 69% had 3-year risk < 5%. These findings highlight the importance of considering the individual-level risk of progression in the definition and management of CKD, similar to how the risk of cardiovascular disease is considered in the treatment of hypertension.

At present, most patients with CKD are diagnosed and staged using guideline-recommended cutoffs of laboratory values, namely UACR and creatinine-derived eGFR, on the basis of expert consensus. An eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 is the threshold for diagnosing CKD unless albuminuria or structural disease is present, irrespective of eGFR. Prognostication of CKD relies heavily on eGFR and albuminuria stages. However, the risks of CKD progression and kidney failure attributed per CKD stage in the KDIGO heatmapare relative to those with eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and no albuminuria. A 65-year-old patient with an eGFR of 50 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and UACR of 15 mg/g is classified as stage G3a-A1 and deemed to have a four-fold higher risk of CKD progression and 22-fold higher risk of kidney failure compared with someone without CKD. For an individual categorized as stage 3a-A1, however, their range of possible CKD progression risk, 0.5%–12% in our study, is widely contingent on the presence of other risk factors, with different clinical management implications.

### Testing for chronic kidney disease: a position statement from the National Kidney Foundation [^1143hH3P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in the United States. The estimated prevalence of CKD in US adults was 11.7% ± 0.8% in 2000, based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Global estimates for CKD prevalence are less certain, but recent studies in Europe, Australia, and China suggest a high prevalence. The most common risk factors for CKD include diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, a family history of CKD, and age greater than 60 years. Major outcomes of CKD include progression to kidney failure, development of complications of impaired kidney function, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. CKD is usually silent until its late stages, thus many patients with CKD are detected only shortly before the onset of symptomatic kidney failure, when there are few opportunities to prevent adverse outcomes. Earlier detection allows for more time for evaluation and treatment but requires explicit testing strategies for asymptomatic individuals at increased risk. In the majority of patients, CKD can be detected with 2 simple tests: a urine test for the detection of proteinuria and a blood test to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These 2 tests facilitate detection of CKD by all physicians by allowing for identification of CKD without first requiring determination of its cause. Understanding the strengths and limitations of CKD testing is critical for appropriate implementation of these recommendations. Application of CKD testing in national and international screening and surveillance programs could improve public health related to CKD.

Baseline associations

The mean age of the 16 958 participants was 53 (range 33–81; SD 9) years, 51% were female, and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 79 (14) ml/min/1.73 m 2 (table 2). Six per cent (1016) of participants had an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60, 1.4% (241) had proteinuria, and 7% (1210) had chronic kidney disease at entry (65 had stage 1, 129 had stage 2, 939 had stage 3a, 65 had stage 3b, and 12 had stage 4). People with chronic kidney disease had higher mean levels of cardiovascular risk factors than did people without chronic kidney disease, except for smoking and male sex (table 2, web table B). During 383 553 person years at risk (median follow-up 24 (interquartile range 17–31) years), 4010 coronary heart disease outcomes, 559 deaths from stroke, 662 deaths from other vascular causes, and 3875 deaths from non-vascular causes were recorded.

### National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification [^111NhAoF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, poor outcomes, and high cost. Outcomes of chronic kidney disease include not only kidney failure but also complications of decreased kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that some of these adverse outcomes can be prevented or delayed by early detection and treatment. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part as a result of lack of agreement on a definition and classification of its stages of progression. Recent clinical practice guidelines by the National Kidney Foundation 1) define chronic kidney disease and classify its stages, regardless of underlying cause, 2) evaluate laboratory measurements for the clinical assessment of kidney disease, 3) associate the level of kidney function with complications of chronic kidney disease, and 4) stratify the risk for loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. The guidelines were developed by using an approach based on the procedure outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This paper presents the definition and five-stage classification system of chronic kidney disease and summarizes the major recommendations on early detection in adults. Recommendations include identifying persons at increased risk (those with diabetes, those with hypertension, those with a family history of chronic kidney disease, those older than 60 years of age, or those with U.S. racial or ethnic minority status), detecting kidney damage by measuring the albumin-creatinine ratio in untimed ("spot") urine specimens, and estimating the glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements by using prediction equations. Because of the high prevalence of early stages of chronic kidney disease in the general population (approximately 11% of adults), this information is particularly important for general internists and specialists.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^114W85y1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Main text

Current nephrology guidelines recommend an age-neutral approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) management based upon the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the presence of proteinuria. Nephrology referrals are recommended for patients with estimated glomerulofiltration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2, abrupt sustained fall in eGFR (Acute Kidney Injury – AKI), albumin to creatinine ratio of > 300 mg/gm. or rapid progression of renal failure, as defined by a sustained decline in renal function of > 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year. This approach may need to be modified, as there are large differences in prognosis and the trajectory of illness for older and younger adults with similar levels of eGFR. As compared with younger adults, older adults with advanced kidney disease lose their renal function more slowly, have multiple other comorbidities, and face a substantially higher competing risk of death (from comorbidities) before being required to make a decision regarding the initiation of dialysis.

Dialysis initiation trends have led to earlier initiation, that is, starting dialysis at higher levels of eGFR. Because of this trend, many older adults who may have otherwise died from non-renal failure issues are faced with a decision regarding dialysis. Between 1996 and 2009 the percent of "early", at eGFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2, US dialysis starts in older adults increased from 25% to 62%. Several recent observational studies using US and other countries' dialysis registry data and one randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate a survival benefit for "early start" dialysis. These studies provide support for recent guidelines, which recommend deferring dialysis until patients have low levels of eGFR (≤ 6 ml/min/1.73 m 2) unless a patient is symptomatic at a higher eGFR level. Although there is agreement that a patient's symptoms should be the primary determinant for starting dialysis, eGFR remains a primary consideration for many nephrologists and symptoms that drive the decision to start dialysis are generally non specific and not life threatening.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2, we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^1156RBGZ]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this pooled analysis of over two million participants in 33 general population and high cardiovascular risk cohorts, men had a higher risk than women for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality at all levels of kidney function. However, the risk relationships of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria with mortality were steeper in women than they were in men; thus, the mortality risk associated with chronic kidney disease was at least as great among women. These results strongly refute the idea that lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria are less important risk factors in women than in men. Modification of mortality risk by gender was not seen in the 13 chronic kidney disease cohorts (n = 38 612), where even the main effect of sex was attenuated. The risk of progression to end stage renal disease at a given estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio seemed equivalent in men and women.

### Improving chronic kidney disease detection and treatment in the United States: the chronic kidney disease cascade of care (C) study protocol [^115kXe8a]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and/or a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) greater than or equal to 30 mg/g, is a major public health problem. Globally, nearly 10% of the adult population has a diagnosis of CKD which is associated with substantially increased risks for cardiovascular events, progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplant, in-hospital complications, and early death. The healthcare costs of CKD are substantial. In 2018, overall Medicare fee for service spending for patients with CKD exceeded $81 billion, representing 23% of total Medicare spending.

Most preventive guidelines recommend testing for CKD as part of the usual management of high-risk conditions including diabetes, hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. The rationale for these recommendations is that detection and staging of CKD are critical for proper kidney and cardiovascular risk stratification, prompt referral to nephrology care, and initiation of cardio-kidney preventive therapies. Collectively, these actions could vastly lower the adverse health consequences of CKD, but major evidence-to-care gaps exist in CKD detection which is the necessary first step towards optimizing clinical management and outcomes. For instance, less than 50% of patients with diabetes undergo regular testing for CKD with eGFR and albuminuria. For patients with hypertension but without diabetes, testing for albuminuria is routinely conducted in less than 10% of patients. As a result, CKD at early stages is poorly recognized, marking a missed opportunity to treat CKD in patients when preventive efforts could have the largest impact.

Prior research has identified multi-level barriers for the optimal detection and treatment of CKD in primary care. Primary care providers (PCPs) have reported limited knowledge of CKD and its complications and low awareness of guidelines for CKD care. In addition, PCPs have reported low self-efficacy in educating and treating patients with CKD. From a system-level perspective, PCPs have reported limited time and clinical support to care for patients with CKD who often have competing medical priorities. There is also substantial heterogeneity in the assessment and reporting of albuminuria and limited availability of cystatin C as a marker of kidney function to enhance CKD detection and staging. Lack of institutional support for CKD care improvement initiatives may further widen this care gap. While our research group has demonstrated that comprehensive CKD detection and treatment is feasible in primary care, larger implementation efforts are needed to bridge large evidence to care gaps.

### Observations from a teaching hospital in Ireland: changing from MDRD to CKD-EPI eGFR in routine practice [^116e1a9F]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) help assess kidney function. Estimated GFR can be used to classify patients into one of six Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) categories as recommended by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines; CKD1 ≥ 90, CKD2 60–89, CKD3a 45–59, CKD3b 30–44, CKD4 15–29 or CKD5 ≤ 15mL/min/1.73 m 2 The Modification of Diet and Renal Disease (MDRD) study formula was widely adopted to calculate eGFR. The CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula improved accuracy of CKD staging at eGFR ≥ 60mL/min/1.73 m 2 MDRD and CKD-EPI eGFR were calculated on 111 444 serum creatinine results from adult patients measured as part of the routine Clinical Chemistry service. Application of CKD-EPI eGFR reclassified 18% to a lower (13.9%) or higher (4.0%) CKD stage. CKD staging was lower when < 65 years and higher when ≥ 65 years. Females were more often reclassified compared with males (2.6%vs 0.8%). Overall, CKD-EPI eGFR classified less with CKD (stages 3a-5), unless ≥ 75 years. Older males and inpatients had higher CKD stages when CKD-EPI eGFR was applied. It has been recommended to replace MDRD eGFR with CKD-EPI eGFR. In general, doing this will have little impact, however, for some patients their CKD classification will be different.

### Evaluation of cardiovascular disease burden and therapeutic goal attainment in US adults with chronic kidney disease: an analysis of national health and nutritional examination survey data, 2001–2010 [^111BKy4Q]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The stratification of CKD into 5 stages according to the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or level of decline in eGFR was previously based on criteria developed in 2002 by the NKF and subsequently endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Foundation. However, refinements to the CKD classification system were proposed to provide a more comprehensive description of CKD severity, disease prognosis, and CV risk. For example, the high prevalence of Stage 3 CKD, and potential differences in CV risk profiles within this stage, led some experts to suggest subdividing this category into Stage 3a and 3b CKD (eGFR 45–59 and 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2). This analysis of 2001–2010 NHANES data found that the prevalence of CV-related comorbidities and CV risk factors was significantly higher in Stage 3b versus 3a CKD, including an observed ~2-fold increase in the prevalence of CVD and stroke between Stage 3a and 3b, thus supporting this particular revision of the CKD classification system. Indeed, the recently released KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease now includes the subdivision of Stage 3 CKD, as well as the addition of albuminuria stages and diagnosis of CKD by cause, to enable more precise estimations of disease risk and prognosis in patients with CKD.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^1158msPy]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Appendix J. Approaches for eGFR calculation — glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is described as the best overall index of kidney function and a measure of how quickly plasma is filtered each minute by the nephron; in young adults normal GFR is approximately 90–130 mL/min and it declines on average 0.8–1.0 mL/min/year after age 30. In clinical practice, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is obtained from validated equations using creatinine, cystatin C, or both, and any estimate assumes steady-state kidney function; if kidney function is changing (e.g. AKI), the creatinine or cystatin C value is unstable and the estimating formulas should not be used, with rising levels in a non-steady state leading formulas to overestimate GFR and falling levels leading formulas to underestimate GFR. eGFR is used for screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) with urine albumin/creatinine assessment, determining CKD severity, and monitoring progression of kidney disease, and knowing the level of GFR is important for medication prescribing.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114GRPqv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and classification — KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO 2012 states that KDIGO recently published an updated guideline to clarify the definition and classification of CKD and to update recommendations for evaluation and management, with primary recommendations to retain the current definition of CKD based on decreased glomerular filtration rate or markers of kidney damage for 3 months or more and to include the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria, as well as level of glomerular filtration rate, for CKD classification. The commentary work group agreed with most KDIGO recommendations, particularly those regarding the definition and classification of CKD, but noted concerns about incorporating the cause of disease into CKD classification. The foreword notes that the inherent imprecision of formulas used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for CKD classification was often underappreciated, that stage 5 CKD came to be interpreted by some as "time for dialysis", and that albuminuria, not part of the 2002 classification scheme, was itself an independent predictor of important clinical outcomes and that a more precise degree of risk prediction became available.

### Chronic kidney disease in russia: the ural eye and medical study [^1167ZQB2]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To examine the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its associations in a Russian population.

Methods

Out of 7328 eligible individuals, the population-based cross-sectional Ural Eye and Medical Study included 5899 (80.5%) individuals aged 40+ years and undergoing a detailed medical examination. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Epidemiology-Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.

Results

The mean eGFR was 72.3 ± 19.1mL/min/1.73m 2 (median:70.3mL/min/1.73m 2). Prevalence of CKD stage 3a (eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2 and > 45mL/min/1.73m 2), CKD stage 3b (eGFR < 45mL/min/1.73m 2 and > 30mL/min/1.73m 2) and CKD stage 4+ (eGFR < 30mL/min/1.73m 2) were 1351/5841 (23.1%;95% confidence interval (CI):22.1,24.2), 294/5841 (5.0%;95%CI:4.5,5.6), and 29/5841 (0.5%;95%CI:0.3,0.7), respectively. The CKD stage 3+ prevalence increased (P < 0.001) from 11.1% (95%CI:8.4,13.9) in 40–44-year-olds to 56.8% (95%CI:52.8,60.8) in 75+year-olds. In univariate analysis, CKD stage 3a+prevalence increased with higher systolic blood pressure (P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, higher prevalence of CKD stage 3a+was associated with older age (P < 0.001; odds ratio (OR):1.06;95%CI:1.05,1.07), female sex (P < 0.001; OR:2.29;95%CI:1.94,2.69), rural region of habitation (P = 0.001; OR:1.29;95%CI:1.11,1.50), higher body mass index (P = 0.03; OR:1.02;95%CI:1.002,1.03), lower prevalence of house ownership (P = 0.02; OR:0.57;95%CI:0.35,0.92), higher prevalence of mostly sitting or standing during work (P < 0.001; OR:1.40;95%CI:1.20,1.64), higher serum concentration of triglycerides (P < 0.001; OR:1.23;95%CI:1.12,1.35) and blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.001; OR:1.33;95%CI:1.27,1.40), lower serum concentration of hemoglobin (P = 0.03; OR:0.99;95%CI:0.99,0.999), and lower prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < 0.001; OR:0.57;95%CI:0.42,0.78).

Conclusions

In this population from Russia aged 40+ years, prevalence of CKD stage 3+ (28.7%;95%CI:27.5,29.8) was relatively high as compared to populations from other countries. Associated factors were older age, female sex, rural region, higher body mass index, a sedentary lifestyle, and lower socioeconomic background.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^115Vmc15]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

In this pooled analysis of over two million participants, there was an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and end stage renal disease with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria in both sexes. In stark contrast to previous assertions that kidney disease should be defined by a lower threshold for estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher threshold for urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in women, we found the association between chronic kidney disease and mortality risk to be as strong in women as in men. Low estimated glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria should be considered at least as potent a risk factor in women as it is in men.

Results

Of the 70,598 study patients, 61.2%, 28.9%, and 9.9% were in early stage 3, late stage 3, and stage 4 CKD, respectively. Table 1 also shows that they were largely men (97.5%), and the mean age was 70(± 9) years. There were 81.9% white, 14.2% African American, 2.3% Hispanics, and 1.6% were of other racial groups. At the baseline, 36.6% had prior hospitalizations, 69.5% had cardiovascular conditions, 98.3% had other non-cardiovascular conditions, and 19.0% had mental comorbidities. Individuals in stage 4 were more likely to be non-White, and had higher rates of prior hospitalizations and comorbidities than those in stage 3. During follow-up, 19,939 (28.3%) had dialysis-free death, and 7,193 (10.3%) had dialysis. The rate of dialysis or dialysis-free death was higher for patients with more severe CKD: 29.1% for early stage 3, 46.8% for late stage 3, and 73.3% for stage 4 CKD. Overall, the median follow-up time was 3.8 years (range: < 0.01–4.8).

Case 2

A cardiologist calls as they are planning a coronary angiogram for a 68-year-old trans woman and are concerned because the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is unknown. They are uncertain how to risk stratify her for potential contrast-induced nephropathy. She has a history of longstanding hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, vaginoplasty, and has been on various formulations of estradiol therapy for over 20 years. On review of her investigations, her serum creatinine is 109 umol/L (1.23 mg/dL) but her eGFR has not been reported for the last 18 months. Laboratory providers cannot report eGFR if a male or female marker is not provided on the request form, as this is required along with age to estimate eGFR. Using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, if classified as female, the eGFR would be 45 mL/min/1.73m 2 classed as Stage 3 chronic kidney disease and would meet the guidelines for intravenous hydration prior to procedure. However, if classified male, the patient would have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 which would be classed as Stage 2 chronic kidney disease and would not require prehydration. Which is the most appropriate eGFR to use?

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.

### Why overestimate or underestimate chronic kidney disease when correct estimation is possible? [^116Y1ySX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

There is no doubt that the introduction of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines 14 years ago, and their subsequent updates, have substantially contributed to the early detection of different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Several recent studies from different parts of the world mention a CKD prevalence of 8–13%. However, some editorials and reviews have begun to describe the weaknesses of a substantial number of studies. Maremar (maladies rénales chroniques au Maroc) is a recently published prevalence study of CKD, hypertension, diabetes and obesity in a randomized, representative and high response rate (85%) sample of the adult population of Morocco that strictly applied the KDIGO guidelines. When adjusted to the actual adult population of Morocco (2015), a rather low prevalence of CKD (2.9%) was found. Several reasons for this low prevalence were identified; the tagine-like population pyramid of the Maremar population was a factor, but even more important were the confirmation of proteinuria found at first screening and the proof of chronicity of decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), eliminating false positive results. In addition, it was found that when an arbitrary single threshold of eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was used to classify CKD stages 3, 4 and 5, it lead to substantial 'overdiagnosis' (false positives) in the elderly (> 55 years of age), particularly in those without proteinuria, haematuria or hypertension. It also resulted in a significant 'underdiagnosis' (false negatives) in younger individuals with an eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and below the third percentile of their age-/gender-category. The use of the third percentile eGFR level as a cut-off, based on age-gender-specific reference values of eGFR, allows the detection of these false positives and negatives. There is an urgent need for additional quality studies of the prevalence of CKD using the recent KDIGO guidelines in the correct way, to avoid overestimation of the true disease state of CKD by ≥ 50% with potentially dramatic consequences.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^116wakmY]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease affects 10–16% of the general adult population in Asia, Europe, Australia, and the United States. Chronic kidney disease, typically defined by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and/or albuminuria, is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality and progression to end stage renal disease. Go and colleagues found in administrative healthcare data that estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 were independently associated with hospitalisations, cardiovascular events, and death. In a collaborative meta-analysis of general population cohorts we found that mortality rises exponentially with decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, while albuminuria shows linear association across its entire measurement range. Recent data indicate that the risk associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate is even stronger when glomerular filtration rate is estimated using the more accurate equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration.

Existing data regarding potential sex differences in the risk of chronic kidney disease suggest that women have a lower incidence of end stage renal disease, lower cardiovascular risk, and (in countries with low maternal mortality) lower risk of all-cause mortality than men. Whether sex differences exist with respect to estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes, and in particular whether such differences exist based on the combined effect of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, is largely unknown.

Given the clinical uncertainty, we sought to determine if sex modifies the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities and end stage renal disease, using a global consortium of 46 cohorts and more than two million participants.

### The evolution of renal function and the incidence of end-stage renal disease in patients aged ≥ 50 years [^1168dgUk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, especially among older patients.

Methods

In order to identify risk factors for the evolution towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a cohort of patients ≥ 50 years of age for whom at least four serum creatinine measurements were available were selected from a primary care-based database. The slope of changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) was calculated, and ESRD was defined as eGFR < 15 mL/min. Risk factors for ESRD were analysed using Cox regression analysis.

Results

The cohort included 24,682 patients (13,305 women) with a mean age at first available measurement of 64 years. During follow-up (average 7.8 years), 212 patients (0.9%) developed ESRD. The incidence of ESRD per 10,000 person-years is low and depends on baseline eGFR (Stages 0–2: 3, Stage 3A: 13, Stage 3B: 121 and Stage 4: 765). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for patients with baseline eGFR in Stage 3B or 4 depended on age (HR = 0.47 or 0.41 for patients 65–79 years and HR = 0.26 or 0.32 for patients ≥ 80 years compared with patients aged 50–64 years). Females (HR = 1.48) and patients with diabetes (HR = 1.20), hypertension (HR = 1.25), high total cholesterol (HR = 1.28) or high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (HR = 1.39) were at higher risk for ESRD.

Conclusions

Baseline eGFR, diabetes, high cholesterol, high LDL, hypertension and female gender are independent risk factors for developing ESRD. Older age at baseline predicts a lower risk.

Why?

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or presence of albuminuria, is estimated to have a prevalence of over 850 million individuals worldwide. In the United States, 1 in 7 (approximately 14%) of the adult population are estimated to have CKD. Patients with CKD experience higher levels of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population and cost the healthcare system a disproportionate amount. Despite its prevalence and morbidity, as little as 9% of patients with CKD are aware of their condition. Given this high prevalence, simplicity of detection, and numerous available therapeutic options to delay its progression; major clinical practice guideline organizations in nephrology and diabetes recommend CKD screening and have called upon the United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) to prioritize reexamining recommendations for CKD screening. We believe CKD fulfills the WHO principles for important disease screening because it confers large morbidity with a latent asymptomatic stage, has ubiquitous and inexpensive tests for identification, and has numerous therapeutic options for its treatment. Early treatment of CKD not only can prevent the progression to dialysis but can also reduce cardiovascular events.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease is an umbrella term for conditions resulting in impaired kidney function, and can be divided into five stages defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Chronic kidney disease stages 3, 4, and 5 represent moderate to severe disease and affect an estimated 6·1% of the UK population over the age of 16 years and 32·7% of those older than 75 years. The most common causes of chronic kidney disease stage 3 in high-income and middle-income countries are diabetes and hypertension.

Rare diseases are generally defined as affecting fewer than 200 000 individuals in the USA, or fewer than five per 10 000 individuals in Europe. Approximately 80% of rare diseases are inherited. Rare kidney diseases, as defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes global organisation, include more than 150 conditionsand have an estimated prevalence of 60–80 cases per 100 000 people in Europe and the USA.

More than 50% of children and those younger than 20 years receiving kidney replacement therapy have a rare kidney disease. In contrast to earlier chronic kidney disease stages, glomerulonephritis (which comprises multiple individually rare disorders) accounts for more UK adults receiving kidney replacement therapy than do common causes of chronic kidney disease, such as diabetes. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it could be explained by a slower average rate of kidney function lossand higher competing risk of death in unselected individuals with chronic kidney disease. Moreover, although population-based data show differences between males and females in kidney function decline, little is known about sex differences in renal outcomes for rare kidney diseases, or how kidney failure risk prediction tools that were validated in unselected chronic kidney disease populations (such as the kidney failure risk equation)perform for patients with rare kidney diseases. A better understanding of disease progression and of renal and patient survival is therefore needed, and could enable more accurate prognostication, inform health-care resource planning, and help to identify optimal opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions to slow progression to kidney failure, potentially reducing the population burden of kidney failure. Novel therapies for rare kidney diseases, such as the recently approved targeted-released budesonide for IgA nephropathy, are emerging rapidly, and real-world data on historical and current outcomes for rare kidney diseases are needed to appraise safety and efficacy data from clinical trials and inform economic modelling to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions.

KDOQI/KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging are summarized with NKF-KDOQI defining CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function regardless of cause or specific clinical presentation and proposing a staging system based on the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The conceptual model highlights the clinical value of early identification and management of patients with CKD and has promoted broad-based reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by clinical laboratories to maximize detection of occult CKD. Analyses informing the KDIGO update demonstrated that GFR and albuminuria are independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes, including CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. The specific goals of the KDIGO CKD guideline update were to clarify the definition and classification of the presence of CKD and to develop a risk classification system of CKD based on evidence. The primary recommendations were to retain KDIGO's use of GFR as the principal basis for staging CKD, but to augment the staging scheme by incorporating the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria in addition to level of GFR. The KDIGO guideline update contains a discussion of CKD progression, recommendations regarding referral to nephrologists, and management of the complications of CKD.

Results

Baseline Demographics

The baseline cohort was composed of 46 162 patients (mean [SD] age, 69.2 [14.0] years; 25 855 [56.0%] female) from primary care practices in Canada identified with stages 3 to 5 CKD during the study period. A total of 24 368 patients (68.6%) had stage 3A CKD, with a mean eGFR value of 47.7 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. A total of 38 545 patients (83.5%) had at least 1 comorbid condition. A total of 7603 patients (16.5%) had neither diabetes nor hypertension, 6770 (14.7%) had diabetes without hypertension, 16 930 (36.7%) had hypertension only, and 14 859 (32.2%) had both diabetes and hypertension (Table 1).

Overview of Quality of CKD Management

Only 4 quality indicators were successfully met in 75% or more of the cohort (Table 2 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement). These indicators were receipt of an outpatient serum creatinine test within 18 months after confirmation of CKD, receipt of blood pressure measurement at any time during follow-up, achieving a target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or lower, and receiving a hemoglobin A 1c test for monitoring diabetes during follow-up. These indicators were in the domains of testing and monitoring of kidney function (eGFR), management of blood pressure, and glycemic control. Criteria for the remaining indicators (in the domains of detection and recognition of CKD [monitoring of albuminuria], use of recommended medications, and appropriate monitoring after initiation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs) were not met in at least 75% of the cohort.

Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in people with diabetes — clinical features: CKD in people with diabetes is usually a clinical diagnosis made based on the presence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR in the absence of signs or symptoms of other primary causes of kidney damage, with typical presentation including long-standing diabetes, retinopathy, albuminuria without gross hematuria, and gradually progressive loss of eGFR. Reduced eGFR without albuminuria has been frequently reported in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is becoming more common over time.

### Implications of the CKD-EPI GFR estimation equation in clinical practice [^1145nRJP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem whose diagnosis and staging relies upon GFR-estimating equations, including the new CKD-EPI equation. CKD-EPI demonstrated superior performance compared with the existing MDRD equation but has not been applied to a healthcare system.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We identified 53,759 patients with stages 3 to 5 CKD on the basis of either MDRD or CKD-EPI equations using two eGFR values < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² > 90 days apart from an outpatient setting. We compared patient characteristics, presence of related diagnosis codes, and time CKD classification between equations.

Results

The number of patients identified with CKD decreased 10% applying CKD-EPI versus MDRD. Changes varied substantially by patient characteristics including a 35% decrease among patients < 60 years and a 10% increase among patients > 90 years. Women, non-African Americans, nondiabetics, and obese patients were less likely to be classified on the basis of CKD-EPI. Time to CKD classification was significantly longer with CKD-EPI among younger patients. 14% of patients identified with CKD on the basis of either estimating equation also had a related ICD-9 diagnosis, ranging from 19% among patients < 60 years to 7% among patients > 90 years.

Conclusions

Consistent with findings in the general population, CKD-EPI resulted in substantial declines in equation-based CKD diagnoses in a large healthcare system. Further research is needed to determine whether widespread use of CKD-EPI with current guidelines could lead to delayed needed care among younger patients or excessive referrals among older patients.

### Establishing pragmatic estimated GFR thresholds to guide metformin prescribing [^113B4EDu]. Diabetic Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

Renal impairment is a contraindication to metformin treatment because of the perceived increased risk of lactic acidosis. Current guidelines define renal impairment according to the serum creatinine of the individual, but this measure is being supplanted by the use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as it gives a closer estimate to true GFR. This study aimed to establish pragmatic eGFR limits for use in patients being considered for metformin treatment.

Methods

Estimated GFR measurements corresponding to currently used metformin creatinine limits of 130 and 150 micromol/l were derived and then applied to 12 482 patients with diabetes in Hull and East Yorkshire.

Results

Few patients with a serum creatinine of 130 or 150 micromol/l have an eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)[chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or greater], while most are between 30 and 59 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (CKD stage 3). When applied to the 12 482 patients (median age 67 years, interquartile range 56–75), males predominated when using creatinine cut-offs (13.6% of males and 8.3% of females had creatinine > 130 micromol/l; 8.2% males and 5.2% females > 150 micromol/l), but not using eGFR CKD thresholds (3.3% males and 4.7% females < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2); 20.8% males and 28.1% females eGFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Similar proportions of patients as currently would have metformin withheld if using eGFR cut-offs between 30 and 49 ml/min/1.73 m(2).

Conclusions

We have proposed pragmatic eGFR limits to guide metformin prescribing in patients with renal impairment. CKD stage 4 or greater should be an absolute contraindication to metformin, while CKD stage 3 should alert clinicians to consider other risk factors before initiating or continuing treatment.

### Predicting mortality and uptake of renal replacement therapy in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease [^111vXKaU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Novel strategies are required to efficiently manage the increasing number of patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We sought to identify factors predicting outcome in patients with stage 4 CKD and to determine whether low-risk patients could be managed in primary care.

Methods

We performed a two-centre, retrospective cohort study including 396 patients with stage 4 CKD referred to nephrology clinics from 1998 to 2002. We utilized electronic databases to determine the incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mortality and the rate of deterioration in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to the year end 2005.

Results

This was an elderly cohort, with 71.7% of patients aged ≥ 65 years. The risk of surviving to require dialysis fell with increasing age (HR 0.44; 95% CI: 0.23–0.84 for those > 74 years verses those < 65 years), in part due to the slower rate of decline in renal function in older patients (median fall in eGFR was -2.25, -1.38 and -0.86 ml/ min/1.73 m(2)/year in those aged < 65 years, 65–74 years and > 74 years, respectively, P < 0.0001). Additional independent risk factors predicting RRT included: high baseline proteinuria (HR 6.26; 95% CI: 2.74–14.23 for > 3 g/24 h versus < 0.3 g/24 h), greater early decline in renal function (HR 3.86; 95% CI: 2.34–6.38 for ≥ 4 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year versus < 4 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year), low baseline eGFR (HR 2.92; 95% CI: 1.61–5.30 for 15–19 versus 25–29 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and low haemoglobin (HR 3.16; 95% CI: 1.64–6.08 for < 10 versus > 12 g/dl). The 98 (24.7%) patients discharged to primary care had more stable renal function than those remaining under nephrology care (median change in eGFR of +0.20 versus -1.88 ml/ min/1.73 m(2)/year, P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

Most patients with stage 4 CKD, in particular the elderly, die without commencing RRT. Patients at low risk of progression can be identified and discharged safely to primary care with an active management plan.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^117Hm447]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies and implications

Our results contrast with previous studies suggesting that the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate with mortality is equivalent or weaker in women. Variations in the underlying populations studied may explain some of the difference: the NHANES study follows a US cohort, and the MRC study enrolled only people aged ≥ 75 years; and all estimated glomerular filtration rate by means of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, which may have resulted in misclassification of women with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45–59. Recent studies have demonstrated the superiority of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation for estimating measured glomerular filtration rate and for predicting prognosis. In addition, the reference groups used in the previous studies were different from the ones used here. The choice of reference can affect the estimation of interaction: choosing an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60, for example, assumes the same risk across the range of reference estimated glomerular filtration rate, and may blunt estimates of associations (particularly when associations are U shaped).

Some investigators have suggested different thresholds of estimated glomerular filtration rate for defining chronic kidney disease in men and women, where "normal" kidney function encompasses a lower glomerular filtration rate in women than men. Our results strongly contradict this assertion: the risk relationship increases more steeply at lower levels of glomerular filtration rate for women than for men. We also found a smaller increase in mortality risk at higher estimated glomerular filtration rate in women than in men. Previous studies have suggested that the increased mortality at higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (resulting in a U shaped association between glomerular filtration rate and mortality) may be attributable to frailty or low muscle mass leading to decreased creatinine generation rather than high levels of kidney function. Our findings suggest some sex differences in the relation of frailty or muscle mass with kidney function and mortality. It was reassuring to see that the associations of mortality and of end stage renal disease with estimated glomerular filtration rate were linear in the chronic kidney disease cohorts and among the younger participants in the general population and high risk cohorts.

Progression (change in eGFR over follow-up)

In patients in whom eGFR (calculated by CKD EPI equation) was followed for at least one year (n = 905), 19.3% (175/905) had improvement in eGFR (defined by increase of > 5 ml/min/year) whilst 24.7% (224/905) experienced significant loss of eGFR (progression) defined by loss of > 5 ml/min/year (p = 0.006). 66.6% of patients under 35 years and 55.4% of 85+ years had stable renal function (eGFR changes up to +/−5 ml/min/year). Elderly people (85+) were more likely to have progression of CKD (29.2%) as compared to 13.3% of those ages < 35 yr. Overall, the majority of the cohort (55.9%) had stable renal function over a 12-month follow-up.

Hospitalisations

Five hundred fourteen patients (261 males and 253 females) had at least one hospitalisation to Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital during the follow-up period, out of total population of 1150. As shown in Table 3, patients over 65 years of age had the highest number of hospitalisation episodes. There were 394 hospitalisation episodes in those aged 65–74 years, 632 episodes in those between 75 and 84 years and 97 episodes in over 85 years. The rate of hospitalisation per 100 person years increased from 64.2 in patients less than 35 years of age to a peak of 124.6 in 75–84 year age group.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112cYWvN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes — Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

It next asks Is consultation with urology indicated? with Consult urology if yes. If no, it asks Is consultation with nephrology indicated? with Consult nephrology if yes; if no, proceed to Assess risk for progression of CKD; formulate plan to treat underlying cause; implement strategies to slow progression in decline of kidney function; adjust medication doses for eGFR; optimize atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors; and review/update vaccination status. Then Monitor and assess for CKD progression and development of complications periodically (e.g., blood pressure [BP], serum creatinine/eGFR, UACR or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio [UPCR], electrolytes, calcium [Ca], phosphate [PO4], hemoglobin [Hgb]). The algorithm then asks Is there evidence of disease progression or development of indications for nephrology consultation? leading to Consult nephrology if yes or continued periodic monitoring if no.
