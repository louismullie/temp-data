## Question

What CPAP settings are used to dissolve cholelithiasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what CPAP settings are used to dissolve cholelithiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether CPAP has any role at all in gallstone management. Then, I should review what CPAP is actually used for and how its pressures are determined. Next, I need to check the correct medical therapy, dosing, duration, and monitoring for gallstone dissolution. After that, I should confirm guideline positions on when medical dissolution is appropriate versus when surgery is preferred. Finally, I will synthesize a precise, clinically useful answer and clarify what to do if the question actually intended to ask about OSA treatment and CPAP titration instead [^1174GVS5] [^1113ZqqS].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental issue because I need to ensure we are not mixing unrelated therapies. CPAP is a positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea and is not a treatment for cholelithiasis; there are no CPAP "settings" that dissolve gallstones, so linking CPAP pressure to gallstone dissolution is a category error, while gallstone treatments are medical dissolution with bile acids or cholecystectomy depending on selection criteria and symptoms [^1174GVS5] [^1113ZqqS] [^112iyB7e].

> Next, I should review what CPAP actually does and how pressures are chosen, to avoid any confusion. CPAP (or APAP) maintains upper airway patency during sleep and is prescribed for objectively diagnosed OSA; pressures are determined via in-laboratory titration or by autotitrating devices at home in appropriate candidates, with ongoing follow-up to confirm efficacy and adherence; in routine adult OSA care, CPAP or APAP is preferred over bilevel unless specific indications arise, and therapeutic pressures commonly fall within the single-digit to low–teens cm H2O range based on individual physiology and titration data, not to alter any biliary pathology [^11589euo] [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS] [^113zqu5t] [^111xMAPq].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric considerations because sometimes questions arise about special populations. CPAP can be safe and effective in children, including younger or lower weight patients, when managed by clinicians experienced in pediatric OSA; still, that pediatric indication pertains to sleep-disordered breathing, not hepatobiliary stone disease [^114zuZCg].

> I will now examine the correct gallstone dissolution therapy, since I need to provide the precise regimen. The medication that actually dissolves selected cholesterol gallstones is ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol), with an optimal dose of about 8–10 mg/kg/day in 2–3 divided doses; treatment commonly spans many months (often ≥ 6 months), and monitoring with ultrasound at 6-month intervals during the first year is advised with confirmation of dissolution on repeat imaging within 1–3 months once stones appear resolved; complete dissolution occurs in roughly 30% of unselected patients at ~10 mg/kg/day, with markedly higher success for very small (≤ 5 mm) radiolucent stones and poor response for stones > 20 mm [^116ESxzX] [^1176a9us] [^1137qRLA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using dissolution broadly; I should confirm guideline positions. EASL guidelines do not recommend bile acid litholysis (alone or with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy) as first-line therapy for gallbladder stones, and instead recommend cholecystectomy as the preferred treatment for symptomatic gallbladder stones; medical dissolution may be considered only in carefully selected patients with small, radiolucent cholesterol stones who decline or are poor candidates for surgery [^112iyB7e] [^1113ZqqS] [^112xrZR3] [^113RHftk].

> Next, I should review alternatives and timing because management often hinges on presentation. For symptomatic gallbladder stones, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard approach; in acute gallstone-related presentations, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred when appropriate, and in patients with concomitant bile duct stones, ERCP followed by early cholecystectomy is recommended; for prevention during rapid weight loss (e.g., after bariatric surgery or very low-calorie diets), UDCA at ≥ 500–600 mg/day can be considered to reduce the risk of new cholesterol stone formation until weight stabilizes [^1111CP8n] [^116KUdiL] [^1146k5c4] [^112BakY7].

> Let me synthesize the correct answer now, and I should double-check that I am explicit. There are no CPAP settings for gallstone dissolution; CPAP is for OSA, titrated to normalize respiratory events and improve symptoms with structured follow-up, while typical effective pressures are individualized and often in the single digits to low teens cm H2O range during titration, with APAP or in-lab titration used per guideline and adherence monitored objectively; if the clinical question intended gallstone dissolution, the correct therapy is ursodiol 8–10 mg/kg/day in divided doses for months with ultrasound monitoring and careful patient selection, understanding that outcomes depend strongly on stone size and radiolucency and that cholecystectomy remains first-line for symptomatic stones [^1174GVS5] [^11589euo] [^113V56sM] [^113zqu5t] [^111xMAPq] [^116ESxzX] [^1176a9us] [^1137qRLA] [^1113ZqqS] [^113RHftk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could CPAP's pressure effects indirectly influence the biliary system in a way that dissolves stones? I should confirm this to avoid an unfounded assumption. While CPAP can modulate intrathoracic pressure and has been studied for possible benefits on nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, there is no evidence that positive airway pressure alters gallstone composition or achieves litholysis; thus, using CPAP for gallstone dissolution is unsupported mechanistically and clinically, reinforcing that ursodiol or cholecystectomy are the appropriate pathways depending on patient selection and symptoms [^114weA81] [^1113ZqqS] [^112iyB7e].

---

CPAP is not used to dissolve gallstones. CPAP is for **obstructive sleep apnea** [^1174GVS5] and has no role in gallstone management. Gallstone dissolution is achieved with **UDCA** at 8–10 mg/kg/day [^116ESxzX] for small, radiolucent cholesterol stones [^1176a9us], with ultrasound monitoring every 6 months [^1137qRLA]. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the **preferred treatment** [^1113ZqqS] for symptomatic gallstones [^1111CP8n]. No **evidence or guidelines** support CPAP for gallstone dissolution.

---

## Clinical indications for CPAP therapy

CPAP is indicated for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** [^114TqjPq], characterized by repeated upper airway collapse during sleep, causing intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, and daytime sleepiness. It maintains airway patency, reduces apneas/hypopneas [^114TqjPq], and improves oxygenation and sleep quality [^113V56sM]. It is not indicated for gallstone disease [^1113ZqqS].

---

## Pathophysiology of gallstone formation and dissolution

Gallstones arise from **cholesterol supersaturation**, bile stasis, and cholesterol crystal nucleation [^1113ZqqS]. Dissolution requires altering bile composition to lower cholesterol saturation and gradually dissolve stones [^113gHH93].

---

## Established medical therapies for gallstone dissolution

Medical dissolution relies on bile acids, primarily **ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)**, to reduce cholesterol saturation and dissolve small, radiolucent cholesterol stones [^1113ZqqS]. UDCA is recommended at 8–10 mg/kg/day [^116ESxzX] in 2–3 divided doses, with ultrasound monitoring every 6 months [^1137qRLA]. Complete dissolution occurs in about 30% of unselected patients, with higher rates for small (< 5 mm) [^1176a9us], radiolucent, cholesterol-rich stones [^116ESxzX].

---

## Surgical management of gallstones

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the **preferred treatment** [^1113ZqqS] for symptomatic gallstones, providing definitive relief and preventing recurrence. It is recommended for symptomatic patients, including those with acute calculous cholecystitis and those with Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis [^116KUdiL] [^115G6zxK].

---

## Lack of evidence supporting CPAP for gallstone dissolution

There is no **evidence or guideline support** for CPAP in gallstone dissolution [^1113ZqqS]. CPAP does not alter bile composition or promote stone dissolution and is used exclusively for OSA management.

---

## Potential risks and complications of CPAP therapy

CPAP is **generally safe** but may cause nasal congestion, dryness, discomfort, and rare barotrauma. These effects are unrelated to gallstone disease and do not affect its management.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Physicians [^114TqjPq], American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^1174GVS5], and European Association for the Study of the Liver [^1113ZqqS] do not mention CPAP for gallstone dissolution. CPAP is for **OSA** [^114TqjPq], whereas gallstone management relies on medical dissolution with UDCA [^116ESxzX] or surgical cholecystectomy [^1113ZqqS].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

CPAP is not indicated for **gallstone dissolution**. Gallstone management should follow established medical and surgical protocols, with UDCA for small, radiolucent cholesterol stones [^116ESxzX] and laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic disease [^1111CP8n]. **No evidence or guidelines support CPAP** for gallstone dissolution.

### Ursodiol 400 mg [^116ESxzX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Based on clinical trial results from a total of 868 patients with radiolucent gallstones treated across eight studies — three in the U.S. involving 282 patients, one in the U.K. involving 130 patients, and four in Italy involving 456 patients — treatment periods ranged from 6 to 78 months with ursodiol doses of approximately 5–20 mg/kg/day. An optimal ursodiol dose of about 8–10 mg/kg/day was identified. At a dose of around 10 mg/kg/day, complete stone dissolution can be anticipated in about 30% of unselected patients with uncalcified gallstones, while stones 20 mm in maximal diameter rarely dissolve their stones. The likelihood of gallstone dissolution increases to up to 50% in patients with floating or floatable stones (i.e. those with high cholesterol content) and is inversely related to stone size for those < 20 mm in maximal diameter. Complete dissolution was observed in 81% of patients with stones up to 5 mm in diameter. Factors such as age, sex, weight, degree of obesity, and serum cholesterol levels do not appear to influence the likelihood of stone dissolution with ursodiol.

### Reltone 400 mg [^1137qRLA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Dosage and administration:

- **Gallstone dissolution**: The recommended dose for Reltone™ treatment of radiolucent gallbladder stones is 8–10 mg/kg/day, administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. Ultrasound images of the gallbladder should be obtained at 6-month intervals for the first year of Reltone™ therapy to monitor the gallstone response. If gallstones appear to have dissolved, Reltone™ therapy should be continued and dissolution confirmed on a repeat ultrasound examination within 1 to 3 months. Most patients who eventually achieve complete stone dissolution will show partial or complete dissolution at the first on-treatment reevaluation. If partial stone dissolution is not seen by 12 months of Reltone™ therapy, the likelihood of success is greatly reduced.

- **Gallstone prevention**: The recommended dosage of Reltone™ for gallstone prevention in patients undergoing rapid weight loss is 600 mg/day.

### Restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain (SECURE): A multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority trial [^116KhQ8g]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

International guidelines advise laparoscopic cholecystectomy for treating symptomatic, uncomplicated gallstones. Usual care regarding cholecystectomy often results in practice variations and persistent post-cholecystectomy pain in 10–41% of patients. This study aimed to compare the non-inferiority of a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection against usual care to evaluate the efficient use of cholecystectomy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority study in 24 academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18–95 years with abdominal pain and ultrasound-proven gallstones or sludge were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual care, where the decision for cholecystectomy was left to the discretion of the surgeon, or a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection for cholecystectomy. In the restrictive strategy, cholecystectomy was advised for patients who fulfilled all five pre-specified criteria of the triage instrument: 1) severe pain attacks, 2) pain lasting 15–30 minutes or longer, 3) pain in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant, 4) pain radiating to the back, and 5) a positive pain response to simple analgesics.

	- Randomisation was conducted using an online program, which was implemented into a web-based application using blocks of variable sizes and stratified for centre (academic versus non-academic and a high vs low number of patients), sex, and body-mass index. Physicians and patients were blinded to study-arm allocation until after completing the triage instrument.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholangitis, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend eliciting medical history and performing physical examination to identify the characteristic symptoms of gallbladder stones. These symptoms include episodic attacks of severe pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant or epigastrium for at least 15–30 minutes, with radiation to the right back or shoulder, and a positive reaction to analgesics.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only individuals with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones, such as steady, non-paroxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen, or complications such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis, warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy for treating symptomatic gallstones.

Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having a cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### Evolution of mild obstructive sleep apnea after different treatments [^1176sdLQ]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of mild obstructive sleep apnea in relation to different treatment modalities. It was designed as an open, retrospective, longitudinal follow-up study. Fifty adult patients diagnosed and treated for mild obstructive sleep apnea at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Kuopio University Hospital between 1998 and 2004 had a control polysomnography in 2005. The changes in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were observed in untreated (n = 28), operative (n = 11), and continuous positive airway pressure (n = 11) treatment groups at a long-term follow-up visit.

The mean follow-up period was 4 years (range, 1.3–9.0; SD, 1.9). The untreated patients had a statistically significant increase in AHI (13.3, SD 18.3) at the follow-up. Half of these patients developed a moderate or severe degree of sleep apnea, and only 11% were cured. In patients who were treated with continuous positive airway pressure, the degree of obstructive sleep apnea became worse in 64% of cases, and in 27% of patients, the AHI returned to normal (< 5). The degree of obstructive sleep apnea in operated patients deteriorated in only 18%, and in 27% of the patients, the AHI returned to normal (< 5).

In conclusion, mild obstructive sleep apnea has a natural tendency to worsen with time. Active treatment of mild obstructive sleep apnea appears, therefore, to be advisable.

This article provides an overview of the management of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS). Where possible, recommendations are based on a review of the relevant literature. With the exception of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, which is considered in greater detail elsewhere in the series, and certain oral appliances, the efficacy of many proposed treatments for OSAHS is not supported by data from randomised controlled clinical trials. To a considerable extent, treatment recommendations are based on data from uncontrolled studies, case series, consensus guidelines, practice parameters, and other less rigorous forms of evidence.

### Cardiovascular effects after five nights without continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea: a randomized controlled trial [^114aNWEj]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

About 400 million people worldwide are estimated to suffer from moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and they run an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment can effectively treat sleep apnea and reduce arterial stiffness and blood pressure. However, adherence to CPAP treatment is essential, as obstructive sleep apneas return after only one night without CPAP treatment.

Few trials have investigated the effects of CPAP withdrawal on cardiovascular outcomes, including 24-hour blood pressure. A PubMed search for randomized controlled trials on CPAP withdrawal identified only one group of researchers studying cardiovascular outcomes after 14 days on CPAP vs. subtherapeutic CPAP. This group reported significant increases in morning office blood pressure with subtherapeutic CPAP along with impaired endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation. The PubMed search found no trial that had studied how a few nights without CPAP treatment affects cardiovascular outcomes, even though many patients with sleep apnea occasionally skip their CPAP treatment.

Here, we investigated whether five nights without CPAP affects arterial stiffness and 24-hour blood pressure. In addition, we investigated whether five nights without CPAP affects NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide, nocturnal urine norepinephrine, glucose metabolism, blood lipids, inflammatory markers, the apnea–hypopnea index, oxygen-desaturation index, daytime sleepiness, and lung function, with separate analyses for men and women.

### Drug therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea in adults [^111EWzr6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of choice for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) applied via a mask during sleep. However, this is not tolerated by all individuals and its role in mild OSA is not proven. Drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea and could be of value in patients intolerant of CPAP. A number of mechanisms have been proposed by which drugs could reduce the severity of OSA, including:

- **Upper airway dilator muscles tone**: An increase in tone in the upper airway dilator muscles.
- **Ventilatory drive**: An increase in ventilatory drive.
- **REM sleep proportion**: A reduction in the proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
- **Cholinergic tone during sleep**: An increase in cholinergic tone during sleep.
- **Arousal threshold**: An increase in arousal threshold.
- **Airway resistance**: A reduction in airway resistance.
- **Surface tension in the upper airway**: A reduction in surface tension in the upper airway.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of drug therapies in the specific treatment of sleep apnoea.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Searches were conducted as of July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, placebo-controlled trials involving adult patients with confirmed OSA were included. We excluded trials if continuous positive airways pressure, mandibular devices, or oxygen therapy were used. We also excluded studies investigating treatment of associated conditions such as excessive sleepiness, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and obesity.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

- **Main results**: Thirty trials of drug therapy for OSA were analyzed.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113YkQDf]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

From a patient perspective, the defining symptom of gallstone disease is severe and lasting (i.e. > 30 minutes) abdominal pain. General abdominal symptoms commonly intensify over a period and become regular pain attacks (biliary colic) that may require medical attention.

A recent large prospective study in the UK (n = 8909 participants) showed that 10.8% of people experienced complications 30 days after surgery. Furthermore, as much as 40% of patients may continue to experience pain and abdominal symptoms after surgery. In particular, persistent pain similar to that experienced preoperatively has been reported in about 20% of people after cholecystectomy, and new pain has been reported in up to 14% of people. Based on the 61,000 episodes reported for 2018/19, 6600 people would have experienced complications from surgery, and 24,400 would continue to experience pain, with a substantial impact on NHS resources and costs.

Post-cholecystectomy syndrome is an umbrella term widely used to describe the range of symptoms patients might experience after surgery. The term persistent post-cholecystectomy symptoms has been suggested as a more accurate description of these symptoms, which include biliary and non-biliary abdominal pain, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Up to 40% of people may experience persistent pain and discomfort, usually described as post-cholecystectomy symptoms. Persistent diarrhea or constipation is often reported after cholecystectomy, and flatulence may arise as a new symptom.

### New frontiers in pharmacologic obstructive sleep apnea treatment: A narrative review [^115TDXp4]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, characterized by intermittent partial or complete closure of the upper airway during sleep. If left untreated, OSA is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, and death. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is often considered the first-line treatment for OSA. Although PAP can be very effective in reducing the number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas, its impact on the prevention of adverse cardiovascular consequences remains controversial, and treatment adherence is often poor. Hence, there is a necessity for novel treatment options to assist those who cannot adhere to positive airway pressure treatment.

Different classes of medications have been tested regarding their effect on OSA severity. This review provides an update on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of OSA, outlines the mechanistic rationale for medication classes tested as OSA treatment, and discusses the effects of these medications on OSA. Several wake-promoting medications are approved for the management of persistent sleepiness despite OSA treatment; however, the discussion of these symptomatic treatments is outside the scope of this review. Herein, the authors review the evidence for pharmacological management of OSA and provide future directions.

### Reltone 400 mg [^1176a9us]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Based on clinical trial results from 868 patients with radiolucent gallstones treated across eight studies — three in the U.S. (282 patients), one in the U.K. (130 patients), and four in Italy (456 patients) — an ursodiol dose ranging from about 5–20 mg/kg/day was used over periods from 6 to 78 months. A dose of approximately 8–10 mg/kg/day was found to be the most effective. At about 10 mg/kg/day, complete stone dissolution can be anticipated in approximately 30% of unselected patients with uncalcified gallstones.

- **Stone size impact**: Stones greater than 20 mm in maximal diameter rarely dissolve. The chance of gallstone dissolution increases to up to 50% in patients with floating or floatable stones (i.e. those with high cholesterol content) and is inversely related to stone size for those less than 20 mm in diameter.

- **Complete dissolution rates**: Complete dissolution was observed in 81% of patients with stones up to 5 mm in diameter.

- **Factors not related to dissolution**: Age, sex, weight, degree of obesity, and serum cholesterol level do not significantly influence the likelihood of stone dissolution with ursodiol.

### Persistent high residual AHI after CPAP use [^117LXR48]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea has recently been noted after various treatment modalities for obstructive sleep apnea. It often remits spontaneously or can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure. However, we encountered a pediatric patient with obstructive sleep apnea who presented with severe complications, including growth failure, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, poor school performance, daytime sleepiness, and urinary difficulty that required permanent cystostomy. His obstructive sleep apnea resolved after adenotonsillectomy. However, treatment-emergent central sleep apnea developed after adenotonsillectomy and was further aggravated after continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure without a backup respiratory rate use. After bilevel positive airway pressure with a backup respiratory rate treatment for 3 months initially, all his symptoms improved, except growth failure. Later, after adaptive servoventilation was used for 10 months, the patient's growth began to improve.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116ezaSE]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines in the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

- **Methods**: The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically significant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements" that establish the basis for appropriate and effective treatment of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Good practice statements**: The following good practice statements are based on expert consensus, and their implementation is necessary for appropriate and effective management of patients with OSA treated with positive airway pressure:
	1. Treatment of OSA with PAP therapy should be based on a diagnosis of OSA established using objective sleep apnea testing.
	2. Adequate follow-up, including troubleshooting and monitoring of objective efficacy and usage data to ensure adequate treatment and adherence, should occur following PAP therapy initiation.

### Sleep apnoea: Finnish national guidelines for prevention and treatment 2002–2012 [^116Gxs3h]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

After negotiations with the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, a national program to promote prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of sleep apnoea for the years 2002–2012 has been prepared by the Finnish Lung Health Association on the basis of extensive collaboration. The program needs to be revised as necessary because of the rapid development in medical knowledge, particularly in appliance therapy.

Sleep apnoea deteriorates slowly. Its typical features are snoring, interruptions of breathing during sleep, and daytime tiredness. Sleep apnoea affects roughly 3% of middle-aged men and 2% of women. In Finland, there are approximately 150,000 sleep apnoea patients, of whom 15,000 have a severe disease, 50,000 are moderate, and 85,000 have a mild form of the disease. Children are also affected by sleep apnoea. A typical sleep apnoea patient is a middle-aged man or a postmenopausal woman.

The obstruction of the upper airways is essential in the occurrence of sleep apnoea. The obstruction can be caused by structural and/or functional factors. Regarding structural factors, various methods of intervention exist, such as securing children's nasal respiration, removing redundant soft tissue, and correcting malocclusions. It is possible to affect functional factors by effectively treating diseases predisposing to sleep apnoea, reducing smoking, and minimizing the consumption of alcohol and the use of medicines impairing the central nervous system. The most important single risk factor for sleep apnoea is obesity.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^116VfZGC]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

In addition to this approach, a criteria set with patient characteristics and preoperative symptoms is highly valuable in improving treatment decision-making. In the SUCCESS trial, a criteria set was developed and validated to allow selection of patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease for surgery based on prediction of becoming pain-free or achieving a relevant reduction in pain. The SUCCESS cohort provided the data for development of the criteria set: 494 patients with radiologically confirmed gallbladder stones, gastrointestinal pain symptoms, and a referral to the surgery department of the hospital.

The criteria set comprised older patients with a high baseline pain score, no history of abdominal surgery, radiation of pain to the back, nausea, effective result after simple painkillers, and no symptoms of heartburn. Patients with these characteristics/symptoms more frequently had a relevant reduction in pain after gallbladder removal. External validation of the SUCCESS criteria in the SECURE data indicated good distinction between patients with and without a relevant reduction in pain.

For daily clinical use, an online tool was developed, which can be easily accessed via the QR code in Fig. 2. To tailor treatment for individual patients, Fig. 3 illustrates a decision tree. When patients with proven gallbladder stones complain of repeated biliary colic, this is considered to represent symptomatic gallstone disease, and cholecystectomy is advised in shared decision-making with the patient. An option talk is advocated for patients who report abdominal pain.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^115ArJbZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

There is a lack of consensus in selecting patients who do or do not benefit from surgery when patients present with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones are present. This review aimed to give an overview of results from recent trials and available literature to improve treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

- **Methods**: First, an overview of different symptom criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is given, based on national and international guidelines. Second, treatment outcomes (absence of biliary colic, pain-free state, biliary and surgical complications) are summarized, with data from three clinical trials. Finally, personal advice for treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is provided, based on recent trials, the available literature, and expert opinion.

- **Results**: This review describes different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis, provides an overview of outcomes after cholecystectomy, and advises on treatment decisions in patients with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. After cholecystectomy, biliary colic is resolved in 95 percent of patients. However, non-specific abdominal pain persists in 40 percent. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia significantly increase the risk of persistent pain. Age, previous abdominal surgery, baseline pain score on a visual analogue scale, pain characteristics, nausea, and heartburn are part of the SUCCESS criteria and are associated with clinically relevant outcomes.

### Provigil [^113dQrVD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Provigil in improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was established in two multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical studies of patients who met the criteria for OSA. The criteria include either: 1) excessive sleepiness or insomnia, plus frequent episodes of impaired breathing during sleep, and associated features such as loud snoring, morning headaches, and dry mouth upon awakening; or 2) excessive sleepiness or insomnia and polysomnography demonstrating one of the following: more than five obstructive apneas, each greater than 10 seconds in duration, per hour of sleep and one or more of the following: frequent arousals from sleep associated with the apneas, bradytachycardia, and arterial oxygen desaturation in association with the apneas. In addition, for entry into these studies, all patients were required to have excessive sleepiness as demonstrated by a score ≥ 10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) despite treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Evidence that CPAP was effective in reducing episodes of apnea/hypopnea was required along with documentation of CPAP use.

In the first study, a 12-week trial, a total of 327 patients with OSA were randomized to receive Provigil 200 mg/day, Provigil 400 mg/day, or a matching placebo. The majority of patients (80%) were fully compliant with CPAP, defined as CPAP use greater than 4 hours/night on more than 70% of nights. The remainder were partially CPAP compliant, defined as CPAP use on 30% of nights.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^1144c8H9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

This review addresses the challenge of selecting patients who would benefit from surgery when presenting with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. An overview of findings from recent trials and existing literature is presented to enhance treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

- **Symptom criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy**: An analysis based on national and international guidelines.
- **Treatment outcomes and positive metrics**: Key outcomes include the absence of biliary colic, achieving a pain-free state, and a summary of biliary and surgical complications, supported by data from three clinical trials.
- **Expert treatment recommendations**: Personal advice grounded in recent trials, the existing literature, and expert opinion is provided for patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

This review explores various guidelines and criteria for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis, summarizing outcomes following cholecystectomy, and offering guidance on treatment decisions for patients with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. A cholecystectomy resolves biliary colic in 95% of patients; however, non-specific abdominal pain persists in 40% of cases. Conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia significantly amplify the risk of enduring pain. Factors including age, previous abdominal surgery, baseline pain score on a visual analogue scale, pain characteristics, nausea, and heartburn constitute the SUCCESS criteria, and they are clinically associated with outcomes.

### Adult obstructive sleep apnoea [^1171fWup]. Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is an increasingly common disorder characterized by repeated upper airway collapse during sleep, leading to oxygen desaturation and disrupted sleep. Features include snoring, witnessed apnoeas, and sleepiness. The pathogenesis varies, and predisposing factors include a small upper airway lumen, unstable respiratory control, low arousal threshold, small lung volume, and dysfunctional upper airway dilator muscles. Risk factors include obesity, male sex, age, menopause, fluid retention, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and smoking. Obstructive sleep apnoea causes sleepiness and road traffic accidents and is probably linked to systemic hypertension. It has also been associated with myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, and diabetes mellitus, though not definitively. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice, with adherence rates of 60–70%. Bi-level positive airway pressure or adaptive servo-ventilation can be used for patients intolerant to continuous positive airway pressure. Other treatments include dental devices, surgery, and weight loss.

### What are the nonsurgical treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^112qzkNu]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2001). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is now recognized as a relatively common cause of excessive daytime sleepiness, leading to psychosocial impairment and motor vehicle accidents, and it likely contributes to premature cardiovascular disease. Treatment is naturally directed at the upper airway. However, it is also important to identify and correct significant risk factors, such as obesity and hypothyroidism, whenever possible. Oral appliances or nasal continuous positive airway pressure may immediately reverse symptoms caused by OSA and can be used either indefinitely or as a bridge to potentially definitive surgery.

### Systematic review: Clinical effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux [^114weA81]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Low credibility.

- **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)**: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repetitive partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep, leading to obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and/or arousals from sleep. Symptoms include daytime sleepiness, excessive snoring, and gasping during sleep. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard for the treatment of OSAS. CPAP increases intrathoracic pressure and prevents the upper airway from collapsing, effectively reducing apneas, hypopneas, and arousals from sleep.

It is hypothesized that by raising intrathoracic pressure, CPAP might also reduce the occurrence of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux. We identified seven clinical trials investigating the effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) on nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux. All of these are non-blinded, non-randomized cross-over trials or observational studies. Five studies were conducted in OSAS patients with subsequent nocturnal reflux symptoms and were at serious or critical risk of bias. Two studies were performed in a non-OSAS population, with moderate or low risk of bias.

### Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea among privately paying patients - a cross sectional study [^116Kqt2f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a relatively common disorder with an estimated prevalence of 4% in men and 2% in women. It is characterized by intermittent obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. Patients experience repetitive episodes of apnea (complete cessation of airflow), hypopnea (partial reduction in airflow), oxygen desaturation, and sleep fragmentation. Common symptoms include loud habitual snoring, frequent nocturnal awakenings, unrefreshing sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Age, gender, obesity, and nasal blockage are some well-established risk factors for OSA. OSA is associated with poor sleep quality, impaired cognition, and an increased risk of accidents. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and treating OSA favorably reduces these risks. Similarly, OSA is associated with an increase in blood pressure that is improved with treating apnea but not by supplemental O2 therapy, suggesting that mechanisms other than hypoxemia are responsible for hypertension.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice for OSA. CPAP therapy results in improvements in daytime sleepiness and cognitive function, along with an improved quality of life compared to control. Good compliance with CPAP therapy has been shown to achieve cardiovascular and metabolic benefits.

Despite the high efficacy of CPAP, treatment effectiveness is limited by variable adherence to prescribed therapy. Failure to comply with CPAP therapy may occur in up to 25% to 50% of patients.

### Interventions to improve compliance in sleep apnea patients previously non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure [^1169EDMc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite widespread agreement that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, it is estimated that 50% of patients recommended for therapy are noncompliant one year later. Interventions to improve compliance in such patients have not been studied. We evaluated a two-phase intervention program to improve compliance in sleep apnea patients previously noncompliant with CPAP.

- **Methods**: 204 patients with previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and noncompliant with CPAP were enrolled. Phase 1 evaluated standard interventions to improve therapy compliance, including mask optimization, heated humidification, topical nasal therapy, and sleep apnea education. Persistently noncompliant patients proceeded to phase 2, where compliance was compared in double-blind randomized fashion between standard CPAP and flexible bilevel positive airway pressure.

- **Results**: 49 (24%) of 204 previously noncompliant patients became compliant (average nightly use ≥ 4 hours) after standard interventions. Then, 104 of the 155 persistently noncompliant patients agreed to continue and were randomized to either CPAP or flexible bilevel positive airway pressure retitration and treatment for an additional ninety days. At follow-up, 15 (28%) of the 53 randomized to CPAP and 25 (49%) of the 51 randomized to flexible bilevel positive airway pressure (p = 0.03) achieved compliance.

- **Conclusions**: A two-phase intervention program, first employing standard interventions…

### Managing hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea: The interplay of continuous positive airway pressure, medication and chronotherapy [^113npjdR]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertension is highly prevalent and usually uncontrolled among patients with obstructive sleep apnea, despite multiple interventions, namely lifestyle modifications, use of antihypertensive drugs, and continuous positive airway pressure application. The main prognosticators of blood pressure (BP) reduction with continuous positive airway pressure therapy are high levels of BP, severity of apnea, and daytime sleepiness. The long-term effect of continuous positive airway pressure on BP is still inconclusive, and compliance issues constitute a major limitation.

There is no clear evidence for a preference for a specific type of antihypertensive drug, and selection should primarily be guided by the patient's cardiometabolic profile and associated clinical conditions. Furthermore, as hypertensive patients with obstructive sleep apnea frequently exhibit a disturbed circadian BP pattern, chronotherapy emerges as a possible therapeutic supplement.

### A comparison of pressure-controlled and volume-controlled ventilation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^114wQebm]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The potential advantages of pressure-controlled ventilation over volume-controlled ventilation during laparoscopic surgery have yet to be proven. We randomly assigned 42 patients with a BMI of less than 30 kg.m(-2), scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, to receive either pressure- or volume-controlled ventilation. Compared with volume-controlled ventilation, pressure-controlled ventilation resulted in a significant decrease in mean (SD) peak airway pressure at 10 minutes (20.4 (2.7) vs. 24.0 (4.7) cmH₂O, p = 0.004) and 30 minutes (20.7 (3.0) vs. 23.9 (4.9) cmH₂O, p = 0.015). There was also an increase in mean airway pressure at 10 minutes (10.5 (0.9) vs. 9.6 (1.1) cmH₂O, p = 0.007) and 30 minutes (10.5 (1.1) vs. 9.6 (1.2) cmH₂O, p = 0.016) after the start of surgery. Gas exchange and haemodynamic stability were similar. We conclude that pressure-controlled ventilation is a safe alternative and offers some advantages over volume-controlled ventilation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in non-obese patients.

### Obesity as a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias [^112quTqY]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea, although reports on the effects of this treatment on atrial fibrillation (AF) risk are conflicting. Observational studies have reported reductions in atrial and ventricular ectopy and arrhythmias with continuous positive airway pressure and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion and catheter ablation for AF. Two meta-analyses of 108 observational studies evaluating the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on AF risk reported similar results. One meta-analysis of 3,743 people suggested that AF risk increased by almost 60% in people with obstructive sleep apnoea who were not treated with continuous positive airway pressure. The other meta-analysis of 4,752 patients reported a 42% relative risk reduction of AF recurrence with continuous positive airway pressure among more than 1,000 patients. Another meta-analysis of clinical and observational studies comprising 14,812 patients showed that continuous positive airway pressure reduced AF recurrence by over 60%. The benefits of this treatment in reducing AF recurrence might also be greater in younger patients (< 60 years). Similarly, continuous positive airway pressure has been shown to be particularly efficacious at decreasing AF risk in younger men who are obese, supporting intervention early in the progression of obesity.

Nevertheless, an open-label randomized trial of 108 patients with paroxysmal AF and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea showed no difference in AF burden between groups treated with…

### Comparison of the effects of continuous positive airway pressure and mandibular advancement devices on sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: a network meta-analysis [^114FuYpz]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness is the most important symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea and can affect work productivity, quality of life, and the risk of road traffic accidents. We aimed to quantify the effects of the two main treatments for obstructive sleep apnoea (continuous positive airway pressure and mandibular advancement devices) on daytime sleepiness and to establish predictors of response to continuous positive airway pressure.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from inception to May 31, 2015, to identify randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of continuous positive airway pressure, mandibular advancement devices, or an inactive control (e.g. placebo or no treatment) on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS, range 0–24 points) in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. We conducted a network meta-analysis using multivariate random-effects meta-regression to assess the effect of each treatment on ESS. Meta-regression was used to evaluate the association of the reported effects of continuous positive airway pressure versus inactive controls with the characteristics of trials and their risk of bias.

- **Findings**: We included 67 studies comprising 6,873 patients in the meta-analysis. Compared with an inactive control, continuous positive airway pressure was associated with a reduction in ESS score of 2.5 points (95% CI 2.0–2.9) and mandibular advancement devices of 1.7 points (1.1–2.3). We estimated that, on average, continuous positive airway pressure reduced the ESS score by a further 0.8 points compared with mandibular advancement devices.

### Clinical characteristics of older adults seeking hypoglossal nerve stimulation for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^112o1bkR]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction, hypoxemia, and fragmented sleep. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has traditionally been the preferred treatment modality for OSA, although adherence is a well-known limiting factor. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) first gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2014 as an alternative treatment option; however, little is known regarding the clinical characteristics of those presenting for possible HNS treatment for OSA.

In the general population, moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (apnea–hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 15) is suspected to occur at alarmingly high prevalence rates of 49.7% of men and 23.7% of women. Sleep apnea is more common in older adults. This increased prevalence, along with sleep apnea's role in exacerbating many age-related disorders, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and cognitive deficits, highlights the importance of assessing and treating sleep apnea, especially in older adults.

### Asthma outcomes improve with continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea [^11762bMo]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Background: Continuous positive airway pressure in asthma patients with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome seems to have a favorable impact on asthma, but data are inconsistent due to methodological limitations of previous studies.

Methods: This prospective, multicenter study examined asthma outcomes after 6 months in 99 adult asthma patients (mean age 57 years) with a respiratory disturbance index ≥ 20. Asthma control and quality of life were assessed with the Asthma Control Questionnaire and the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results: The mean score on the Asthma Control Questionnaire decreased from 1.39 ± 0.91 at baseline to 1.0 ± 0.78 at 6 months (P = 0.003), and the percentage of patients with uncontrolled asthma reduced from 41.4% to 17.2% (P = 0.006). Additionally, the percentage of patients experiencing asthma attacks in the 6 months before and after treatment decreased from 35.4% to 17.2% (P = 0.015). The Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score increased from 5.12 ± 1.38 to 5.63 ± 1.17 (P = 0.009). Significant improvements were also observed in symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and rhinitis, bronchial reversibility, and exhaled nitric oxide values (all P < 0.05). No significant changes were seen in drug therapy for asthma or their comorbidities, nor in the patients' weight.

Conclusions: Asthma control (both actual and future risk), quality of life, and lung function improved after starting continuous positive airway pressure in asthmatics with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

### The history and future of bile acid therapies [^113gHH93]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Animal bile has been regarded as a potential remedy for liver diseases for millennia in ancient Eastern cultures. The application of bile acids as major organic bile components for gallstone dissolution and of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for cholestatic liver diseases began in the second half of the 20th century. Currently, UDCA is regarded as an effective first-line treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, the most frequent chronic cholestatic liver disease, and is also applied in other cholestatic disorders, including primary sclerosing cholangitis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

For the past two decades, nuclear receptor agonists such as the farnesoid-X receptor agonist and chenodeoxycholic acid derivative obeticholic acid, along with derivatives of UDCA such as norucholic acid and various UDCA hybrids, are under evaluation for the treatment of diverse benign and malignant, genetic and acquired hepatobiliary disorders. The development of new drugs interacting with the enterohepatic bile acid circulation has attracted attention for rare genetic pediatric disorders.

This review describes the status and future prospects of bile acid-based therapies for hepatobiliary diseases of adults, children, and during pregnancy based on historical developments over centuries and millennia.

### Effect of positive airway pressure on obese patients undergoing surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LHzm6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, resulting in inadequate oxygen levels. Studies have revealed that middle-aged adults with higher BMI face a significantly higher risk of sleep apnoea. In severely obese individuals, the prevalence of sleep apnoea can range from 40–90%. Obstructive sleep apnea is more prevalent among obese individuals.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is the gold standard treatment for moderate to severe OSA. PAP therapy maintains upper airway patency by maintaining positive air pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, functioning as an inflatable splint. This modality encompasses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), and positive airway pressure with automatic titration (APAP). CPAP proffers a continual, stable influx of positive air pressure to the patient's airway, engineered to avert airway collapse and minimize the frequency of apnoeic episodes. BIPAP delivers two distinct pressure settings – an elevated pressure during inspiration (IPAP) and a reduced pressure during expiration (EPAP), enabling patients to benefit from increased respiratory support during inspiration along with continuous positive pressure during expiration, thereby contributing to enhanced comfort and therapeutic outcomes. APAP is an intelligent non-invasive ventilator, autonomously adjusting the end positive pressure airway level in alignment with the patient's respiratory requirements.

### Upper airway collapsibility in patients with OSA treated with continuous positive airway pressure: A retrospective preliminary study [^111xMAPq]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mildly collapsible upper airways, defined by therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) values of ≤ 8 cm H₂O, in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea treated with CPAP. It also sought to determine their clinical, functional, and nocturnal polysomnographic characteristics.

Eighty-seven patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who were consecutively treated with CPAP were retrospectively investigated. Two nocturnal home sleep portable monitoring studies were conducted at baseline and during treatment. Participants were categorized based on therapeutic CPAP values: ≤ 8 cm H₂O (group 1), 8–12 cm H₂O (group 2), and ≥ 12 cm H₂O (group 3). Data on anthropometric measures, awake respiratory function, symptoms, comorbidities, and nocturnal home sleep portable monitoring studies were collected.

Mild upper airway collapsibility (therapeutic CPAP values ≤ 8 cm H₂O) was present in 25.3% of patients. These patients showed more favorable apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, mean nocturnal saturation, sleep time with oxygen saturation < 90%, desaturation nadir, and supine position. The oxygen desaturation index showed a weak association with anatomical collapsibility. Using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve for the oxygen desaturation index versus CPAP pressure requirements ≤ 8 cm H₂O was low, and an oxygen desaturation index ≤ 40.8/h had a sensitivity of 63.3% and a specificity of 69.2% to detect patients with mild collapsibility.

### Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea among privately paying patients- a cross sectional study [^117Deush]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the compliance, benefits, and side effects associated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy among Pakistani patients treated for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the private sector.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with OSA based on an overnight study and recommended for CPAP therapy between 1998 and 2003 were evaluated through a telephonic survey and review of hospital notes. Compliance, benefits, and side effects associated with CPAP therapy were assessed.

- **Results**: Out of 135 patients who were prescribed CPAP therapy, 75 were contactable. Sixty patients (80%) began using CPAP within one month of diagnosis, and 46 patients (61%) continued its use long-term (beyond one year). Compliance with CPAP therapy was associated with higher body mass index, higher Epworth sleepiness scale scores, a history of witnessed apnea, and a reduction in daytime sleepiness with the use of CPAP therapy. The severity of OSA, as assessed by the apnea-hypopnea index, did not affect compliance with CPAP therapy. However, the use of antidepressants and CPAP-induced sleep disturbances were linked to poor compliance.

- **Conclusions**: Obesity, excessive daytime sleepiness, and witnessed apnea, along with the improvement of daytime symptoms following the use of CPAP, were predictors of improved compliance. In contrast, the use of antidepressants and CPAP-induced sleep disturbances were predictors of poor compliance.

### Perioperative adherence to continuous positive airway pressure and its effect on postoperative nocturnal hypoxemia in obstructive sleep apnea patients: a prospective cohort study [^1158CFyD]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep. Among patients undergoing elective surgery, the prevalence of OSA is estimated to be at least 25% and as high as 80% in certain populations, such as patients undergoing bariatric surgery. OSA has important perioperative implications as it is associated with an increased risk of cardiac and pulmonary complications, oxygen desaturations, difficult intubation, and, in rare instances, death.

Many of the sequelae of OSA are strongly linked to the degree and duration of oxygen desaturation. Preoperative indices of oxygen desaturation have been linked to postoperative complications. In one study, preoperative oxygen desaturation index (ODI) greater than 29 events per hour, more than 7% of sleep duration with SpO2 less than 90%, and mean SpO2 less than 93% were identified as thresholds predictive of increased postoperative complications. Among patients with OSA, postoperative hypoxemia occurs mostly between postoperative nights two to five and may lead to serious consequences including poor wound healing, cardiac arrhythmias, and delirium.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is currently the first-line treatment for OSA. CPAP serves as a functional pneumatic upper airway splint, preventing airway collapse as well as the associated oxygen desaturation that may accompany respiratory events in sleep. With appropriate settings, CPAP is expected to treat sleep-disordered breathing and normalize oxygenation during sleep.

### Effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure versus mandibular advancement device in severe obstructive sleep apnea patients with mandibular retrognathia: A prospective clinical trial [^112UPFDN]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Some obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients may have mandibular retrognathia (ANB > 4.7° and SNB < 76.2°). Currently, there are no studies that have compared the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus mandibular advancement device (MAD) in severe OSA patients with mandibular retrognathia. This study explored the efficacy of CPAP versus MAD for the treatment of severe OSA patients with mandibular retrognathia.

- **Methods**: A total of 105 patients were enrolled. Outcomes were assessed using polysomnography, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Snore Scale (SS), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and compliance before treatment and after 6 and 12 months of treatment.

- **Results**: Continuous positive airway pressure was superior to MAD in improving polysomnographic outcomes and SS score, but reported compliance was higher on MAD. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of ESS score and SAS score. Obstructive sleep apnea patients with mandibular retrognathia showed greater improvement than those without mandibular retrognathia in terms of apnea-hypopnea index and oxygen desaturation index after MAD.

- **Conclusion**: Continuous positive airway pressure and MAD are both effective in treating severe OSA patients with mandibular retrognathia. Mandibular advancement device is a good alternative to CPAP in severe OSA patients with mandibular retrognathia. Mandibular advancement device is more effective in treating OSA patients with mandibular retrognathia than those without.

### Mean disease alleviation as a comprehensive metric for evaluating continuous positive airway pressure therapy in obstructive sleep apnea: Establishing reference values and clinical significance [^1174cUPR]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea poses significant health risks, warranting effective treatment strategies. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is widely used, but assessing treatment effectiveness remains complex. This study aimed to establish reference values for mean disease alleviation (MDA) in a large cohort treated with continuous positive airway pressure.

Data from the Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study were analyzed. A total of 352 participants underwent 6 months of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, with adherence and efficacy monitored objectively. MDA, calculated as the product of treatment efficacy and percentage adherence, was assessed. Age and sex differences in MDA and its association with sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores > 10) were evaluated using logistic regression and linear regression models.

The mean MDA in the 352 participants at 6 months was 53.85% ± 27.22%. Older participants demonstrated higher adherence and MDA compared to younger participants (58.2% ± 27.8% vs. 51.1% ± 27.4%, P = 0.047). Despite higher efficacy, females demonstrated lower adherence, yielding MDA levels comparable to those of males. Participants achieving MDA ≥ 40% had significantly lower odds of sleepiness (odds ratio = 0.40; 95% confidence interval: 0.23–0.70, P = 0.001). In linear regression models, MDA was significantly associated with a reduction in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores from baseline to 6 months (β = 0.146, P = 0.006), further supporting MDA as a robust predictor of treatment success.

### Chenodiol [^117A4EkF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Observed stone dissolution rates achieved with Chenodiol treatment are higher in subgroups having certain pretreatment characteristics. In the NCGS, patients with small (less than 15 mm in diameter) radiolucent stones observed a rate of complete dissolution of approximately 20% with a dosage of 750 mg/day. In the uncontrolled trials using 13 to 16 mg/kg/day doses of Chenodiol, the rates of complete dissolution for small radiolucent stones ranged from 42% to 60%. Even higher dissolution rates have been observed in patients with small floatable stones.

- **Floatable versus nonfloatable stones**: Some obese patients and occasional normal-weight patients fail to achieve bile desaturation even with Chenodiol doses up to 19 mg/kg/day for unknown reasons. Although dissolution is generally higher with increased dosage of Chenodiol, doses that are too low are associated with increased cholecystectomy rates (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Stones have recurred within five years in about 50% of patients following complete confirmed dissolutions. Although retreatment with Chenodiol has proven successful in dissolving some newly formed stones, the indications for and safety of retreatment are not well defined. Serum aminotransferase elevations and diarrhea have been notable in all clinical trials and are dose-related (refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS and WARNINGS sections for full information).

### Age and weight considerations for the use of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in pediatric populations: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^114zuZCg]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). High credibility.

This position statement provides guidance on age and weight considerations for using continuous positive airway pressure therapy in pediatric populations. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in pediatric sleep medicine to review the medical literature and develop a position statement based on a thorough review of these studies and their clinical expertise. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine Board of Directors approved the final position statement. It is the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that continuous positive airway pressure can be safe and effective for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in pediatric patients, even in children of younger ages and lower weights, when managed by a clinician with expertise in evaluating and treating pediatric obstructive sleep apnea. The clinician must make the ultimate judgment regarding any specific care in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, accessible treatment options, patient/parental preference, and resources.

### Clinical foundation for efficient treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^111FLFUa]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Only a few decades ago, the entity known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was unknown and untreated. Now, there is a rush to put literally millions of Americans on continuous positive airway pressure devices. Community practice standards are changing yearly under pressure from strong forces based on economic incentives for industry, government, and physicians, independent of the actual medical evidence supporting treatment and efficacy. Medicare has lowered the diagnostic threshold for diagnosis and reimbursement; the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revision 2 (2005), has allowed OSA to be diagnosed exclusively by a laboratory test without the patient having clinical symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness; and industry is poised to have the public buy computer-assisted continuous positive airway pressure machines without the need for a physician's prescription. Because of this paradigm shift away from physician-directed diagnosis and treatment, this article will critically evaluate the present state of medical evidence regarding the clinical foundation for treatment of OSA.

### Treating obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure benefits type 2 diabetes management [^115qXoBW]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are both common major public health concerns. Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggest that OSA may be a causal factor in the pathogenesis of T2DM. This review examines recent empirical developments in theory, research, and practice regarding T2DM and OSA. We first examined data from 10 studies covering 281 patients with T2DM who used continuous positive airway pressure therapy, followed by research describing how hypoxia/reoxygenation in OSA may be key triggers initiating or contributing to insulin resistance and inflammation. We then propose mechanisms that may relate diabetes with OSA. The issues that should be addressed in the future are outlined. We suggest that intervention with continuous positive airway pressure may improve diabetic symptoms and should be encouraged for patients with diabetes.

### Pitolisant for daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who refuse continuous positive airway pressure treatment. A randomized trial [^112Nnbt3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common disabling symptom in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of pitolisant, a selective histamine H3 receptor antagonist with wake-promoting effects, for the treatment of daytime sleepiness in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who refuse continuous positive airway pressure treatment.

The study was conducted as an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized (3:1), placebo-controlled, parallel-design trial. Pitolisant was individually titrated at up to 20 mg/day over 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Key secondary endpoints were the maintenance of wakefulness based on the Oxford Sleep Resistance test, safety, Clinical Global Impression of severity, patient's global opinion, EuroQol quality-of-life questionnaire, and Pichot fatigue questionnaire.

A total of 268 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (75% male; mean age, 52 years; apnea–hypopnea index, 49/h; baseline sleepiness score, 15.7) were randomized (200 to pitolisant and 68 to placebo) and analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was reduced more with pitolisant than with placebo (−2.8; 95% confidence interval, −4.0 to −1.5; P < 0.001). Wake maintenance tests were not improved. The Pichot fatigue score was reduced with pitolisant. The overall impact of pitolisant was confirmed by both physicians' and patients' questionnaires. The incidence of adverse events was mainly headache, insomnia, nausea, and other minor issues.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): Pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112N6ZkR]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of conservative management compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the prevention of symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease. This was a parallel group, pragmatic randomised, superiority trial conducted across 20 secondary care centres in the UK.

Participants included 434 adults over the age of 18 with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease who were referred to secondary care. These participants were assessed for eligibility between August 2016 and November 2019, and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either conservative management or laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either conservative management or surgical removal of the gallbladder.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary patient outcome was quality of life, measured by the area under the curve, over 18 months using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) bodily pain domain. Higher scores (range 0–100) indicated a better quality of life. Additional outcomes included costs to the NHS, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

- **Results**: Of the 2667 patients assessed for eligibility, 434 were randomised: 217 to the conservative management group and 217 to the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. By 18 months, 54 (25%) participants in the conservative management arm and 146 (67%) in the cholecystectomy arm had received surgery. The mean SF-36 norm-based bodily pain score was 49.4 (standard deviation 11.7) in the conservative management arm and 50.4 (11.6) in the cholecystectomy arm. The SF-36 bodily pain area under the curve up to 18 months did not differ significantly between these groups.
