## Question

Anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, including when to start, which agent to choose, how to dose and monitor, and how to handle special scenarios like cardioversion, ablation, and device-detected AF. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why anticoagulation matters. Then, I should verify stroke risk stratification and the thresholds that trigger therapy. Next, I will compare anticoagulant options and choose among DOACs and warfarin. After that, I need to check dosing, renal adjustments, and monitoring. I will then examine bleeding risk mitigation and peri-procedural management. Finally, I should review special populations, device-detected AF, and summarize a practical decision algorithm with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and the magnitude of benefit. Atrial fibrillation confers a roughly fivefold increase in ischemic stroke risk, and oral anticoagulation reduces stroke by about 60% in meta-analyses, with even larger risk reductions in on-treatment analyses, which establishes the core rationale for therapy in appropriately selected patients [^08b94442] [^a29f98b2].

> I need to verify stroke risk stratification and the thresholds that mandate therapy. Contemporary guidelines use CHA2DS2-VASc, and I should confirm the cut points: initiate anticoagulation when the score is ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, and consider anticoagulation when the score is 1 in men or 2 in women, with decisions individualized by bleeding risk and patient preference; importantly, the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent) does not change the indication, so I should not under-treat paroxysmal AF [^754f89b5] [^974e97a2] [^0000251d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antiplatelet therapy. I should confirm that aspirin is not an appropriate substitute for anticoagulation in AF. Multiple guidelines advise against aspirin monotherapy or aspirin plus clopidogrel for stroke prevention in AF when anticoagulation is not contraindicated, given inferior efficacy and persistent bleeding risk, so I need to ensure I do not default to antiplatelets in place of anticoagulation [^18e2cddd] [^30e8123f].

> Next, I should review agent selection. DOACs are preferred over warfarin in most patients with nonvalvular AF because they reduce stroke/systemic embolism and intracranial hemorrhage compared with warfarin; exceptions include moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves, where warfarin remains the standard, and I should double-check that I am not inadvertently choosing a DOAC in those settings [^f8863fc1] [^17b54ddf].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative advantages among DOACs. There are no head-to-head randomized trials, so I should align choices with patient-specific factors: apixaban has lower ICH and gastrointestinal bleeding in some analyses, dabigatran 150 mg has lower ischemic stroke but higher GI bleeding, rivaroxaban is once daily but may have more GI bleeding, and edoxaban 60 mg is effective with lower ICH; renal function, drug interactions, adherence, and cost should guide the selection, and I should confirm renal dosing for each agent before prescribing [^310cf6d5].

> I will now examine dosing and renal adjustments, because getting this wrong increases both thrombosis and bleeding. Apixaban is typically 5 mg twice daily, reduced to 2.5 mg if two of age ≥ 80, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL; dabigatran 150 mg twice daily is standard, reduced to 110 mg if age ≥ 80 or high bleeding risk, and avoided if CrCl < 30 mL/min; rivaroxaban 20 mg daily is standard, reduced to 15 mg if CrCl 15–50 mL/min; edoxaban 60 mg daily is standard, reduced to 30 mg if CrCl 15–50 mL/min, low body weight, or concomitant verapamil/dronedarone; I should confirm these at baseline and reassess renal function at least annually, more often if unstable [^notfound].

> Let me think about warfarin when it is indicated. I should confirm a target INR of 2.5 with a range of 2.0–3.0, aim for time in therapeutic range > 70%, and monitor INR frequently during initiation and when interacting drugs or diet change; I need to ensure I am not targeting a lower INR for convenience, as that sacrifices efficacy without clear bleeding benefit in most scenarios [^5536d21a] [^1c16a6e6].

> Next, I should review bleeding risk assessment and mitigation. HAS-BLED helps identify modifiable risks and prompts closer follow-up, but high bleeding risk alone should not preclude anticoagulation when stroke risk is elevated; instead, I should correct reversible risks (uncontrolled hypertension, labile INR, NSAIDs, alcohol excess) and consider lower-intensity strategies only in select cases, recognizing that the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation generally remains favorable even in higher bleeding risk patients [^e2f6d6ec] [^4982b803].

> I will now examine peri-procedural management. If uninterrupted anticoagulation is not feasible, temporary interruption without routine bridging is recommended for most DOAC users, with timing based on agent and renal function; bridging with LMWH is reserved for mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA; after low bleeding risk procedures, resume the day after, and after high bleeding risk procedures, resume between evening of day 2 and evening of day 3; for AF ablation, uninterrupted oral anticoagulation is recommended to reduce periprocedural stroke risk [^9b79f7dc] [^09ed3a47].

> But wait, what if the patient needs cardioversion. I should confirm that for AF of unknown duration or > 48 hours, therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after is recommended, or use a TEE-guided strategy if early cardioversion is needed; if a thrombus is seen, defer cardioversion and continue anticoagulation, with repeat imaging before attempting conversion [^2db2ad1a] [^6a3605b3].

> Let me consider device-detected AF and subclinical AF. Evidence is evolving, but current guidance suggests not anticoagulating very low burden AF (< 5 minutes) without other indications, whereas longer episodes, particularly ≥ 5 minutes, may warrant anticoagulation when CHA2DS2-VASc is ≥ 3 or equivalent stroke risk; I should acknowledge uncertainty and individualize decisions pending ongoing trials and patient preferences [^71e68c4b] [^c95dc30d] [^1ea9f9db].

> I should double-check special populations. In advanced CKD or dialysis, warfarin remains the standard because DOACs have limited or no evidence; in elderly patients, DOACs are still preferred, but I need to ensure appropriate dose reductions and fall risk mitigation; in patients with HCM or cardiac amyloidosis, guidelines recommend anticoagulation regardless of CHA2DS2-VASc score, so I must not under-treat these patients [^5c9080f1] [^b76ec526].

> Next, I should review the practical decision algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Calculate CHA2DS2-VASc and confirm valvular status; if score is ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, recommend anticoagulation; if score is 1 in men or 2 in women, consider anticoagulation via shared decision-making; if score is 0 in men or 1 in women, no routine anticoagulation; choose a DOAC when not contraindicated, otherwise warfarin; dose per renal function and interactions; assess bleeding risk with HAS-BLED and mitigate modifiable risks; plan peri-procedural interruption without routine bridging; and reassess stroke and bleeding risks periodically, at least annually, or with clinical changes [^754f89b5] [^974e97a2] [^0000251d].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making is explicit. Many patients who initially decline anticoagulation are willing to reconsider when engaged in discussion of absolute risk reduction, bleeding risk, and lifestyle considerations; underuse remains substantial, especially in paroxysmal AF, so I should revisit decisions over time and align therapy with patient values and evolving risk profiles [^702e0566] [^596cb03e].

Anticoagulation is indicated for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with elevated stroke risk, defined as **CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women** [^754f89b5], and should be considered for **1 additional stroke risk factor in men or 2 in women** [^974e97a2]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are **preferred over warfarin** for most patients without mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, as they reduce stroke and intracranial hemorrhage with less monitoring [^f8863fc1] [^17b54ddf]. Warfarin remains the choice for mechanical valves, moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, or severe renal impairment. Bleeding risk should be assessed with HAS-BLED, and anticoagulation should be periodically reassessed as risk evolves [^52741812] [^0000251d].

## Indications for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation

Anticoagulation is indicated based on **stroke risk stratification**, most commonly using the CHA2DS2-VASc score [^67320774]:

| **Cha2ds2-vasc score** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women | Initiate anticoagulation [^754f89b5] |
| 1 in men or 2 in women | Consider anticoagulation (shared decision-making) [^974e97a2] |
| 0 in men or 1 in women | No routine anticoagulation [^e2f6d6ec] |

---

Anticoagulation is recommended regardless of AF pattern (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) [^0000251d] because stroke risk is similar across patterns [^596cb03e].

---

## Choice of anticoagulant therapy

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) are **preferred over warfarin** for most patients with nonvalvular AF because they:

- Reduce stroke and systemic embolism [^f8863fc1]
- Lower intracranial hemorrhage risk [^f8863fc1]
- Require less monitoring [^310cf6d5]

---

### Warfarin

Warfarin remains indicated for patients with **mechanical heart valves** or **moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis** [^5c9080f1], and is an alternative when DOACs are contraindicated or unavailable. It requires INR monitoring with a target INR of 2.0–3.0 [^5536d21a].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjust DOACs based on creatinine clearance; avoid certain DOACs in severe renal impairment [^5c9080f1].
- **Peri-procedural management**: Temporarily interrupt anticoagulation based on bleeding risk and renal function; avoid routine bridging [^9b79f7dc].
- **Bleeding risk**: Assess with HAS-BLED; mitigate modifiable risks and reassess regularly [^e2f6d6ec].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to reassess stroke and bleeding risk, ensure adherence, and adjust therapy as needed [^0000251d]. For warfarin, **INR should be monitored regularly** to maintain therapeutic levels [^1c16a6e6].

---

Anticoagulation is indicated for AF patients with elevated stroke risk, with **DOACs preferred** for most and warfarin for specific valvular or renal scenarios. Regular reassessment ensures the net clinical benefit remains favorable [^52741812].

Upon follow-up, 119 patients in the BOAT-AF study were prescribed anticoagulation, as compared with 55 879 of 387 975 similar patients at other centers in the PINNACLE Registry. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study suggest that patients with AF who are not receiving anticoagulation are more willing to consider anticoagulation than their physicians. These data emphasize the need to revisit any prior decision against anticoagulation in a shared decision-making manner. Oral anticoagulation reduces thromboembolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation; however, underuse of anticoagulation is a major issue in treating patients with nonvalvular AF at high stroke risk.

1 Prior data from the American College of Cardiology's Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence Registry has found approximately 40% of patients are not receiving anticoagulants, with little change over time, despite the availability of the nonvitamin K antagonists. 2–4. In order to benchmark the patient and physician responses, we conducted an external review of the appropriateness of oral anticoagulation. Due to the absence of an already established appropriateness criteria for anticoagulation beyond the CHA2DS2-VASc score, the central committee used the best clinical judgment based on available guidelines. 9 Patients with AF and no clear contraindication were deemed appropriate. In the US-specific population sampled in the ORBIT-AF registry, 70% of 130 patients with newly diagnosed AF in the registry in 2010 were receiving oral anticoagulants.

By 2016, 79% of patients were prescribed oral anticoagulants, with 71% of patients being prescribed a NOAC. We also observed an increase in the use of oral anticoagulation — where 14% of patients who were not initially receiving anticoagulation started approximately 1 year later. This pattern was consistent between BOAT-AF and the PINNACLE Registry. Notably, the 14% increase in cases was lower than the 16. 9% of cases in which physicians and patients were initially agreeable to reconsider anticoagulation. This assessment of the clinical evidence of oral anticoagulants underuse supports development of new approaches to improve the appropriate use of oral anticoagulants in AF.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^08b94442]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The use of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate or high risk of stroke, estimated by established criteria, improves outcomes. However, to ensure that the benefits exceed the risks of bleeding, appropriate patient selection is essential. Vitamin K antagonism has been the mainstay of treatment; however, newer drugs with novel mechanisms are also available. These novel oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors) obviate many of warfarin's shortcomings, and they have demonstrated safety and efficacy in large randomized trials of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. However, the management of patients taking warfarin or novel agents remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations when selecting anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. This review will discuss the rationale for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation; risk stratification for treatment; available agents; the appropriate implementation of these agents; and additional, specific clinical considerations for treatment.

### Practical management of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^a2c1d643]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation has become more complex due to the introduction of new anticoagulant agents, the number and kinds of patients requiring therapy, and the interactions of those patients in the matrix of care. The management of anticoagulation has become a "team sport" involving multiple specialties in multiple sites of care. The American College of Cardiology, through the College's Anticoagulation Initiative, convened a roundtable of experts from multiple specialties to discuss topics important to the management of patients requiring anticoagulation and to make expert recommendations on issues such as the initiation and interruption of anticoagulation, quality of anticoagulation care, management of major and minor bleeding, and treatment of special populations. The attendees continued to work toward consensus on these topics, and present the key findings of this roundtable in a state-of- the-art review focusing on the practical aspects of anticoagulation care for the patient with atrial fibrillation.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was prescription of an OAC with warfarin sodium or a non–vitamin K antagonist OAC. Results. Patients with AF with a CHADS2 score of 3 and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 5 were most often prescribed anticoagulation at 50. 6% and
49. 7%, respectively. Oral anticoagulant prescription did not exceed 50% even in higher-risk patients, including patients with AF with a CHADS2 score exceeding 3 or a CHA2DS2-VASc score exceeding 4. In both unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses, each 1-point increase in the CHADS2 score and the CHA2DS2-VASc score was significantly associated with greater odds of both antiplatelet therapy and OAC prescription. Notably, for each 1-point increase in the CHADS2 score, patients with AF had a 16. 6% greater odds of OAC prescription vs no antithrombotic therapy prescription and a
15.

8% greater odds of OAC prescription vs aspirin-only prescription. Most important, despite the heightened bleeding risk with higher HAS-BLED scores, the benefit of anticoagulation continues to outweigh the risk as all of these scores increase. 27 In addition, risk factors for stroke, such as age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery disease and its equivalents, may necessitate treatment with aspirin or even aspirin plus thienopyridine dual antiplatelet therapy. Because dabigatran and rivaroxaban were approved toward the end of our study time frame, most patients prescribed an OAC in our cohort were prescribed warfarin. Our study time frame concluded in 2012, and it is possible that practice patterns may have changed since that time given the subsequent growing availability of several approved OACs.

Although 4 non–vitamin K antagonist OACs are now available in clinical practice, warfarin remains the most common drug prescription for anticoagulation in AF, 31 making these data relevant to contemporary practice.

### Ineligibility for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^7af7d1b4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although anticoagulation therapy markedly reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, up to 50% of these patients are deemed ineligible for anticoagulation. In this manuscript we provide a framework to assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation with an increased risk of bleeding. We also review recent data related to the novel oral anticoagulants targeting thrombin or factor Xa, and discuss how the introduction of these agents raises the distinction between eligibility for vitamin K antagonist therapy specifically, and eligibility for anticoagulation in general.

### New anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation management [^3d3aff7d]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Three new oral anticoagulants have been evaluated in large registration trials and are now available in many jurisdictions for patients with atrial fibrillation. Questions arise whether these drugs are equally effective and safe for all patients. Now when we are moving away from decades with only one orally available drug for anticoagulation there is opportunity to tailor the therapy according to patient characteristics and preferences. This review addresses the interaction of various patient characteristics with the treatment and what features can assist the physician in the choice of anticoagulant for the individual patient.

### Risk stratification for stroke in atrial fibrillation: a critique [^bbbdc5ed]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the demonstrable success of oral anticoagulants in reducing the rate of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, they continue to be seriously underutilized. Indications for their use as stated in the guidelines incorporate a number of risk score algorithms, the most widely used being the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Nonetheless there are several limitations to the various scores currently in clinical use and a critique of these is the focus of this review. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and its role in thromboembolic stroke risk. We amalgamate this with the basis of major professional society anticoagulation recommendations with regards to the strengths and limitations of current risk stratification strategies and discuss gaps in our current evidence base and next steps to address those gaps.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^310cf6d5]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^8a45aa58]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Guidelines Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations indicate that most patients would make the same choice and Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range 2.0–3.0, unless otherwise noted). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have had a prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, because of the high risk of future ischemic stroke faced by this set of patients (Grade 1A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have two or more of the risk factors for future ischemic stroke listed immediately below, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1A). Two or more of the following risk factors apply: age > 75 years, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure. In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, with only one of the risk factors listed immediately above, we recommend long-term antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1A), either as anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A), or as aspirin, at a dose of 75–325 mg/d (Grade 1B). In these patients at intermediate risk of ischemic stroke we suggest a VKA rather than aspirin (Grade 2A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, age ≤ 75 years and with none of the other risk factors listed above, we recommend long-term aspirin therapy at a dose of 75–325 mg/d (Grade 1B), because of their low risk of ischemic stroke. For patients with atrial flutter, we recommend that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF (Grade 1C). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA at an intensity appropriate for the specific type of prosthesis (Grade 1B). See CHEST 2008; 133(suppl):593S-629S. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, for 3 weeks before elective cardioversion and for at least 4 weeks after sinus rhythm has been maintained (Grade 1C). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacological or electrical cardioversion, we also recommend either immediate anticoagulation with unfractionated IV heparin, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or at least 5 days of warfarin by the time of cardioversion (achieving an INR of 2.0–3.0) as well as a screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). If no thrombus is seen, cardioversion is successful, and sinus rhythm is maintained, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks. If a thrombus is seen on TEE, then cardioversion should be postponed and anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely. We recommend obtaining a repeat TEE before attempting later cardioversion (Grade 1B addressing the equivalence of TEE-guided vs non-TEE-guided cardioversion). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without prolonged anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or LMWH at presentation (Grade 2C).

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^7d87dbb2]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation thresholds in atrial fibrillation — intermediate risk: although risk stratification schemes identify patients who benefit most and least from anticoagulation, the threshold for use of anticoagulation is controversial, and opinion is particularly divided about anticoagulation for those at intermediate risk (stroke rate 3% to 5% per year); some advocate routine anticoagulation at this level, whereas others favor selective anticoagulation with weight given to bleeding risks and preferences, and the threshold of benefit at which AF patients choose anticoagulation varies, with some at intermediate risk electing anticoagulation whereas others do not.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^f6c8cf98]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) antithrombotic therapy — stroke prevention conclusions state that stroke is a serious complication of AF with risk varying across patient groups and that antithrombotic prophylaxis is associated with increased bleeding risk; recommendations are based on net clinical benefit across varying stroke-risk levels. Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score ≥ 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, decisions require an individualized approach considering patient values and preferences, bleeding risk, and non-CHADS2 stroke risk factors. The role of oral anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in AF will evolve with results of large, ongoing, phase 3 RCTs of new oral anticoagulants and as experience with these new agents in clinical practice continues to grow.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation: a contemporary viewpoint [^68e0532d]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation is important. This review consists of three parts: chronic anticoagulation, anticoagulation for cardioversion, and a brief comment on anticoagulation around the time of left atrial radiofrequency ablation. The risk stratification scheme of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines for chronic anticoagulation is briefly reviewed. Although there are several other similar schemes, they are not identical. The key point is the balance between benefit and risk. Some emerging controversies are outlined. Two specific questions explored are: is well-controlled hypertension a risk factor, and does paroxysmal atrial fibrillation confer the same risk as continuous atrial fibrillation? Differences in the risk of bleeding while taking a vitamin K antagonist noted in recent compared with older data are discussed. Risk of bleeding in the elderly and combined antithrombotic therapy with a vitamin K antagonist and an antiplatelet agent in high-risk patients are briefly discussed. Recent failures of studies attempting to find a suitable alternative to vitamin K antagonists are outlined. The treatment guidelines for anticoagulation for cardioversion are briefly reviewed. The risk of thromboembolism according to international normalized ratio and use of low-molecular-weight heparin as an alternative to warfarin are discussed. Anticoagulation before and after left atrial radiofrequency ablation is empirical, and long-term anticoagulation seems advisable for high risk patients at the present time. The two most pressing needs for further investigation are (1) clarification, simplification, and consolidated of risk stratification schemes and treatment recommendations and (2) discovery of alternatives to warfarin.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e2f6d6ec]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### How I use anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^c5ef6979]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and conveys a significant risk of morbidity and mortality due to related stroke and systemic embolism. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the mainstay of thromboembolism prevention, and management of anticoagulation can be challenging. For patients without significant valvular disease, decisions around anticoagulation therapy are first based on the presence of additional stroke risk factors, as measured by the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75, diabetes, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74, and sex category [female]) score. Patients with increased CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores (by regional guidelines) should next be evaluated to determine if they are candidates for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) therapy. This should focus on assessment of concomitant valve disease and/or impaired renal function. In eligible patients, the cumulative data support a preference for NOACs over warfarin, as NOACs appear safer and more effective as a group. However, there are no direct, randomized comparisons between NOACs, and therefore, selecting among them can be difficult. In addition, important patient groups remain underrepresented in major clinical trials, and their management is often left to clinician judgment. Data from emerging clinical trials will help guide physicians; however, patient engagement in decisions regarding OAC management will remain vital to ensuring appropriate balance of risks and optimizing health outcomes.

Atrial fibrillation — nonpharmacological prevention of thromboembolism notes that obliteration of the left atrial appendage is an emerging option for patients who cannot safely undergo anticoagulation, but these approaches must presently be considered investigational, and indications have not been convincingly established; whether such mechanical measures will be comparably effective and safer than anticoagulation remains to be established.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — risk thresholds and number needed to treat — shows that patients with a stroke risk of 2% per year or less do not benefit substantially from oral anticoagulation because it would require treating 100 or more patients for 1 y to prevent a single stroke, whereas for high‑risk patients with stroke rates of 6% per year or greater the number needed‑to‑treat is 25 or fewer, strongly favoring anticoagulation; opinion remains divided about routine anticoagulation for patients at intermediate stroke risk (annual rate 3% to 5%).

### Updated guidelines on outpatient anticoagulation [^efc160e1]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians provides recommendations for the use of anticoagulant medications for several indications that are important in the primary care setting. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^7404dcae]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0): In patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) [intermittent AF] at high risk of stroke (ie, having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age > 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, we recommend antithrombotic therapy with either an oral VKA or aspirin, 325 mg/d, in this group of patients who are at intermediate risk of stroke (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF < 65 years old and with no other risk factors, we recommend aspirin, 325 mg/d (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+); the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA for 3 weeks before and for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, an alternative strategy is anticoagulation and screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (Grade 1B). If no thrombus is seen and cardioversion is successful, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1B). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin at presentation (Grade 2C).

Atrial fibrillation with recent stroke or TIA — antithrombotic management: Unless a clear contraindication exists, patients with a recent stroke or TIA should be treated with long-term anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy, there is no evidence that combining anticoagulation with an antiplatelet agent reduces the risk of stroke compared with anticoagulant therapy alone, and for those who sustain cardiocembolic events while receiving low-intensity anticoagulation, anticoagulation intensity should be increased to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 rather than routinely adding antiplatelet agents.

When surgical procedures require interruption of oral anticoagulant therapy for longer than 1 wk in high-risk patients, unfractionated heparin may be administered or low-molecular-weight heparin given by subcutaneous injection, although the efficacy of these alternatives in this situation is uncertain (Level of Evidence: C).

Atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation efficacy — Meta-analysis using intention-to-treat shows adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation reduces all stroke versus placebo with a risk reduction of 62% (95% CI 48% to 72%). By on-treatment analysis excluding patients not undergoing oral anticoagulation at the time of stroke, the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeded 80%. Among the randomized trials, 4 were placebo controlled; of the 2 that were double blinded with regard to anticoagulation, one was stopped early because of external evidence that oral anticoagulation was superior to placebo, and the other included no female subjects. In 3 trials dosing was regulated by prothrombin time ratio; 2 used INR target ranges of 2.5 to 4.0 and 2.0 to 3.0. Follow-up was generally between 1 and 2 y, with the longest 2.2 y.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

Atrial fibrillation — preventing thromboembolism (Class IIa) specifies that for primary prevention of thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular AF who have just 1 validated risk factor, antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable, based upon an assessment of bleeding risk, ability to safely sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences, listing age greater than or equal to 75 y, hypertension, HF, impaired LV function, or diabetes mellitus (Level of Evidence: A). For patients with nonvalvular AF who have 1 or more less well-validated risk factors, antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable for prevention of thromboembolism, including age 65 to 74 y, female gender, or CAD, and the choice of agent should be based upon bleeding risk, ability to safely sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to select antithrombotic therapy using the same criteria irrespective of the pattern (i.e., paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) of AF (Level of Evidence: B). In patients with AF who do not have mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is reasonable to interrupt anticoagulation for up to 1 wk without substituting heparin for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding (Level of Evidence: C).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — preventing thromboembolism (Class I) states that antithrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended for all patients with AF, except those with low risk or contraindications (Level of Evidence: A), and the selection of the antithrombotic agent should be based upon the absolute risks of stroke and bleeding and the relative risk and benefit for a given patient (Level of Evidence: A). For patients without mechanical heart valves at high risk of stroke, chronic oral anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended in a dose adjusted to achieve the target intensity of an INR of 2.0 to 3.0, unless contraindicated, and factors associated with high risk include prior thromboembolism and rheumatic mitral stenosis (Level of Evidence: A). Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended for patients with more than 1 moderate risk factor, including age 75 y or greater, hypertension, HF, impaired LV systolic function (ejection fraction 35% or less or fractional shortening less than 25%), and diabetes mellitus (Level of Evidence: A). INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of therapy and monthly when anticoagulation is stable (Level of Evidence: A). Aspirin, 81–325 mg daily, is recommended as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists in low-risk patients or in those with contraindications to oral anticoagulation (Level of Evidence: A). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, the target intensity of anticoagulation should be based on the type of prosthesis, maintaining an INR of at least 2.5 (Level of Evidence: B). Antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with atrial flutter as for those with AF (Level of Evidence: C).

In patients with AF who sustain ischemic stroke or systemic embolism during treatment with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0), rather than add an antiplatelet agent, it may be reasonable to raise the intensity of anticoagulation to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 (Level of Evidence: C).

### Comparing the guidelines: anticoagulation therapy to optimize stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^f170f6ab]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for stroke. According to a pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials with warfarin, anticoagulation therapy reduces stroke risk by 62%. However, clinicians must decide whether the benefit of long-term anticoagulation therapy with available agents outweighs the risk of bleeding for individual patients. Guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians and by the joint American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology task force recommend antithrombotic therapy to protect AF patients from stroke based on risk-stratification algorithms. Risk factors for stroke AF patients include age ≥ 75 years; hypertension; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; congestive heart failure; and history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism. Patients at high risk for stroke experience greater absolute benefit from anticoagulation therapy than patients at low risk. The guidelines are consistent in recommendations for high-risk patients (warfarin therapy, international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0) and low-risk patients (aspirin 325 mg), but differ for intermediate-risk patients with diabetes or heart disease. The guidelines continue to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to incorporate new clinical data, including the CHADS(2) algorithm for determining risk and the results of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial, the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation study, and the Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation II to V trials.

### Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines on atrial fibrillation: a commentary [^14e476f1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide a commentary on the recommendations for stroke prevention from the 2012 focused update of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation and the evidence (or lack of it) supporting these recommendations. These guidelines strongly advocate a major clinical practice shift towards initially focusing on the identification of 'truly low risk' patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy. After this initial decision-making step, effective stroke prevention - that is, oral anticoagulation therapy (whether as well-controlled adjusted dose warfarin or with one of the novel oral anticoagulants) - could be offered to patients with atrial fibrillation with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. The 2012 focused update guideline also provides additional guidance on advances in stroke and bleeding risk assessment that are evident since publication of the 2010 guideline, as well as recommendations on the use of the novel oral anticoagulants and the left atrial appendage occlusion devices that have been increasingly used in European clinical practice over the last 2 years.

Anticoagulation intensity targets in atrial fibrillation (AF) — For patients with nonvalvular AF, an INR of 1.6 to 3.0 is efficacious and relatively safe; for primary prevention in most AF patients under age 75 y and for secondary prevention, an INR of 2.5 (target range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended, whereas a target INR of 2.0 (target range 1.6 to 2.5) seems reasonable for primary prevention in patients older than 75 y at high risk of bleeding. Maximum protection against ischemic stroke in AF is probably achieved at an INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, whereas an INR range of 1.6 to 2.5 is associated with incomplete efficacy, estimated at approximately 80% of that achieved with higher-intensity anticoagulation; trials targeting INR 1.4 to 2.8 (estimated mean achieved 2.0 to 2.1) found the largest relative risk reductions, but among AF patients with prior stroke or TIA, targeting 2.2 to 3.5 versus 1.5 to 2.1 found a greater rate of major hemorrhage with the higher intensity. Low-intensity anticoagulation requires special efforts to minimize time below the target range because stroke protection is sharply reduced; major bleeding across 5 randomized trials was 1.2% per year, and contemporary intracerebral hemorrhage rates are typically 0.1% to 0.6%.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^69a61efe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC atrial fibrillation — newly discovered atrial fibrillation: When AF persists, one option is to accept progression to permanent AF with antithrombotic therapy and control of the ventricular rate, and the diagnosis of AF in a patient with risk factors for thromboembolism should prompt long-term anticoagulation. Although it may seem reasonable to make at least one attempt to restore sinus rhythm, the AFFIRM study showed no difference in survival or quality of life with rate-control compared with rhythm-control strategies, so the decision to attempt restoration of sinus rhythm should be based on the severity of arrhythmia-related symptoms and the potential risk of antiarrhythmic drugs, with anticoagulation and rate control important before cardioversion. In patients with AF present for more than 3 mo, early recurrence is common after cardioversion, and antiarrhythmic medication may be initiated before cardioversion (after adequate anticoagulation) to reduce the likelihood of recurrence, with the duration of drug therapy brief (e.g., 1 mo).

### Risk factors for stroke and thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation: what happens in daily clinical practice? The GEFAUR-1 study [^7795affa]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

We determine the risk for stroke of patients with atrial fibrillation in the emergency department (ED) and analyze the use of stroke prophylaxis in this setting.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study carried out in 12 EDs. Clinical variables, risk factors for stroke, the prophylaxis prescribed, and the reasons for not initiating anticoagulation were collected. Risk factors and indications for therapy were evaluated according to the American College of Chest Physicians' 1998 recommendations.

Results

Of 1,178 patients included, 69% were not taking anticoagulants. Of the latter, 89% patients had indications for anticoagulation (age > 75 years 59%, hypertension 56%, cardiac disorders 29%, heart failure 22%, diabetes 22%, previous embolism 14%), and 63% of the patients had 2 or more risk factors. Anticoagulation was prescribed in the ED to 27% of patients (67% with warfarin, 33% low-weight heparin plus warfarin), antiplatelets to 20% of patients, and no thromboprophylaxis to 53% of these eligible patients. Anticoagulants were prescribed in only 9% of patients with risk factors and current prophylaxis with antiplatelet agents. The main reasons for not prescribing anticoagulation in the presence of risk factors were advanced age (11%), contraindication for anticoagulation (27%), or because it was not considered to be indicated by the physicians (23%).

Conclusion

Most patients seen in the ED with atrial fibrillation are at high risk of stroke. Despite this risk, anticoagulation is underused in this setting, mainly because of the influence of advanced age on medical decisions and the reluctance to change current antiplatelet therapy.

The North American Thrombosis Forum Atrial Fibrillation Action Initiative consensus document is a comprehensive yet practical briefing document focusing on stroke and bleeding risk assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as recommendations regarding anticoagulation options and management. Despite the breadth of clinical trial data and guideline recommendation updates, many clinicians continue to struggle to synthesize the disparate information available. This problem slows the uptake and utilization of updated risk prediction tools and adoption of new oral anticoagulants.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — pericardioversion anticoagulation: Anticoagulation is recommended for 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion for patients with AF of unknown duration or with AF for more than 48 h, and when acute AF produces hemodynamic instability, immediate cardioversion should not be delayed, but intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated before cardioversion. Pooled data indicate that 98% of clinical thromboembolic events occur within 10 d, supporting administration of an anticoagulant for at least 4 wk after cardioversion and that continuation for a considerably longer period may be warranted even after apparently successful cardioversion. In a multicenter randomized study (n = 1222), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided and conventional strategies using anticoagulation 3 wk before and 4 wk after cardioversion showed comparably low risks of stroke (0.81% with the TEE approach and 0.50% with the conventional approach). For patients with atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, anticoagulation should be considered with either strategy, and anticoagulation can be beneficial according to the recommendations as for patients with AF.

Antiplatelet therapy in atrial fibrillation — evidence and directive: A meta-analysis of AF trials from the 1990s and early 2000s found that while antiplatelet therapy reduced stroke and systemic embolism compared with placebo, antiplatelet therapy was inferior to warfarin. In AVERROES, the trial was stopped early due to the benefit of apixaban over aspirin to prevent stroke or systemic embolism, with similar major bleeding between arms; in ACTIVEW, the trial was stopped prematurely due to the superiority of anticoagulation with VKAs. Unless there is an indication for antiplatelet therapy such as CAD or vascular disease, patients with AF should not be prescribed antiplatelet therapy to reduce stroke risk.

### Is there a role for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation? [^9d3e5426]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies have indicated that outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation who are managed with rate control and anticoagulation are similar to those in patients who have maintenance of sinus rhythm. These studies did not include important groups of patients with atrial fibrillation in whom antiarrhythmic therapy may be appropriate. This perspective argues for the maintenance of sinus rhythm and for the use of antiarrhythmic therapy that includes medications, invasive procedures, and a combination of both in appropriate patients.

### Contemporary approach to stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: risks, benefits, and new options [^b203b692]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common diagnosis affecting nearly 3 million adults in the United States. Morbidity and mortality in these patients is driven largely by the associated increased risk of thromboembolic complications, especially stroke. Atrial fibrillation is a stronger risk factor than hypertension, coronary disease, or heart failure and is associated with an approximately five-fold increased risk. Mitigating stroke risk can be challenging and requires accurate assessment of stroke risk factors and careful selection of appropriate therapy. Anticoagulation, including the more recently introduced direct oral anticoagulants, is the standard of care for most patients. In addition, emerging non-pharmacologic mechanical interventions are playing an expanding role in reducing stroke risk in select patients. In this review we highlight the current approach to stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation and discuss in detail the mechanism, risks, and benefits of current and evolving therapies.

Conclusions

We found that the use of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with AF newly recommended for anticoagulation under the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines did not result in a reduction in the composite risk of stroke, SE, and death; yet, it was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. These results do not support the changes to anticoagulant therapy recommended by the 2014 guidelines; however, further research is needed to evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation in this cohort with low to moderate risk.

### Combining antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy (triple therapy): what are the risks and benefits? [^40043fb2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Most patients with mechanical heart valves and many patients with atrial fibrillation will require long-term anticoagulation therapy. For patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, only warfarin is indicated. However, for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at increased risk for embolic stroke, one of the newer antithrombotic medications, such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and apixaban, also can be used. Patients with indications for antithrombotic therapy often will have coexisting vascular disease, such as coronary artery disease, requiring concomitant antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone or more commonly with a dual antiplatelet regimen, aspirin and clopidogrel, or prasugrel or ticagrelor. The risks and benefits of this approach are still not well defined, and current guidelines have included recommendations based primarily on expert opinion.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers an increased risk of ischemic stroke or thromboembolism that is reduced by long-term oral anticoagulant therapy. Until recently, the latter has typically been one from the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) class of drugs. Although highly effective, VKAs have limitations, and their use is challenging for both patients and clinicians. A new generation of oral anticoagulant drugs is emerging, including several drugs that appear to be viable alternatives to VKAs in AF patients.

Atrial fibrillation — interruption of anticoagulation for procedures is addressed as follows: In patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is generally appropriate to substitute unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent thromboembolism; in patients with AF without mechanical valves, anticoagulation may be interrupted for a period of up to 1 wk for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding without substituting heparin, with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin administered intravenously or subcutaneously in high-risk patients or when longer interruption is required. Low-molecular-weight heparins have pharmacological advantages including more predictable bioavailability (greater than 90% after subcutaneous injection).

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

### Use of oral anticoagulation in a real-world population with device detected atrial fibrillation [^1ea9f9db]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Current US guidelines strongly support the use of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ≥ 2 stroke risk factors, without regard of AF duration or burden. 1 Device‐detected AF of various durations, often referred to as subclinical AF, has been shown to be associated with increased stroke risk, though at a rate less than that of clinically detected AF. 2, 3, 4 Anticoagulation recommendations for clinical AF are based on studies of stroke risk in the clinical AF population. 1 While patients may have both clinical and subclinical AF, the increasing use of implantable and consumer‐grade technologies capable of detecting AF will likely increase the latter population significantly. There is, however, considerable clinical equipoise about the management of these episodes of subclinical AF, particularly those that are paroxysmal and of short duration. Even the 2019 update of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines noted that it is not yet clear what the optimal management strategy is in these patients with regards to anticoagulation. 1 There are trials currently being conducted to answer this question, but in the meantime, clinicians are presented with such clinical scenarios daily. 5, 6

A recent statement from the American Heart Association noted the considerable evidence gap in answering this clinical question. 7 Given the uncertainty of anticoagulation management in device‐detected AF and the absence of randomized trial results for guidance, it is of interest to determine the practice patterns of anticoagulation use in patients with device‐detected AF among US physicians.

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation — synopsis and supportive text — states that prevention "is important in patients with AF to maximize survival, health, and QOL", and therapy selection "should be guided by the patient's risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and individual preferences". Decisions "should" be based on stroke risk "regardless of the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent)" and "should be periodically reassessed since a patient's risk, eligibility, and preferences can change over time". Supportive text adds that although risk is higher with more persistent AF, therapy "should be based on the risk of stroke and not the pattern of AF", and that "Treatment effects with oral anticoagulation are consistent across AF patterns". Ongoing follow-up is emphasized: "Typically, periodic assessment should be performed once a year but might need to be performed more frequently" with clinical changes such as "reduction in renal function or development of additional risk factors".

### Differences in anticoagulant therapy prescription in patients with paroxysmal versus persistent atrial fibrillation [^596cb03e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation experience a similar risk of thromboembolism. Therefore, consensus guidelines recommend anticoagulant therapy in those at risk for thromboembolism irrespective of atrial fibrillation classification. We sought to examine whether there are differences in rates of appropriate oral anticoagulant treatment among patients with paroxysmal vs persistent atrial fibrillation in real-world cardiology practices.

Methods

We studied 71,316 outpatients with atrial fibrillation and intermediate to high thromboembolic risk (CHADS2 score ≥ 2) enrolled in the American College of Cardiology PINNACLE Registry between 2008 and 2012. Using hierarchical modified Poisson regression models adjusted for patient characteristics, we examined whether anticoagulant treatment rates differed between patients with paroxysmal vs persistent atrial fibrillation.

Results

The majority of outpatients (78.4%, n = 55,905) had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In both unadjusted and multivariable adjusted analyses, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were less frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant therapy than those with persistent atrial fibrillation (50.3% vs 64.2%; adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.76). Instead, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were prescribed more frequently only antiplatelet therapy (35.1% vs 25.0%; adjusted RR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.69–1.86) or neither antiplatelet nor anticoagulant therapy (14.6% vs 10.8%; adjusted RR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.26–1.44; P < .0001 for differences across all 3 comparisons).

Conclusions

In a large, real-world cardiac outpatient population, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a moderate to high risk of stroke were less likely to be prescribed appropriate oral anticoagulant therapy and more likely to be prescribed less effective or no therapy for thromboembolism prevention.

### Intracranial and fatal bleeding according to indication for long-term oral anticoagulant therapy [^3af35aa9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Rate of major bleeding is generally accepted as a good measure of the risks associated with anticoagulant therapy, but this may not be true if the proportion of major bleeds with the most serious consequences differs according to the indication for anticoagulant therapy.

Objective

To determine whether the indication for long-term oral anticoagulant therapy influences the proportion of major bleeds that are intracranial and fatal.

Patients/Methods

Two authors abstracted intracranial and fatal bleeds from randomized trials of patients who received anticoagulant therapy for a minimum of 6months for atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, venous thromboembolism, prosthetic heart valves and ischemic stroke.

Results

There were 877 major bleeds among 23,518 patients in 39 studies. The proportion of bleeds that were intracranial was significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke (36%; 95% CI, 22–52%; P = 0.02) compared with patients with venous thromboembolism (10%; 95% CI, 5–20%). The difference in the proportion of bleeds that were intracranial among atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, venous thromboembolism and prosthetic heart valves was not statistically significant; however, the estimates varied from 10% to 27%. The proportion of bleeds that were fatal did not differ significantly according to indication, but varied from 8% to 20%. For all indications for anticoagulation, intracranial bleeds were much more likely to be fatal than extracranial major bleeds (44% vs. 4% overall).

Conclusions

In current practise, the indication for oral anticoagulant therapy has limited influence on the proportion of major bleeds that are intracranial or fatal.

### Benefits and risks of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^89060295]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the most common clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia in the United States. It increases both the risk for and the severity of strokes and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, decreased quality of life, and related health care costs. Guidelines recommend anticoagulation therapy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Clinical trials have established that vitamin K antagonists are effective for stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation for whom anticoagulation is recommended. However, vitamin K antagonists remain underutilized for a variety of reasons, including drug, physician, and patient factors. While vitamin K antagonists considerably reduce the risk of stroke, the absolute risk reduction varies according to individual patient risk factors. Accurately assessing each patient's true risk of stroke and bleeding is essential when determining which (if any) antithrombotic strategy should be used. Several stroke risk stratification schemes exist; of these, CHADS(2) is widely employed and simple. New, more sophisticated schemes may generate more precise risk estimates and better identify those patients for whom anticoagulant therapy offers a net clinical benefit. More studies are needed to determine the utility of bleeding risk stratification systems, as well as the role of surgical and interventional alternatives to anticoagulation treatment. Several novel oral anticoagulants are in (or have completed) phase 3 clinical trials. Dabigatran etexilate, approved in the United States in October 2010 for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, now offers the first oral alternative to warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^40ff92d3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a 5‐fold increase in stroke and thromboembolism risk. 1 Oral anticoagulation has been shown to reduce this risk by ≈60% 2; however, anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding. Although the benefits of stroke prevention outweigh the risk of bleeding in patients with moderate to high risk of stroke, 3 the benefit/risk ratio of anticoagulation in patients with low risk remains unclear. In March 2014, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) updated their guidelines for the use of anticoagulation in patients with AF, recommending oral anticoagulation therapy for patients with CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc ≥ 2. 3 Before 2014, only patients with CHADS 2 ≥ 2 were recommended for anticoagulation. 4 CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc are 2 validated scores that predict the risk of stroke in patients with AF: CHADS 2 score is calculated as the sum of 6 points: 1 for congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and age older than 75 years, and 2 for a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. 5 In addition to these factors, female sex, vascular disease, and age 65 to 74 years are assigned 1 point in the calculation of the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, and age older than 75 years is assigned 2, for a possible sum of 9 points. 5

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^d4a72c9a]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — intermediate stroke risk (CHADS2 score = 1) management: For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at intermediate risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score = 1), "we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1B)". The guideline also states "We suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B)". Quantified 1-year effects for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy include, versus no therapy, "five fewer deaths and 15 fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients at the cost of eight more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds"; versus aspirin, VKA is anticipated to "prevent nine nonfatal strokes for every 1,000 patients treated for 1 year compared with aspirin but will result in three additional bleeds and no reduction in all-cause mortality"; and versus aspirin plus clopidogrel, VKA is expected to result in "six fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients over a 1-year period, anywhere from four fewer to three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds, and no reduction in all-cause mortality". For patients unsuitable for or choosing not to take an oral anticoagulant for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding, such as "difficulty maintaining a stable INR, lifestyle limitations of regular INR monitoring, dietary restrictions that are too burdensome, or costs of new anticoagulant drugs that are too high", the text states that combination aspirin and clopidogrel "provides additional benefit of stroke reduction at the cost of additional bleeding" and that they "should be informed that they are choosing an inferior treatment with regard to stroke prevention".

### Triple oral antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation and coronary artery stenting [^ce6145c5]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation affected by an acute coronary syndrome have indications for oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor after coronary artery stenting. The concurrent use of all 3 agents, termed triple oral antithrombotic therapy, significantly increases the risk of bleeding. To date, there is a lack of evidence on the proper combination and duration of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in patients with indications for both therapies. As such, care has been guided by expert opinion, and there is wide variation in clinician practice. In this review, the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of triple oral antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation after coronary artery stenting is summarized. We discuss the clinical risk scores useful in guiding the prediction of stroke, bleeding, and stent thrombosis. Additionally, we highlight where additional evidence is needed to determine the proper balance of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in this patient population.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) oral anticoagulation — For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, we suggest dabigatran 150 mg twice daily rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (target international normalized ratio [INR] range, 2.0–3.0) (Grade 2B). Remarks specify that dabigatran is excreted primarily by the kidney, is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less), and that there is no antidote for dabigatran.

In 2011, key trials with oral factor Xa inhibitors in patients with atrial fibrillation highlighted promising data on these novel anticoagulants. Patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors can be considered for oral anticoagulation. These novel, fixed-dose drugs are given without monitoring, so clinicians must learn to balance stroke and bleeding risks.

### Oral anticoagulant use around the time of atrial fibrillation ablation: a review of the current evidence of individual oral anticoagulant use for periprocedural atrial fibrillation ablation thromboembolic prophylaxis [^6a392683]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and ablation is becoming more prevalent as a treatment option. Appropriate treatment of atrial fibrillation mandates thromboembolic prophylaxis, and atrial fibrillation ablation periprocedural management of oral anticoagulation is paramount because of the unique susceptibility for thromboembolism that exists for a patient undergoing ablation. Uninterrupted warfarin therapy is the current standard approach for periprocedural atrial fibrillation anticoagulation. Novel oral anticoagulants, including direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, are being used more frequently for thromboembolic prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation patients, but the best strategy for using novel oral anticoagulants in periprocedural anticoagulation is unknown. Optimal periprocedural anticoagulation management strategies with oral anticoagulants, limitations of using novel oral anticoagulants, and future directions in this field are discussed.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke: a practical guide [^0bc38d1e]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurologists and stroke physicians will be familiar with atrial fibrillation as a major cause of ischaemic stroke, and the role of anticoagulation in preventing cardioembolic stroke. However, making decisions about anticoagulation for individual patients remains a difficult area of clinical practice, balancing the serious risk of ischaemic stroke against that of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation management requires interdisciplinary collaboration with colleagues in cardiology and haematology. Recent advances, especially the now-widespread availability of direct oral anticoagulants, have brought opportunities to improve stroke care while posing new challenges. This article gives an overview of the contemporary diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation, and the associated evidence base. Where there is uncertainty, we describe our own approach to these areas, while highlighting ongoing research that will likely guide future practice.

### Is concomitant aspirin helping novel oral anticoagulants? Focus on apixaban [^47fa9464]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Apixaban is the third novel oral anticoagulant approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the reduction in the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban showed a significant reduction in mortality as well as a reduction in strokes compared with warfarin in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial. However, it is unclear how much of this 'benefit' was derived from the negative benefit to risk ratio (RR) when combining aspirin with warfarin compared with warfarin alone. Approximately one-third of patients received combination warfarin-acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy in ARISTOTLE at baseline (31.3% on apixaban, 30.5% on warfarin), with approximately 20–25% of patients receiving aspirin with long-term anticoagulation, despite the fact that only 14% of patients randomised to warfarin had a definitive indication for concomitant aspirin therapy (ie, patients having a previous myocardial infarction (MI)). Most patients receiving aspirin had arterial vascular disease, but the majority did not have a recent MI, which is a more appropriate indication for concomitant warfarin-ASA therapy (ie, a history of MI < 6 months, depending on the stent used). The high percentage of warfarin-ASA use in ARISTOTLE, despite no clear indication for many of these individuals, introduces a significant confounder. Did aspirin increase the harm in patients on warfarin over and above what would be seen in patients receiving apixaban?

### Evidence summary… [^653d3fd4]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence Summary Family physicians are often faced with the dilemma of balancing the benefit of stroke prevention with the risk of major bleeding when deciding on anticoagulation treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation. Over the past 10 years, several decision support tools have been developed and validated to assess the risk of major bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants. Major bleeding is typically defined as bleeding that requires hospitalization or transfusion, or a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 2 g per dL. Most tools share common risk factors, such as advanced age, previous bleeding, and renal/liver impairment. 1, 2 The ATRIA tool includes five risk factors and was developed in a study of 9, 186 patients with nontransient, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were receiving warfarin, with five-year follow-up. 3 The major limitation is the lack of information about aspirin use in the study patients. The HAS-BLED tool includes seven risk factors and was developed in a study of 3, 978 patients with nontransient, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were receiving oral anticoagulant monotherapy, an oral anticoagulant combined with an antiplatelet drug, an antiplatelet drug alone, or no anti-thrombotic therapy. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared the two scores in the high-bleeding-risk category. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of HAS-BLED for predicting high bleeding risk were 41% and 78%, respectively, compared with 23% and 91% for ATRIA. 12 The study was limited because it included heterogeneous studies, not all patients were anticoagulated, and different anticoagulants were used. Overall, the HAS-BLED tool appears to be more sensitive and easy-to-use, and thus is recommended for assessment of major bleeding risk.

Applying the Evidence A 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, stroke, and moderate dementia presented at a routine office visit with atrial fibrillation and a normal ventricular rate. She was not in discomfort. It was not clear how long she had been in atrial fibrillation. She used a walker for ambulation. She did not drink alcohol but took aspirin in addition to other medications. She had no history of major bleeding, renal disease, or liver disease.

Anticoagulation risk assessment — Recommendations for anticoagulation are now made based on yearly thromboembolic event risk using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc, and for patients at an intermediate annual risk score who remain uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation, consideration of other risk variables or other clinical risk scores can improve prediction, facilitate shared decision making, and incorporate into the electronic medical record.

### AFib treatment: general population [^ce1930da]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

When primary care physicians are presented with a patient with atrial fibrillation (AFib), there are two concerns. (online video available at: http://education.amjmed.com/video.php?event_id = 445&stage_id = 5&vcs = 1). One is the choice of strategy to treat the AFib, ie, whether to use rate control or a rhythm control strategy (to keep patients in sinus rhythm). The second concern is preventing the principal risk associated with AFib: stroke and systemic embolism. The focus of this review is stroke prevention, concentrating on risk assessment and traditional versus the new oral anticoagulation agents. For the past several decades, oral anticoagulation therapy has meant warfarin, which has the benefit of > 50 years of clinical experience: it is inexpensive, it has generic availability, and it has a wide range of clinical use indications beyond merely stroke prophylaxis in patients with AFib. On the other hand, only about half of the patients who should be receiving warfarin are prescribed it (and even fewer older patients are prescribed it), and only 30% of patients maintain time in therapeutic range (TTR) for serum warfarin levels at or above INR 2–3. According to a recent survey, almost a quarter of physicians employ rhythm control to treat AFib, and many of these believe that rhythm control decreases stroke and mortality risk sufficiently that anticoagulation therapy is not necessary. In addition, many physicians believe that when AFib is paroxysmal as opposed to permanent, then risk of stroke is low enough that long-term anticoagulation is not necessary. As discussed in this review, however, neither of these beliefs is true. Regarding bleeding risk, the same survey found that physicians perceive the risks of anticoagulation to be far greater than the benefits. Again, the evidence reveals that the patients at highest risk of bleeding are also at highest risk of stroke, and the benefits of preventing stroke with anticoagulation therapy almost always outweigh the risk of bleeding. This is discussed in the context of the new NOACs (discussed in the next review), including addressing what physicians should do if patients move from warfarin to one of the NOACs or vice versa. A final challenge for physicians treating patients with AFib has been the often mistaken belief that patients are at a low-risk status, and this review concludes with an overview of the use of the CHADS2 versus the CHA2DS2-VASc risk scoring systems, including why CHA2DS2-VASc provides a better assessment of which patients are or are not at low risk.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation stroke risk stratified by CHADS2 — nonanticoagulated versus aspirin: In the ATRIA cohort with a single stroke risk factor (32% of the cohort) who were not anticoagulated, the rate of stroke and systemic embolism was 1.5% per year (95% CI 1.2% to 1.9%). Of 670 patients treated with aspirin in 6 clinical trials, the stroke rate was 2.2% per year for those with a CHADS2 score of 1 (95% CI 1.6% to 3.1% per year).

### Stroke prevention in atrial… [^563638d7]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Clinical Trials of Anticoagulation in Nonvalvular AF General consensus has been reached regarding the recommendations for anticoagulation in patients with rheumatic AF. However, until recently, clear-cut recommendations have not been available for management of patients with nonvalvular AF. Since 1989, many large, prospective, randomized trials have been conducted to evaluate the risks and benefits of warfarin or aspirin therapy in the prevention of stroke. The results of these trials provide a strong foundation for recommendations regarding the use of anticoagulation therapy in patients with nonvalvular AF.

A reduction in the risk of thromboembolism with anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents as compared with placebo was noted in the following trials: the Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation Aspirin and Anticoagulation Study, 8 the Boston Area Anticoagulation Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, 15 the Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation Study 16 and the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation trial. 6, 7, 17–19. 20 the incidence of an embolic event was
0. 8 percent in the group receiving anticoagulant therapy, compared with 5. 3 percent in the group not receiving anticoagulant therapy. These results are impressive because the number of patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension and rheumatic heart disease was greater in the anticoagulation group than in the group not receiving anticoagulation.

Based on these observations, it is generally recommended that anticoagulation be instituted for three weeks before cardioversion is attempted in patients with AF of more than two days' duration. To minimize thromboembolic complications, anticoagulants should be continued for four weeks after cardioversion. This period is required for recovery of atrial mechanical contractility after conversion to a sinus rhythm. Such a recommendation is based more on tradition and theory than on findings from controlled trials. Final Comment Anticoagulation with warfarin is clearly beneficial in patients with non-rheumatic AF who are at moderate risk for stroke and have a low risk of bleeding as a result of anticoagulation. 26, 27 Anticoagulation with warfarin should also be instituted in patients with a high risk of emboli unless the risk of bleeding is very high.

### Key recommendations… [^5c9080f1]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Anticoagulation is recommended for AF at a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score of 2 for men and 3 for women without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. The score has not been validated for mitral stenosis or mechanical valves.
- Direct oral anticoagulants are recommended over warfarin for AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. Warfarin is still recommended for mitral stenosis and mechanical valves.
- Although CHA 2DS 2-VASc scores of 0 for men and 1 for women do not require treatment, scores of 1 for men and 2 for women are indeterminate and anticoagulation may be considered by shared decision-making. Key Recommendations HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE Based on high-quality evidence, oral anticoagulants should be prescribed for women with AF and a CHA.

Direct oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are preferred to warfarin unless the patient has concomitant moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Based on new data, the recommended set-points for anticoagulation have been increased, and the previous recommendation to prescribe an anticoagulant for all patients with AF who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack has been removed. For patients taking warfarin, an international normalized ratio test is recommended at least every week at the start of treatment and monthly when stable within the recommended range. Warfarin is the recommended anticoagulant for patients with AF and moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Dabigatran should be avoided in patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve.

Renal and hepatic function should be assessed before initiating direct oral anticoagulant therapy, then at least each year thereafter. Based on expert opinion, patients with AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve who are taking warfarin, but whose international normalized ratio is not being maintained in a therapeutic range, should have their treatment regimen changed to a direct oral anticogulant. Because there are no data indicating that the benefits are greater than the harms, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban should be avoided in patients with AF and ESRD or on dialysis.

Periprocedural anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation when uninterrupted therapy is not feasible — interruption and resumption: If a procedure cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging is recommended (1) excluding those with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve; the timing of interruption of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk (1); bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA (3: Harm); and resumption of anticoagulation is the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery (2a).
