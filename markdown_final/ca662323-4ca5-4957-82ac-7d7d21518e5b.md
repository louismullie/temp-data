## Question

Why we take CT prior lumper puncture in case of meningitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why we obtain a head CT before lumbar puncture in suspected meningitis, and under what circumstances CT is actually indicated versus when it should be avoided to prevent harmful delays. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic risk of herniation and whether LP can precipitate it. Then, I should verify which clinical features predict mass effect or brain shift on CT and thus constitute a true contraindication to immediate LP. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for CT before LP across societies and reconcile differences. After that, I need to quantify the harms of unnecessary CT, including delays to antibiotics and loss of CSF culture yield. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state the bottom line clearly, anchoring to high-quality evidence and contemporary guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiologic concern: in the presence of a mass lesion, obstructive hydrocephalus, or significant midline shift, removing CSF via LP can worsen pressure gradients and precipitate transtentorial or tonsillar herniation, which is the rationale for selective CT before LP in high-risk patients [^111KWFcd] [^114yc4Q7].

> Wait, let me verify how often this actually happens and whether CT reliably predicts risk; I initially thought CT could reliably screen for herniation risk, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. A nationwide cohort showed deterioration possibly related to LP occurred in only 3.1% of bacterial meningitis cases, with only 0.1% deteriorating within 1 hour of LP, and expert review of CTs had only moderate interrater reliability for identifying LP contraindications, suggesting CT is an imperfect screen and that most patients with meningitis do not have dangerous mass effect at presentation [^116oU9PU]. I should also note that many patients who herniate have normal CTs, reinforcing that clinical judgment is paramount and that CT cannot be used as a blanket gatekeeper for LP safety [^1134QLkn].

> Next, I should review which clinical features truly predict abnormal CT with mass effect; the NEJM prospective study identified 10 predictors with a 97% negative predictive value when none are present: age ≥ 60, immunocompromise, prior CNS disease, seizure within 1 week, and focal deficits or altered consciousness including abnormal language, inability to answer two questions or follow two commands, gaze palsy, visual field defect, facial palsy, arm or leg drift, and abnormal language, so absence of these features makes a dangerous mass effect very unlikely [^113VbpeR]. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment; ESCMID similarly recommends CT before LP for focal deficits, new-onset seizures, severely altered mental status (often operationalized as GCS < 10), or severe immunocompromise, which mirrors the high-yield risk factors from the NEJM model [^113wEp42].

> I need to check how different guidelines diverge, especially around "altered mental status"; the Swedish approach removed impaired mental status alone as an indication for pre-LP CT after 2009, reserving imaging for unconsciousness with signs of herniation, which dramatically reduced CT rates and was associated with earlier antibiotics and improved outcomes, whereas IDSA criteria are more conservative and would prompt CT in a larger proportion, including many with GCS < 15, leading to more normal scans without changing management [^111bEaWd] [^111nLJHJ]. But wait, what if we over-image; comparative analyses show UK and ESCMID criteria are more selective than IDSA and still capture the rare patients with brain shift, reducing unnecessary CTs and incidental findings without compromising safety [^111nLJHJ].

> Now, I should quantify the harms of unnecessary CT; delays to LP of roughly 1–2 hours are consistently observed when CT is obtained without indication, and this translates into meaningful delays to antibiotics, which are independently associated with worse outcomes in bacterial meningitis, with mortality rising approximately 12.6% for each hour of delay in some cohorts [^115NMFRQ] [^111bEaWd]. I should double-check the diagnostic yield impact; culture positivity drops sharply after antibiotics, with very low yield beyond 8 hours, so unnecessary CT can directly reduce microbiologic confirmation and optimal therapy tailoring [^111oSgP5].

> Let me consider real-world practice patterns; multiple cohorts show CT before LP is performed in the majority of suspected CNS infections regardless of indications, often driven by medicolegal caution or non-specific symptoms, and adherence to guideline criteria is poor, with overuse of CT and underuse of immediate LP when safe, which compounds delays and costs without improving outcomes in low-risk patients [^111NngjT] [^115NMFRQ].

> I should confirm the bottom line and the practical approach; CT before LP is indicated when there are features suggesting mass effect or brain shift, including focal neurologic deficits, new-onset seizures, severely depressed consciousness, papilledema, or severe immunocompromise, whereas immunocompetent adults with a stable GCS ≥ 12 and no focal signs can proceed directly to LP without pre-imaging, provided there is no coagulopathy or shock, and if CT is indicated, antibiotics must not be delayed while awaiting imaging [^113wEp42] [^111Ez1HT] [^114yc4Q7]. Hold on, I should verify the universal caveat; in all cases of suspected bacterial meningitis, administer empiric antibiotics as soon as possible, ideally within the first hour, and do not withhold therapy for CT or LP, because treatment delays worsen mortality and neurologic outcomes [^115dDsVZ] [^111bEaWd].

> In summary, we do not routinely obtain head CT before LP in suspected meningitis; we selectively obtain CT to mitigate herniation risk in patients with features predictive of mass effect or brain shift, while recognizing that CT is an imperfect screen and that unnecessary CT causes harmful delays to antibiotics and reduces diagnostic yield, so the safest, evidence-based strategy is risk-stratified: immediate LP without CT for low-risk patients, and immediate antibiotics with expedited CT only for those with high-risk features, never delaying therapy for imaging [^113VbpeR] [^113wEp42] [^115NMFRQ].

We obtain a head CT before lumbar puncture in suspected meningitis to **identify mass effect or brain shift** that could precipitate herniation if CSF is removed [^113VbpeR] [^111KWFcd]. CT is indicated for patients with focal deficits, papilledema, seizures, immunocompromise, or altered consciousness, and should not delay antibiotics if imaging is unavailable [^113wEp42] [^115dDsVZ] [^115wWaAm]. Routine CT is unnecessary in stable, immunocompetent adults without red flags, as it can delay LP and treatment without benefit [^113VbpeR] [^111Ez1HT] [^111NngjT].

---

## Pathophysiological rationale for CT before lumbar puncture

The primary concern is **herniation risk** from sudden CSF pressure changes when mass effect or brain shift is present [^111KWFcd]. CT detects these lesions so LP can be deferred or modified to prevent herniation [^113VbpeR].

---

## Clinical indications for CT before lumbar puncture

Guidelines recommend **selective CT** based on clinical features:

| **Clinical feature** | **Indication for CT before LP** |
|-|-|
| Focal neurological deficits | Yes [^113wEp42] |
| Papilledema | Yes [^115wWaAm] |
| Seizures (new-onset or recent) | Yes [^113wEp42] |
| Altered mental status (GCS < 10) | Yes [^113wEp42] |
| Immunocompromised state | Yes [^113wEp42] |
| Known intracranial mass lesions | Yes [^111KWFcd] |
| Stable, immunocompetent adult without red flags | No [^113VbpeR] |

---

## Risks associated with lumbar puncture without prior CT

LP without prior CT in patients with mass effect can cause **herniation**, though this is rare (about 1.5% in those with mass effect) [^1134QLkn] [^116oU9PU]. Most meningitis patients do not have mass effect, so routine CT is not needed [^113VbpeR].

---

## Risks associated with unnecessary CT scanning

Unnecessary CT can **delay LP and antibiotics**, worsening outcomes [^111Ez1HT] [^111bEaWd]. Delays reduce culture yield and are linked to higher mortality [^111oSgP5] [^111bEaWd]. CT also adds cost and radiation exposure [^113ki7gb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **IDSA**: CT before LP for focal deficits, papilledema, seizures, altered mental status, or immunocompromise [^notfound].
- **ESCMID**: Similar, emphasizing immediate antibiotics if LP is delayed [^115dDsVZ].
- **WHO**: LP as soon as possible unless contraindications; do not delay antibiotics for imaging [^1147poxR] [^115wWaAm].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

CT before LP is rare and usually manageable; most complications are minor (headache, bleeding, infection) [^notfound]. Serious complications are uncommon, especially when guidelines are followed [^116oU9PU].

---

## Summary of key points

- **CT before LP** is indicated for patients with risk of mass effect or herniation [^114yc4Q7].
- **Routine CT** is not needed for stable, immunocompetent adults without red flags [^113VbpeR].
- **Unnecessary CT** can delay treatment and worsen outcomes [^111Ez1HT] [^111bEaWd].
- **Follow guidelines** to balance herniation risk against delays in diagnosis and treatment [^115wWaAm].

---

CT before LP in suspected meningitis is used to **identify mass effect or brain shift** that could cause herniation; it should be used selectively and not delay antibiotics when imaging is not immediately available [^113VbpeR] [^115dDsVZ] [^1147poxR].

### Cranial imaging before lumbar puncture in adults with community-acquired meningitis: clinical utility and adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines [^111NngjT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines delineate criteria for the use of computed tomography (CT) scan of the head before lumbar puncture (LP) in adults with community-acquired meningitis (CAM). There are limited data to document adherence to these guidelines and assess the clinical utility of brain imaging.

Methods.

This was a retrospective analysis from January 2005 to January 2010 in Houston, Texas.

Results.

Among 614 adults with CAM, 407 patients (66.3%) did not have an indication for a head CT scan and 207 (33.7%) did. Patients with a CT scan indication were older, had more comorbidities, were sicker, and had more urgent treatable etiologies and adverse clinical outcomes (P < .001). A CT scan was ordered before the LP in 549 patients (89%). Overall, clinicians did not adhere to clinical guidelines in 368 of 614 (60%) subjects. A CT of the head was ordered when not indicated in 355 of 549 patients (64%), and not done when indicated in 13 of 207 patients (0.6%). CT of the head revealed intracranial abnormalities in 35 of 193 patients (18.1%) with an indication for brain imaging, compared with only 2 of 356 (0.05%) with no indication (P < .05). Major intracranial findings were seen in only 15 of 549 (2.7%) patients, all with an indication for brain imaging. Furthermore, only 8 patients had abnormalities that affected clinical management.

Conclusions.

Most clinicians do not adhere to IDSA guidelines, delaying diagnostic LP and increasing costs. Usefulness of head CT in patients with CAM without an indication for imaging is limited and has no impact in clinical management.

### Computed tomography of the head before lumbar puncture in adults with suspected meningitis [^113VbpeR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

In adults with suspected meningitis clinicians routinely order computed tomography (CT) of the head before performing a lumbar puncture.

Methods

We prospectively studied 301 adults with suspected meningitis to determine whether clinical characteristics that were present before CT of the head was performed could be used to identify patients who were unlikely to have abnormalities on CT. The Modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was used to identify neurologic abnormalities.

Results

Of the 301 patients with suspected meningitis, 235 (78 percent) underwent CT of the head before undergoing lumbar puncture. In 56 of the 235 patients (24 percent), the results of CT were abnormal; 11 patients (5 percent) had evidence of a mass effect. The clinical features at base line that were associated with an abnormal finding on CT of the head were an age of at least 60 years, immunocompromise, a history of central nervous system disease, and a history of seizure within one week before presentation, as well as the following neurologic abnormalities: an abnormal level of consciousness, an inability to answer two consecutive questions correctly or to follow two consecutive commands, gaze palsy, abnormal visual fields, facial palsy, arm drift, leg drift, and abnormal language (e.g., aphasia). None of these features were present at base line in 96 of the 235 patients who underwent CT scanning of the head (41 percent). The CT scan was normal in 93 of these 96 patients, yielding a negative predictive value of 97 percent. Of the three misclassified patients, only one had a mild mass effect on CT, and all three subsequently underwent lumbar puncture, with no evidence of brain herniation one week later.

Conclusions

In adults with suspected meningitis, clinical features can be used to identify those who are unlikely to have abnormal findings on CT of the head.

### Cranial imaging and lumbar puncture in patients with suspected central nervous system infection [^111EvrrK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The performance of a cranial CT before an LP was not associated with the delayed initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy. Previously, a retrospective analysis of 123 cases of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in patients admitted from 1990–2002 showed that having a CT scan prior to an LP was associated with an odds ratio of 5.6 for having a delay in antibiotic treatment of more than 6 hours. However, in this Canadian study, a substantial proportion of patients had to be transferred from a peripheral hospital to receive a cranial CT, which was a major contributor to the delay. A more recent, retrospective, Danish study studying 358 bacterial meningitis patients who were admitted between 1998–2014 showed that a CT was associated with a late diagnosis, which was associated with a poor prognosis. However, the contribution of cranial imaging to the delay in imaging was not reported, and several other factors were identified that contributed to the late diagnoses. Finally, a retrospective Swedish study of bacterial meningitis patients who were identified between 2005–2012 showed that a cranial CT led to a delay in antibiotic treatment of 1.6 hours, even though 60% of patients received antibiotics prior to a CT. Several explanations for the discrepancy between our results and the literature can be identified. First, we studied patients presenting to our center and excluded transferred patients. Second, in the time periods in which the previous studies were performed, cranial imaging was likely to be less readily available than in our setting, which increased the risk of a delay. Finally, all previous studies had selection biases, as they studied only confirmed bacterial meningitis cases, as opposed to all patients suspected of CNS infections, which is the population at risk and was included in our study.

### Emergency medicine myths: computed tomography of the head prior to lumbar puncture in adults with suspected bacterial meningitis-due diligence or antiquated practice? [^1134QLkn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Various sources purport an association between lumbar puncture and brainstem herniation in patients with intracranial mass effect lesions. Several organizations and texts recommend head computed tomography (CT) prior to lumbar puncture in selected patients.

Objective

To review the evidence regarding the utility of obtaining head CT prior to lumbar puncture in adults with suspected bacterial meningitis.

Discussion

Observational studies report a risk of post-lumbar puncture brainstem herniation in the presence of intracranial mass effect (1.5%) that is significantly lower than that reported among all patients with bacterial meningitis (up to 13.3%). It is unclear from existing literature whether identifying patients with intracranial mass effect decreases herniation risk. Up to 80% of patients with bacterial meningitis experiencing herniation have no CT abnormalities, and approximately half of patients with intracranial mass effect not undergoing lumbar puncture herniate. Decision rules to selectively perform CT on only those individuals most likely to have intracranial mass effect lesions have not undergone validation. Despite recommendations for immediate antimicrobial therapy prior to imaging, data indicate an association between pre-lumbar puncture CT and antibiotic delays. Recent data demonstrate shortened door-to-antibiotic times and lower mortality from bacterial meningitis after implementation of new national guidelines, which restricted generally accepted CT indications by removing impaired mental status as imaging criterion.

Conclusions

Data supporting routine head CT prior to lumbar puncture are limited. Physicians should consider selective CT for those patients at risk for intracranial mass effect lesions based on decision rules or clinical gestalt. Patients undergoing head CT must receive immediate antibiotic therapy.

### Cranial imaging and lumbar puncture in patients with suspected central nervous system infection [^115H68g6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our data show that the majority of patients with suspected CNS infections presenting to the emergency department received cranial imaging, irrespective of guideline criteria. This is concordant with previous studies in bacterial meningitis. A potential explanation for the high rate of CT scans prior to LPs is that conditions other than CNS infections can be considered in the differential diagnoses of these patients, such as cerebral hemorrhage. Furthermore, CNS infections may present with mass lesions causing substantial brain shifts — for example, herpes simplex encephalitis or brain abscess — and physicians want to rule out this possibility prior to the LP. Such mass lesions can be detected by a cranial CT, but the risk of a substantial brain shift is very low, particularly when clinical signs of a brains shift are absent. Finally, nowadays cranial CT imaging is performed extremely quickly in some settings, especially in those centers with acute stroke care infrastructure. The availability of cranial CT results within minutes after the emergency department entrance may lower the threshold for performing a CT before LP.

### Cranial imaging and lumbar puncture in patients with suspected central nervous system infection [^11793jet]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) infections need prompt diagnostic work-ups and initiation of treatment. Once an initial patient evaluation has been completed, including collecting a medical history and performing a physical examination, lumbar puncture (LP) is the diagnostic procedure of choice if the diagnoses of bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis cannot be ruled out. In view of the urgent nature of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing, an issue physicians are faced with in an emergency department setting is whether neuroimaging is required before LP. Cranial imaging is performed to rule out diagnoses of space-occupying lesions, which cause substantial brain shifts and, potentially, could lead to the compression of vital brains structures, triggered by the increased pressure gradient caused by LP.

Guideline recommendations for cranial imaging prior to LP are based on a prospective study including 301 adult patients with suspected meningitis. In this study, 10 characteristics were identified as associated with abnormal computed tomography (CT) of the brain: age over 60 years; altered mental status; gaze or facial palsy; abnormal language or inability to answer 2 questions or follow 2 commands; immunocompromise; history of central nervous system disease; seizure in past week; visual field abnormalities; arm and leg drifts. If none of these features are present, there is a negative predictive value of 97% for an intracranial abnormality, confirming that clinical features can be used to identify patients who are unlikely to have abnormal findings on brain CT scans. However, in the recent years, there has been a discussion about whether these criteria indeed should be used in clinical practice, based on their predictive value, to detect contraindications for LP. The potential trade-offs of using these items are a high proportion of patients with CT scans prior to LPs, the potential treatment delays caused by CT scans, and the association between these delays and clinical outcomes.

We aimed to describe the use of cranial imaging in a cohort of patients with suspected CNS infections, and evaluated adherence to the recommendations made in bacterial meningitis guidelines published by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA; 2004) and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID; 2016). Furthermore, we evaluated recommendations in the Swedish national guideline (2013), as it was recently described to result in less cranial imaging and, thereby, potentially, improved prognoses, and the Dutch national guideline (2012), which was the criteria most likely to be used by the physicians in the study period. We also analyzed the association between cranial imaging and time between emergency department entrance and intravenous antibiotic administration.

### Comparison of international guidelines for CT prior to lumbar puncture in patients with suspected meningitis [^111nLJHJ]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the performance of multiple international guidelines in selecting patients for head CT prior to lumbar puncture (LP) in suspected meningitis, focusing on identification of potential contraindications to immediate LP.

Methods

Retrospective study of 196 patients with suspected meningitis presenting to an emergency department between March 2013 and March 2023 and undergoing head CT prior to LP. UK Joint Specialist Society Guidelines (UK), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines were evaluated by cross-referencing imaging criteria with clinical characteristics present at time of presentation. Sensitivity of each guideline for recommending neuroimaging in cases with brain shift on CT was evaluated, along with the number of normal studies and incidental or spurious findings.

Results

2/196 (1%) patients had abnormal CTs with evidence of brain shift, while 14/196 (7%) had other abnormalities on CT without brain shift. UK, ESCMID and IDSA guidelines recommended imaging in 10%, 14% and 33% of cases respectively. All three guidelines recommended imaging pre-LP in 2/2 (100%) cases with brain shift. IDSA guidelines recommended more CT studies with normal findings (59 vs 16 and 24 for UK and ESCMID guidelines respectively) and CT abnormalities without brain shift (4 vs 1 and 2 respectively) than the other guidelines.

Conclusion

UK, ESCMID and IDSA guidelines are all effective at identifying the small cohort of patients who benefit from a head CT prior to LP. Following the more selective UK/ESCMID guidelines limits the number of normal studies and incidental or spurious CT findings.

### Fatal lumbar puncture: fact versus fiction – an approach to a clinical dilemma [^113MxVFg]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Recent reports and commentaries have emphasized the alleged risk of cerebral herniation complicating lumbar puncture performed to diagnose acute bacterial meningitis. Instead, knowledge of facts relevant to the disease process can provide a rational and reassuring approach to management. All cases of purulent meningitis are associated with increased intracranial pressure, but herniation is a rare complication (5%). Despite suggestions to the contrary, cranial computed tomography (CT) is normal in most cases of purulent meningitis, including those with subsequent herniation. Additionally, CT may be associated with long-term radiation effects. An accurate clinical history combined with recognition of the early systemic and neurologic findings of bacterial meningitis will indicate a safe setting for performance of a diagnostic lumbar puncture with little likelihood of complicating herniation. In contrast, in patients in whom the disease process has progressed to the neurologic findings associated with impending cerebral herniation, a delay of the diagnostic procedure is indicated. In this latter circumstance, a different approach in management can be developed.

### Effect of delayed lumbar punctures on the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults [^111oSgP5]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency, the outcome of which is improved by prompt antibiotic treatment. For patients with suspected meningitis and no features of severe disease, the British Infection Society recommends immediate lumbar puncture (LP) before antibiotics, to maximise the chance of a positive cerebrospinal (CSF) culture. In such patients, CT scanning before LP is not needed.

Methods

The case notes of adults with meningitis admitted to a large district general hospital over 3 years were reviewed. Patients were classified as Likely Bacterial Meningitis or Likely Viral Meningitis based on their CSF and peripheral blood results using the Meningitest Criteria, with microbiological and virological confirmation.

Results

Of 92 patients studied, 24 had Likely Bacterial Meningitis, including 16 with microbiologically confirmed disease (none had PCR tests for bacteria). Sixty-eight had Likely Viral Meningitis, four of whom had viral PCR, including one with herpes simplex virus. No patient had an LP before antibiotics. CSF culture was positive for eight (73%) of the 11 patients who had an LP up to 4 h after starting antibiotics, compared with eight (11%) of 71 patients with a later LP (p < 0.001). None of the 34 LPs performed more than 8 h after antibiotics was culture-positive. For 62 (67%) of the 92 patients, the delay was due to a CT scan, although only 20 of these patients had a contraindication to an immediate LP.

Conclusions

Too many patients with acute bacterial meningitis are being sent for unnecessary CT scans, causing delays in the LP, and reducing the chances of a positive CSF culture after starting antibiotics. However, even if antibiotics have been started, an LP within 4 h is still likely to be positive. Molecular tests for diagnosis should also be requested.

### Diagnosis, initial management, and prevention of meningitis [^111YzV2A]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although the annual incidence of bacterial meningitis in the United States is declining, it remains a medical emer- gency with a potential for high morbidity and mortality. Clinical signs and symptoms are unreliable in distinguishing bacterial meningitis from the more common forms of aseptic meningitis; therefore, a lumbar puncture with cerebro- spinal fluid analysis is recommended. Empiric antimicrobial therapy based on age and risk factors must be started promptly in patients with bacterial meningitis. Empiric therapy should not be delayed, even if a lumbar puncture cannot be performed because results of a computed tomography scan are pending or because the patient is awaiting transfer. Concomitant therapy with dexamethasone initiated before or at the time of antimicrobial therapy has been demonstrated to improve morbidity and mortality in adults with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Within the United States, almost 30 percent of strains of pneumococci, the most common etiologic agent of bacterial meningitis, are not susceptible to penicillin. Among adults in developed countries, the mortality rate from bacterial meningitis is 21 percent. However, the use of conjugate vaccines has reduced the incidence of bacterial meningitis in children and adults.

### Lumbar puncture in the management of adults with suspected bacterial meningitis – a survey of practice [^113UpzdX]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Assess the use of lumbar puncture (LP) in the management of suspected community acquired bacterial meningitis in adults.

Methods

A questionnaire was sent to secondary care clinicians (excluding junior house officers) in general internal and emergency medicine at three acute NHS healthcare trusts in the south west of England. The questionnaire recorded the experience of the clinician and asked questions related to case scenarios representing common presentations of bacterial meningitis or meningococcal disease.

Results

The response rate was 42% (108/260). Nearly all of the respondents (91%) reported regularly managing patients with suspected meningitis. Most respondents considered that (i) brain computerised tomography (CT) was necessary prior to undertaking LP (78%, 60/77), (ii) LP was a useful first line investigation in a patient with meningococcal shock.(80%, 84/105), (iii) LP could be performed safely in a man with a falling level of consciousness if the CT brain was normal (89/106, 84%). Early antibiotic administration was considered important, other management priorities such as oxygen therapy, volume resuscitation, and critical care involvement were not emphasised.

Conclusions

Reported clinical practice in the investigation and management of meningitis in adults is not in line with current published guidance. Efforts to target interventions that promote consensus in practice are needed.

### Cranial imaging and lumbar puncture in patients with suspected central nervous system infection [^117W7zoW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Performing cranial imaging prior to lumbar punctures (LPs) in patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) infections has been associated with delayed treatments and poor outcomes. Various guidelines provide different criteria for cranial imaging prior to LP.

Methods

We describe the use of cranial imaging in a cohort of adult patients with suspected CNS infections, and evaluated adherence to the recommendations made in the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), Swedish, and Dutch guidelines. We also analyzed the association between cranial imaging and the time between emergency department entrance and intravenous antibiotic administration.

Results

From 2012–2015, 203 patients with suspected CNS infections were included, of whom 56 (27%) were diagnosed with CNS infections and 16 were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis (8%). Cranial imaging, in all cases computed tomography (CT), was performed in 130 patients (64%) and led to the deferral of LPs in 7 (5%). Criteria by the IDSA, ESCMID, Swedish, and Dutch guidelines showed indications for imaging in 64%, 39%, 39%, and 40% of patients, respectively. The times between emergency department arrivals and the start of antibiotic therapy between patients with and without CT before LP were similar (median 134 [interquartile range (IQR) 58–292] vs. 141 minutes [IQR 52–227], respectively; Mann-Whitney U P = 0.74).

Conclusions

A cranial CT prior to LP was done in the majority of patients with a suspected CNS infection, irrespective of guideline indications. The ESCMID, Swedish, and Dutch guidelines were more restrictive in advising imaging, compared to the IDSA guidelines. Performing cranial imaging prior to LP was not associated with treatment delays in this Dutch cohort study.

### Cranial imaging and lumbar puncture in patients with suspected central nervous system infection [^115NMFRQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

LPs were delayed by 2 hours when patients underwent CT scans prior to LPs. Previous studies in bacterial meningitis have shown that the yield of CSF cultures decreased from 94% to 88% in patients in whom CT scans were done before LPs. A single-center, retrospective study from the United Kingdom including 92 patients with bacterial and viral meningitis between 2002–2004 showed that 67% of patients had a delayed time to LP due to a CT, and only 3% of cases had an LP performed within 2 hours of initiation of antibiotic treatment. Culture positivity sharply decreased if the LP was performed more than 4 hours after the initiation of antibiotic treatment, and none of the patients with LPs performed more than 8 hours after beginning antibiotics had a positive culture. This, and increased costs and radiation exposure, remain arguments for restricted cranial imaging in patients with suspected CNS infections when guideline indications are not met and imaging is not indicated for other neurological conditions included in the differential diagnosis. We observed that the time to treatment in patients eventually diagnosed with bacterial meningitis was half that of the time in those receiving an alternative diagnosis (median 62 vs 136 minutes, respectively). This may indicate that physicians are able to identify those patients with a high probability of bacterial meningitis, even though this profile has not been identified by looking at individual or combined clinical and laboratory characteristics.

We found that the IDSA guideline differs substantially from the ESCMID, Swedish, and Dutch guidelines with regard to the proportion of patients for whom cranial imaging is advised. The IDSA guideline has the most conservative recommendations, in which 64% of our patients were advised to be scanned, compared to 39–40% for the ESCMID, Swedish, and Dutch guidelines. This is in contrast to a recent study in bacterial meningitis patients, which describing imaging indications in 65%, 32%, and 7% of patients based on the IDSA, ESCMID, and Swedish guidelines, respectively. The explanation of the discrepancy between studies is a selection bias, as only confirmed bacterial meningitis cases were included in the Swedish study. Importantly, some of the criteria in the Swedish guideline are left to the interpretation of the treating physician, such as "cerebral symptoms", "increasing blood pressure", and "disturbed breathing patterns".

Abstract

Background

Performing cranial imaging prior to lumbar punctures (LPs) in patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) infections has been associated with delayed treatments and poor outcomes. Various guidelines provide different criteria for cranial imaging prior to LP.

We describe the use of cranial imaging in a cohort of adult patients with suspected CNS infections, and evaluated adherence to the recommendations made in the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), Swedish, and Dutch guidelines. We also analyzed the association between cranial imaging and the time between emergency department entrance and intravenous antibiotic administration.

From 2012–2015, 203 patients with suspected CNS infections were included, of whom 56 (27%) were diagnosed with CNS infections and 16 were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis (8%). Cranial imaging, in all cases computed tomography (CT), was performed in 130 patients (64%) and led to the deferral of LPs in 7 (5%). Criteria by the IDSA, ESCMID, Swedish, and Dutch guidelines showed indications for imaging in 64%, 39%, 39%, and 40% of patients, respectively. The times between emergency department arrivals and the start of antibiotic therapy between patients with and without CT before LP were similar (median 134 [interquartile range (IQR) 58–292] vs. 141 minutes [IQR 52–227], respectively; Mann-Whitney U P = 0.74).

Conclusions

A cranial CT prior to LP was done in the majority of patients with a suspected CNS infection, irrespective of guideline indications. The ESCMID, Swedish, and Dutch guidelines were more restrictive in advising imaging, compared to the IDSA guidelines. Performing cranial imaging prior to LP was not associated with treatment delays in this Dutch cohort study.

### Adult bacterial meningitis: earlier treatment and improved outcome following guideline revision promoting prompt lumbar puncture [^111bEaWd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In suspected acute bacterial meningitis (ABM), cerebral computerized tomography (CT) is recommended before lumbar puncture (LP) if mental impairment. Despite guideline emphasis on early treatment, performing CT prior to LP implies a risk of delayed treatment and unfavorable outcome. Therefore, Swedish guidelines were revised in 2009, deleting impaired mental status as a contraindication for LP without prior CT scan. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the guideline revision.

Methods

The Swedish quality registry for community-acquired ABM was analyzed retrospectively. Door-to-antibiotic time and outcome were compared among patients treated 2005–2009 (n = 394) and 2010–2012 (n = 318). The effect of different LP-CT sequences was analyzed during 2008–2012.

Results

Adequate treatment was started 1.2 hours earlier, and significantly more patients were treated < 2 hours from admission 2010–2012 than 2005–2009. Compared with CT before LP, immediate LP resulted in 1.6 hours earlier treatment, significant increase in door-to-antibiotic times of < 1 and < 2 hours, and a favorable outcome. In 2010–2012, mortality was lower (6.9% vs 11.7%) and the risk of sequelae at follow-up decreased (38% vs 49%) in comparison with 2005–2009. Treatment delay resulted in a significantly increased risk for fatal outcome, with a relative increase in mortality of 12.6% per hour of delay.

Conclusions

The deletion of impaired mental status as contraindication for prompt LP and LP without prior CT scan are associated with significantly earlier treatment and a favorable outcome. A revision of current international guidelines should be considered.

### Lumbar puncture and the risk of herniation: when should we first perform CT? [^111hGQou]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Death following lumbar puncture (LP) is feared by physicians. Many opinions are found in literature on the question whether computed cranial tomography (CT) should be performed before LP, to prevent herniation. These opinions are mainly based on retrospective studies and pathophysiological reasoning. In this review the difficulties in the decision whether we should perform CT before LP are discussed. It is explained that the concept of "raised intracranial pressure" is confusing, and that the less ambiguous terms "brain shift" and "raised CSF pressure" should be used instead. Brain shift is a contraindication to LP, whether CSF pressure is raised or not, and whether papilloedema is present or not. Subsequently, recommendations are offered for indications to perform CT before LP, grouped according to the safety and clinical utility of LP.

Table 3.
Overview of Guideline Indications for Cranial Imaging, and Proportion of Patients Fulfilling the Criteria

Empirical antibiotic treatment was started in the emergency department for 72 of 203 patients (35.4%). Antibiotic treatment was initiated for suspected sepsis in 23 patients (31.9%) and for suspected bacterial meningitis in 49 patients (68.1%). The median time between emergency department entry and antibiotic treatment was 136 minutes (IQR 57–258), and the times were similar between patients with and without CT scans (141 minutes [IQR 58–292] vs 134 minutes [IQR 52–227], respectively; MWU P = 0.74; Figure 1); results were also similar when limiting the analysis to those patients treated for suspected bacterial meningitis (MWU P = 0.34). Antibiotic treatments were started prior to CT scans in 11 of 33 (33.3%) patients with suspected bacterial meningitis, and those CT scans were before LPs. Antibiotic treatments were started within 1 hour, according to the ESCMID guideline recommendations, in 14 of 49 (28.6%) patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. The median time to LP was 157 minutes (IQR 103–228) in patients for whom CT scans were not performed, compared to 290 minutes (IQR 191–527) in those for whom CT scans were performed before LP (MWU P < .001). The time to treatment was known for 15 of the 16 patients who were eventually diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, and showed a median time to treatment of 62 minutes (IQR 32–171), which was shorter than for those treated with antibiotics who eventually received another diagnosis, albeit the difference was nonsignificant (median 136 minutes, IQR 65–278; MWU P = 0.09). There were 7 bacterial meningitis patients who were treated within 1 hour (46.7%), in compliance with the ESCMID guidelines.

### Impact of an evidence-based guideline on the management of community-acquired bacterial meningitis: a prospective cohort study [^11118eai]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the impact of an evidence-based guideline on the management of community-acquired bacterial meningitis.

Methods

We performed an interrupted time series analysis in a prospective nationwide cohort study from 2006 to 2015. The guideline stresses the importance of cranial imaging before lumbar puncture (LP) in selected patients based on clinical criteria, and early treatment with amoxicillin and a third-generation cephalosporin for adults with suspected community-acquired bacterial meningitis. The guideline was published in April 2013.

Results

We included 1326 episodes before and 210 episodes after guideline introduction. Cranial imaging was performed before LP in 497 (84%) of 591 episodes with clinical criteria warranting computed tomography (CT). The guideline did not improve this (increase of 2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -15 to 19). Without these criteria, imaging before LP occurred in 606 (67%) of 900 episodes, also without effect of the guideline (increase of 1%; 95% CI, -25 to 28). The estimate of effect of the guideline for treatment with the recommended antibiotic regimen was an increase of 19.5% (95% CI, 13.5 to 25.5), and there was a trend towards more frequent initiation of treatment before CT. There was no association between delay in antibiotic treatment due to imaging before LP and unfavourable outcome (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52).

Conclusions

Cranial imaging is performed before LP in the majority of patients with bacterial meningitis, irrespective of guideline indications. The guideline introduction was associated with a trend towards early initiation of treatment before imaging and with increased adherence to antibiotic policy.

### Cranial imaging and lumbar puncture in patients with suspected central nervous system infection [^115WsRXD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The guideline items that explain the differences in advice on imaging were an altered mental status, medical history, and "a long duration of symptoms or acute bacterial meningitis atypical symptoms". Whereas the IDSA, ESCMID, and Dutch guidelines have altered mental status defined by Glasgow Coma Scale score cut-offs (< 15, < 10, and < 10, respectively), the Swedish guideline advises physicians to perform imaging only when unconsciousness is combined with clinical signs of cerebral herniation. Only 2% of patients met this mental status criterion of the Swedish guideline. This did not result in an overall reduction in the proportion of patients in whom imaging was advised, because of the incorporation of the "long duration symptoms and acute bacterial meningitis atypical symptoms" item. As only 41% of bacterial meningitis patients have the classic triad of neck stiffness, fever, and altered mental status, and even fewer have the triad in the population with suspected CNS infections, many patients fulfilled this criterion.

This study has several limitations. The most important limitation is that our study was limited to patients who underwent an LP, and patients in whom an LP was not performed due to cranial imaging were not included. Ideally, a diagnostic accuracy study on the use of CT before LP would include all patients in whom CNS infections are considered, regardless of whether an LP is performed. However, a definite diagnosis of CNS infection can not be made in patients in whom no CSF examination is performed and, therefore, such a study will not provide conclusive results. Another limitation of our study is that it is observational and not all patients received cranial imaging, which means lesions could have been missed in patients in whom the physicians choose to directly perform the LP. However, follow-ups of these patients showed that all survived and that none developed severe complications from their LP. Furthermore, several other guidelines exist for bacterial meningitis, encephalitis, and tuberculous meningitis that were not evaluated in our study. We selected the bacterial meningitis guidelines of 2 major infectious disease societies (IDSA and ESCMID), as well as the local (Dutch) guideline and Swedish guideline: the latter because a recent publication suggested the superiority of this guideline. We choose bacterial meningitis guidelines, as this disease has the highest mortality and the most urgency in diagnosis and treatment. A final limitation is that our hospital is a tertiary care facility with a specific clinical and research focus on neurological infectious disease and, therefore, may not be representative of other hospitals or countries.

Bacterial meningitis

All CMGs covering bacterial CNS infections recommended urgent LP and most recommended blood sampling (Table 3), since a positive CSF culture is confirmative of bacterial meningitis and enables in vitro testing of antimicrobial susceptibility to optimise antibiotic treatment, and urgent LP increases diagnostic chances. If CSF examination is not possible, serum markers of inflammation and blood cultures, especially if taken prior to antibiotics, can support the diagnosis and immunochromatographic antigen testing and PCR can provide additional information. The CMG by MSF did not recommend LP for new cases in an epidemic context when a meningococcal aetiology was confirmed. Sixty-nine percent (n = 11/16) recommended a CT scan before LP if clinical signs of raised ICP. In contrast, the CMG by NICE stated that CT is unreliable for identifying raised ICP and recommended clinical assessment instead of CT.

### Cranial computed tomography, lumbar puncture, and clinical deterioration in bacterial meningitis: a nationwide cohort study [^116oU9PU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear how often lumbar puncture (LP) is complicated by cerebral herniation in patients with bacterial meningitis and whether cranial computed tomography (CT) can be used to identify patients at risk for herniation.

Methods

We performed a nationwide prospective cohort study of patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis from 2006 to 2014 and identified patients with clinical deterioration possibly caused by LP. For systematic evaluation of contraindications for LP on cranial CT, these patients were matched to patients in the cohort without deterioration. Four experts, blinded for outcome, scored cranial CT results for contraindications for LP. A Fleiss' generalized κ for this assessment was determined.

Results

Of 1533 episodes, 47 (3.1%) had deterioration possibly caused by LP. Two patients deteriorated within 1 hour after LP (0.1%). In 43 of 47 patients with deterioration, cranial CT was performed prior to LP, so CT results were matched with 43 patients without deterioration. The interrater reliability of assessment of contraindications for LP on cranial CT was moderate (Fleiss' generalized κ = 0.47). A contraindication for LP was reported by all 4 raters in 6 patients with deterioration (14%) and in 5 without deterioration (11%).

Conclusions

LP can be performed safely in the large majority of patients with bacterial meningitis, as it is only very rarely complicated by cerebral herniation. Cranial CT can be considered a screening method for contraindications for LP, but the interrater reliability of this assessment is moderate.

### Acute bacterial meningitis [^111Ez1HT]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

NEW DIRECTIONS IN DIAGNOSTICS AND CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Early recognition and initiation of appropriate antimicrobials are essential to minimise death and complications from ABM. The differential diagnosis in patients presenting with headache, fever, neck stiffness or altered mental state is broad: the classical meningitis triad has limited diagnostic sensitivity. A high index of clinical suspicion is thus required to diagnose ABM. Lumbar puncture is essential, and should be undertaken promptly before CSF is rendered sterile by broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Many patients with ABM present with an altered level of consciousness, leading clinicians to frequently request cranial imaging prior to diagnostic lumbar puncture. Early Lumbar puncture (LP) is strongly associated with higher diagnostic yield from the CSF; delays in LP for cranial imaging lead to substantial reductions in yield from either CSF bacterial culture or PCR. Delays to diagnosis are linked to worse clinical outcomes. Cranial imaging (either CT or MRI) in patients with clear clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis without focal neurology is thus not recommended in the majority of patients with suspected ABM. CT has poor inter-reporting reliability to predict the risk of cerebral herniation in ABM. The American, British and European infection societies meningitis guidelines all recommend immediate LP in cases of suspected ABM without delay for CT/MRI in immunocompetent adults with suspected ABM who have a stable GCS of ≥ 12/15 without seizures. Important contraindications to LP include shock, respiratory compromise, or coagulopathy.

The diagnosis of ABM is dependent on the analysis of CSF. The leukocyte count remains the strongest predictive value of ABM. Diagnostic models including clinical, CSF and blood data show little additional benefit beyond clinical judgement. Antibiotic administration prior to LP commonly renders the CSF sterile, thus clinicians are increasingly dependent on diagnostic PCR. Recent data suggest that while small multiplex panels targeting Hib, meningococci and pneumococci are highly sensitive and specific, larger panels that include viral, nosocomial and rarer community-acquired pathogens have varying sensitivity and specificity and are not currently recommended. More recently, direct next-generation sequencing (NGS) and metagenomics of CSF have been proposed to detect pathogens in cases with a high index of clinical suspicion of ABM but negative PCR tests. While this approach is promising, constraints around cost, bioinformatics expertise and clinically relevant turnaround times have limited clinical use of NGS to date.

### Emergency department management of meningitis and encephalitis [^1175ctfn]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis are infectious disease emergencies that can cause significant patient morbidity and mortality. Clinicians use epidemiologic, historical, and physical examination findings to identify patients at risk for these infections, and central nervous system (CNS) imaging and lumbar puncture (LP) may be needed to further evaluate for these diagnoses. The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis can be challenging, as patients often lack some of the characteristic findings of this disease with presentations that overlap with more common disorders seen in the emergency department. This article addresses considerations in clinical evaluation, need for CNS imaging before LP, interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid results, standards for and effects of timely antibiotic administration, and recommendations for specific antimicrobial therapy and corticosteroids.

### Update and advances in community acquired bacterial meningitis [^113Pcwsg]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired bacterial meningitis continues to occur and be associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite the availability of effective conjugate vaccines for the three most important meningeal pathogens.

Recent Findings

Indications for cranial imaging in suspected bacterial meningitis varies significantly between guidelines. Cranial imaging is of no clinical utility in those patients without indications and fosters delays in performing a lumbar puncture. Delaying lumbar puncture is associated with increased costs in both adults and children with meningitis and previous antibiotic therapy impacts the yield of microbiological results. Delaying antibiotic therapy is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Adjunctive steroids have reduced the mortality of adults with pneumococcal meningitis but have been associated with increased adverse outcomes in Listeria monocytogenes and Cryptococcus neoformans.

Summary

Community-acquired bacterial meningitis remains a global health concern with high morbidity and mortality especially in low-income countries. Cranial imaging should be done only in patients with an indication with an attempt to do a prompt lumbar puncture and to initiate antibiotic therapy and adjunctive steroids as soon as possible to improve clinical outcomes.

RESULTS

Between February 2012 through May 2015, 238 episodes of suspected CNS infections were evaluated in 238 patients (Supplementary Figure 1). In 35 of 238 patients (14.7%) the clinician judged that performing an LP in the emergency department was not indicated, and an LP was performed later, during hospital admission. Of the remaining 203 patients, 114 (56.2%; Table 1) were women and the median age was 44 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29–59). Final diagnoses of CNS infections were made in 56 patients (27.6%), consisting of bacterial meningitis in 16 patients (7.9%), viral meningitis in 24 (11.8%), and other CNS infections in 16 (7.9%). Of the 16 bacterial meningitis cases, 11 were confirmed by culture, and the diagnoses were made in the remaining cases on clinical grounds (elevated CSF white cell count and protein, and high blood C-reactive protein concentration and/or leukocytosis). Other CNS infections consisted of viral encephalitis (3 patients); tuberculous (2 patients); parasitic, fungal, or leptospirosis meningitis (each 2 patients); cerebral toxoplasmosis (2 patients); progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (2 patients); and human immunodeficiency virus meningitis (1 patient). Those patients with no CNS infection were diagnosed with inflammatory CNS disease (n = 11; 5.4%), non-neurologic infectious disease (n = 63; 32.5%), noninfectious neurological disease (n = 66; 32.5%), or other systemic disease (n = 3; 1.5%).

Table 1.
Characteristics of Included Patients

CT was performed prior to LP in 130 of 203 (64.0%) patients. The median time between emergency room arrival and CT was 115 minutes (IQR 66–220 min; Figure 1). Cranial CT scans showed abnormalities in 70 of the 130 patients (53.8%: Table 2): most commonly, old vascular lesions were seen in 21 (16.2%), leukoaraoisis in 19 (14.6%), new hypodense lesions in 5 (3.8%), and mass lesions in 4 (3.1%). CT abnormalities were related to the current illness in 19 patients (14.6%).

Brain imaging was done in 544 (51%) of 1066 episodes during admission, of which 16 (3%) had new intracranial pathological findings (Table 1). The radiological diagnoses comprised benign brain tumours (n = 6), brain cysts (n = 5), brain infarction (n = 3), brain haemorrhage (n = 1) and brain oedema (n = 1). The median time from admission until brain imaging was 2.8 h (IQR 1.5–7.5). Brain imaging preceded lumbar puncture in 408 (39%) of 1058 episodes. A lumbar puncture was done in all episodes. The median time from admission until lumbar puncture was 3.0 h (IQR 1.3–7.1). The median time from admission until lumbar puncture was shorter in episodes admitted directly to a department of infectious diseases [2.0 h (IQR 0.9–4.7)] than in those admitted elsewhere [3.9 h (IQR 1.8–11.2); P < 0.001] and longer in episodes where brain imaging preceded lumbar puncture [6.2 h (IQR 3.6–15.2)] than in those where it did not [1.7 h (IQR 0.9–3.5); P < 0.001]. In multiple ln-linear regression, admission directly to a department of infectious diseases was associated with a 28% (95% CI: 16–39) decrease in time to lumbar puncture, whereas brain imaging prior to lumbar puncture was associated with a 184% (95% CI: 140–235) increase.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging was performed in these patients within 24 h, showing no contra-indications for LPs. Mass lesions with substantial brain shifts were seen on cranial CT scans in 2 remaining patients (29%); both were diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis–complicating human immunodeficiency virus infections. CT scans were not performed before LPs in 73 patients (36.0%), and none of these patients deteriorated after their LP. The outcome was favorable in 71 of 73 patients (97.3%); 2 patients had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 4.

### Lumbar puncture performed promptly or after neuroimaging in acute bacterial meningitis in adults: a prospective national cohort study evaluating different guidelines [^114X6GQa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early treatment is pivotal for favorable outcome in acute bacterial meningitis (ABM). Lumbar puncture (LP) is the diagnostic key. The aim was to evaluate the effect on outcome of adherence to European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and Swedish guidelines regarding neuroimaging before LP.

Methods

The cohort comprised 815 adult ABM patients in Sweden registered prospectively between 2008 and 2015. Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and secondary endpoint was favorable outcome at 2–6 months of follow-up.

Results

Indications for neuroimaging before LP existed in 7%, 32%, and 65% according to Swedish, ESCMID, and IDSA guidelines, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 0.48 (95% confidence interval, .26-.89) for mortality and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.08–2.12) for favorable outcome if Swedish guidelines were followed. ESCMID guideline adherence resulted in aOR of 0.68 (95% CI, .38–1.23) for mortality and 1.05 (95% CI, .75–1.47) for favorable outcome. Following IDSA recommendations resulted in aOR of 1.09 (95% CI, .61–1.95) for mortality and 0.59 (95% CI, .42-.82) for favorable outcome. Performing prompt vs neuroimaging-preceded LP was associated with aOR of 0.38 (95% CI, .18-.77) for mortality and 2.11 (95% CI, 1.47–3.00) for favorable outcome. The beneficial effect of prompt LP was observed regardless of mental status and immunosuppression.

Conclusions

Adherence to Swedish guidelines in ABM is associated with decreased mortality and increased favorable outcome in contrast to adherence to ESCMID or IDSA recommendations. Our findings support that impaired mental status and immunocompromised state should not be considered indications for neuroimaging before LP in patients with suspected ABM.

### Performance of large language models on advocating the management of meningitis: a comparative qualitative study [^1179NGer]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated qualitative performance characteristics of different LLMs when challenged with a hypothetical clinical case of an adult patient with bacterial meningitis and revealed marked discrepancies between the LLMs. This reflects both the potentials and limitations of these models when used as a guidance for medical work-up and treatment. The differences in qualitative performances observed among the LLMs did not demonstrate a correlation with the length of their respective outputs. This suggests that the performance variations can be attributed to the unique algorithmic designs of each LLM rather than their quantitative output.

CNS infection was identified as a probable cause among other differential diagnosis in the majority of cases and almost all LLMs succeeded in identifying and recommending appropriate investigations, including cranial imaging and LP. A fair proportion underscored the need for urgent diagnostics and antibiotic treatment. These results align with previous findings demonstrating a satisfactory performance of GPT-3 (the predecessor of GPT-3.5) in terms of triage and reasoning on differential diagnoses and the high performance of GPT-4 in diagnostic case challenges. Our study expands on these findings by examining an additional five LLMs which were not available at the time of the previous studies.

Our investigation also highlights limitations of most LLMs regarding their understanding of case complexity and their ability to link different disease entities. For instance, the identification of mastoiditis as an underlying cause was mentioned infrequently, as were blood glucose measurements, drawing blood cultures, considerations of empirical antiviral treatment and the administration of dexamethasone. The considerable heterogeneity in the responses of individual LLMs, despite standardised prompts, raises further concerns about their reliability and consistency. The presentation of misleading statements in more than half of the LLM sessions underscores the potential risk that comes along with their use for critical medical decision-making, especially in complex, life-threatening and time-sensitive situations, such as with bacterial meningitis. Such challenges must be addressed in future research when developing tools on the basis of LLMs for medical purposes.

Most LLMs' inability to provide definitive guidance on whether to conduct a cranial CT scan before an LP might be due to the differences in the guidelines. However, the lack of clear direction in many LLM responses could also suggest an insufficiency in handling complex clinical situations where there is a need for reasoned decision-making. This finding may be viewed in the context of the research gap between healthcare AI development and the challenge of its validation and implementation in real-world clinical settings.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^113ki7gb]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) — additional concerns in suspected SAH include incidental aneurysm detection because 2% of the general population has asymptomatic cerebral aneurysms at baseline, with one approach being lumbar puncture (LP) for all patients with positive CTA results; radiation exposure increases since a cranial computed tomography (CT) dose is approximately 2 mSv and adding a CTA to a CT would at least double this exposure, and head and neck CT may increase cataract risk; after a negative noncontrast head CT, 302 patients who underwent LP had a 10.6% incidence of alternative diagnoses including viral meningitis (6.3%), intracranial hypertension (2.0%), bacterial meningitis (1.7%), chemical meningitis (0.3%), and intrathecal hematoma (0.3%), and broader availability may lead to increased CTA use because many patients otherwise do not have additional testing.

### Headache. diagnosing subarachnoid hemorrhage: are CT scans enough? [^115sisHX]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a rare but potentially fatal cause of headache. According to results from a recent study, CT scans enable clinicians to identify patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a high sensitivity. Does CT imaging rule out the need for lumbar puncture in patients who present with headache?

### Differential diagnostic yield of lumbar puncture in investigation of suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage: a retrospective study [^1153HFtz]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnostic algorithm of computerized tomography (CT) and lumbar puncture (LP) for suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) has lately been challenged by the advancement of radiological techniques, such as higher resolution offered by newer generation CT-scanners and increased availability of CT-angiography. A purely radiological workup of suspected SAH offers great advantages for both patients and the health care system, but the risks of abandoning LP in this setting are not well investigated. We have characterized the differential diagnostic yield of LP in the investigation of suspected SAH by a retrospective study. From the hospital laboratory database, we analyzed the medical records of all patients who had undergone CSF-analysis in search of subarachnoid bleeding during 2009–2011. A total of 453 patients were included. In 14 patients (3%) the LP resulted in an alternative diagnosis, the most common being aseptic meningitis. Two patients (0.5%) received treatment for herpes meningitis. Five patients (1%) with subarachnoid haemorrhages were identified. Among these, the four patients presenting with thunderclap headache had non-aneurysmal bleedings and did not require surgical intervention. We conclude that the differential diagnostic yield of LP in investigation of suspected SAH is low, which indicates that alternative diagnoses is not a reason to keep LP in the workup when a purely radiological strategy has been validated. However, algorithms should be developed to increase the recognition of aseptic meningitis. One hundred and fifty-three patients (34%) were admitted to undergo LP, which estimates the number of hospital beds that might be made available by a radiological diagnostic algorithm.

### Dilemmas in the diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis [^115birFF]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Rapid diagnosis and treatment of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis reduces mortality and neurological sequelae, but can be delayed by atypical presentation, assessment of lumbar puncture safety, and poor sensitivity of standard diagnostic microbiology. Thus, diagnostic dilemmas are common in patients with suspected acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis. History and physical examination alone are sometimes not sufficient to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is an essential investigation, but can be delayed by brain imaging. Results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination should be interpreted carefully, because CSF abnormalities vary according to the cause, patient's age and immune status, and previous treatment. Diagnostic prediction models that use a combination of clinical findings, with or without test results, can help to distinguish acute bacterial meningitis from other causes, but these models are not infallible. We review the dilemmas in the diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and focus on the roles of clinical assessment and CSF examination.

### Neonatal pneumocephalus secondary to meningitis: a case report and literature review [^116Md7P8]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Lumbar puncture was performed 6 hours after admission. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a cell count of 150 × 10⁶/L (10% polymorphonuclear cells) and a glucose level of 1.11 mmol/L. Meropenem and vancomycin were added to the treatments, and cefmetazole was discontinued. Moreover, mechanical ventilation was used to reduce the frequency of apnoea. Despite the administration of active treatments, the infant's status continued to progressively worsen. Within 24 h after admission, the infant presented with no response to stimulation, fixed dilated pupils, and recurrent seizures; therefore, corticosteroids and anticonvulsant drugs were added to the treatment protocol.

On the second day after admission, a plain cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. The CT images revealed diffuse, multiple strip-shaped gas density shadows along the blood vessels within both hemispheres of the brain parenchyma, accompanied by widespread areas of low density. Additionally, there was poor visualization of the ventricular system. High-density shadows were observed in the bilateral fissures, suprasellar cistern, annular cistern, and certain sulci. The midline structure appeared to be slightly shifted to the left, and scattered point-shaped gas density shadows were visible in both orbitals (Fig. 1 a). Owing to the infant's critical condition, the neurosurgeon did not recommend surgical treatment. Therefore, appropriate symptomatic and supportive treatments were continuously provided. On the third day, blood and CSF cultures revealed Enterobacter cloacae, and drug sensitivity tests indicated its sensitivity to various drugs, including meropenem; subsequently, vancomycin was discontinued. Although the infant's condition failed to improve, her parents refused to withdraw life support. A CT brain scan on day 15 of hospitalization revealed a significant increase in pneumocephalus, with a crescent-shaped change and a visible gas‒liquid level (Fig. 1 b). The baby ultimately died from multiorgan failure on day 19 after admission. Autopsy was not performed because of the lack of consent from her parents.

### Investigating chronic meningitis [^115eYXYE]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic meningitis is a syndrome characterised by persistent and progressive signs and symptoms of meningitis along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and elevated protein that fail to improve over 4 weeks. A detailed and careful history and examination is required along with CSF parameters to guide a clinician towards the aetiology of the problem. Neuroimaging modalities have become a useful tool in the quest for a diagnosis in such cases. An interesting case is described in real time illustrating the process of making a diagnosis in chronic meningitis with an insight into investigations and subsequent management.

### Consensus guidelines for lumbar puncture in patients with neurological diseases [^113DQF1W]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Lumbar puncture (LP) is a technique to sample cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a window into brain pathology (Supplemental Data). The procedure involves introducing a needle into the subarachnoid space of the lumbar sac, at a level safely below the spinal cord. Despite modern neuroimaging techniques, LP remains an important diagnostic tool as CSF analysis provides important diagnostic information for many neurological conditions. For example, no procedure can replace the CSF analysis in differential diagnosis of infectious disorders of the central nervous system (e.g. bacterial or viral meningitis, neuroborreliosis). Moreover, CSF analysis is now at the core of the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, an LP is the easiest procedure to perform a CSF pressure measurement. Given the use of CSF analysis for diagnosis, LPs are currently often performed to perform research to discover novel diagnostic biomarkers and understand brain pathology.

### Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in patients of 80 years and older [^11663tR1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. First, we only included patients who underwent lumbar puncture. Older patients may not receive a lumbar puncture due to an atypical or uncharacteristic clinical presentation or a poor overall prognosis. Also, patients with a severe septic shock or coagulation disorders, for whom the lumbar puncture was postponed initially, and died before CSF examination was performed, were not evaluated in this study. Furthermore, patients with space‐occupying lesions on CT who could not undergo a lumbar puncture were not included either. All these factors may lead to a selection bias and underestimation of the mortality rate. Second, only a small proportion of our included patients had negative CSF cultures (9%) because the NRLBM only identifies patients with a positive CSF culture. Patients pretreated with antibiotics, which increases the probability of negative CSF cultures, may therefore be underrepresented in our study. Third, we did not evaluate living circumstances prior to hospital admission. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions on the influence of living circumstances on pathogen distribution and clinical course. Nonetheless, this large nationwide study allowed us to describe a representative group of very old patients with community‐acquired bacterial meningitis.

In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in patients of 80 years of older is associated with a high mortality rate, although 30% have a good recovery despite their old age. Atypical causative pathogens such as L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli occur commonly and should be considered when starting empirical antimicrobial therapy in this age group. Primary preventive strategies, such as the 23‐valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination (PPV‐23) which is given to adults aged 60 years or older since 2020, or secondary prevention with the 13‐valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV‐13) and PPV‐23, may decrease the impact of this disease in the population very advantaged of age. Maximized herd protection may also help older adults, who have a poor immunological response, to be fully immunized.

Evaluation of pediatric recurrent headache — examination and indications for ancillary testing: Evaluation begins with thorough history, vital signs, and complete neurologic examination including the optic fundus, and the principle indication for performance of ancillary diagnostic testing rests on information or concerns revealed during this fundamental process. There is a lack of consensus concerning the role of diagnostic testing including routine laboratory testing, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, electroencephalography (EEG), and neuroimaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For acute severe presentations when serious conditions are suspected, if subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute or chronic meningitis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or certain other conditions are suspected, lumbar puncture when opening pressure measurement and appropriate ancillary testing are indicated, and if the clinical examination demonstrates nuchal rigidity with or without alteration of consciousness, signs of increased intracranial pressure, mental status changes, or lateralizing features, neuroimaging followed by lumbar puncture may need to be performed. The presence of headache accompanied by fever or in the immunocompromised patient must raise concerns for infections such as meningitis, either bacterial or viral.

### Diplopia in a patient with carcinomatous meningitis: a case report and review of the literature [^114Ag16b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

In a patient with a history of malignancy, an isolated neurologic sign or symptom may indicate metastasis to the central nervous system. To exclude this possibility, a lumbar puncture should still be performed after a nondiagnostic cranial computed tomography (CT) scan even in the absence of signs of infection. A case is presented of a 59 year-old man recently diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with the sole complaint of diplopia. Examination was unremarkable except for a left abducens nerve palsy. Cranial CT scan was normal but initial cerebrospinal fluid results were suggestive of carcinomatous meningitis, and cytology results later confirmed this diagnosis. A review of diplopia and carcinomatous meningitis is presented, along with a suggested conservative diagnostic algorithm for cancer patients presenting with neurologic signs or symptoms.

IrAE-Ns affecting the CNS

For purposes of this discussion, the CNS is defined to include the meninges and the parenchyma of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. Meningitis is a syndrome of headache, fever and neck stiffness; focal neurological deficits or seizures should be taken as evidence of parenchymal CNS involvement. The parenchyma can be affected by inflammation of the gray and/or white matter (encephalitis), demyelination or vasculitis (which can lead to CNS ischemia). An attempt should be made to attribute neurological symptoms that localize to the CNS to one of these major categories, recognizing that this may, in some cases, be difficult for non-specific symptoms (as discussed above).

The evaluation of CNS disease relies primarily on a combination of head and spinal cord imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Head imaging (CT or MRI) should be performed prior to lumbar puncture (LP) to exclude mass lesions that may cause herniation and because LP can cause pachymeningeal enhancement.

MRI has superior sensitivity to detect many abnormalities compared with CT. MRI of the brain with contrast is recommended to evaluate for leptomeningeal and/or pachymeningeal enhancement, and for evidence of CNS metastasis, encephalitis, vasculitis, and demyelination. Head CT evaluates for cerebral edema, strokes and hemorrhages but is unlikely to demonstrate leptomeningeal or pachymeningeal inflammation. If MRI brain is not possible, then head CT is preferably performed with contrast. A head CT rather than an MRI may also be warranted in more acute presentations given the rapidity with which it can be obtained.

In all cases, it is important to rule out infectious disease as well as CNS involvement by the primary malignancy. In certain situations, serologic tests can identify antibodies associated with autoimmune encephalitis or demyelinating disease. Antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigen positivity may suggest an autoimmune tendency but are of unclear pathogenic significance in isolation. Serum evaluation for specific infectious agents should be dictated by local prevalence, seasonal incidence, travel history and other patient risk factors such as intravenous drug use or high-risk sexual exposure. If concern about undiagnosed infectious disease persists, additional testing including metagenomic next-generation sequencing can be considered, typically with guidance from an infectious disease expert. Given its invasive nature, brain biopsy is not commonly pursued but may very rarely be needed to rule out alternative etiologies.

### Cranial imaging and lumbar puncture in patients with suspected central nervous system infection [^116gHGZt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We included consecutive adult patients with suspected CNS infections who underwent CSF examinations in the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, from February 2012 through May 2015. The methods have been described previously. In short, all patients 16 years or older presenting to the emergency department or admitted to the hospital with the suspicion of an infection of the CNS who underwent a CSF examination were included in this study. The study was set up for a prospective cohort, but to assure no episodes were missed, an overview of all CSF samples analyzed by the hospital laboratory was conducted, and all episodes fulfilling the inclusion criteria were also included. Data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed; therefore, this study is considered as a prospective study according to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria. Exclusion criteria were suspected infection within 1 month of neurosurgery or a traumatic brain injury, or implanted neurosurgical devices. Online case record forms were used to collect data on each patient's medical history, clinical characteristics on presentation, and results of laboratory investigations and radiological imaging.

### Shifts in diagnostic testing for headache in the emergency department, 2015 to 2021 [^114kB6eK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) causes approximately 5% of acute-onset headaches in emergency department (ED) patients and has a 50% risk of serious disability or death at 1 year. The first-line diagnostic test for SAH is noncontrast head computed tomography (CT), which is most sensitive within the first 6 hours of headache onset. When CT is nondiagnostic and clinical suspicion remains high, lumbar puncture (LP) is the recommended second-line test (CT-LP approach). However, LP yields a high proportion of false-positive results. Since ruptured cerebral aneurysms account for nearly all attributable morbidity from SAH, computed tomography cerebral angiography (CTCA) has been proposed as a noninvasive alternative (CT-CTCA approach) to LP due to its relatively high sensitivity and specificity for cerebral aneurysms.,

In 2019, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) issued a weak recommendation for the use of either a CT-LP or CT-CTCA approach to exclude aneurysmal SAH. However, debate persists over the appropriateness of the CT-CTCA approach owing to concerns over cost, radiation exposure, missed alternative diagnoses (eg, meningitis), increased detection of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA), and no clear advantage in cost-benefit analyses. Since there is little to no direct evidence supporting a CT-CTCA approach to SAH diagnosis in practice, updated 2023 guidelines from the American Heart and Stroke Associations (AHA/ASA) made a strong recommendation in favor of a CT-LP approach but no recommendation for a CT-CTCA approach.

To help further inform clinical practice, we examined temporal trends in and correlations between second-line testing (LP or CTCA) for SAH and newly detected UIA among ED patients with headaches. Given rising CTCA use in the general ED patient population, we hypothesized that an increase in CTCA use for the evaluation of headache would be mirrored by a decrease in LP use, with an associated rise in UIA detection. From a safety perspective, we examined trends in missed diagnoses of SAH or bacterial meningitis following ED encounters for headache.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114NGCqc]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) — central nervous system evaluation and lumbar puncture indications state that patients with significant CNS signs or symptoms at presentation should undergo appropriate imaging, and if CNS hemorrhage is suspected, a CT of the brain without contrast is recommended, whereas if leukemic meningitis is suspected, a brain MRI with and without contrast is recommended. If symptoms persist after exclusion of bleeding and mass lesions, a diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed once coagulopathy has been corrected, adequate platelet support is available, and circulating disease has been cleared through initiation of systemic therapy; one dose of intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, or a combination) can be considered at the time of diagnostic LP. Routine screening LPs are not warranted at diagnosis in AML patients who lack neurologic symptoms; however, screening LPs should be considered at first remission in asymptomatic patients with WBC count > 40 × 10⁹/L at diagnosis or risk factors including extramedullary disease, high-risk APL, intraparenchymal hemorrhage at diagnosis, AML with FLT3 mutations or MLLT3::KMT2A fusion, monocytic differentiation, or mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), particularly in patients not receiving doses of cytarabine ≥ 2 g/m².

### What's the bug? an unusual cause of bacterial meningitis in a patient with history of transsphenoidal surgery [^1138rZS3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial meningitis is an increasingly rare disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. We describe the case of a 38-year-old male with a past medical history of pituitary macroadenoma with prior endonasal surgeries on prednisone therapy daily for resultant hypopituitarism and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy on lamotrigine daily who was transferred to an academic tertiary emergency department due to concern for developing pituitary apoplexy. At the outside emergency department, the patient presented complaining of sudden onset severe headache. CT scan demonstrated residual pituitary mass but no additional findings. On arrival to our emergency department, the patient was altered and newly febrile. Physical exam was notable for the patient moving all extremities and opening eyes spontaneously but unable to follow commands with a positive Kernig's sign. Broad spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and stress dosed steroids were started due to concern for meningitis, and Neurology and Neurosurgery were consulted. Repeat CT was obtained prior to lumbar puncture (LP). LP demonstrated bacterial meningitis, which later speciated to Streptococcus salivarius. The patient was admitted to the medical ICU and discharged with full neurologic recovery on hospital day 13. This case demonstrates the variable presentation of bacterial meningitis as the patient was not initially febrile or altered. Emergency physicians index of suspicion for meningitis should be increased with risk factors such as immunosuppression and history of transsphenoidal surgery, as in our patient. Our case is a unique case of Streptococcus salivarius meningitis that has been previously associated with primarily iatrogenic etiologies.

### Spinal subdural Staphylococcus aureus abscess: case report and review of the literature [^1138ehqk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Only 65 cases (including our case) of spinal subdural abscesses have been reported to the literature, mostly to the lumbar spine. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterial. The symptoms are not caracteristic and contrast - enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) is the imaging method of choice. The early diagnosis is crucial for the prognosis of the patient.

Case Presentation

We present a patient 75 years old who had a history of diabetes and suffered acute low back pain in the region of the lumbar spine for the last 4 days before his admission to the hospital. He also experienced lower leg weakness, fever and neck stiffness. After having a brain CT scan and a lumbar puncture the patient hospitalized with the diagnosis of meningitis. Five days after his admission the diagnosis of subdural abscess secured with contrast - enhanced MRI but meanwhile the condition of the patient impaired with respiratory failure and quadriplegia and he was admitted to the ICU. A laminectomy was performed eight days after his admission into the hospital but unfortunately the patient died.

Conclusion

Early diagnosis and treatment are very important for the good outcome in patients with subdural abscess. Although morbidity and mortality are very high, surgical and antibiotic treatment should be established as soon as possible after the diagnosis has secured.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of cryptococcosis: an initiative of the ECMM and ISHAM in cooperation with the ASM [^112Nk4RF]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis — raised intracranial pressure (Panel 8) includes graded actions for monitoring and management. Opening pressure should be measured at every lumbar puncture in patients with cryptococcal meningitis (AIIu), and a brain CT should be done to exclude CNS outflow obstruction (AIII). Acute symptomatic elevation of the intracranial pressure (≥ 20 cm of CSF) should be managed by daily therapeutic lumbar punctures with removal of sufficient CSF, usually around 20–30 mL, to reduce the pressure to 50% of opening pressure or to a normal pressure of ≤ 20 cm of CSF (AIIu). Perform a scheduled therapeutic lumbar puncture 48–72 h after initial lumbar puncture or 7 days, regardless of initial opening pressure (BIIu). Persistent raised symptomatic intracranial pressure despite therapeutic lumbar punctures should be managed by surgical decompression via temporary lumbar drainage, shunting, or ventriculostomy, depending on local expertise and resources (AIII). Consider ventriculoperitoneal (preferential) and lumboperitoneal shunts (alternative) to control both acute and chronic hydrocephalus if temporary measures are not successful, ideally inserting shunts after institution of effective antifungal therapy (BIII).

### Reducing unnecessary CT scan of the head for minor paediatric head injuries at the emergency department [^112p1NqC]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

The project team was able to identify errors made during indications of CT scan of the head in paediatric patients through audits and surveys and developed effective measures to decrease unindicated CT scan. Besides, this project reduced the risk for some paediatric patients undergoing a CT scan of the head and the economic and functional impact of the service, based on strategic measures that improved the performance of physicians in the area.

Despite the various limitations, we managed to create a series of measures to ensure the sustainability of the project. In addition to the interventions related to the educational part of the doctors of the service, the integration of a special sheet to each patient's file represents insurance that the parameters of the different guidelines will be fulfilled.

This project also makes it clear that it is necessary to study the indications of the CT scan of the head in other scenarios, such as headache or prior to a lumbar puncture, in order to have the same benefits that we find in this case. In general, it is necessary to subject the staff of the institution to programmed performance evaluations that include compliance with the various protocols established for any disease, based on the analysis of patient's file and other available resources.

### Delayed diagnosis of bilateral subdural effusions complicating intracranial hypotension in a patient presenting with post lumbar puncture headache [^114NT5jY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 34-year-old woman presented with an unrelenting headache which had been ongoing since discharge from hospital 4days before. She initially presented 2weeks earlier with a 7days history of severe headache, for which she had a CT scan, lumbar puncture and treatment for possible viral meningitis. The headache got worse 4days after the lumbar puncture. Despite analgesics and bed rest, the headache persisted. A subsequent magnetic imaging scan demonstrated bilateral subdural effusions. She was given supportive treatment, which included advice concerning strict bed rest and analgesia. The headache took several months to abate. A third of patients suffer from post lumbar puncture headaches and this should be explained during informed consenting and post procedure. Not all post lumbar puncture headaches are simple headaches. A post lumbar puncture headache continuing for more than 7–14days after the procedure requires further investigation to exclude life-threatening intracranial complications.

### COVID-19 meningitis without pulmonary involvement with positive cerebrospinal fluid PCR [^1129aJnc]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) typically presents with respiratory illness ranging in severity. Neurological complications of the disease remain largely unknown. Herein, we discuss the case of a woman diagnosed with COVID-19 meningitis following two positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) RT-PCR assays, and highlight the importance of recognizing the neurological manifestations of the disease.

Case Report

The patient was a 49-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with non-specific symptoms (fever, headache, malaise, nausea/vomiting). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a lack of pulmonary involvement and oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal RT-PCR was negative for COVID-19. A lumbar puncture was performed on the third day of admission and the CSF analysis elucidated a viral pattern, but the CSF bacterial culture and RT-PCR assay for herpes simplex virus were both negative. Surprisingly, the CSF RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive. The diagnosis of COVID-19 meningitis was made and the patient was treated solely with Kaletra ®, with a second CSF analysis confirming our unique finding 1 week later. The patient's clinical characteristics improved progressively, and she was discharged in excellent general condition after 21 days.

Conclusion

In contrast to what was originally believed, the SARS-CoV-2 can cause meningitis in isolation, perhaps by crossing the blood-brain barrier. Hence, it seems essential that physicians maintain a high index of suspicion for neurological involvement among COVID-19 patients, with early CSF analysis and brain imaging sometimes being indicated.

Materials and Methods

Single case report and review of the literature.

Findings

We describe a child with acute bacterial meningitis in whom plain CT and MRI showed the white cerebellum sign. The subtle imagings findings were not recognized and a lumbar puncture was performed. Markedly increased intracranial pressure was documented by lumbar puncture and by placement of an intraparenchymal monitor. Contrary to most prior descriptions the patient made a very good recovery.

Conclusions

The white cerebellum sign is a subtle imaging finding seen in patients with diffuse cerebral edema, such finding may not be as ominous as previously thought.

### Is a lumbar puncture required to rule out atraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in emergency department patients with headache and normal brain computed tomography more than six hours after symptom onset? [^116tKFHy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Atraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a deadly condition that most commonly presents as acute, severe headache. Controversy exists concerning evaluation of SAH based on the time from onset of symptoms, specifically if the headache occurred > 6 h prior to patient presentation.

Clinical Question

Do patients undergoing evaluation for atraumatic SAH who have a negative computed tomography (CT) scan of the head obtained more than 6 h after symptom onset require a subsequent lumbar puncture to rule out the diagnosis?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included a retrospective cohort study, two prospective cohort studies, and a case-control study. These studies provide estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of head CT imaging obtained > 6 h from symptom onset and diagnostic test characteristics of subsequent lumbar puncture.

Conclusion

The probability of SAH above which emergency clinicians should perform a lumbar puncture is 1.0%. This threshold is essentially the same as the estimated probability of SAH in patients with a negative head CT obtained more than 6 h from symptom onset. Emergency physicians might reasonably decide to either perform or forego this procedure. Consequently, we contend that the decision whether to perform lumbar puncture in these instances is an excellent candidate for shared decision-making.

### Determinants of timely management of acute bacterial meningitis in the ED [^1158cWGc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose was to study the emergency management of patients with suspected meningitis to identify potential areas for improvement.

Methods

All patients who underwent cerebrospinal fluid puncture at the emergency department of the University Hospital of Bern from January 31, 2004, to October 30, 2008, were included. A total of 396 patients were included in the study. For each patient, we analyzed the sequence and timing for the following management steps: first contact with medical staff, administration of the first antibiotic dose, lumbar puncture (LP), head imaging, and blood cultures. The results were analyzed in relation to clinical characteristics and the referral diagnosis on admission.

Results

Of the 396 patient analyzed, 15 (3.7%) had a discharge diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, 119 (30%) had nonbacterial meningitis, and 262 (66.3%) had no evidence of meningitis. Suspicion of meningitis led to earlier antibiotic therapy than suspicion of an acute cerebral event or nonacute cerebral event (P < .0001). In patients with bacterial meningitis, the average time to antibiotics was 136 minutes, with a range of 0 to 340 minutes. Most patients (60.1%) had brain imaging studies performed before LP. On the other hand, half of the patients with a referral diagnosis of meningitis (50%) received antibiotics before performance of an LP.

Conclusions

Few patients with suspected meningitis received antimicrobial therapy within the first 30 minutes after arrival, but most patients with pneumococcal meningitis and typical symptoms were treated early; patients with bacterial meningitis who received treatment late had complex medical histories or atypical presentations.

### Shifts in diagnostic testing for headache in the emergency department, 2015 to 2021 [^1131xztQ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Subarachnoid hemorrhage is typically diagnosed by noncontrast head computed tomography (CT); lumbar puncture is recommended if computed tomography is nondiagnostic, although CT cerebral angiography has been promoted as an alternative to lumbar puncture in this diagnostic pathway. The outcomes of this debate in practice have not been studied.

Objective

To determine whether CT cerebral angiography use has increased in lieu of lumbar puncture among emergency department (ED) patients with headache, with an increase in unruptured intracranial aneurysm detection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study took place in 21 community EDs of an integrated health care system in Northern California between 2015 and 2021. Participants were adult (aged > 17 years) health plan members with a chief concern of headache. Exclusions were prior diagnoses of subarachnoid hemorrhage, unruptured intracranial aneurysm, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, or cerebrospinal fluid shunt. Data were analyzed from October to November 2023.

Exposures

CT cerebral angiography and/or lumbar puncture during the ED encounter.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary and secondary outcomes were 14-day and 90-day unruptured intracranial aneurysm detection, respectively. Safety outcomes were missed diagnoses of subarachnoid hemorrhage or bacterial meningitis. The annual incidence of unruptured intracranial aneurysm detection was normalized to the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (UIA:SAH ratio). Average annualized percentage changes were quantified using joinpoint regression analysis.

Results

Among 198 109 included ED encounters, the mean (SD) age was 47.5 (18.4) years; 140 001 patients (70.7%) were female; 29 035 (14.7%) were Black or African American, 59 896 (30.2%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 75 602 (38.2%) were White. Per year, CT cerebral angiography use increased (18.8%; 95% CI, 17.7% to 20.3%) and lumbar punctures decreased (-11.1%; 95% CI, -12.0% to -10.4%), with a corresponding increase in the 14-day UIA:SAH ratio (3.5%; 95% CI, 0.9% to 7.4%). Overall, computed tomography cerebral angiography use increased 6-fold relative to lumbar puncture, with a 33% increase in the detection of UIA. Results were similar at 90 days and robust to sensitivity analyses. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (1004 cases) and bacterial meningitis (118 cases) were misdiagnosed in 5% and 18% of cases, respectively, with no annual trends (P = 0.34; z1003 = .95 and P = 0.74; z117 = -.34, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of ED patients with headache, increases in CT cerebral angiography use were associated with fewer lumbar punctures and higher detection of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, with no significant change in missed diagnoses of subarachnoid hemorrhage or bacterial meningitis. While this shift in diagnostic strategy appeared safe in the short-term, the long-term consequences remain unclear.

### Improving patient safety of acute care lumbar punctures [^113ME48U]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

The first lumbar puncture (LP) was performed in 1891 by Quincke in order to relieve raised intracranial pressure in children with tuberculous meningitis.

LP has since become a common invasive procedure to analyse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the acute medical setting. This procedure does not come without its risks and complications, making documentation an important aspect of the process for protection of both the patient and physician.

In other areas of medicine, the use of proformas has been shown to improve the quality of documentation and triggers elements of the procedure to be considered by the physician. This makes it much easier for other team members to reflect on the procedure and creates consistency in clinical practice.

### Pneumococcal meningitis in adults: a prospective nationwide cohort study over a 20-year period [^113GPWGh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic treatment was known for 1714 patients (94%) and consisted of third-generation cephalosporins in combination with amoxicillin in 752 patients (44%) and in combination with penicillin or ampicillin in 57 patients (3%). Dexamethasone was administered per protocol in 1188 of 1774 episodes (67%), and after the antibiotics or clinical deterioration in 144 episodes, and in a lower dose in 37 episodes. A total of 498 of the 1216 patients (41%) who underwent neuroimaging before lumbar puncture received antibiotics before neuroimaging. The proportion of patients who underwent neuroimaging before lumbar puncture increased over time (192 of 279 [69%] in 1998–2002 to 283 of 315 [90%] in 2015–2018 [P < .001]), as did the proportion of these patients receiving antibiotics before neuroimaging (52 of 192 [27%] in 1998–2002 to 140 of 273 [51%] in 2015–2018 [P < .001]).

Neuroimaging was performed on and/or during admission in 1679 of 1816 episodes (92%) and revealed abnormalities in 1094 episodes: mastoid and/or sinus opacification in 639 of 1816 episodes (35%), hypodensities suspect for recent cerebral infarction in 279 (15%), generalized brain edema in 202 (11%), hydrocephalus in 105 (6%), cerebral hemorrhage (excluding microbleeds) in 24 (1%), subdural empyema in 23 (1%), venous sinus thrombosis in 22 (1%), brain abscesses in 14 (1%), or other abnormalities in 142 patients (8%).

Cardiorespiratory failure (circulatory shock or respiratory failure) developed in 578 of 1770 (33%) patients, of whom 469 (74%) required mechanical ventilation. Neurological complications occurred in 1149 of 1797 patients (64%), including deterioration of consciousness in 971 of 1693 patients (57%), in-hospital seizures in 315 of 1744 patients (18%), and focal neurological abnormalities in 364 of 1690 patients (22%). Clinical outcome at discharge was unfavorable in 772 of 1816 episodes (43%), with in-hospital death occurring in 363 episodes (20%), vegetative survival occurring in 6 episodes, severe disability in 95 episodes (5%), and moderate disability in 308 episodes (17%) (Figure 3).

### The role of lumbar puncture in children with suspected central nervous system infection [^113gceyg]. BMC Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The use of the lumbar puncture in the diagnosis of central nervous system infection in acutely ill children is controversial. Recommendations have been published but it is unclear whether they are being followed.

Methods

The medical case notes of 415 acute medical admissions in a children's hospital were examined to identify children with suspected central nervous system infection and suspected meningococcal septicaemia. We determined whether lumbar punctures were indicated or contraindicated, whether they had been performed, and whether the results contributed to the patients' management.

Results

Fifty-two children with suspected central nervous system infections, and 43 with suspected meningococcal septicaemia were identified. No lumbar punctures were performed in patients with contraindications, but only 25 (53%) of 47 children with suspected central nervous system infection and no contraindications received a lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture findings contributed to the management in 18 (72%) of these patients, by identifying a causative organism or excluding bacterial meningitis.

Conclusion

The recommendations for undertaking lumbar punctures in children with suspected central nervous system infection are not being followed because many children that should receive lumbar punctures are not getting them. When they are performed, lumbar puncture findings make a useful contribution to the patients' management.

### Consensus guidelines for lumbar puncture in patients with neurological diseases [^114yc4Q7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

3 Results

3.1 Identification of LP contraindications

Contraindications were identified from the available literature. The most important contraindication for LP is an intracranial space–occupying lesion with mass effect as well as a posterior fossa mass because it can lead to herniation of the cerebellar tonsils, regardless of the volume of CSF that is sampled. Other contraindications for LP include a risk for cerebral herniation caused by abnormal intracranial pressure due to increased CSF pressure or Arnold-Chiari malformation, as well as anticoagulant medication, coagulopathies and uncorrected bleeding diathesis, congenital spine abnormalities, and local skin infection at the puncture site (Table 1). Based on consensus (evidence level III); a brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan should at least be performed before LP if an intracranial lesion with mass effect, abnormal intracranial pressure due to increased CSF pressure, or tonsillar herniation is suspected, or whenever a patient has focal neurological deficits, is immune compromised, has a previous central nervous system disease, recent seizures, impaired consciousness, or papilledema at fundoscopy. The following imaging findings should be considered as a contraindication for LP:
- Evidence for a pressure gradient across the falx cerebri.
Unequal supratentorial pressure gradients can result in a lateral shift of midline structures. Asymmetry of lateral ventricles is frequently a result of congenital brain abnormality or congenital/perinatal stroke, presenting an abnormal anatomical variant. On the other hand, an asymmetry of the lateral ventricles should not be considered to be an accurate sign, as ipsilateral ventricular dilation may be caused by stroke and as coaptation of a frontal horn may represent a normal anatomical variant. Performing an LP in patients with unequal supratentorial pressure gradients can result in compression of the ipsilateral temporal lobe, leading to uncal herniation.
- Evidence for a pressure gradient between the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments.
Such pressure gradient may be caused by elevated pressure above the tentorium cerebelli, and elevated pressure below the tentorium cerebelli. Under these circumstances, LP may lead to a bilateral uncal herniation.
- Arnold-Chiari malformation. Patients with an Arnold-Chiari malformation are prone to develop tonsillar herniation, sometimes even after removal of small volumes of CSF.

### Is the combination of negative computed tomography result and negative lumbar puncture result sufficient to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage? [^114wAcBP]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Current clinical practice assumes a negative computed tomography (CT) head scan result and a negative lumbar puncture result together are adequate to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with acute headache. Our objective is to determine the sensitivity of a negative CT result combined with a negative lumbar puncture result to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Methods

This prospective cohort study was conducted at 2 tertiary care emergency departments (EDs) during 3 years. We enrolled all patients who were older than 15 years, had a nontraumatic acute headache and normal neurologic examination result, and who had a CT head scan and a lumbar puncture if the CT result was negative (ie, no blood in the subarachnoid space). Patients were followed up with a structured telephone questionnaire 6 to 36 months after their ED visit and electronic hospital records review to ensure no missed subarachnoid hemorrhage. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of the strategy of CT and then lumbar puncture for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Results

Five hundred ninety-two patients were enrolled, including 61 with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The mean patient age was 43.6 years, with 59.1% female patients. All cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage were identified on initial CT or lumbar puncture. One patient without subarachnoid hemorrhage was subsequently diagnosed with cerebral aneurysm, requiring surgery. The strategy classified patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of 100% (95% CI 94% to 100%), 67% (95% CI 63% to 71%), 3.03 (95% CI 2.69 to 3.53), and 0. For diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage or aneurysm, these were 98% (95% CI 91% to 100%), 67% (95% CI 63% to 71%), 2.98 (95% CI 2.63 to 3.38), and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.17), respectively.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective study evaluating the accuracy of a strategy of CT and lumbar puncture to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage in alert ED patients with an acute headache. This study validates clinical practice that a negative CT with a negative lumbar puncture is sufficient to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage.

### LP or not LP, that is the question: gold standard or unnecessary procedure in subarachnoid haemorrhage? [^111WLRhz]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To measure the sensitivity of modern CT in patients presenting to the emergency department and evaluated for possible subarachnoid haemorrhage, with particular attention to those presenting within 12h of ictus.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Large district general hospital emergency department seeing 73,500 new attendances per year.

Participants

Patients presenting to the emergency department and screened for suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage.

Outcome Measures

Subarachnoid haemorrhage was defined by either the presence of subarachnoid blood on CT, positive CSF spectrophotometry defined by national guidelines or aneurysm identified on subsequent angiography if either of the former were equivocal.

Results

244 patients were screened for subarachnoid haemorrhage during the 24months between March 2006 and April 2008 (mean age 48.5years). The sensitivity of CT overall for subarachnoid haemorrhage was 93.8% (95% CI 84% to 98%) increasing to 95% (95% CI 82% to 99%) if performed within 12h of ictus.

Conclusions

While modern CT has a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute subarachnoid haemorrhage, particularly within 12h of ictus, it is still not sufficient to act as the sole diagnostic tool, and patients with a negative CT will require further investigation with a lumbar puncture.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^115B1LzD]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation after stabilization of SE — testing guidance — advises that once SE is under control and vital signs are stable, specific diagnostic studies can be performed. A lumbar puncture is generally needed if there is any suspicion of a central nervous system infection, but may not be required if meningitis is not suspected, particularly in patients with AED non-compliance. A comprehensive toxicology screen should be obtained if there is no clear etiology for SE, and specific toxicology testing should be performed if the history or physical examination suggests a specific toxin. Additional critical care management may apply to those with suspected elevated intracranial pressure and/or mass effect.

### Acute headache presentations to the emergency department: a statewide cross-sectional study [^115N4UJe]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to describe demographic and clinical characteristics including features that were consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), use of diagnostic tests, emergency department (ED) discharge diagnoses, and disposition of adult patients presenting with an acute headache to EDs statewide across Queensland, Australia. In addition, potential variations in the presentation and diagnostic workup between principal-referral and city-regional hospitals were examined.

Methods

A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted over 4 weeks in September 2014. All patients ≥ 18 years presenting to one of 29 public and five private hospital EDs across the state with an acute headache were included. The headache had to be the principal presenting complaint and nontraumatic. The 34 study sites attend to about 90% of all ED presentations statewide. The treating doctor collected clinical information at the time of the ED visit including the characteristics of the headache and investigations performed. A study coordinator retrieved results of investigations, ED discharge diagnoses, and disposition from state databases. Variations in presentation, investigations, and diagnosis between city-regional and principal-referral hospitals were examined.

Results

There were 847 headache presentations. Median (range) age was 39 (18–92) years, 62% were female, and 31% arrived by ambulance. Headache peaked instantly in 18% and ≤ 1 hour in 44%. It was "worst ever" in 37%, 10/10 in severity in 23%, and associated with physical activity in 7.4%. Glasgow Coma Scale score was < 15 in 4.1%. Neck stiffness was noted on examination in 4.8%. Neurologic deficit persisting in the ED was found in 6.5%. A computed tomography (CT) head scan was performed in 38% (318/841, 95% CI = 35% to 41%) and an lumbar puncture in 4.7% (39/832, 95% CI = 3.4% to 6.3%). There were 18 SAH, six intraparenchymal hemorrhages, one subdural hematoma, one newly diagnosed brain metastasis, and two bacterial meningitis. Migraine was diagnosed in 23% and "primary headache not further specified" in 45%. CT head scans were more likely to be performed in principal-referral hospitals (41%) compared to city-regional hospitals (33%). The headache in patients presenting to the latter was less likely to be instantly peaking or associated with activity, but was no less severe in intensity and was more frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Their diagnosis was more likely to be a benign primary headache. Variations in CT scanning could thus be due to differences in the case mix. The median (interquartile range) ED length of stay was 3.1 (2.2 to 4.5) hours. Patients was discharged from the ED or admitted to the ED short-stay unit prior to discharge in 57 and 23% of cases, respectively.

Conclusions

The majority of patients had a benign diagnosis, with intracranial hemorrhage and bacterial meningitis accounting for only 3% of the diagnoses. There are variations in the proportion of patients receiving CT head scans between city-regional and principal-referral hospitals. As 38% of headache presentations overall underwent CT scanning, there is scope to rationalize diagnostic testing to rule out life-threatening conditions.

### Diagnostic workup of acute headache and subarachnoid hemorrhage in a Norwegian population: an observational study [^112N9aUX]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

LP is a moderately straightforward procedure, but as an invasive investigation it predisposes the patient to complications, and can cause complications such as spinal headaches and CSF‐leak, low back pain and in very rare cases epidural hematoma, resulting in increased hospitalization. CTA has been suggested to replace LP in the workup of SAH. However, CTA does not directly evaluate SAH, only cerebrovascular pathology. Incidental aneurysm findings may lead to unwarranted interventions, increased contrast exposure and nephropathy risk. Furthermore, no studies comparing CTA versus LP have been published to date. For these reasons, current guidelines do not recommend CTA as a diagnostic modality for suspected SAH.

In summary, the standard approach of head CT and LP with xanthochromia evaluation without additional risk assessment seems to lead to over‐investigation of low‐risk patients. Routine LP after a normal head CT, if performed within 6 h, may lead to more harm and uncertainty than benefit, and does not justify subjecting all acute headache patients to a potentially harmful procedure requiring the time, resources and costs of hospitalization.

However, from a clinical point of view, it is important to stress that a normal CT scan within 6 h of presentation is highly sensitive in excluding SAH, but further investigations can be justified depending on strong clinical suspicion, history and comorbidity. Given the severe morbidity and potential mortality associated with a missed aneurysmal SAH diagnosis, the decision regarding the need for further investigations will be influenced by details of the history and the clinical state of the patient. It is important to note that patients with atypical presentations such as primary neck pain, syncope, seizure or a new focal neurological deficit are different matters than those with a typical history of acute headache. Further, LP has a place in the diagnostic workup of some patients, and in certain cases needs to be carried out especially to rule out other conditions such as meningitis or inflammatory diseases.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^117PiwEe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Imaging evidence summary in healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis. Neuroimaging studies, while rarely the definitive study, are very frequently obtained during evaluation, and in known infection shunt hardware retained from previous procedures or complications may be detected; plain radiographs of the shunt system to document retained hardware may also be helpful. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scanning may be useful for noninfectious complications but is often normal in uncomplicated meningitis, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than CT for detecting ventriculitis. Fluid-attenuation inversion recovery and post-contrast T1 weighted images can be used to detect pus in the ventricular system (visualized as bright signal) and to differentiate a brain abscess from malignancy, and care must be taken to ensure that intracranial pressure monitoring and external CSF drainage devices are cleared for MRI. An ultrasound or CT of the abdomen may identify CSF loculations at the shunt terminus in patients with abdominal symptoms or signs.

### Detection and management of elevated intracranial pressure in the treatment of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis: a systematic review [^111cG1XD]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

ICP Monitoring

Intracranial pressure in patients with ABM was measured using invasive methods in 18 studies, with external ventricular drain (EVD) and intraparenchymal monitoring devices being the most widely used (Table 2). Six and three studies reported the use of either EVD or intraparenchymal monitoring devices, respectively. Seven other studies reported the use of both, with EVD being most often chosen as the first alternative. One study used subdural catheters and another one used lumbar drain for ICP measurement.

Table 2
The tools used by each study for ICP measurement, estimation, or monitoring

AMB: acute bacterial meningitis, CNS: central nervous system, CPP: cerebral perfusion pressure, CT: computed tomography, EVD: external ventricular drain, GCS: Glasgow Coma Scale, ICP: intracranial pressure, ID: identifier, MeningiSSS: xxx, MRI: magnetic resonance imaging, NM: not mentioned, PICU: xxx, RLS: Reaction Level Scale

Management of patients in need of invasive ICP monitoring is typically performed at an intensive care unit. In studies in which this information was available (13/18), a deteriorating neurological status was the main indication. In some studies (11/18), authors used standardized and objective metrics such as the GCS, or the Reaction Level Scale. In other studies, different surrogates were used, such as clinical and radiological signs or perceived severity of the illness (7/18). The GCS and Reaction Level Scale thresholds for initiation of ICP monitoring were generally set to below 7–9 or above 3, respectively (Table 2).

All six studies that reported the use of CT in conjunction with invasive techniques confirmed that CT was less reliable and could severely underestimate a raised ICP. Muralidhar et al. found that once abnormal head CT findings were detected, clinical outcomes were remarkably worse. Similar findings were noted by Wettervik et al. who found a significant association between both compression of the basal cisterns on admission CT and pupillary abnormalities and unfavorable outcomes or death. Wettervik et al. did not find any association between elevated ICP and positive CT findings, which they attributed to the effective early detection and management of elevated ICP before the development of radiological signs.

Cryptococcal meningitis — intracranial pressure management — "Opening pressure should be measured at every lumbar puncture in patients with cryptococcal meningitis". "Acute symptomatic elevation of the intracranial pressure (≥ 20 cm of CSF) should be managed by daily therapeutic lumbar punctures… usually around 20–30 mL… to reduce the pressure to 50% of opening pressure or to a normal pressure of ≤ 20 cm of CSF". "Perform a scheduled therapeutic lumbar puncture 48–72 h after initial lumbar puncture or 7 days, regardless of initial opening pressure", and persistent raised pressure "should be managed by surgical decompression via temporary lumbar drainage, shunting, or ventriculostomy".

### Sensitivity of computed tomography performed within six hours of onset of headache for diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage: prospective cohort study [^111Wy4kK]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Because the study did not interfere with usual clinical practice, many participants did not undergo lumbar puncture after normal results on computed tomography. Unless patients had a definitive cause for the headache identified on neuroimaging (such as subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage, tumour with mass effect, meningitis, acute or subacute infarction) or had negative results on lumbar puncture (that is, no erythrocytes and no xanthochromia), they were followed for six months to ascertain their outcome. These patients underwent a structured telephone interview, and we reviewed hospital records at one and six months to identify any missed subarachnoid haemorrhages. Patients who had angiography without lumbar puncture underwent the full follow-up procedure. Patients requiring follow-up were called up to five times at varying times on different days of the week. For patients whom we could not reach by telephone, we attempted to ascertain their vital status by searching records from regional neurosurgical centres at the end of the study. Finally, we searched the provincial coroner's records for the names of all patients not known to be alive and free from subarachnoid haemorrhage at six months based on this passive follow-up of hospital records. By law, all sudden and unexpected deaths in Ontario are reported to the coroner, who has the authority to investigate and identify the cause of death.

Analysis

Data were sent by courier to the coordinating centre at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, entered into a SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) database by trained data entry personnel, and verified by searching for outliers. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratios, and negative predictive values of computed tomography for subarachnoid haemorrhage, with 95% confidence intervals. At the end of the study we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the differences between the patients who did undergo lumbar puncture and those who did not.

Sample size

We anticipated that, for a life threatening problem such as subarachnoid haemorrhage, clinicians would expect 100% sensitivity with a narrow confidence interval (such as 97% to 100%). Thus, we estimated that we required over 100 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage in whom computed tomography was performed in less than six hours from onset of headache. With an overall prevalence of subarachnoid haemorrhage of about 7% in our previous work of similar patients and a median delay to imaging of six hours for positive subarachnoid cases (that is, in half of positive cases imaging was carried out within six hours of onset of headache), we estimated we required a total sample size of about 2860 patients.

None specified. Level B recommendations: 1. Determine a serum glucose and sodium level on patients with a first-time seizure with no comorbidities who have returned to their baseline. 2. Obtain a pregnancy test if a woman is of childbearing age. 3. Perform a lumbar puncture, after a head computed tomography (CT) scan, either in the ED or after admission, on patients who are immunocompromised.

Newly diagnosed pulmonary coccidioidal infection — assessment for extrapulmonary dissemination emphasizes targeted evaluation over routine screening: "When extrapulmonary dissemination of infection occurs, granulomatous proliferation at the site produces local inflammation that results in signs and symptoms referable to that site. A careful review of systems and physical examination is essential". "If these do not identify focal extrapulmonary problems, routine screening imaging studies, such as bone surveys, radionuclide bone scans, or whole-body computed tomography (CT) or MRI, are usually unnecessary to fully assess extent of disease". "In particular, lumbar punctures are unnecessary in most patients without signs or symptoms of CNS involvement". "In contrast, if history or physical examination identifies 1 or more specific anatomic areas of potential concern, further imaging studies appropriate for that area are warranted".

A blood culture and lumbar puncture should be performed immediately to confirm the diagnosis. Because complications associated with lumbar puncture include life-threatening brain herniation, at-risk patients should have a computed tomographic scan before undergoing the procedure. Lumbar puncture also may be delayed pending CT scan results if it may be likely that symptoms are caused by increased intracranial pressure from, for example, a central nervous system mass lesion. Blood samples still should be obtained from patients immediately, and appropriate empiric therapy administered. Once a negative CT scan result is obtained, patients can proceed to lumbar puncture. Diagnosis Diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is dependent on CSF examination following lumbar puncture.

In bacterial meningitis, opening pressure generally is between 200 and 500 mm H₂O; white blood cell count and protein concentration are elevated; glucose concentration may be low; and there may be a neutrophil or lymphocyte predominance. Limulus lysate assay, though sensitive, also is not recommended for routine use as it does not distinguish between organisms or rule out gram-negative meningitis, and it is not widely available. When CSF findings suggest bacterial meningitis but CSF Gram stain and culture results are negative, a combination of laboratory tests is necessary to distinguish bacterial from viral meningitis. The most strongly recommended tests are PCR, which is more sensitive than viral culture and faster than cell culture for the detection of enterovirus, and determination of. In neonates with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacilli, the duration of therapy should be determined in part by repeated lumbar punctures documenting CSF sterilization. Patients who have not responded clinically after 48 hours of appropriate therapy also should be monitored with repeated CSF analysis, particularly those with meningitis caused by resistant strains and those who have received adjunctive dexamethasone therapy. Repeated CSF analysis is not recommended on a routine basis. Because any complications of bacterial meningitis usually occur within the first two or three days of treatment, carefully selected patients may be eligible for outpatient management, with close follow-up.
