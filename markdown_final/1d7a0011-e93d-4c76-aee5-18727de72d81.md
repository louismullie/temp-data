## Question

Hypoglycemic and stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hypoglycemia relates to stroke, including its connection across acute presentation, mechanisms, epidemiology, and management, as well as prevention and guideline-based targets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where hypoglycemia and stroke intersect. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms linking hypoglycemia to cerebrovascular events. Next, I will review the epidemiologic evidence for association versus causation. After that, I need to check guideline-directed acute management thresholds and why they matter. Then, I will examine the risks of overly aggressive glycemic control and the evidence for moderate targets. Finally, I should consider prevention strategies, special populations, and synthesize practical takeaways with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where hypoglycemia and stroke intersect so I don't miss key scenarios. Hypoglycemia can present as a stroke mimic with focal deficits, it can be a trigger for acute ischemic stroke in the days following an episode, it is a critical consideration in acute stroke protocols before thrombolysis, and it is a recognized complication of inpatient glycemic management after stroke, particularly with insulin protocols, so I need to keep these domains in mind as I proceed [^1148Pm82] [^116CBFUi] [^111tZTeC] [^112EyNDy].

> Wait, let me verify the stroke-mimic issue because missing this delays appropriate care. Hypoglycemia can produce focal neurological deficits that resemble acute ischemic stroke, and guidelines explicitly advise checking capillary glucose before IV alteplase because hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can mimic stroke; rapid correction of hypoglycemia can reverse deficits and avert unnecessary thrombolysis, so I should confirm that glucose is measured immediately in suspected stroke presentations [^111tZTeC] [^113TdqNd] [^114FF1YY] [^114sLnWZ].

> I will now examine the mechanistic links between hypoglycemia and cerebrovascular events to ensure biological plausibility. Severe hypoglycemia activates the sympathoadrenal system, increasing cardiac workload and arrhythmias, and induces a prothrombotic, proinflammatory state with endothelial dysfunction. These hemodynamic and thromboinflammatory changes can precipitate cerebral ischemia, and emerging data suggest hypoglycemia may acutely trigger ischemic stroke within days, which aligns with clinical observations and supports a causal pathway in vulnerable patients [^117Q4crD] [^111dZvGo] [^116CBFUi] [^1128EGBR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality without reviewing the epidemiology. Multiple large cohorts and trials show strong associations between severe hypoglycemia and subsequent cardiovascular events, including stroke, with dose–response patterns and early hazard windows. For example, ADVANCE-linked severe hypoglycemia was associated with markedly higher risks of macrovascular events and death, and Korean national data showed sequential increases in stroke risk with more severe hypoglycemia episodes, while a recent case-crossover analysis found a more than threefold increase in acute ischemic stroke risk on the day following a hypoglycemia encounter, though confounding remains a concern and some analyses suggest hypoglycemia may also be a marker of vulnerability rather than a sole cause [^111yZBb5] [^115haTPK] [^116CBFUi] [^117Q4crD].

> Next, I should review acute management thresholds in ischemic stroke to ensure alignment with guidelines. The AHA/ASA recommends treating hypoglycemia when blood glucose is less than 60 mg/dL in acute ischemic stroke and advises checking glucose before alteplase; importantly, they also recommend treating hyperglycemia to a moderate target of 140–180 mg/dL with close monitoring to prevent iatrogenic hypoglycemia, reflecting the balance between hyperglycemia-related harm and hypoglycemia risk [^112o5hbv] [^111KTQkh] [^117NtFun] [^111tZTeC].

> Let me consider hemorrhagic stroke guidance as well so I don't overgeneralize from ischemic stroke. For spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, AHA/ASA guidance emphasizes serum glucose monitoring to mitigate both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and recommends treating hypoglycemia when glucose is below about 40–60 mg/dL; they caution that tight glucose control worsens hypoglycemia and may worsen outcomes, reinforcing a moderate, safety-conscious approach in ICH [^114JJ9z5] [^1141DkTt] [^11235txz] [^111dXPEs].

> I should double-check the evidence on tight glycemic control in acute ischemic stroke because this directly informs targets. Trials and systematic reviews show no functional benefit from intensive insulin protocols and a marked increase in hypoglycemia; for example, GKI infusions did not improve infarct growth and caused frequent asymptomatic hypoglycemia, and Cochrane analyses found no improvement in death or dependency but a substantially higher risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia with intensive control, while SHINE likewise failed to show benefit of tighter targets, supporting avoidance of aggressive insulin titration in the acute phase [^114ZJcy9] [^112EyNDy] [^112cWSf3] [^117NpanZ].

> But wait, what if moderate targets are actually safer and sufficient. The AHA/ASA's 140–180 mg/dL target for hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke is designed to mitigate the harms of persistent hyperglycemia while minimizing hypoglycemia; neurocritical care meta-analyses suggest a U-shaped relationship with both hypoglycemia and extreme hyperglycemia worsening outcomes, and European guidance advises against routine IV insulin to achieve tight control, aligning with a conservative, monitoring-intensive approach [^111KTQkh] [^11162ENQ] [^113PhkPT].

> Next, I should review prevention strategies that reduce hypoglycemia risk without sacrificing glycemic control. Individualized A1c targets, favoring 7–8% or even 8–9% in older adults or those with comorbidities, reduce hypoglycemia exposure, and selecting agents with lower hypoglycemia risk, alongside structured education and continuous glucose monitoring where appropriate, can mitigate severe events. Guidelines also emphasize that intensive glycemic control does not reduce stroke risk and increases hypoglycemia, so therapy should be tailored to hypoglycemia vulnerability [^116PRsJX] [^112HYwFH] [^114iDSiA] [^112J4u8C].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and bidirectional risks. Older adults with diabetes have a bidirectional link between hypoglycemia and cognitive decline or dementia, which increases vulnerability to future hypoglycemia and complicates self-management. In pediatrics, hyperglycemia is common after pediatric AIS and hypoglycemia is less frequent, but adult AHA/ASA principles for glucose management are often extrapolated pending pediatric-specific data, underscoring the need for careful monitoring and conservative targets [^1179E4K6] [^113uSkGd].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Hypoglycemia can mimic stroke, can trigger ischemic stroke within days, and is a preventable iatrogenic harm in inpatient stroke care. Guidelines converge on prompt treatment of glucose less than about 60 mg/dL and on moderate hyperglycemia targets with vigilant monitoring, while evidence argues against tight insulin protocols due to hypoglycemia without outcome benefit, supporting a balanced, patient-centered approach that prioritizes safety and avoids extremes of glycemia [^111tZTeC] [^116CBFUi] [^111KTQkh] [^112EyNDy].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical clinical steps. In the emergency setting, check capillary glucose immediately in suspected stroke and treat hypoglycemia before thrombolysis if present. During inpatient care, aim for 140–180 mg/dL for hyperglycemia with frequent checks to prevent hypoglycemia, avoid GKI infusions or overly aggressive insulin titration, and treat any glucose less than 60 mg/dL promptly with dextrose. For secondary prevention, individualize A1c targets upward when hypoglycemia risk is high and prefer agents with low hypoglycemia risk, integrating education and CGM where feasible to reduce severe events and their cerebrovascular consequences [^111tZTeC] [^111KTQkh] [^116PRsJX] [^112J4u8C].

Hypoglycemia is a recognized **stroke mimic** [^1148Pm82] and can present with focal deficits that resolve with glucose correction [^117JhQaM]. Severe hypoglycemia (< 40 mg/dL) is linked to **increased short-term stroke risk** [^116CBFUi], especially in older adults with diabetes, via sympathoadrenal activation, endothelial dysfunction, and prothrombotic effects [^117Q4crD] [^111dZvGo]. In acute ischemic stroke, treat hypoglycemia immediately (typically with IV dextrose) [^115MnrRj] and correct to ≥ 70 mg/dL before thrombolysis [^notfound]; persistent hypoglycemia worsens outcomes and increases mortality [^111yZBb5]. Avoid tight glycemic targets in stroke care [^113PhkPT] to prevent iatrogenic hypoglycemia, and monitor closely during insulin therapy [^113c617Y] [^112EyNDy].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hypoglycemia and stroke

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain how hypoglycemia may precipitate or exacerbate stroke:

- **Sympathoadrenal activation**: Hypoglycemia triggers catecholamine release, causing vasoconstriction, increased cardiac workload, and arrhythmias, potentially precipitating cerebrovascular events [^117Q4crD] [^114KGWcb].

- **Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation**: Hypoglycemia induces endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation, promoting atherosclerosis and thrombosis [^111dZvGo] [^114pb8DB].

- **Prothrombotic state**: Hypoglycemia increases platelet aggregation and coagulation, enhancing thrombotic risk [^111dZvGo] [^112J4u8C].

- **Neuroglycopenia**: Prolonged hypoglycemia causes neuronal energy failure, mimicking ischemic stroke and potentially causing irreversible brain injury if not promptly corrected [^114qhS1i] [^115ThR5s].

---

## Clinical evidence of association between hypoglycemia and stroke

Multiple studies and reviews have documented a significant association between hypoglycemia and stroke:

- **Stroke mimic**: Hypoglycemia can present with focal neurological deficits indistinguishable from acute ischemic stroke, resolving with glucose administration [^1148Pm82] [^117JhQaM].

- **Increased stroke risk**: Severe hypoglycemia is associated with a higher risk of subsequent stroke, particularly in older adults with diabetes [^116CBFUi] [^115haTPK].

- **Bidirectional relationship**: Stroke patients with diabetes are at increased risk of hypoglycemia due to impaired glucose regulation and medication effects, creating a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia and stroke [^112EyNDy] [^1152M9eg].

---

## Clinical guidelines for management of hypoglycemia in stroke patients

Current guidelines emphasize **prompt recognition and treatment** of hypoglycemia in stroke patients:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) | - Treat hypoglycemia if blood glucose < 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) [^112o5hbv] <br/> - Correct to ≥ 70 mg/dL before administering thrombolysis [^notfound] |
| Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) | - Treat hypoglycemia if blood glucose < 40–60 mg/dL (2.2–3.3 mmol/L) [^1141DkTt] <br/> - Monitor serum glucose closely to prevent recurrence [^114JJ9z5] |
| General stroke care | - Avoid tight glycemic control (target 80–130 mg/dL) due to increased risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia [^11235txz] <br/> - Maintain glucose within 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10.0 mmol/L) [^111rp2v8] |

---

## Impact of hypoglycemia on stroke outcomes

Hypoglycemia **significantly worsens stroke outcomes** through several mechanisms:

- **Increased mortality**: Hypoglycemia is associated with higher in-hospital and long-term mortality in stroke patients [^112GKxVR].

- **Neurological deterioration**: Persistent hypoglycemia exacerbates neurological injury, increasing the risk of permanent disability [^114qhS1i] [^111dZvGo].

- **Delayed recovery**: Hypoglycemia impairs brain recovery processes, prolonging hospital stay and rehabilitation needs [^notfound].

---

## Preventive strategies and clinical recommendations

To minimize hypoglycemia-related stroke risk, clinicians should **individualize glycemic targets** — especially in older adults or those with a history of hypoglycemia — and prefer agents with lower hypoglycemia risk, such as metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Educate patients to recognize and manage hypoglycemia, and use continuous glucose monitoring in high-risk patients to enable early detection and prevention of hypoglycemia [^116PRsJX] [^112HYwFH] [^111in3G5].

---

Hypoglycemia is a **stroke mimic** and a **risk factor for stroke**, particularly in patients with diabetes. Immediate recognition and correction of hypoglycemia are critical in acute stroke care, and avoiding tight glycemic targets helps prevent iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Individualized glycemic management, patient education, and continuous glucose monitoring are essential strategies to reduce hypoglycemia-related stroke risk and improve outcomes.

### Stress hyperglycemia and prognosis of stroke in nondiabetic and diabetic patients: a systematic overview [^1152t9h7]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

"Stress" hyperglycemia may be associated with increased mortality and poor recovery in diabetic and nondiabetic patients after stroke. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature relating acute poststroke glucose levels to the subsequent course were done to summarize and quantify this relationship.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was done for cohort studies reporting mortality and/or functional recovery after stroke in relation to admission glucose level. Relative risks in hyperglycemic compared with normoglycemic patients with and without diabetes were calculated and meta-analyzed when possible.

Results

Thirty-two studies were identified; relative risks for prespecified outcomes were reported or could be calculated in 26 studies. After stroke of either subtype (ischemic or hemorrhagic), the unadjusted relative risk of in-hospital or 30-day mortality associated with admission glucose level > 6 to 8 mmol/L (108 to 144 mg/dL) was 3.07 (95% CI, 2.50 to 3.79) in nondiabetic patients and 1.30 (95% CI, 0.49 to 3.43) in diabetic patients. After ischemic stroke, admission glucose level > 6.1 to 7.0 mmol/L (110 to 126 mg/dL) was associated with increased risk of in-hospital or 30-day mortality in nondiabetic patients only (relative risk = 3.28; 95% CI, 2.32 to 4.64). After hemorrhagic stroke, admission hyperglycemia was not associated with higher mortality in either diabetic or nondiabetic patients. Nondiabetic stroke survivors whose admission glucose level was > 6.7 to 8 mmol/L (121 to 144 mg/dL) also had a greater risk of poor functional recovery (relative risk = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.73).

Conclusions

Acute hyperglycemia predicts increased risk of in-hospital mortality after ischemic stroke in nondiabetic patients and increased risk of poor functional recovery in nondiabetic stroke survivors.

### Hypoglycemia and diabetes: a report of a workgroup of the American diabetes association and the endocrine society [^113vHhqg]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications of hypoglycemia on both short- and long-term outcomes in people with diabetes?

Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is more frequent in patients with profound endogenous insulin deficiency — type 1 diabetes and advanced type 2 diabetes — and its incidence increases with the duration of diabetes. It is caused by treatment with a sulfonylurea, glinide, or insulin and occurs about two to three times more frequently in type 1 diabetes than in type 2 diabetes. Event rates for severe hypoglycemia for patients with type 1 diabetes range from 115 to 320 per 100 patient-years. Severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes has been shown to occur at rates of 35 to 70 per 100 patient-years. However, because type 2 diabetes is much more prevalent than type 1 diabetes, most episodes of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, occur in people with type 2 diabetes.

There is no doubt that hypoglycemia can be fatal. In addition to case reports of hypoglycemic deaths in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, four recent reports of mortality rates in series of patients indicate that 4%, 6%, 7%, and 10% of deaths of patients with type 1 diabetes were caused by hypoglycemia. A temporal relationship between extremely low subcutaneous glucose concentrations and death in a patient with type 1 diabetes who was wearing a CGM device and was found dead in bed has been reported. Although profound and prolonged hypoglycemia can cause brain death, most episodes of fatal hypoglycemia are probably the result of other mechanisms, such as ventricular arrhythmias. In this section, we will consider the effects of hypoglycemia on the development of hypoglycemia unawareness and how iatrogenic hypoglycemia may affect outcomes in specific patient groups.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to patients with acute stroke, AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend to monitor serum glucose to reduce the risk of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Optimal glycemic control in neurocritical care patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11162ENQ]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

We did not identify one subgroup of neurocritical care patients in whom intensive insulin therapy was associated either with any particular benefit or harm. The relationship between tighter glycemic control and improved neurological recovery was, however, stronger among patients with TBI, ICH or SAH than it was for patients with ischemic stroke. This finding is consistent with the lack of benefit observed in RCTs assessing the efficacy of GKI infusions, all of which exclusively involved patients with ischemic stroke. Our findings should not necessarily be applied to patients undergoing semi-elective neurosurgical procedures, such as resection of a brain tumor, since these were not included in the analysis.

We believe that RCTs are consistent with a U-shaped relationship between serum glucose concentration and neurological outcomes. Both hypoglycemia and extreme hyperglycemia are likely to be harmful. Comparable observations have also been made in medical and surgical critical care patients. The optimal glucose target for neurocritical care patients is likely to fall between 80 and 180 mg/dl (4.4 and 10.0 mmol/L). Given that RCTs suggest a relatively high incidence of hypoglycemia when clinicians attempt to maintain glucose levels between 80 and 110 mg/dl (4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L), we consider a more conservative approach to be most appropriate, for example, 110 to 180 mg/dl (6.1 to 10.0 mmol/L).

Some large RCTs involving heterogeneous populations of critically ill patients have not yet published results for their subgroup of neurological patients, and were therefore excluded from this analysis. Most importantly, the NICE-SUGAR trial included more than 6,000 critically ill patients. The GLUCONTROL trial designated 142 of 1,078 patients (13%) as having a neurological diagnostic category, but did not provide results for this subgroup. Another trial, involving 1,200 medical ICU patients, reported hospital mortality among 61 patients with neurologic conditions. Because the specific disorders were not described, it was unclear if these patients met our eligibility criteria. We were unable to obtain this information from the authors. However, a sensitivity analysis performed with inclusion of these patients did not change our results (RR 0.99, 0.84 to 1.17, P = 0.90).

### Hypoglycemia and cardiovascular outcomes in the CARMELINA and CAROLINA trials of linagliptin: a secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1152M9eg]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Previous studies have reported an association between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular (CV) events in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but it is unclear if this association is causal or identifies a high-risk patient phenotype.

Objective

To evaluate the associations between hypoglycemia and CV outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis was a post hoc assessment of the multinational, double-blind CARMELINA (Cardiovascular and Renal Microvascular Outcome Study With Linagliptin; 2013–2016) and CAROLINA (Cardiovascular Outcome Trial of Linagliptin vs Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes; 2010–2018) randomized clinical trials of the antihyperglycemic drug, linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor. Participants were adults with T2D at high CV risk with or without high kidney risk. By design, participants in the CARMELINA trial had longer duration of T2D and had a higher CV risk than participants in the CAROLINA trial. Data analyses were conducted between June 2021 and June 2023.

Intervention

Linagliptin or placebo in the CARMELINA trial, and linagliptin or glimepiride in the CAROLINA trial.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome for both trials was CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke (3-point major adverse CV events [3P-MACE]). For the present analyses, hospitalization for heart failure (HF) was added. Hypoglycemia was defined as plasma glucose less than 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia (episodes requiring the assistance of another person). Associations between the first hypoglycemic episode and subsequent CV events and between nonfatal CV events (MI, stroke, hospitalization for HF) and subsequent hypoglycemic episodes were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. Sensitivity analyses explored the risk of CV events within 60 days after each hypoglycemic episode.

Results

In the CARMELINA trial (6979 patients; 4390 males [62.9%]; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [9.1] years), there was an association between hypoglycemia and subsequent 3P-MACE plus hospitalization for HF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04–1.46) as well as between nonfatal CV events and subsequent hypoglycemia (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06–1.83). In the CAROLINA trial (6033 patients; 3619 males (60.0%); mean [SD] age, 64.0 [9.5] years), there was no association between hypoglycemia and subsequent 3P-MACE plus hospitalization for HF (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76–1.32) and between nonfatal CV events and subsequent hypoglycemia (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.96–2.16). In analyses of CV events occurring within 60 days after hypoglycemia, there was either no association or too few events to analyze.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found bidirectional associations between hypoglycemia and CV outcomes in the CARMELINA trial but no associations in either direction in the CAROLINA trial, challenging the notion that hypoglycemia causes adverse CV events. The findings from the CARMELINA trial suggest that both hypoglycemia and CV events more likely identify patients at high risk for both.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01897532 (CARMELINA) and NCT01243424 (CAROLINA).

### How hypoglycaemia can affect the life of a person with diabetes [^116rU7nx]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoglycaemia is the commonest side-effect of insulin treatment for diabetes, and is the single greatest barrier to achieving and maintaining good glycaemic control. Severe hypoglycaemia (requiring assistance for recovery) is associated with significant morbidity and is feared by most people with type 1 diabetes and their families. It causes stress and anxiety and may influence self-management and glycaemic control. The annual prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia is around 30% in people with type 1 diabetes, and is higher in those with risk factors such as strict glycaemic control, impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia and increasing duration of diabetes. It is also common during sleep (nocturnal hypoglycaemia). Neurological manifestations include coma, convulsions, transient hemiparesis and stroke, while reduced consciousness and cognitive dysfunction may cause accidents and injuries. Cardiac events may be precipitated such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia and cardiac failure. Hypoglycaemia can affect all aspects of life, including employment, driving, recreational activities involving exercise, and travel, and measures should be taken in all of these situations to avoid this potentially dangerous side-effect of insulin therapy.

### Hypoglycemia and cardiovascular risks [^1151tcAw]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In a large multicenter randomized controlled trial in Australia (NICE-SUGAR), the relationship of glycemic control to outcome from critical illness was examined in patients being treated in intensive care units. Strict control of blood glucose (4.5–6.0 mmol/L) was compared with standard control (< 10.0 mmol/L). Mortality was higher in patients who maintained strict glycemic control, in whom severe hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose < 2.2 mmol/L) was much more common (6.8 vs. 0.5%; P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis suggested that no difference in 90-day mortality existed between individuals with diabetes (∼20%) and individuals without diabetes (∼80%). Potential weaknesses of this study limit interpretation. Unfortunately, the protocol permitted a reduction in the frequency of blood glucose measurements to four hourly tests when blood glucose was considered to be "stable", which was then inadequate to assess glycemic control. In addition, neuroglycopenia may be more difficult to detect in an unconscious patient under sedation and may not therefore be identified. Two meta-analyses have shown that strict glycemic control in seriously ill patients does not improve overall survival but reduces the risk of septicemia in surgical intensive care units at the expense of a fivefold higher incidence of hypoglycemia (13.7 vs. 2.5%).

Alarming results have been reported recently from a large multicenter registry of 3,571 Japanese patients undergoing first elective coronary revascularization when a potential association was examined between preoperative HbA 1c levels and the CV outcome. Of the 3,571 patients, 1,504 had type 2 diabetes; the outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes was analyzed according to four categories of HbA 1c: < 6%, 6 to < 7%, 7 to < 8%, and > 8%. Freedom from composite events of CVD death, myocardial infarction, and stroke after coronary revascularization was similar in nondiabetic patients and in those diabetic patients presenting with an HbA 1c between 6 and 7%. By contrast, diabetic patients with higher HbA 1c values (7–8 and > 8%) had a significantly higher rate of the composite end point versus nondiabetic subjects (P < 0.0005), but the composite end point of CVD death, myocardial infarction, and stroke after coronary revascularization was similar or even higher in diabetic patients who had the lowest HbA 1c values (< 6.0%) compared with those patients with the poorest glycemic control.

### Hypoglycaemia and CV risk: perceptions and reality [^111r1YCe]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia is an established complication of diabetes management. It has been related to numerous adverse outcomes including dementia, falls, cognitive dysfunction, coma, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and many more. Of all these adverse cardiovascular outcomes is the most discussed and reported complication related to hypoglycemia. There have been several mechanistic case reports and retrospective data linking hypoglycemia with adverse CVD outcomes. However, hard-core cause and effect relationship remains elusive. This review looks into the available data and where we stand as of now on this issue of hypoglycemia and adverse CVD outcomes.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous alteplase (pre-administration evaluation), AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to assess blood glucose levels before administering IV alteplase since hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations. Do not administer IV alteplase for nonvascular conditions.

### Diabetes, hyperglycemia and the management of cerebrovascular disease [^112yszxC]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperglycemia is frequent in patients with cerebrovascular disease. This review article aims to summarize the recent evidence from observational studies that examined the adverse cerebrovascular effects of dysglycemic states as well as interventional studies assessing intensive management strategies for hyperglycemia.

Recent Findings

In recent years, diabetes, prediabetic states and insulin resistance and their association with cerebrovascular disease were an important focus of research. The cerebrovascular consequences of these metabolic abnormalities were found to extend beyond ischemic stroke to covert brain infarcts, other structural brain changes and to cognitive impairment with and without dementia. Interventional studies did not reveal that more intensive management of chronic hyperglycemia and of hyperglycemia in the setting of acute stroke improves outcome. There is clear evidence, however, that the overall management of multiple risk factors and behavior modification in patients with dysglycemia may reduce the burden of cerebrovascular disease.

Summary

Observational studies reveal the growing burden and adverse cerebrovascular effects of dysglycemic states. Currently available interventional studies assessing more intensive strategies for the management of hyperglycemia did not prove, however, to be effective. We discuss the current evidence, pathophysiological considerations and management implications.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111KTQkh]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — glucose management specifies that hypoglycemia should be treated and provides a reasonable target range for hyperglycemia treatment. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS, and evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia; thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia.

### Risk of stroke and cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome… [^116Fp7HD]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Results Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus had increased risks of stroke, major cardiovascular events, and revascularization procedures compared with the reference group. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risks of both stroke and coronary heart disease. 1–4 Metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance identifies individuals at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes and is also associated with an increase in stroke and cardiovascular morbidity. 5–7 Each component of the cluster of risk factors defining MetS increases the likelihood of stroke.

Transient ischemic attack was defined by the loss of cerebral or ocular function for less than 24 hours of presumed ischemic cause. Patients had to be ambulatory with a modified Rankin score of 3 or less and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 100 to 190 mg/dL. There was no difference between the 3 groups in the distribution of ischemic stroke subtypes at randomization. Among the subjects with MetS, 60% were obese, 39% had glycemic abnormalities, 70% had hypertension, 83% had hypertriglyceridemia, and 77% had reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values. Epidemiological studies indicate that persons with stroke or TIA and type 2 diabetes or MetS have a higher risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events.

1–12 A secondary analysis of subjects with stable CHD randomized in the Treating to New Targets trial found that those with MetS including type 2 diabetes had a higher risk of stroke than those without MetS. 25 Similar to our results, Treating to New Targets subjects with MetS and no diabetes had no increase in stroke risk.

### Hypoglycemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular events [^117WQNap]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The review of the literature and results from large randomized trials suggest that severe hypoglycemia is common during intensive therapy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This is true in the outpatient setting as well as the inpatient setting. Although smaller observational and epidemiological studies suggest an association between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events, there is currently no evidence for causality. Larger clinical trials looking specifically at this question are required. The mechanisms that might be involved also need to be determined further. Our challenge in these patients is to lower blood glucose to near-normal values to lower the risk for long-term complications, but at the same time minimize hypoglycemia- and hypoglycemia-associated morbidity and mortality.

### Outcome prediction in acute stroke patients by continuous glucose monitoring [^111in3G5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

High blood glucose levels induced by cortisol produced by stress in acute stroke patients are known to be related to initial neurological severity and poor outcome at 3 months after onset. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 However, the detailed dynamic state of blood glucose is affected by various physical conditions and therapeutic processes in the acute phase of stroke, and, accordingly, its association with stroke outcome has not been clarified. Although glycemic variability is known to be associated with the onset of acute coronary syndrome, and hypoglycemia is known to be a predictor of poor outcomes in intensive care unit patients, the relationships between these blood glucose parameters and outcomes are unknown in acute stroke patients. 7, 8, 9 The GIST‐UK (Glucose‐Insulin Stroke Trial‐UK) showed no difference in clinical outcomes between acute stroke patients treated with intravenous insulin, potassium, and glucose and those treated with saline. 10 Aggressive lowering of blood glucose using insulin was also associated with poor outcomes in another trial. 11, 12 Current guidelines did not show any clinical evidence that targeting the blood glucose to a particular level during acute ischemic stroke improves outcomes. 13

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has recently become commercially available to evaluate the detailed dynamics of blood glucose levels. A CGM device records blood glucose levels every 5 minutes and obtains glucose parameters, and patients are accordingly able to receive intensive glucose management. 14 The aim of this study was to clarify the detailed dynamics of blood glucose levels in acute stroke patients regardless of the presence of diabetes mellitus using a CGM device and to identify the parameters related to death or dependency at 3 months and early neurological deterioration within 7 days after stroke.

### Association of clinical symptomatic hypoglycemia with cardiovascular events and total mortality in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide population-based study [^113cm9hA]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoglycemia is associated with serious health outcomes for patients treated for diabetes. However, the outcome of outpatients with type 2 diabetes who have experienced hypoglycemia episodes is largely unknown.

Research Design and Methods

The study population, derived from the National Health Insurance Research Database released by the Taiwan National Health Research Institutes during 1998–2009, comprised 77,611 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We designed a prospective study consisting of randomly selected hypoglycemic type 2 diabetic patients and matched type 2 diabetic patients without hypoglycemia. We investigated the relationships of hypoglycemia with total mortality and cardiovascular events, including stroke, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause hospitalization.

Results

There were 1,844 hypoglycemic events (500 inpatients and 1,344 outpatients) among the 77,611 patients. Both mild (outpatient) and severe (inpatient) hypoglycemia cases had a higher percentage of comorbidities, including hypertension, renal diseases, cancer, stroke, and heart disease. In multivariate Cox regression models, including diabetes treatment adjustment, diabetic patients with hypoglycemia had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events during clinical treatment periods. After constructing a model adjusted with propensity scores, mild and severe hypoglycemia still demonstrated higher hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular diseases (HR 2.09 [95% CI 1.63–2.67]), all-cause hospitalization (2.51 [2.00–3.16]), and total mortality (2.48 [1.41–4.38]).

Conclusions

Symptomatic hypoglycemia, whether clinically mild or severe, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. More attention may be needed for diabetic patients with hypoglycemic episodes.

### Cardiac implications of hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes-a systematic review [^114pb8DB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoglycaemia has been associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality in a number of recent multicentre trials, but the mechanistic links driving this association remain ill defined. This review aims to summarize the available data on how hypoglycaemia may affect CV risk in patients with diabetes.

Methods

This was a systematic review of available mechanistic and clinical studies on the relationship between hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular risk. Study outcomes were compiled from relevant articles, and factors contributing to hypoglycaemia-mediated CVD and its complications are discussed.

Results

Six recent comprehensive clinical trials have reinforced the critical importance of understanding the link between hypoglycaemia and the CV system. In addition, 88 studies have indicated that hypoglycaemia mechanistically contributes to CV risk by increasing thrombotic tendency, causing abnormal cardiac repolarization, inducing inflammation, and contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. These hypoglycaemia-associated risk factors are conducive to events such as unstable angina, non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction, sudden death, and stroke in patients with diabetes.

Conclusions

Emerging data suggest that there is an impact of hypoglycaemia on CV function and mechanistic link is multifactorial. Further research will be needed to ascertain the full impact of hypoglycaemia on the CV system and its complications.

### The role of hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke [^112jXg3E]. Neurocritical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the developed world. Reperfusion and anti-thrombotic therapies are of limited benefit for the majority of patients following acute ischemic stroke, and increasing interest has focused on therapeutic approaches that seek to modulate infarct evolution. Animal and human studies have linked hyperglycemia in the acute phase of ischemic stroke to worse clinical outcomes regardless of the presence of pre-existing diabetes mellitus. Experimental data suggest that elevated blood glucose may directly contribute to infarct expansion through a number of maladaptive metabolic pathways, and that treatment with insulin may attenuate these adverse effects. In this review, we analyze the relationship between elevated serum glucose and acute cerebrovascular ischemia, and critically appraise the potential of a clinical strategy that targets euglycemia in all acute stroke patients.

### Continuous glucose monitoring systems can meet the challenge of glucose management and beyond in individuals with type 2 diabetes: an expert multidisciplinary position [^112J4u8C]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges Associated with Care of Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes

The timely diagnosis of T2D remains a challenge, since the condition does not present with clear symptoms for a significant period of time once hyperglycemia may be detectable. Consequently, people with new-onset T2D, or those at risk, do not actively seek medical help. It is for this reason that identifying people at risk and undertaking regular screening is essential for making an effective diagnosis of prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycemia or T2D, as well as enabling early initiation of pharmacological and behavioral therapy. Effective treatment from the moment of diagnosis and early intensification of therapy when treatment goals are not being met are key to preventing and delaying the development of the vascular complications of diabetes.

The largest group of people with T2D are those of advancing years with numerous comorbidities, in whom the benefits of lowering blood glucose levels must be weighed against the risk of hypoglycemia. Frequent overlap between multiple disease processes and the drugs employed in treating them renders glycemic control, in this patient group, a therapeutic challenge.

People with T2D have up to a 10% greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a 53% higher risk of myocardial infarction, a 58% higher risk of stroke, and a 12% higher risk of heart failure when compared with people without diabetes. Numerous studies confirm that the risk of CVD is increased by a factor of 1.6–2.3 in people with T2D, compared to those without. Some of this risk is attributed to the impact of hypoglycemia on processes that are implicated in development of CVD. Studies in healthy individuals and in those with diabetes, particularly T1D, indicate that acute hypoglycemia leads to increased proinflammatory cytokines, mobilization of inflammatory leukocytes, and increased platelet reactivity. Moreover, repeated hypoglycemia in T2D is also associated with enhanced coagulation, oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet activation, which are each associated with CVD.

### Abnormal glucose regulation, hypoglycemic treatment during hospitalization and prognosis of acute ischemic stroke [^114fKMTu]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To examine the effect of abnormal glucose regulation on prognosis and whether hypoglycemic treatment during hospitalization improves prognosis in acute ischemic stroke patients.

Methods

A total of 3882 acute ischemic stroke patients with an elevated systolic blood pressure between 140mmHg and 220mmHg were included in the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke (CATIS). The primary outcome was a combination of death and major disability (modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 3) at 3months after stroke. Secondary outcomes included death, major disability, and vascular events.

Results

Compared with normal fasting plasma glucose, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were 1.25 (0.92–1.68) and 1.38 (1.13–1.67) for composite outcome of death or major disability, respectively, and there was a significant trend for death or major disability (P trend = 0.001). A linear association between fasting plasma glucose and the risk of combined outcome of death and major disability was observed among the patients without hypoglycemic treatment during hospitalization (P for linearity = 0.005). We found protective effect of hypoglycemic treatment for risk of death (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.92) among ischemic stroke patients with DM.

Conclusions

Abnormal glucose regulation, especially DM, increased risks of 3-month poor outcomes after an acute ischemic stroke and hypoglycemic treatment during hospitalization might improve prognosis in ischemic stroke patients with DM.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111hxvYi]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — IV alteplase general principles state that in patients eligible for IV alteplase, benefit of therapy is time dependent, and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible (I A). In patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy, physicians should be prepared to treat potential emergent adverse effects, including bleeding complications and angioedema that may cause partial airway obstruction (I B-NR). The potential risks should be discussed during IV alteplase eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision-making (I C-EO). Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation, and IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions (III: No Benefit B-NR). Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement (III: Harm C-EO).

### Practical approaches to diagnosing, treating and preventing hypoglycemia in diabetes [^114d6Kgz]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Impact

Hypoglycemia poses an economic burden to healthcare resources. Recently published studies suggest that the average cost to the healthcare provider of treating a patient — across settings and countries — is approximately US$1200 per episode, with costs increasing by up to eightfold for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia episodes that require the patient to be admitted to hospital.

Published data also suggest that hypoglycemia directly impairs health-related quality of life in patients with T2DM and that this impairment becomes increasingly pronounced with increasing severity and frequency of the hypoglycemic episodes. This relationship has not been consistently shown in adult patients with T1DM, but it has been more clearly documented in pediatric and adolescent patients.

Hypoglycemia is known to contribute to morbidity and mortality in the clinical setting of diabetes. This risk is primarily cardiovascular related and is seen most often in patients with diabetes who are treated with insulin. Hypoglycemia causes increases in blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output and myocardial contractility, all of which may cause reduced cardiovascular functioning over time. The results of a 2017 study of 464 patients suggested that the crude incidence rates of CVD and death were higher in persons with hypoglycemia than in those without, even after adjusting for potential confounding variables [CVD: 10.6 vs. 5.08 per 100 person-years (PY), p < 0.001; death: 14.3 vs. 4.5 per 100 PY, p < 0.001]. Several large-scale studies have confirmed the strength of this relationship, such as the ACCORD trial results (action to control CVD in diabetes) which suggested that 1% of deaths in the trial were likely caused by diabetes while 9% had hypoglycemia as a contributing factor. Other studies have suggested that severe hypoglycemia may contribute to the deaths of people with T1DM in up to 10% of cases.

### What is the impact of acute endocrine and metabolic alterations on long-term ischemic stroke prognosis: a prospective study [^112hc8NN]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering the clinical implications, further research on stress control, including glucose-lowering interventions and other therapies in acute ischemic stroke, is highly warranted. In the animal model of acute middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced ischemic stroke in rats, the administration of insulin has been shown to reduce infarct size, which theoretically suggests it may improve outcomes in ischemic stroke. However, in one of the largest studies to date, the Glucose in Stroke Trial (GIST), which involved 933 patients with hyperglycemia at admission, the use of a glucose-potassium-insulin infusion to maintain capillary glucose levels between 4 and 7 mmol/L did not show a significant reduction in 90-day mortality following insulin treatment. Additionally, another trial observed that glucose-potassium-insulin infusion was associated with greater infarct growth in patients and a high incidence of hypoglycemia. Overall, the efficacy of insulin therapy in acute ischemic stroke requires confirmation through larger trials, with careful consideration of hypoglycemia risk. Similarly, the current findings regarding thyroid hormones and stroke are still inadequate for clinical application. Hypothyroid animals exposed to cerebral ischemia exhibited reduced apoptosis, necrosis, oxidative stress, neurological impairments, and infarct size, and T3 administration has shown therapeutic effects in animal studies. However, clinical studies examining the use of thyroid hormone therapy in the management of acute stroke are scarce. In summary, there is currently no consensus in guidelines regarding blood glucose control methods and thyroid hormone management during the acute phase of stroke. Future large-scale research is needed to explore the relationships between multi-modal glycemic control strategies (such as long-acting insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents), thyroid hormone supplementation, and long-term stroke outcomes.

### Management of stroke in neonates and children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113uSkGd]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute management of childhood AIS — blood glucose guidance notes that hyperglycemia is a common and well-established risk factor for adverse outcomes in adult stroke and likely a frequent and detrimental risk factor in children as well, yet adult randomized data showed no benefit from intensive glucose control and pediatric evidence is limited; in adults, 933 patients were randomly assigned to 2 arms with no difference in 90-day mortality, while in children a retrospective multivariate analysis of 98 children found hyperglycemia independently associated with adverse outcome, with hyperglycemia relatively common (18%) and hypoglycemia rare (3%). Given the lack of pediatric data, it is reasonable to follow the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) adult stroke guidelines for the management of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and the ongoing SHINE trial is testing treatment of hyperglycemia in adults.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^11235txz]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — glycemic control: In ICU populations, intensive glucose control (target, 81–108 mg/dL) versus conventional control (< 180 mg/dL) was linked to increased mortality and markedly more severe hypoglycemia (glucose ≤ 40 mg/dL; 6.8% versus 0.5%). Tight systemic control (80–110 mg/dL) after severe brain injury was associated with low cerebral microdialysis glucose and brain energy crisis, correlating with increased hospital mortality. In general critical care, a blood glucose target of < 180 mg/dL was associated with lower mortality than a target of 81 to 108 mg/dL. The text notes that the risk of treating hypoglycemia is exceedingly low and that treatment is "highly recommended despite a low quality of evidence". Identified gaps state that optimized serum glucose targets and optimal agents have not been defined and that the relationship among serum glucose, diabetes, and functional outcomes in ICH remains unclear.

### Association of clinical symptomatic hypoglycemia with cardiovascular events and total mortality in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide population-based study [^113G2eHJ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Hypoglycemia is associated with serious health outcomes for patients treated for diabetes. However, the outcome of outpatients with type 2 diabetes who have experienced hypoglycemia episodes is largely unknown.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The study population, derived from the National Health Insurance Research Database released by the Taiwan National Health Research Institutes during 1998–2009, comprised 77,611 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We designed a prospective study consisting of randomly selected hypoglycemic type 2 diabetic patients and matched type 2 diabetic patients without hypoglycemia. We investigated the relationships of hypoglycemia with total mortality and cardiovascular events, including stroke, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause hospitalization.

RESULTS

There were 1,844 hypoglycemic events (500 inpatients and 1,344 outpatients) among the 77,611 patients. Both mild (outpatient) and severe (inpatient) hypoglycemia cases had a higher percentage of comorbidities, including hypertension, renal diseases, cancer, stroke, and heart disease. In multivariate Cox regression models, including diabetes treatment adjustment, diabetic patients with hypoglycemia had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events during clinical treatment periods.

CONCLUSIONS

Symptomatic hypoglycemia, whether clinically mild or severe, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. More attention may be needed for diabetic patients with hypoglycemic episodes.

### Reactive hypoglycaemia: a rarely considered' stroke mimic' in non-diabetic individuals [^115mKySp]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycaemia is a well-documented 'stroke mimic'. The literature documents numerous case reports of patients presenting with focal neurological deficits subsequently attributed to hypoglycaemia. The significant majority of these cases are found in patients with pre-existing diabetes. We present case histories of two patients with no history of diabetes presenting to secondary care with reactive hypoglycaemia causing transient symptoms that were responsible for referral as a possible transient ischaemic attack. Although uncommon, metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycaemia should be considered in all patients presenting as a suspected stroke, even if they are not known to have diabetes.

### Fewer deaths / strokes / revascularizations with metformin than… [^115o7Hae]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does metformin affect cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bottom Line Over five years, treatment with metformin for three years, with other hypoglycemics as needed, reduced the likelihood of death, nonfatal stroke, or the need for vascularization compared with treatment beginning with glipizide. Cardiovascular events were not individually reduced with metformin compared with glipizide. Synopsis These authors enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, and followed them for a median of five years. The average age of all 304 patients was 63. 3 years; 77% were men.

After stopping current treatment, patients were randomized, with allocation concealment unknown, to receive 30 mg of glipizide daily or 1, 500 mg of metformin daily, with additional treatment added as needed, to achieve an average A1C level of 7%. In each group, 25% of patients ended up receiving insulin in addition to the study drug. Using intention-to-treat analysis, the investigators compared the incidence of recurrent cardiovascular events in the two groups, including death, nonfatal stroke, or need for revascularization. After a median follow-up of five years, one or more events occurred in 35% of patients treated with glipizide and in 25% of patients treated with metformin, which translates to a number needed to treat of 9. 4 for five years. Death rates were not different between the two groups. This small study reinforces the findings from the long-ago study that resulted in U. S. Food and Drug Administration warnings of an increased risk of cardiovascular events with sulfonylurea hypoglycemics.

Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Glycemic management during endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — observational data associate glucose levels of > 140 mg/dL with worse outcomes, with a J-shaped relation between admission glucose and disability at 12 months showing a nadir of 90 mg/dL and favorable outcomes with 67 to 131 mg/dL; trial data are mixed, including a large study that failed to show clinical benefit, while some reports targeted < 130 mg/dL. External guidelines recommend insulin treatment for blood glucose concentrations > 140 to 185 mg/dL (American Heart Association/American Stroke Association) and > 180 mg/dL (European Stroke Organization), and recommend treating hypoglycemia at < 50 mg/dL with intravenous dextrose or 10% to 20% glucose. Under anesthesia, glucose levels can increase and vary widely, indicating need for frequent monitoring and careful insulin titration; one trial used a continuous intravenous GKI infusion of 500 mL of 10% dextrose, 20 mmol potassium chloride, and 16 U of insulin to achieve targets.

### Insulin for glycaemic control in acute ischaemic stroke [^112cWSf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with hyperglycaemia concomitant with an acute stroke have greater stroke severity and greater functional impairment when compared to those with normoglycaemia at stroke presentation.

Objectives

To determine whether maintaining serum glucose within a specific normal range (4 to 7.5 mmol/L) in the first 24 hours of acute ischaemic stroke influences outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2010), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (1980 to June 2010), CINAHL (1982 to June 2010), Science Citation Index (1900 to June 2010), and Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge) (1993 to June 2010). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trials registers and SCOPUS.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials comparing intensively monitored insulin therapy versus usual care in adult patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the study characteristics, study quality, and data to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) of outcome measures.

Main Results

We included seven trials involving 1296 participants (639 participants in the intervention group and 657 in the control group). We found that there was no difference between treatment and control groups in the outcome of death or disability and dependence (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.28) or final neurological deficit (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.00). The rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was higher in the intervention group (OR 25.9, 95% CI 9.2 to 72.7). In the subgroup analyses of diabetes mellitus (DM) versus non-DM, we found no difference for the outcomes of death and dependency or neurological deficit.

Authors' Conclusions

With the current evidence, we found that the administration of intravenous insulin with the objective of maintaining serum glucose within a specific range in the first hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide benefit in terms of functional outcome, death, or improvement in final neurological deficit and significantly increased the number of hypoglycaemic episodes. Specifically, those who were maintained within a more tight range of glycaemia with intravenous insulin experienced a greater risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia than those individuals in the control group.

### Severe hypoglycemia and the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^112BiXdS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated the association regarding severe hypoglycemia episodes with cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Baseline and follow-up data (n = 1,568,097) from patients with type 2 diabetes were retrieved from the National Health Insurance System database (covering the entire Korean population). Type 2 diabetes, severe hypoglycemia, and major comorbidities were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes and medication information. Individuals who were classified as type 2 diabetes in the year of 2009 were screened, and we counted severe hypoglycemia episodes from 2007 to 2009. The primary outcome was newly developed myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality. Participants were followed from the baseline index date to the date of death or until December 31, 2015.

Results

In total, 19,660 (1.2%) patients developed at least one severe hypoglycemia event during the period from 2007 to 2009. Mean follow-up was 5.7 years. After adjustment for confounding factors, the hazard ratio (HR) of MI significantly and sequentially increased: 0 vs. 1 episode, HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.46–1.64; 0 vs. 2 episodes, HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.61–2.15; 0 vs. 3 or more episodes, HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48–2.35, P for trend < 0.001. Similar findings were noted regarding the relationship of severe hypoglycemia episodes with stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Risks for all outcomes were highest within 1 year from the index date and showed decreasing trends with follow-up. Sensitivity analyses of the data from the subgroup population and 797,544 subjects who received a national health examination did not change the significance of the main findings.

Conclusion

Among adult Korean patients with type 2 diabetes, a severe hypoglycemia episode is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. Significant results from dose-response, temporal, and sensitivity analyses may suggest the possibility of direct causality between severe hypoglycemia and cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

### Vascular disease and diabetes: is hypoglycaemia an aggravating factor? [^1128EGBR]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Acute hypoglycaemia provokes profound physiological changes affecting the cardiovascular system and several haematological parameters, principally as a consequence of sympatho-adrenal activation and counter-regulatory hormonal secretion. Many of these responses have an important role in protecting the brain from neuroglycopenia, through altering regional blood flow and promoting metabolic changes that will restore blood glucose to normal. In healthy young adults the cardiovascular effects are transient and have no obvious detrimental consequences. However, some of the effected changes are potentially pathophysiological and in people with diabetes who have developed endothelial dysfunction, they may have an adverse impact on a vasculature that is already damaged. The acute haemodynamic and haematological changes may increase the risk of localized tissue ischaemia, and major vascular events can certainly be precipitated by acute hypoglycaemia. These include myocardial and cerebral ischaemia and occasionally infarction. Established diabetic retinopathy often deteriorates after strict glycaemic control is instituted, the latter being associated with a threefold increase in frequency of severe hypoglycaemia, and enhanced exposure to mild hypoglycaemia. The possible mechanisms underlying these hypoglycaemia-induced effects include haemorrheological changes, white cell activation, vasoconstriction, and the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The concept that acute hypoglycaemia could aggravate vascular complications associated with diabetes is discussed in relation to evolving comprehension of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and blood vessel disease.

### Natural history of blood glucose within the first 48 hours after ischemic stroke [^1131KH4c]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite suggestions that glucose levels rise after stroke before falling within a few hours, the natural history and determinants of this phenomenon remain unclear. We aimed to better characterize the time course of changes in glucose levels after ischemic stroke and to identify factors that affect poststroke glycemia.

Methods

Patients with ischemic stroke without previously diagnosed diabetes had blood glucose measured at least 4-hourly until 48 hours poststroke. The relationship between baseline factors, such as the NIH Stroke Scale, and blood glucose was assessed with mixed-effects models. The behavior of glucose over time was modeled in the whole cohort, and for the cohort partitioned into two around an admission glucose of 6.0 mmol/L.

Results

In the cohort of 124 patients the mean glucose was 6.6 mmol/L throughout the period of monitoring, with no change over time. Mixed-effects models identified more severe stroke and glucose-lowering therapy to be associated with higher poststroke glucose levels. When the cohort was partitioned, the mean glucose of those below 6.0 mmol/L at admission increased and the mean glucose of those above 6.0 mmol/L at admission decreased to the overall mean.

Conclusions

Mean glucose levels remain static in patients with ischemic stroke without diabetes until at least 48 hours poststroke. Serial glucose levels are higher in patients with more severe stroke. Initially high or low mean glucose recordings exhibit regression to the mean over time, a change which may merely be a statistical phenomenon without necessarily indicating resolution of abnormal glycemia.

### Association between hypoglycemia and dementia in a biracial cohort of older adults with diabetes mellitus [^1179E4K6]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hypoglycemia commonly occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and may negatively influence cognitive performance. Cognitive impairment in turn can compromise DM management and lead to hypoglycemia.

Objective

To prospectively evaluate the association between hypoglycemia and dementia in a biracial cohort of older adults with DM.

Design and Setting

Prospective population-based study.

Participants

We studied 783 older adults with DM (mean age, 74.0 years; 47.0% of black race/ethnicity; and 47.6% female) who were participating in the prospective population-based Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study beginning in 1997 and who had baseline Modified Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 80 or higher.

Main Outcome Measures

Dementia diagnosis was determined during the follow-up period from hospital records indicating an admission associated with dementia or the use of prescribed dementia medications. Hypoglycemic events were determined during the follow-up period by hospital records.

Results

During the 12-year follow-up period, 61 participants (7.8%) had a reported hypoglycemic event, and 148 (18.9%) developed dementia. Those who experienced a hypoglycemic event had a 2-fold increased risk for developing dementia compared with those who did not have a hypoglycemic event (34.4% vs 17.6%, P < .001; multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0–4.4). Similarly, older adults with DM who developed dementia had a greater risk for having a subsequent hypoglycemic event compared with participants who did not develop dementia (14.2% vs 6.3%, P < .001; multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5–6.6). Further adjustment for stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and cognitive change scores produced similar results.

Conclusion and Relevance

Among older adults with DM, there seems to be a bidirectional association between hypoglycemia and dementia.

### Intensive versus standard treatment of hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke patient: a randomized clinical trial subgroups analysis [^117NpanZ]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Benefit from blood glucose (BG) control during acute ischemic stroke may depend on glycemic parameters. We evaluated for associations between the SHINE (Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort) randomized treatment group and the SHINE predefined 90-day functional outcome, within-patient subgroups defined by various glycemic parameters.

Methods

The SHINE Trial randomized 1151 patients within 12 hours with acute ischemic stroke and hyperglycemia to standard (target BG 80–179 mg/dL) or intensive (target BG 80–130 mg/dL) BG control for 72 hours. We predefined 6 glycemic parameters: acute BG level, absence versus presence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes, hemoglobin A1c, glycemic gap (acute BG-average daily hemoglobin A1c based BG), stress hyperglycemia ratio (acute BG/average daily hemoglobin A1c based BG), and BG variability (SD). Favorable functional outcome was defined by the SHINE Trial and based on the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days, adjusted for stroke severity. We computed relative risks adjusted for baseline stroke severity and thrombolysis use.

Results

Likelihood for favorable outcome was lowest among patients with undiagnosed diabetes compared to patients with true nondiabetes (adjusted relative risk, 0.42 [99% CI, 0.19–0.94]). We did not find any relationship between the favorable outcome rate and baseline BG or any of the glycemic parameters. No differences between SHINE treatment groups were identified among any of these patient subgroups.

Conclusions

In this exploratory subgroup analysis, intensive versus standard insulin treatment of hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke patient subgroups, did not influence the 90-day functional outcomes, nor did we identify associations between these glycemic parameters and 90-day functional outcomes.

### Association between severe hypoglycemia and cardiovascular disease risk in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^111GPPbh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Accumulating epidemiologic evidence, primarily from European populations, suggests that severe hypoglycemia — a critical condition induced by diabetes treatment — may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D). 1, 2, 3 In a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of cohort studies that included 903 510 patients with T2D, severe hypoglycemia was associated with a 2‐fold increased risk of CVD. 1 Subsequently, several cohort studies have reported similar results. 4, 5 This association is biologically plausible, given that severe hypoglycemia induces sympathoadrenal activation, 6 inflammation, 7 endothelial dysfunction, 8 and cardiac ischemia or fatal arrhythmia, 9, 10, 11 all of which have potential adverse cardiovascular effects. These findings have brought widespread attention to the importance of avoiding severe hypoglycemia in order to prevent CVD among patients with T2D.

Asian populations have a relatively higher risk of stroke and a lower risk of ischemic heart disease than Western populations 12; however, there has been only one study from Taiwan 13 that examined the association between severe hypoglycemia and risk of CVD in patients with T2D. Furthermore, no study in Japan has examined this association. Of note, there are marked differences in the initial prescription patterns for diabetes between Japan and other countries, with a low rate of metformin prescriptions (≈25%) and relatively high prescription rates for dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors (≈40%) and sulfonylureas (≈25%). 14 This is in contrast with the high rate of metformin prescriptions in other countries (55–65% in the United States, 15, 16 ≈75% in the United Kingdom, 17 and ≈70% in Taiwan 18). This difference may be partially because the Japanese guidelines on diabetes management do not specify the first‐line agent to be used, but rather recommend that the selection of glucose‐lowering agents should be made on the basis of individual patient characteristics. 19 This advice is in contrast with most clinical practice guidelines that suggest metformin as a first‐line glucose‐lowering agent for patients with T2D. 20, 21, 22 Investigating the association between severe hypoglycemia and risk of CVD in Japan, where the prescription patterns differ from those of other countries, may provide further insight into the role of severe hypoglycemia in the development of CVD in patients with T2D. Therefore, we performed a retrospective cohort study based on a claims database in Japan to clarify the putative association between severe hypoglycemia and the risk of CVD in a Japanese population.

### The association of severe hypoglycemia with incident cardiovascular events and mortality in adults with type 2 diabetes [^116cyH4x]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

There is suggestive evidence linking hypoglycemia with cardiovascular disease, but few data have been collected in a community-based setting. Information is lacking on individual cardiovascular outcomes and cause-specific mortality.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort analysis of 1,209 participants with diagnosed diabetes from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (analytic baseline, 1996–1998). Severe hypoglycemic episodes were identified using first position ICD-9 codes from hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and ambulance calls through 2013. Cardiovascular events and deaths were captured through 2013. We used adjusted Cox regression models with hypoglycemia as a time-varying exposure.

Results

There were 195 participants with at least one severe hypoglycemic episode during a median fellow-up of 15.3 years. After severe hypoglycemia, the 3-year cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease was 10.8% and of mortality was 28.3%. After adjustment, severe hypoglycemia was associated with coronary heart disease (hazard ratio [HR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.27–3.20), all-cause mortality (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.38–2.17), cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.15–2.34), and cancer mortality (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.46–4.24). Hypoglycemia was not associated with stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or noncardiovascular and noncancer death. Results were robust within subgroups defined by age, sex, race, diabetes duration, and baseline cardiovascular risk.

Conclusions

Severe hypoglycemia is clearly indicative of declining health and is a potent marker of high absolute risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.

### Hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes [^115JGyy9]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The consequences of hypoglycaemia

Clinical consequences

Mild symptomatic hypoglycaemia is not reported to have any serious clinical effects, apart from the potential for inducing defects in counterregulatory responses and impaired awareness to subsequent hypoglycaemia. Nevertheless, people with diabetes are fearful of hypoglycaemia (see below), and even clinically trivial events may be enough to inhibit concordance with therapy.

Severe hypoglycaemia is more serious, particularly in the elderly. In a prospective study of people aged > 80 years, with well-controlled (mean HbA 1c 5.1%) Type 2 diabetes, 25% of hospital admissions associated with diabetes were due to severe hypoglycaemia (defined as symptomatic event requiring third-party treatment and blood glucose < 2.8 mmol/l). Patients had considerable comorbidity (cardiovascular disease, dementia or diabetic complications).

In a retrospective cohort study of elderly patients (mean age 78 years) presenting to A&E departments in Tennessee with hypoglycaemia (defined as hospitalisation, A&E admission or death associated with hypoglycaemic symptoms and a blood glucose of < 2.8 mmol/l), almost all patients presented with neuroglycopenic symptoms and 49% presented with loss of consciousness. Approximately 5% were associated with stroke, myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack, injury or death, although the cause-and-effect relationship is not clear.

Severe hypoglycaemia is also associated with increased mortality. For example, in cases of severe hypoglycaemia induced by SU monotherapy, the overall mortality rate has been estimated as approximately 9%. Deficits in cognitive functioning have been found to occur during hypoglycaemic events, and in one study over one-fifth of patients with Type 2 diabetes were found unconscious during a severe hypoglycaemic episode.

A retrospective review of 102 patients (90% with Type 2 diabetes) admitted to hospital with drug-induced hypoglycaemic coma revealed a mortality rate of 4.9% (n = 5) (all in patients with Type 2 diabetes). However, it was not possible to confirm whether the deaths were due to hypoglycaemia, since all five patients had serious comorbidities. Coma was associated with considerable morbidity, including head trauma, fracture, seizures, transient asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia and stroke.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HYPOGLYCEMIA AND CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY

Recent studies such as VADT and ACCORD have brought to the forefront the question of the role of hypoglycemia, if any, in increasing the risk for cardiovascular events. There are few studies looking at this question. Broadly, they can be divided into studies that look at the effect of hypoglycemia on cardiac ischemia, arrhythmias, and cerebral ischemia.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111dXPEs]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Glucose management — synopsis and rationale in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): Glucose monitoring and management are often considered part of the general care of all patients, including those with ICH. Hyperglycemia on presentation may herald a worse prognosis, yet tight glucose control may increase the risk of hypoglycemic events and worsen outcomes, and the ideal evidence-based approach to glucose management in patients with ICH has remained elusive. Monitoring serum glucose is important because it can provide an opportunity to intervene in the event of hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic events, and in the QASC single-blind cluster randomized clinical trial an intervention of fever, hyperglycemia, and swallowing protocols resulted in patients who were significantly less likely to be dead or dependent at 90 days, although the impact of each specific intervention could not be determined. No trials have analyzed the effects of untreated hypoglycemia given the known acute clinical risks.

### Association of clinical symptomatic hypoglycemia with cardiovascular events and total mortality in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide population-based study [^114c9bEG]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The major findings of this study suggest that hypoglycemia episodes, both mild and severe, are strongly associated with subsequent major cardiovascular events including stroke, CHD, and CVD hospitalization in outpatient-treated type 2 diabetic patients. Furthermore, higher all-cause mortality was associated with these hypoglycemic events. Diabetic patients who are vulnerable to hypoglycemia have more comorbidities, including hypertension, liver cirrhosis, renal disease, mental disease, cancer, and previous stroke or heart diseases. Medications, including insulin and sulfonylurea, also are important factors that impact clinical events related to hypoglycemia. Once outpatient-treated diabetic patients have hypoglycemic episodes, cardiovascular and hospitalization events occur most frequently in the first year after the hypoglycemic event regardless of whether the hypoglycemia was mild or severe.

The incidence of clinical hypoglycemic events, including both mild and severe types, was lower in our study than in previous clinical trials such as ACCORD and community epidemiological studies in other countries such as the United Kingdom. A lower proportion of patients with hypoglycemia has been reported in Asian Pacific countries and Taiwan, which may be explained by more conservative treatment strategies in Taiwanese clinical diabetes control.

In recent years, intensive glucose control strategies for long-duration type 2 diabetic patients have been intensively studied, including in the VADT, ADVANCE, and ACCORD trials. These trials did not consistently support strategies to improve reductions in cardiovascular events or mortality. Excessive mortality in intensive glucose control groups has led to debate regarding hypoglycemia-related adverse outcomes. However, a post hoc analysis of the data from the ACCORD trial suggests that the excess mortality in the intensively treated group cannot be directly explained by the more frequent episodes of hypoglycemia in this group of patients. The post hoc analysis of the data from the ADVANCE study also suggested recently that severe hypoglycemia is strongly associated with increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including macrovascular and microvascular changes and death from cardiovascular events. Because there is no relationship between repeated hypoglycemia episodes and adverse outcomes, the authors conclude that hypoglycemia is a likely marker of vulnerability to such events.

### Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events? A report from the ORIGIN trial [^116Ckm7r]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Hypoglycaemia caused by glucose-lowering therapy has been linked to cardiovascular (CV) events. The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further assess this relationship.

Methods and Results

A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of ≤ 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose ≤ 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose ≤ 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8–6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24–2.02, P < 0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39–2.19, P < 0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27–2.30, P < 0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17–2.67, P = 0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine.

Conclusion

Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control.

### Management of diabetes during acute stroke and inpatient stroke rehabilitation [^112iJ7AG]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To summarize evidence on the impact of hyperglycemia on stroke outcomes and to present therapy algorithms for inpatient management in diabetic stroke patients.

Data Sources

Guidelines for inpatient management of diabetes were reviewed and extracted from a technical review and recommendations from 2 national diabetes and endocrine organizations. MEDLINE database searches were conducted using key words: stroke, diabetes, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, inpatient, hospitalized, treatment, outcomes, disability, self-management, and education.

Study Selection

Studies were selected that specifically addressed the impact of the following in stroke patients: hyperglycemia and diabetes on rehabilitation outcomes, management strategies for hyperglycemia and diabetes, and strategies for facilitating diabetes self-management.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted data and management practices from selected articles and published practice guidelines.

Data Synthesis

Diabetes is prevalent in stroke patients and results in poorer inpatient hospital and rehabilitation outcomes. Management of diabetes in stroke patients is further complicated by impairments in mobility and vision, necessitating accommodation strategies and tools for self-management. Optimal management of hyperglycemia using insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents results in reduced morbidity and mortality among diabetic inpatients.

Conclusions

To achieve inpatient glycemic management targets, use of clinical management algorithms, self-management tools, and systems approaches such as diabetes management teams are useful.

### Drug-related risk of severe hypoglycaemia in observational studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LErRG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common disease with increasing prevalence. DM can lead to microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, as well as macrovascular complications caused mainly by atherosclerotic changes that cause myocardial infarction, stroke, TIA, and peripheral vascular disease. Hyperglycaemia is an important pathophysiological factor in the development of these complications and key to keeping the glucose concentration close to euglycaemic levels in the treatment of diabetes. This is very challenging in clinical practice because of the risk of treatment-induced hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia can be perceived from clinical, physiological, or pathophysiological perspectives through risk factors and preventive measures. Clinical hypoglycaemia is described by the Whipple triad. A plasma glucose concentration < 3.9 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl) with (documented symptomatic) or without symptoms (asymptomatic) is regarded as the threshold for hypoglycaemic events. A severe hypoglycaemic event (SHE) is defined as one requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of normal plasma glucose levels is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. Severe hypoglycaemia is common in both types of DM, but less frequent in type 2 (T2). The number of events depends on many factors, including type, duration of diabetes, and types of treatment. The event rates for severe hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated patients as reported in the literature and expressed as episodes per 100 patient-years range from 62 to 320 in type 1 (T1) DM, and from 0 to 73 in T2 DM.

### Neuroimaging in patients with abnormal blood glucose levels [^114qhS1i]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Smooth neuronal functioning requires an uninterrupted supply of energy that is provided by glucose under normal physiologic conditions. Significant variations in plasma glucose levels, be it hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, can present with myriad clinical manifestations and may mimic stroke. At times, the diagnosis is either not apparent or not clinically suspected. Imaging can suggest the diagnosis in unsuspected cases and can help in the assessment of the extent of neuronal damage in known cases, making it vital for the neuroradiologist to be aware of both common and atypical neuroimaging findings in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

### Severe hypoglycemia and risks of vascular events and death [^111yZBb5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Severe hypoglycemia may increase the risk of a poor outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes assigned to an intensive glucose-lowering intervention. We analyzed data from a large study of intensive glucose lowering to explore the relationship between severe hypoglycemia and adverse clinical outcomes.

Methods

We examined the associations between severe hypoglycemia and the risks of macrovascular or microvascular events and death among 11,140 patients with type 2 diabetes, using Cox proportional-hazards models with adjustment for covariates measured at baseline and after randomization.

Results

During a median follow-up period of 5 years, 231 patients (2.1%) had at least one severe hypoglycemic episode; 150 had been assigned to intensive glucose control (2.7% of the 5571 patients in that group), and 81 had been assigned to standard glucose control (1.5% of the 5569 patients in that group). The median times from the onset of severe hypoglycemia to the first major macrovascular event, the first major microvascular event, and death were 1.56 years (interquartile range, 0.84 to 2.41), 0.99 years (interquartile range, 0.40 to 2.17), and 1.05 years (interquartile range, 0.34 to 2.41), respectively. During follow-up, severe hypoglycemia was associated with a significant increase in the adjusted risks of major macrovascular events (hazard ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01 to 4.12), major microvascular events (hazard ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.74), death from a cardiovascular cause (hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.72 to 4.19), and death from any cause (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.97 to 3.67) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Similar associations were apparent for a range of nonvascular outcomes, including respiratory, digestive, and skin conditions (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). No relationship was found between repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia and vascular outcomes or death.

Conclusions

Severe hypoglycemia was strongly associated with increased risks of a range of adverse clinical outcomes. It is possible that severe hypoglycemia contributes to adverse outcomes, but these analyses indicate that hypoglycemia is just as likely to be a marker of vulnerability to such events.

### Insulin for glycaemic control in acute ischaemic stroke [^112EyNDy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

People with hyperglycaemia concomitant with an acute stroke have greater mortality, stroke severity, and functional impairment when compared with those with normoglycaemia at stroke presentation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011.

Objectives

To determine whether intensively monitoring insulin therapy aimed at maintaining serum glucose within a specific normal range (4 to 7.5 mmol/L) in the first 24 hours of acute ischaemic stroke influences outcome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (September 2013), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2013), EMBASE (1980 to September 2013), CINAHL (1982 to September 2013), Science Citation Index (1900 to September 2013), and Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge) (1993 to September 2013). We also searched ongoing trials registers and SCOPUS.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intensively monitored insulin therapy versus usual care in adults with acute ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

We obtained a total of 1565 titles through the literature search. Two review authors independently selected the included articles and extracted the study characteristics, study quality, and data to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) of outcome measures. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs involving 1583 participants (791 participants in the intervention group and 792 in the control group). We found that there was no difference between the treatment and control groups in the outcomes of death or dependency (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23) or final neurological deficit (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.01). The rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was higher in the intervention group (OR 14.6, 95% CI 6.6 to 32.2). In the subgroup analyses of diabetes mellitus (DM) versus non-DM, we found no difference for the outcomes of death and disability or neurological deficit. The number needed to treat was not significant for the outcomes of death and final neurological deficit. The number needed to harm was nine for symptomatic hypoglycaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

After updating the results of our previous review, we found that the administration of intravenous insulin with the objective of maintaining serum glucose within a specific range in the first hours of acute ischaemic stroke does not provide benefit in terms of functional outcome, death, or improvement in final neurological deficit and significantly increased the number of hypoglycaemic episodes. Specifically, those people whose glucose levels were maintained within a tighter range with intravenous insulin experienced a greater risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia than those people in the control group.

### Relationship between spontaneous and iatrogenic hypoglycemia and mortality in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction… [^114TwkKT]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions While hypoglycemia was associated with increased mortality in patients with AMI, this risk was confined to patients who developed hypoglycemia spontaneously. In contrast, iatrogenic hypoglycemia after insulin therapy was not associated with higher mortality risk. Elevated glucose levels in the setting of acute myocardial infarction is a well-recognized risk factor for increased mortality, 1–27 and limited clinical trial data suggest that better glucose control may improve patient outcomes after AMI. 28 Based on these findings, professional societies currently endorse glucose control in patients with hyperglycemia hospitalized with AMI. 29–31. In the unadjusted analyses, hypoglycemia was associated with worse survival.

However, the relationship between hypoglycemia and mortality was markedly different within subgroups of patients who developed it spontaneously and those who developed it following insulin therapy. In this large, contemporary cohort of patients hospitalized with AMI, we found that while hypoglycemia was associated with increased mortality, this risk was confined to those who developed hypoglycemia spontaneously. In contrast, hypoglycemia that occurred after initiation of insulin therapy was not associated with higher mortality. These data suggest that hypoglycemia during hospitalization for AMI is a marker for more critical illness, rather than a direct cause of adverse outcomes and should provide some reassurance to clinicians in their efforts to manage glucose level after AMI. The most likely explanation for our findings is that hypoglycemia is a marker, rather than a direct mediator of higher mortality in the setting of AMI.

Certainly, patients who develop hypoglycemia spontaneously appear to have greater illness severity and comorbidity, and their hypoglycemic events are likely to be the result of severe concomitant conditions. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that while hypoglycemia is associated with increased short-term mortality in patients hospitalized with AMI, this risk is confined to patients who develop hypoglycemia spontaneously. In contrast, hypoglycemia that occurs after initiation of insulin therapy is not associated with higher mortality risk. While continuous efforts to avoid hypoglycemia are warranted, these data suggest that hypoglycemia is a marker of severe illness, rather than a direct cause of adverse outcomes.

### Randomized, controlled trial of insulin for acute poststroke hyperglycemia [^114ZJcy9]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Poststroke hyperglycemia is common and is associated with increased risk of death and dependence, but appropriate management remains uncertain. Glucose potassium insulin (GKI) infusion did not benefit patients with moderate poststroke hyperglycemia in a recent trial. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), previous studies identified a relationship between recruitment of ischemic tissue to the final infarct and hyperglycemia, possibly mediated by brain lactic acidosis.

Methods

We undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of GKI infusion in patients with blood glucose > 126mg/dl (7mmol/l) within 24 hours of ischemic stroke. The primary endpoint was infarct growth on MRI between baseline and day 7. Brain lactate concentrations were measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Results

Forty patients were randomized, 15 to saline and 25 to GKI infusions of different durations. Capillary blood glucose concentrations were lowered significantly from 6 to 12 hours after GKI initiation. There was no significant difference on any measure of infarct growth between the GKI and saline groups. In a secondary analysis, GKI was associated with significantly greater infarct growth in patients with complete intracranial vessel occlusion compared with controls (p = 0.011 for group-vessel status interaction). Brain lactate levels increased in control subjects, but were significantly lower with GKI infusion. Predominantly asymptomatic hypoglycemia occurred in 76% of GKI-treated subjects.

Interpretation

GKI infusion within 24 hours of stroke lowered blood glucose and attenuated an increase in brain lactate, but did not affect cerebral infarct growth. Exploratory analysis found that GKI infusion was associated with greater infarct growth in patients with persistent arterial occlusion, and with a high incidence of asymptomatic hypoglycemia.

### Effect of hyperglycemia on stroke outcomes [^1169YCno]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review published data about the relationship between hyperglycemia and the outcome of patients with stroke.

Results

Stroke is the most frequent cause of permanent disability in the Western world and the third leading cause of death among Americans. Each year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cerebrovascular accident. In the medical literature, numerous reports have discussed how hyperglycemia during acute stroke, regardless of a patient's prior diabetes status, has been associated with significantly higher morbidity, higher mortality, longer hospital stays, reduced long-term recovery, and diminished ability to return to work. In the United States alone, an estimated $300 million in additional health-care costs are incurred among hospitalized patients with stroke who also have high blood glucose levels. Treatment of hyperglycemia has safely, successfully, and effectively yielded glucose levels in the normal range in the hospital setting under the direction of specialty physicians and should be implemented in patients with stroke.

Conclusion

Until convincing randomized prospective trials prove that tight glycemic control does not improve stroke outcomes, the overwhelming preponderance of data suggests that aggressive glucose management should be the standard care in all patients with stroke and hyperglycemia.

### Association of clinical symptomatic hypoglycemia with cardiovascular events and total mortality in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide population-based study [^111p7qvD]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Total mortality and incidence of stroke, CHD, and cardiovascular events in hypoglycemic diabetic patients

During the follow-up period, 1,187 diabetic patients had development of stroke, 1,164 had development of CHD, 3,515 had development of cardiovascular events, and 773 died before the end of the study.

Patients with hypoglycemia had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events during the clinical treatment periods (Fig. 2). Compared with patients without hypoglycemia, those with hypoglycemia (both inpatient and outpatient claims datasets) had a higher hospitalization rate for stroke (27.97 vs. 69.05 and 71.73, respectively, per 1,000 person-years; both P < 0.0001), CHD (27.96 vs. 65.51 and 65.77, respectively, per 1,000 person-years; both P < 0.0001), CVD hospitalization (106.00 vs. 323.36 and 325.79, respectively, per 1,000 person-years; both P < 0.0001), and total mortality (14.30 vs. 41.04 and 52.28, respectively, per 1,000 person-years; all comparisons P < 0.0001). Both inpatients and outpatients with hypoglycemia had a more than two-fold higher relative risk of stroke (HR 2.55 [95% CI 2.24–2.90]), CHD events (HR 2.35 [95% CI 2.06–2.68]), CVD (3.19 [2.94–3.47]), and total mortality (3.49 [3.01–4.05]).

### Relationship between glycated hemoglobin and stroke risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UNgP4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Strokes represent a heterogeneous group of vascular pathologies that collectively act as a major global burden of mortality and lifelong morbidity. Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of stroke, particularly ischemic stroke, with type 2 diabetes mellitus alone known to increase stroke risk 1.5 to 4 fold. 1 Macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus (ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) represent a major cause of diabetes mellitus related mortality and health‐related expenditure. 2, 3

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) is a validated marker of 2 to 3 month glycemic control used within routine diabetes mellitus care. Current American Diabetes Association (ADA) diabetes mellitus management guidelines recommend a base target of HbA 1c < 7.0% within routine diabetes mellitus care of non‐pregnant adults. 4 This target is most validated for microvascular complication risk reduction and has unclear implications for optimal macrovascular risk reductions. Long‐term follow‐up studies of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated beneficial effects on long‐term macrovascular outcomes with more intensive glycemic control, thereby suggesting a metabolic memory effect for hyperglycemia. 5, 6

Up to one half of all patients presenting with acute stroke have previously unknown abnormalities of glucose tolerance, with 20% to 40% of patients presenting with hyperglycemia at hospital admission. 7 Chronic hyperglycemia has been linked with several stroke risk factors including accelerated atherosclerosis, increased carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), cardiomyocyte dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (AF), and ischemic heart disease. 8, 9, 10, 11 In non–diabetes mellitus patients with insulin resistance and recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, long‐term treatment with pioglitazone reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 12 The outcomes of this trial suggested that in the ischemic stroke subgroup, anti‐hyperglycemic medication may need to start at lower HbA 1c thresholds than currently accepted levels. 12

No systematic review and meta‐analysis has generated consensus regarding the specific relationship between rising HbA 1c level and stroke risk. 13, 14 We therefore aimed to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational studies to examine and determine a quantifiable risk relationship for the association between rising HbA 1c level and stroke risk, stratified by diabetes mellitus status, stroke temporality, and stroke subtype.

### Proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects of hypoglycemia [^111dZvGo]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

It is important to note that the rapidity of the onset of hypoglycemia is also a major determinant of the proinflammatory changes. Further studies are necessary to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoglycemia and its relationship with inflammation, platelet aggregation, and thrombotic mechanisms. In addition, we also need further information on the effects of the severity, duration, and rapidity of hypoglycemia development. Such studies are even more important and urgent because insulin is now being used in the intensive care setting in very ill patients with profound and severe inflammation in association with the activation of thrombotic mechanisms. To add to these challenges, there are also the contrasting effects of spontaneous hypoglycemia, which carries a bad prognosis, whereas that induced by insulin does not, in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Another important aspect of the pathophysiology of hypoglycemia is its effect on the brain. In addition to the obvious short- and long-term effects of neuroglycopenia, the brain is also vulnerable to systemic inflammation because cytokines from the circulation can potentially enter the brain, activate the microglia (the representatives of macrophages in the central nervous system), and activate a damaging, neurotoxic sequence of events. Whether hypoglycemia-induced catecholamine release also exerts a proinflammatory effect on microglia requires further investigation. It should be noted that repeated hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia-related deaths are associated with significant changes in the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus.

### Influence of prestroke glycemic status on outcomes by age in patients with acute ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus [^1174abDC]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for stroke in the general population and for vascular events after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In patients with ischemic stroke and diabetes, admission HbA1c levels have been linked to 1‐year vascular events and 3‐month functional outcomes. However, clinical trials have not demonstrated a benefit of intensive glucose control on early recurrent stroke or functional outcomes in these patients.

The European or American stroke guidelines suggest maintaining HbA1c below 7.0% in patients with ischemic stroke, but emphasize that targets should be individualized based on age and patient‐specific factors. However, age‐specific HbA1c targets for stroke patients are not well‐defined, and research in this area remains limited. Guidelines for diabetes management generally recommend an HbA1c target of 7%–8%, or even 8%–9% for elderly individuals with limited life expectancy or significant comorbidities, to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Notably, the risk of vascular events associated with diabetes is higher in younger adults than in older adults. Previous studies have often categorized age groups simply as < 65 years versus ≥ 65 years, lacking detailed granularity. Given that ischemic stroke and TIA patients are typically older and have preexisting vascular conditions, the impact of prestroke glycemic control on stroke prognosis may vary by age.

This study aims to explore the association between admission HbA1c levels and the risk of subsequent vascular events, stratified by age, in patients with ischemic stroke and diabetes. By classifying patients into more specific age and HbA1c groups, we seek to identify potential variations in outcomes across different age groups.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114iDSiA]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Diabetes and stroke prevention — intensive glycemic control evidence: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have not demonstrated that intensive glycemic control (targeting hemoglobin A1c ≤ 6.5%) reduces stroke risk more than looser glycemic control (targeting hemoglobin A1c of 7%–8%) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A review of intensive versus conventional glycemic targets in type 1 diabetes, including 12 trials and 2230 patients, found low-quality evidence for stroke with small numbers of the outcome, and the authors concluded that the evidence of the effect of intensive glycemic control on stroke was insufficient. Furthermore, tight glycemic control increases treatment burden, costs, and side-effect risks and might cause patient harm (eg, severe hypoglycemia). In summary, for individuals with diabetes, both the potential benefit of more intensive control (eg, to hemoglobin A1c ≤ 6.5%) for prevention of microvascular disease and the potential risk of hypoglycemia should be considered in decision-making.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) blood glucose management states that evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia and thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with AIS. Additionally, hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS.

### Diabetes and the treatment of ischemic stroke [^115h1tS2]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

This white paper examines the current challenges for treating ischemic stroke in diabetic patients. The need for a greater understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the relationship between diabetes and the cerebral vascular responses to ischemia is discussed. The critical need to improve the efficacy and safety of thrombolysis is addressed, as is the need for a better characterization the off-target actions of tPA, the only currently approved thrombolytic for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Statistical methods

The different groups were compared using the unpaired Student t test for parametric continuous data and the χ 2 test for categorical data. We investigated the relationship between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events. Survival time was calculated from the date of hypoglycemia diagnosis for each data pair to the onset date of the event (stroke, CHD, CVD, or any cause for hospitalization), death, or end of study (31 December 2009). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves, and the log-rank test was used to test the homogeneity between survival curves. Hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the Cox proportional hazard model were used to evaluate the association between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events. We also performed a propensity score analysis to evaluate the association between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events, hospitalization, and total mortality. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).

### Relationship of glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic episodes to 4-year cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes starting insulin [^114dQmjn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The CV events were then confirmed by decision of the Adjudication Committee (agreement of three reviewers or, if not, consensus at a formal meeting, using definitions enshrined in the Adjudication Committee charter). Deaths were adjudicated as 'CV', 'non‐CV' and 'cannot classify', and all other events classified as 'event', 'no event' or 'cannot classify'. Adjudicated CV death and CV events were used to derive composite outcomes [major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and MACE+].

The primary aim was to examine the relationship between HbA1c and CV events. The principal CV event composite (MACE) was defined as time to the first experience of non‐fatal MI, non‐fatal stroke or CV death. The secondary CV event (MACE+) included severe unstable angina leading to hospitalization, heart failure leading to hospitalization, myocardial revascularization, peripheral revascularization, and lower limb amputation. We also describe the components of the principal outcome separately 15. Analysis using all‐cause mortality rather than CV death was added at editorial request post hoc.

The relationship between reports of severe or symptomatic hypoglycaemic events and subsequent CV deaths and all‐cause mortality was investigated as a secondary aim as part of the statistical analysis plan. Symptomatic hypoglycaemia was predefined in the study protocol as any event with clinical symptoms resulting in hypoglycaemia, confirmed by plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/l. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an event that required the assistance of another person and confirmed by plasma glucose < 2.0 mmol/l or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or intramuscular glucagon. Events for the 6 months before each visit were ascertained by patient recall.

### Hypoglycaemia, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in diabetes: epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management [^117Q4crD]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Hypoglycaemia has long been recognised as a dangerous side-effect of treatment of diabetes with insulin or insulin secretagogues. With its potential to disrupt cerebral function, hypoglycaemia can have a major effect on peoples' lives. Study findings have suggested that hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Different mechanisms by which hypoglycaemia might provoke cardiovascular events have been identified in experimental studies, and in clinical studies cardiac arrhythmias have been reported to be induced by hypoglycaemia, with one report describing sudden death during a severe episode. Emerging evidence suggests that the association between hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular events and mortality is likely to be multifactorial. The association is probably partly caused by confounding, with hypoglycaemia occurring more frequently in people with comorbidities who are also more likely to die than those without. However, people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes also seem at risk of hypoglycaemia-induced cardiovascular effects. This risk should be recognised by clinicians when agreeing glycaemic goals with patients and choosing appropriate glucose-lowering therapies.

### Hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke: pathophysiology and clinical management [^115kBmqE]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute ischemic stroke frequently test positive for hyperglycemia, which is associated with a poor clinical outcome. This association between poor glycemic control and an unfavorable prognosis is particularly evident in patients with persistent hyperglycemia, patients without a known history of diabetes mellitus, and patients with cortical infarction. To date, however, only one large clinical trial has specifically investigated the effect of glycemic control on stroke outcome. This trial failed to show a clinical benefit, but had several limitations. Despite a lack of clinical evidence supporting the use of glycemic control in the treatment of patients with stroke, international guidelines recommend treating this subset of critically ill patients for hyperglycemia in the hospital setting. This treatment regime is, however, particularly challenging in patients with stroke, and is associated with an increased risk of the patient developing hypoglycemia. Here we review the available evidence linking hyperglycemia to a poor clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke. We highlight the pathophysiological mechanisms that might underlie the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia on acute stroke prognosis and systematically review the literature concerning tight glycemic control after stroke. Finally, we provide directions on the use of insulin treatment strategies to control hyperglycemia in this patient group.

### Relationship between glycated hemoglobin and stroke risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117D2qhd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our study suggests that both continuous and categorical elevations in HbA 1c are associated with increased first‐ever ischemic stroke risk, irrespective of diabetes mellitus status. Prevention of macrovascular complications like stroke may need to start at lower HbA 1c thresholds. Further interventional studies are needed to explore the effectiveness of more intensive glycemic management within primary and secondary stroke prevention, in pre–diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus cohorts.

### Stroke mimics and chameleons [^1148Pm82]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute stroke remains a clinical diagnosis in the initial phases of patient evaluation. There is a differential diagnostic process to the abrupt onset of focal neurologic deficit that characterizes an acute stroke. "Is this a CNS event?" might be the initial question posed by the clinician. The stroke mimics of systemic problems such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and other encephalopathies are considered. Certainly consideration of hypoglycemia, which is common, easily detectable, and correctable, should occur in every stroke patient encounter. Any witnesses that suggest a convulsive episode should raise suspicion of the presence of an ictal or postictal phenomena. Next, if a CNS event is believed to exist, the different stroke subtypes are considered along with other CNS events that may simulate stroke. The standard acute neuroimaging with noncontrast CT scanning uncovers some mass lesions mimicking stroke and confirm a stroke subtype in other patients. Ischemic stroke, like other common diseases, does have uncommon manifestations. Acute stroke is considered in neurologic syndromes in which abrupt onset of symptoms figure prominently, particularly in patients with cerebrovascular risk factors.

Figure 2
Association between hypoglycemia and hospitalization. A: Survival curves for patients with hypoglycemia and hospitalization. B: The hospitalization rate (n = 1,348) during the follow-up period was 53.1% (n = 714/1,344) for mild hypoglycemia and 63.4% (n = 317/500) for severe hypoglycemia, and occurred during the first year.

Table 2 shows the independent risk factors for stroke events, CHD events, cardiovascular events, and total mortality. In the multivariate Cox regression model, both mild and severe hypoglycemia events showed increased HRs for stroke, CHD, and all cardiovascular events after adjusting for other important comorbidities.

Table 2

Furthermore, we also estimated the association between hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events, hospitalization, and total mortality for patients with insulin treatment (n = 1,068) and sulfonylurea treatment (n = 4,817). The HRs for mild and severe hypoglycemia were as follows: 2.57 (95% CI 0.73–9.09) and 1.44 (0.40–5.17), respectively, for stroke; 2.06 (0.76–5.57) and 2.10 (0.45–9.77), respectively, for CHD; 2.21 (1.39–3.53) and 1.48 (0.69–3.19), respectively, for CVD; and 1.94 (0.79–4.76) and 2.67 (0.68–10.45), respectively, for total mortality for patients with insulin treatment. Hypoglycemia was significantly and positively correlated with cardiovascular events and mortality for patients receiving sulfonylurea treatment. The HRs for mild and severe hypoglycemia were as follows: 1.82 (1.41–2.34) and 1.32 (0.96–1.82), respectively, for stroke; 1.88 (1.47–2.42) and 1.35 (0.99–1.85), respectively, for CHD; 2.32 (1.98–2.70) and 1.96 (1.59–2.43), respectively, for CVD; and 2.97 (2.22–3.97) and 2.24 (1.53–3.27), respectively, for total mortality. As shown in Table 2, the results were similar for patients who had good medication compliance, as defined by proportion of days covered.

### Influence of prestroke glycemic status on outcomes by age in patients with acute ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus [^114tjhCD]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the overall population, our study revealed a notable trend: as admission HbA1c values decreased, 1‐year event rates of mortality increased, while 1‐year event rates of stroke increased. Consequently, there was less pronounced difference in the 1‐year composite vascular event rates according to the HbA1c at admission. Previous studies have suggested that in elderly individuals, the risk of mortality might be greater due to the potential dangers of hypoglycemia associated with intensive glucose lowering. In our study, across all age groups, mortality rates were numerically greater for the ≤ 6.0% HbA1c subgroup than for the > 8.0% HbA1c subgroup. Lower HbA1c values in older patients may indicate a potentially frailer condition, such as poor nutritional status, sarcopenia, or chronic diseases. It is possible that in elderly individuals, a lower HbA1c value may be associated with an increased risk of episodes of hypoglycemia, and several clinical and preclinical studies have indicated that exposure to hypoglycemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Many experts currently argue that the benefits of intensive control of macrovascular disease are likely limited to younger patients with recent‐onset diabetes and without established vascular disease. These considerations underscore the importance of individualizing glycemic control strategies, accounting for both age and overall health status, to optimize patient outcomes. However, unfortunately, our study did not implement glucose‐lowering therapy, which prevents us from confirming whether lower HbA1c is associated with hypoglycemia. Additionally, data on the incidence of severe hypoglycemia were not available for the study population, and we could not explore the relationship between hypoglycemia and stroke risk for each HbA1c category.

### Hypoglycemic events may trigger acute ischemic stroke within 30 days in those with diabetes: a case-crossover study [^116CBFUi]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke triggers are factors that may precipitate a stroke within a given time interval and can predict the timing of a stroke. While hypoglycemia has been established as a risk factor for cardiovascular events such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS), there is limited research demonstrating hypoglycemic events as stroke triggers. We hypothesize an association between hypoglycemic events and the occurrence of stroke among patients with diabetes.

Methods

We used Medicare inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, and subacute nursing facility data sets from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019, and validated using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes to identify conditions. We used a case-crossover study design, testing whether exposure to a hypoglycemia encounter within progressively longer case periods (up to 30 days before index AIS) was associated with the subsequent occurrence of AIS, compared with control periods of equal length exactly 1 year before the case period. We used conditional logistical regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs.

Results

There were 237667 index admissions with AIS and diabetes during the study period. There were increased odds of AIS following an encounter with hypoglycemia. The risk was the highest immediately on the first day following the hypoglycemia encounter (odds ratio, 3.694 [95% CI, 2.694–5.065]; P < 0.0001) and gradually became lower as the case-control period lengthened. At a 30-day case-control interval, the risk was lowest but still significant (odds ratio, 2.345 [95% CI, 2.179–2.523]; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

We found that hypoglycemic events in patients with diabetes are associated with a more than 3-fold greater risk of AIS in the first day but can trigger AIS in the 30 days following the event. More research is needed to assess the link between the severity of hypoglycemia and stroke occurrence, as well as the severity of the stroke. These results, if confirmed in other studies, emphasize the importance of avoiding hypoglycemic events in patients with diabetes.

### The association between symptomatic, severe hypoglycaemia and mortality in type 2 diabetes: retrospective epidemiological analysis of the ACCORD study [^1145PRqw]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome for the ACCORD trial is the first episode of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. All events were centrally adjudicated by at least two members of the ACCORD study morbidity and mortality subcommittee, who were masked to the participants' randomisation status and their most recent haemoglobin A 1C measurement.

The primary outcome in this analysis was all cause and cause specific mortality. All deaths were reviewed twice. The case was initially reviewed to classify the primary cause of death into one of the following groups: cardiovascular death (including unexpected and presumed cardiovascular death), fatal myocardial infarction, fatal congestive heart failure, or other cardiovascular cause; cancer; non-cardiovascular, non-cancer; or unable to classify. Subsequent review by at least two clinicians with expertise in diabetes care determined whether hypoglycaemia was a proximate contributor to the death. The classification scheme for involvement of hypoglycaemia in the death had four categorical levels: unlikely; possible; probable; and definite. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved either by a third reviewer (for possible disagreements) or by the full adjudication committee (for any case involving at least one vote of "probable" or "definite"). To determine whether hypoglycaemia was involved in a death, adjudicators were provided a list of glucose lowering medications the participant was prescribed, details of any previously reported episodes of severe hypoglycaemia and the number of days these episodes occurred before the death, and information on the number of times a week the participant reported checking blood glucose levels with their finger stick device. This information was provided for all visits occurring within one year before the death.

Intensive glycemic control and targets — evidence and thresholds indicate that intensive control of blood sugar for patients with both type 1 diabetes and T2D reduces microvascular complications, with DCCT enrolling patients between 13 and 39 years of age and showing after a mean of 6.5 years delayed onset or progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, although intensive control was associated with increased risk for hypoglycemia. For most adults, the American Diabetes Association recommends a target HbA1c < 7%, while it advocates less stringent goals (eg, 7%–8%) in patients with limited life expectancy, history of hypoglycemia, long-standing disease, or advanced macrovascular or microvascular disease when the risk and inconvenience of intensive control outweigh the potential benefit.

IV alteplase pretreatment deliberation and timing — The potential risks should be discussed during thrombolysis eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision making. It is reasonable that urgent IV alteplase treatment not be delayed while waiting for hematologic or coagulation testing if there is no reason to suspect an abnormal test. Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation. IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions. Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement.

### Severe hypoglycemia and the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^113WowzV]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our analysis independently suggested the risk of SH for cerebrovascular outcome. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study showed a higher risk of CVD along with an increasing number of SH events for the outcomes of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality, not in the outcome of stroke. They explained the negative results of stroke and heart failure by the possibility of a small number of SH events or competing risks for mortality. Hypoglycemia also has a significant effect on the cerebral vascular system affecting systemic cardiovascular system by promoting inflammation, hypocoagulability, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Changing blood flow during hypoglycemia enhances the supply of glucose to the most vulnerable part of the brain which becomes permanent and persist during normoglycemia. This permanent change can increase the risk of cerebral ischemia that leads to an increased risk of a cerebrovascular event. In our study, the risk of stroke was significantly higher in the group with SH than the group without SH. The risk of stroke increased with the number of SH events and shorter follow-up periods after study initiation.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to management of glucose levels, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider treating hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels of 140–180 mg/dL and obtaining close monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with AIS since persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes.

### Suspecting unwitnessed hypoglycaemia [^115ThR5s]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycaemic coma can present with acute neurological dysfunction mimicking stroke. It may be masked by normoglycaemia due to physiological compensatory mechanisms (Somogyi phenomenon). Specific MR brain scan changes should alert the clinician to consider this alternative to stroke in the acute setting in patients with a history of recurrent hypoglycaemia, even when the blood glucose is not low at presentation. Rapid identification and treatment of hypoglycaemia may confer a good prognosis with radiological resolution.

### The association between TyG index and cardiovascular mortality is modified by antidiabetic or lipid-lowering agent: a prospective cohort study [^115HadCJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Underlying mechanism

Antidiabetic agents may influence the relationship between the TyG index and mortality through several mechanisms. Insulin reduces blood glucose levels and affects lipid metabolism by suppressing lipolysis and promoting lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue. This may lead to lower triglyceride levels and, consequently, influence the TyG index.

Hypolipidemic agents, particularly statins and other lipid-lowering drugs, directly reduce triglyceride levels, which are a key component of the TyG index. Some hypolipidemic agents, such as glitazones, improve insulin sensitivity, potentially modifying the association between the TyG index and mortality.

The observed U-shaped — or more precisely V-shaped — relationship can be partially explained. The decrease in mortality with increasing TyG index on the left side of the curve, particularly in individuals using these agents, may be related to risks associated with hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has been shown to increase counter-regulatory hormones like adrenaline, which can elevate the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including stroke. Additionally, a prospective cohort study identified low triglyceride levels as a risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in women. Low triglyceride levels have also been recognized as predictors of cardiac death in patients. From the TyG index formula, a low TyG index may result from either low triglyceride or low glucose levels. The association between a low TyG index and increased mortality risk may be partially explained by low fasting glucose. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that low fasting plasma glucose (< 4.0 mmol/L) is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, and both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in individuals without pre-existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Other studies have also demonstrated that the relationship between the TyG index and both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality is significantly non-linear across various populations. Specifically, a baseline TyG index below threshold values (< 9.05 for all-cause mortality and < 8.84 for CVD mortality) was negatively associated with mortality, whereas a baseline TyG index above these thresholds showed a positive association with mortality.

These findings are consistent with the present study, emphasizing the importance of maintaining an optimal TyG index to reduce health risks. Both extreme too high or too low — may have harmful effects on health.

While these mechanisms provide potential explanations, future studies should explore the interaction between the TyG index, specific medications, and mortality in populations with balanced treatment histories and comorbidities to better clarify this complex relationship.

### Diabetes, hyperglycaemia, and acute ischaemic stroke [^111zFHoR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and ischaemic stroke often arise together. People with diabetes have more than double the risk of ischaemic stroke after correction for other risk factors, relative to individuals without diabetes. Multifactorial treatment of risk factors for stroke-in particular, lifestyle factors, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia-will prevent a substantial number of these disabling strokes. Hyperglycaemia occurs in 30–40% of patients with acute ischaemic stroke, also in individuals without a known history of diabetes. Admission hyperglycaemia is associated with poor functional outcome, possibly through aggravation of ischaemic damage by disturbing recanalisation and increasing reperfusion injury. Uncertainty surrounds the question of whether glucose-lowering treatment for early stroke can improve clinical outcome. Achievement of normoglycaemia in the early stage of stroke can be difficult, and the possibility of hypoglycaemia remains a concern. Phase 3 studies of glucose-lowering therapy in acute ischaemic stroke are underway.

CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA, STROKE, AND DEMENTIA

Severe hypoglycemia has been known to induce focal neurological deficits and transient ischemic attacks, which are reversible with the correction of blood glucose. However, the question whether hypoglycemia increases the risk for stroke or dementia remains controversial. Recent evidence suggests that recurrent or severe hypoglycemia may predispose to long-term cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Whitmer et al. conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 16,667 patients with type 2 diabetes looking at the relationship between hypoglycemia and dementia. The study found that the attributable risk of dementia between individuals with and without a history of hypoglycemia was 2.4% per year. Patients with multiple episodes of hypoglycemia had a graded increase in dementia risk. Conversely, severe cognitive dysfunction has been associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia. In the ADVANCE trial (type 2 diabetes), severe cognitive dysfunction increased the risk of severe hypoglycemia (hazard ratio 2.1) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Fremantle diabetes study (type 2 diabetes) found that dementia was a risk factor for hypoglycemia. However, hypoglycemia itself was not found to increase the risk of getting dementia. In type 1 diabetes, some small studies show alterations in regional cerebral blood flow in patients with severe hypoglycemia; however, these are temporary and reversible.

In the DCCT, despite frequent hypoglycemia, intensively treated patients with type 1 diabetes did not experience cognitive decline. Some small studies show alterations in regional cerebral blood flow in patients with type 1 diabetes with severe hypoglycemia; however, these are temporary and reversible. It is unclear whether this finding can be extrapolated to type 2 diabetes. Thus, the role of hypoglycemia in increasing the risk for dementia is still controversial.

### Hypoglycemia and cardiovascular risks [^114dDmrD]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although hypoglycemia is the most common side effect of insulin therapy in diabetes and its morbidity is well known, for many years, the potentially life-threatening effects of hypoglycemia on the cardiovascular (CV) system have either been overlooked or have been dismissed as inconsequential to people with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. This scenario may possibly be a consequence of the persisting misconception that this population is seldom exposed to severe hypoglycemia, defined as any episode that requires external assistance for recovery, whereas self-treated events are classified as "mild". This myth was firmly repudiated by the findings of the large prospective study by the U.K. Hypoglycemia Study Group, which demonstrated that severe hypoglycemia is a common problem in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and that the incidence increases with duration of insulin therapy. However, evidence for CV morbidity associated with hypoglycemia has been predominantly hypothetical and anecdotal. The potential dangers of intensive treatment regimens and strict glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes who have CV disease (CVD) have now been highlighted by the disconcerting outcomes of recent studies, in which hypoglycemia was implicated in the excess mortality that was observed in some of these trials. It is therefore timely to review the effects of hypoglycemia on the CV system, how this major metabolic stress could precipitate major vascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and its potential role in these recent clinical studies.

Management of abnormal glucose metabolism

Recommendations

The prognosis of persistent hyperglycaemia in patients with AIS within 24 hours after onset is worse than that of normal blood glucose. So, it is reasonable to control blood glucose to the range between 140~180 mg/dL. At the same time, blood sugar should be closely monitored to prevent hypoglycaemia (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Treatment should be given to patients with AIS with hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) (class I, level of evidence C).
It is recommended that patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA with diabetes should be evaluated and given the best management guideline (class I, level of evidence A).
For all inpatients/outpatients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, rapid blood glucose, 2 hours postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin or 75 g oral glucose tolerance test are recommended for screening of diabetes mellitus (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Lifestyle and/or drug intervention in patients with diabetes or prediabetes can reduce ischaemic stroke or TIA events. The recommended treatment target for glycosylated haemoglobin is ≤ 7% (class I, level of evidence B).
The hypoglycaemic regimen should consider the clinical characteristics of patients and the safety of drugs. To set up individual blood glucose control targets, one should be on guard against the harm caused by hypoglycemia (class IIa, level of evidence B).

### Relationship of glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic episodes to 4-year cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes starting insulin [^116wr5WK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

We conducted supportive analyses comparing the updated mean HbA1c by year (the principal analyses) with models including the HbA1c for that year alone in nested statistical models. In addition to this, we examined the relationship between HbA1c by year and non‐fatal MI, non‐fatal stroke and CV‐specific death, the individual components of the principal outcome.

In an exploratory analysis, we examined the relationship between reported symptomatic or severe hypoglycaemia with CV‐specific death and with all‐cause death. Terms identifying the reporting or otherwise of these events at any time during follow‐up (at the yearly visits) were included in models, along with the same explanatory variables as in the MACE model.

### Impact of glycemic treatment and blood glucose monitoring on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke without prior diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study [^113wkAVG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Glycemic management practices vary widely, often adopting a conservative approach due to the risks of iatrogenic hypoglycemia, ambiguous benefits, and potential overuse of healthcare resources, which vary by the robustness of each country's healthcare system. Frequently, hyperglycemia remains unmanaged, and its control in AIS continues to be debated. Despite these controversies, there is a scarcity of large-scale longitudinal studies investigating the comprehensive effects of glycemic management, including both glycemic treatment and BGM, on AIS outcomes. This study leverages the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to examine both the short- and long-term prognostic impacts of managing glycemia during the acute hospitalization phase on stroke recurrence and mortality among patients experiencing their first-ever ischemic stroke (FIS) with hyperglycemia (FISHG), who had not been previously diagnosed with DM.

This study aims to explore the relationship between GV and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with cerebral infarction. By investigating the associations between GV and poor outcomes at discharge, 90-day and 1-year mortality, and ICU/hospital length of stay (LOS), we seek to elucidate the potential role of GV as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target. This research holds the promise of advancing our understanding of the metabolic derangements in critically ill cerebral infarction patients and informing strategies to optimize their management.

### Severe hypoglycemia and the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^115haTPK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated the association regarding severe hypoglycemia episodes with cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Baseline and follow-up data (n = 1,568,097) from patients with type 2 diabetes were retrieved from the National Health Insurance System database (covering the entire Korean population). Type 2 diabetes, severe hypoglycemia, and major comorbidities were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes and medication information. Individuals who were classified as type 2 diabetes in the year of 2009 were screened, and we counted severe hypoglycemia episodes from 2007 to 2009. The primary outcome was newly developed myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality. Participants were followed from the baseline index date to the date of death or until December 31, 2015.

Results

In total, 19,660 (1.2%) patients developed at least one severe hypoglycemia event during the period from 2007 to 2009. Mean follow-up was 5.7 years. After adjustment for confounding factors, the hazard ratio (HR) of MI significantly and sequentially increased: 0 vs. 1 episode, HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.46–1.64; 0 vs. 2 episodes, HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.61–2.15; 0 vs. 3 or more episodes, HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48–2.35, P for trend < 0.001. Similar findings were noted regarding the relationship of severe hypoglycemia episodes with stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Risks for all outcomes were highest within 1 year from the index date and showed decreasing trends with follow-up. Sensitivity analyses of the data from the subgroup population and 797,544 subjects who received a national health examination did not change the significance of the main findings.

Conclusion

Among adult Korean patients with type 2 diabetes, a severe hypoglycemia episode is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. Significant results from dose–response, temporal, and sensitivity analyses may suggest the possibility of direct causality between severe hypoglycemia and cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112HYwFH]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — intensive glucose control and macrovascular outcomes indicates less evidence for a benefit of intensive glucose control on stroke; initial major trials did not show macrovascular benefit, although long-term follow-up of the DCCT and the UKPDS showed benefit, and meta-analyses reported benefits for some cardiovascular outcomes but not for stroke; no trials or meta-analyses have assessed patients with a history of stroke; experts view any macrovascular benefit as likely limited to younger patients with recent-onset diabetes and no established vascular disease, and some professional organizations recommended targeting an HbA1c of 7% to 8% or even 8% to 9% in elderly individuals with limited life expectancy or significant comorbid illness to reduce hypoglycemia risk.

### Association between stress hyperglycemia and pneumonia in patients with stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112GKxVR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The GRADE framework was applied to systematically evaluate the reliability of the meta-analysis results and identify factors that might influence the certainty of evidence. The GRADE assessment rated the evidence as low quality, primarily due to the observational nature of the included studies, the presence of residual confounding, and the moderate heterogeneity observed across studies (I² = 54%). These limitations preclude causal inference and necessitate cautious interpretation of the observed association between SH and pneumonia risk. Although our findings suggest a potentially important clinical relationship, the low certainty of the evidence means these results should be viewed as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than conclusive. It is essential that future studies, preferably with prospective and standardized designs, validate these findings using more rigorous methods and adjusted analyses.

From a clinical perspective, these findings raise awareness of the potential increased risk of post-stroke pneumonia associated with acute-phase stress hyperglycemia. However, they do not support immediate changes in clinical practice, particularly regarding intensive glucose control. Numerous clinical trials have shown that strict glycemic control has not consistently improved outcomes in stroke patients, and may in fact increase the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia, which itself is associated with worse neurological outcomes and increased mortality. Therefore, until higher-quality evidence becomes available, clinicians should avoid overly aggressive glucose-lowering strategies in the acute stroke setting, and instead consider individualized glycemic management that balances potential infection risk against the dangers of hypoglycemia. Future research should explore targeted thresholds or trajectories of glucose elevation that are predictive of infection risk without compromising patient safety.

### Hypoglycemia and cardiovascular risk: is there a major link? [^114KGWcb]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Severe hypoglycemia is recognized to be one of the strongest predictors of macrovascular events, adverse clinical outcomes, and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, it is uncertain whether a direct pathophysiological link exists or whether hypoglycemia is primarily a marker of vulnerability to these events. Large clinical trials have reported an increased hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe hypoglycemia, but such an association has not been demonstrated in prospective trials of people with type 1 diabetes. Several cardiovascular effects occur during hypoglycemia either as a result of low blood glucose levels per se or through activation of the sympathoadrenal response: hemodynamic changes with an increase in cardiac work load and potential attenuation of myocardial perfusion, electrophysiological changes that may be arrhythmogenic, induction of a prothrombotic state, and release of inflammatory markers. Although the potential for a causal relationship has been demonstrated in mechanistic studies, the evidence from large prospective studies that hypoglycemia is a major causal contributor to cardiovascular events is limited to date. Other preexisting cardiovascular risk factors in addition to hypoglycemia may be the major link to the final cardiovascular event, but a low blood glucose level can trigger these events in patients with a high cardiovascular risk.

### Relationship between glycated hemoglobin and stroke risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168KxR4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The DCCT/EDIC (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study) demonstrated a statistically significant risk reduction in macrovascular complication risk in participants managed initially with intensive glycemic control measures following 17 years of follow‐up of a type 1 diabetes mellitus population. 5, 55 Similarly, the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) follow‐up study 6 demonstrated that intensive glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus led to fewer macrovascular complications after prolonged follow‐up, suggesting a metabolic memory effect for earlier intensive control.

Despite this, several randomized controlled trials including VADT (Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial), 56 ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation) 57 and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) 58 have refuted the presence of a statistically significant macrovascular complication risk reduction offered by intensified glycemic control, in the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus management. Common limitations within these randomized controlled trials that may explain the incongruence of their results with DCCT/EDIC and UKPDS include; the comparatively short follow‐up intervals used, competing risk confounding associated with the older age of participants used, the inclusion of participants with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and, importantly, the inclusion of participants with preexisting cardiovascular disease (may be at heightened risk of hypoglycemia with insulin and sulfonylurea therapy). Newer agents reduce cardiovascular outcomes without major changes in HbA 1c or improved glycemic control, but these may act through other pathways and do not deter from the finding that pre–diabetes mellitus, as determined by HbA 1c level, appears associated with incident ischemic stroke. 59 This is evident within 2 recent glucagon‐like peptide‐1 trials that demonstrated significant reductions in a combined cardiovascular outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke through their use in type 2 diabetes mellitus populations with high cardiovascular disease risk. 60, 61

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood glucose management specifies that hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS, and evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia; thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia.

### Effects of admission hyperglycemia on mortality and costs in acute ischemic stroke [^117PoUjQ]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia at the time of acute ischemic stroke has been linked to worse outcome in both human and animal studies.

Objective

To describe the prevalence and severity of hyperglycemia on hospital admission among acute ischemic stroke patients, to examine the independent relationship of admission hyperglycemia to all-cause mortality, and to document the inpatient management of hyperglycemia.

Methods

Patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke at one hospital from July 1993 to June 1998 (n = 656) were identified. Demographic data, diagnoses, and blood glucose (BG) values were retrieved from the electronic medical record system. Admission stroke severity, fingerstick BG results, and new diabetes diagnoses were obtained by chart review. Hyperglycemia was defined as admitting random serum BG ≥ 130 mg/dL. Hazard ratios (HR) for 30-day, 1-year, and 6-year mortality were calculated using multivariable Cox regression models.

Results

Hyperglycemia at admission to hospital was present in 40% of patients with acute stroke. Patients with hyperglycemia were more often women and more likely to have prior diagnoses of diabetes and heart failure. Almost all of these patients remained hyperglycemic during their hospital stay (mean BG = 206 mg/dL), and 43% received no inpatient hypoglycemic drugs. Hyperglycemic patients had longer hospital stay (7 vs 6 days, p = 0.015) and higher inpatient hospital charges ($6,611 vs $5,262, p < 0.001). Hyperglycemia independently increased the risk for death at 30 days (HR 1.87, p ≤ 0.01), 1 year (HR 1.75, p ≤ 0.01), and 6 years after stroke (HR 1.41, p ≤ 0.01).

Conclusions

Admitting hyperglycemia was common among patients with acute ischemic stroke and was associated with increased short- and long-term mortality and with increased inpatient charges. Inpatient blood glucose management was suboptimal in this hospital. A trial of intensive treatment of hyperglycemia should be considered.

### Glycemic control and hypoglycemia: is the loser the winner? [^114xJyjg]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Antidote to hypoglycemia

Recent animal studies have shown that treatment for brain damage incurred during severe hypoglycemic episodes is possible. The same excitotoxic mechanism that destroys neurons following a stroke is thought to destroy neurons during hypoglycemia. N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-receptor antagonists, currently used to treat stroke patients, are being assessed for efficacy in treating severe hypoglycemia. These studies have shown that these drugs reduced hypoglycemia-induced striatal and neocortical damage, as well as hippocampal seizures.
