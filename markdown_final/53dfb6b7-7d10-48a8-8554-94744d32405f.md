## Question

What is the EMAs role in the approval process of oncology drugs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the EMA's role in the approval process of oncology drugs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the EMA's mandate and the centralized procedure. Then, I should verify the scientific evaluation process and committee structure. Next, I will examine expedited pathways and their evidentiary trade-offs. After that, I need to assess post-marketing obligations and enforcement. I will then compare EMA with FDA on timing, endpoints, and withdrawals. Finally, I should integrate quality-of-life and real-world evidence considerations and synthesize the key tensions and policy implications, making sure each claim is supported by data and citations.

> Let me first confirm the EMA's core mandate and the centralized procedure. The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines for the EU, and oncology drugs are approved via the centralized procedure, which yields a single marketing authorization valid across all EU/EEA member states; this has been the case since 2005 and is mandatory for cancer therapies, ensuring harmonized regulatory standards across the region [^116eosNx] [^1154Jjv2].

> I need to check the scientific evaluation process and governance. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) conducts the scientific review, issuing a positive or negative opinion that the European Commission then adopts into a binding EU-wide authorization; oncology applications are commonly routed through expedited programs such as accelerated assessment and PRIME, which provide early dialogue and support for promising therapies in areas of high unmet need [^1126bs97] [^11444XjZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about expedited pathways; I should verify their evidentiary requirements and trade-offs. Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) is granted when the benefit-risk is positive, the medicine addresses an unmet medical need, comprehensive data are not yet available, and the sponsor commits to timely confirmatory studies; CMAs are renewed annually and are particularly prevalent in oncology, reflecting acceptance of greater uncertainty at approval in exchange for earlier patient access [^1154Jjv2] [^112DJGFp].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence at approval and the reliance on surrogates. Many oncology approvals are based on limited evidence: single-arm studies, nonrandomized designs, and surrogate endpoints such as response rate or progression-free survival are common, and overall survival or quality-of-life benefits are often not established at the time of marketing authorization; this pattern is especially pronounced for drugs approved via CMA or exceptional circumstances, increasing the importance of post-authorization confirmatory data [^112qvDJ6] [^112M3CTx].

> I should confirm the scope and enforcement of post-marketing requirements. The EMA frequently imposes post-marketing studies to address residual uncertainties, with about four-fifths of newly approved cancer drugs receiving such requirements; however, more than one-third remain ongoing or delayed after five years, and completion status often does not influence conversion to permanent authorization, highlighting enforcement gaps and the risk of persistent uncertainty in clinical practice [^111bcFHM] [^112Ff3Y1].

> Let me consider comparative timing and regulatory posture versus the FDA. From 2010–2019, the FDA approved 95% of new oncology therapies before the EMA, with a median European delay of roughly eight months; FDA review times were about half of EMA's, and more FDA approvals occurred before peer-reviewed publication of pivotal trials, contributing to greater early uncertainty for clinicians and patients [^117NkrhP] [^114mCaUQ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the EMA might consistently require stronger evidence than the FDA, but I should double-check that assumption. While the EMA often receives more mature datasets due to later submission, both agencies frequently accept surrogate endpoints and nonrandomized evidence, and concordance between FDA and EMA decisions is high overall; differences in indications often reflect divergent interpretations of the same data or differing data packages rather than a systematic stricter stance by one agency [^113aSYtR] [^112q2M9p].

> I will now examine withdrawals and label changes to stress-test the expedited systems. Several accelerated or conditional oncology approvals have been withdrawn in the US for lack of confirmatory benefit, and a meaningful fraction of these withdrawn indications remain authorized in the EU, underscoring discrepant evidentiary thresholds and follow-through on post-marketing commitments; this pattern reinforces the need for robust confirmatory trials and timely enforcement [^116GFsX6] [^112YejUz].

> Next, I should review quality-of-life and patient-reported outcomes, since these are central to value in oncology. Despite EMA's acknowledgment that overall survival is the most persuasive endpoint, many approvals proceed without demonstrated survival or QOL gains; published QOL evidence is available for a subset of indications, but only a small proportion demonstrate clinically meaningful QOL improvements, and PROMs are not comprehensively assessed in a substantial minority of marketing authorizations, limiting patient-centered decision-making [^112M3CTx] [^114DoqXG] [^113NtmPD].

> Let me verify the role of real-world evidence and evolving regulatory science. RWE is increasingly used to complement randomized trials, both pre- and post-authorization, particularly for orphan and conditionally approved oncology medicines; however, RWE cannot fully substitute for randomized, controlled confirmatory studies when substantial uncertainty remains about clinical benefit, reinforcing the need for well-designed post-authorization evidence generation plans [^11167PhS] [^114JVUVx] [^112p3eLj].

> I should confirm the interface with HTA and access, because regulatory approval does not guarantee reimbursement. Conditional approvals often face challenges in HTA assessments due to limited evidence, leading to negative or non-quantifiable added benefit ratings; despite this, most oncology drugs recover R&D costs within a few years, raising questions about whether current incentives adequately reward clinically meaningful innovation and whether managed entry agreements can mitigate uncertainty while data mature [^113vUsZE] [^113UbgjQ].

> But wait, what if we are overemphasizing speed at the expense of certainty? The literature consistently flags a tension between rapid access and robust evidence: expedited approvals based on surrogates can reach patients sooner, yet delays or failures in confirmatory studies leave persistent uncertainty; policy levers such as stronger enforcement of post-marketing commitments, parallel scientific advice with HTA bodies, and clearer links between added benefit and market incentives are repeatedly proposed to better align access with value [^116GFsX6] [^114DJEB6] [^116SUnXK].

> In summary, the EMA's role in oncology drug approval spans centralized scientific evaluation, conditional pathways for high unmet need, and post-authorization oversight; while the system enables timely EU-wide access, many approvals occur with limited evidence and rely on sponsors to deliver confirmatory data, creating enduring uncertainties that affect clinical practice, HTA decisions, and patient outcomes, and calling for continued refinement of evidentiary standards and enforcement mechanisms [^116eosNx] [^111bcFHM] [^112M3CTx].

The EMA approves oncology drugs through a **centralized procedure** that mandates a single EU-wide marketing authorization for all cancer therapies [^115ABU9m]. The CHMP conducts a **scientific review** of quality, safety, and efficacy, issuing a recommendation to the European Commission for final approval [^116eosNx]. For urgent unmet needs, the EMA grants **conditional approval** based on surrogate endpoints, with annual renewals contingent on confirmatory data [^112DJGFp]. It also issues **post-marketing requirements** to resolve uncertainties, though delays in completion are common [^111bcFHM]. Compared with the FDA, the EMA typically has longer review times but requires more mature evidence, resulting in fewer early approvals before peer-reviewed publication [^117NkrhP].

---

## Centralized procedure for oncology drug approval

- **Mandatory centralized review**: All oncology drugs must undergo centralized review, yielding a single EU-wide authorization [^115ABU9m].
- **CHMP role**: The CHMP conducts the scientific evaluation and issues a recommendation to the European Commission [^115JiDW2].
- **European Commission decision**: The Commission issues the final marketing authorization based on CHMP's recommendation [^115JiDW2].

---

## Scientific evaluation process

The EMA's evaluation **focuses on three core areas**:

| **Aspect** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Quality | Manufacturing, formulation, and stability [^notfound] |
| Safety | Toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical safety data [^notfound] |
| Efficacy | Clinical trial evidence on survival, progression-free survival, or response rate [^112qvDJ6] |

---

The CHMP may seek **expert advice** from the Scientific Advisory Groups (SAGs) or other external experts as needed [^notfound].

---

## Conditional marketing authorization (CMA)

Conditional marketing authorization is granted for oncology drugs that address **unmet medical needs** when comprehensive data are not yet available but the benefit-risk balance is favorable [^114wvs6H]. Criteria include a positive benefit-risk balance, likelihood of confirmatory data, fulfillment of an unmet need, and immediate benefit outweighing risks. Authorizations are valid for one year and are renewable annually pending confirmatory data [^114wvs6H].

---

## Post-marketing requirements

The EMA frequently imposes **post-marketing requirements** to address uncertainties at approval [^111bcFHM]. Common requirements include additional safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic studies, as well as risk management plans. Completion is often delayed, with about one-third of requirements still ongoing or delayed after five years [^112Ff3Y1].

---

## Comparison with FDA

The EMA and FDA differ in their **approval processes and timelines**:

| **Aspect** | **Ema** | **Fda** |
|-|-|-|
| Review time | Longer (median 426 days) [^117NkrhP] | Shorter (median 200 days) [^117NkrhP] |
| Early approvals | Fewer approvals before publication | More approvals before publication [^117NkrhP] |
| Expedited pathways | Conditional marketing authorization | Accelerated approval [^116Xbjba] |

---

## Challenges and criticisms

The EMA faces several **challenges and criticisms** in oncology drug approval:

- **Surrogate endpoints**: Frequent use of surrogate endpoints (e.g. PFS) without proven OS benefit [^112M3CTx].
- **Quality of life**: Limited consideration of quality of life in approvals [^113Vi3MN].
- **Post-marketing delays**: Slow completion of post-marketing studies [^112Ff3Y1].
- **Access disparities**: Unequal access across EU member states due to varying HTA processes [^11151RWV].

---

## Recent developments and initiatives

Recent efforts include **PRIME**, launched in 2016 to support early dialogue and expedited review for medicines addressing unmet needs [^11444XjZ]. The EMA is also increasingly incorporating real-world evidence into regulatory decisions [^notfound]. Parallel scientific advice with HTA bodies aims to align evidence requirements and facilitate access [^114DJEB6].

---

The EMA's oncology drug approval process balances timely access with rigorous evidence, using conditional approval and post-marketing requirements to manage uncertainty. Despite longer review times than the FDA, the EMA emphasizes mature evidence, though challenges remain regarding surrogate endpoints, quality of life, and post-marketing study completion.

### The European medicines agency: an overview of its mission, responsibilities, and recent initiatives in cancer drug regulation [^116eosNx]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union (EU). Since 2005, the agency has become responsible for the approval of all new oncology drugs in the EU. In this article we describe the mission, role, and responsibilities of the EMA, and provide a brief summary of recent initiatives related to cancer drug regulation. The EMA recently published its Road Map to 2015. Over the next 5 years, the agency aims to continue to stimulate drug development in areas of unmet medical needs. Concerning drug safety, one of the priorities over the next few years will be to establish a more proactive approach in ensuring patient safety. This is the result of new EU legislation coming into force in 2012 that will strengthen the way the safety of medicines for human use is monitored in the EU. In terms of its general operation, the agency is committed to increased openness and transparency, and to build on its interactions with stakeholders, including members of academia, health care professionals, patients, and health technology assessment bodies. The agency recently created an oncology working party to expand the current guideline for the development and evaluation of cancer drugs. The guideline focuses on both exploratory and confirmatory studies for different types of agents. The current revision will address a number of topics, including the use of biomarkers as an integrated part of drug development and the use of progression-free survival as a primary endpoint in registration trials.

### Evaluation of oncology drugs at the European medicines agency and US food and drug administration: when differences have an impact on clinical practice [^112tFduL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this study were to compare the approaches of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the evaluation and approval of new anticancer indications and to identify possible clinical implications associated with these differences.

Methods

Information on the European Union therapeutic indications for the cohort of anticancer drugs was extracted from the European Public Assessment Reports and from the FDA review reports.

Results

Overall, 42 anticancer drugs were approved by EMA between 1995 and 2008, corresponding to a total of 100 indications. In 47 of 100 indications, a difference was found. For 19 of these 47 indications, the difference was that one agency approved an indication, whereas the other agency did not. For the remaining 28 indications, the same indication was approved by both of the agencies and differences were evaluated through an algorithm; in 10 cases, discrepancies in therapeutic indications between EMA and FDA were considered clinically relevant. We found an overall trend that the agency that was second to give a positive approval was usually more restrictive in terms of wording of the indication compared with the agency that provided approval first. Regarding the use and robustness of available clinical data for evaluation, no clear associations could be found.

Conclusion

Clinically relevant differences in the outcome of the EMA and FDA approval process of oncology products were found. Neither of the agencies seems to have a prevailing restrictive behavior over the other. Further efforts on harmonizing decision making between regulatory systems are needed.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

A growing number of new cancer drugs in Europe are approved based on limited clinical trial data and may be required to address unresolved questions about drug safety and efficacy through postmarketing requirements.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Using regulatory documents, we characterized the design and completion of postmarketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We also examined whether the completion of postmarketing requirements influenced regulatory decisions for permanent authorization.

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

From 2004 to 2014, the EMA assigned postmarketing data collection requirements to four‐fifths of newly approved cancer drugs. More than one‐third of postmarketing requirements were ongoing or delayed after at least 5 years, including about one‐half of requirements for new clinical studies. Despite delays in the completion of postmarketing requirements, this often did not impact the likelihood of temporarily authorized drugs receiving permanent marketing authorization.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

European regulators should work with manufacturers to develop postmarketing research plans that address limitations in the available evidence and improve compliance with study timelines.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for evaluating the benefits and risks of new drugs before they can be prescribed in the European Union. As part of the regulatory approval process, drug manufacturers conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that their products have sufficient safety and efficacy and that the benefits outweigh the risks. To address unresolved questions about new drugs at the time of approval, the EMA may require that manufacturers conduct additional studies during the postmarketing period. When postmarketing requirements have been delayed or have not been fulfilled, the EMA can send a letter to the manufacturer, request an oral explanation, request an inspection, or vary, suspend, or revoke marketing authorization.

### Cancer therapy approval timings, review speed, and publication of pivotal registration trials in the US and Europe, 2010–2019 [^117NkrhP]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Ensuring patients have access to safe and efficacious medicines in a timely manner is an essential goal for regulatory agencies, one which has particular importance in oncology because of the substantial unmet need for new therapies. The 2 largest regulatory agencies, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), have pivotal global roles, and their recommendations and approvals are frequently followed by other national regulators.

Objective

To compare market authorization dates for new oncology therapies approved in the US and Europe over the past decade and to examine and contrast the regulatory activities of the FDA and EMA in the approval of new cancer medicines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study reviewed the FDA and EMA regulatory databases to identify new oncology therapies approved in both the US and Europe from 2010 to 2019, and characterization of the timings of regulatory activities. Statistical analysis was performed from January to April 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Regulatory approval date, review time, submission of market authorization application, accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization status and proportion of approvals prior to peer-reviewed publication of pivotal trial results.

Results

In total, 89 new concomitant oncology therapies were approved in the US and Europe from 2010 to 2019. The FDA approved 85 oncology therapies (95%) before European authorization and 4 therapies (5%) after. The median (IQR) delay in market authorization for new oncology therapies in Europe was 241 (150–370) days compared with the US. The median (IQR) review time was 200 (155–277) days for the FDA and 426 (358–480) days for the EMA. Sixty-four new licensing applications (72%) were submitted to the FDA first, compared with 21 (23%) to the EMA. Thirty-five oncology therapies (39%) were approved by the FDA prior to pivotal study publication, whereas only 8 (9%) by the EMA.

Conclusion and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, new oncology therapies were approved earlier in the US than Europe. The FDA received licensing applications sooner and had shorter review times. However, more therapies were approved prior to licensing study publication, leaving uncertainty for practitioners regarding clinical utility and safety of newly approved therapies.

### Similarities and differences in the oncology drug approval process between FDA and European union with emphasis on in vitro companion diagnostics [^114vY7KX]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

Drug approval [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or market authorization for the European Union's European Medicines Agency (EMA)] is the most significant regulatory milestone for any drug, as drugs can only be marketed after marketing approval by a health authority. This article focuses on the main regulatory aspects of the drug approval process in the European Union (EU) and the United States. Although the procedures, requirements, and timelines for drug approvals are different between the EU and the United States, several global harmonization efforts have been developed during the past few years to have more consistent regulatory procedures/outcomes in different parts of the world. One of the most different procedures/requirements among these regions is co-development, also known as in vitro companion diagnostic. In the United States, it is expected that for a drug that requires an in vitro diagnostic test to select the population to be treated, the companion diagnostic should be already/concomitantly approved by the FDA. In the EU, these requirements are not as stringent as in the United States. However, it is anticipated that in the very near future, legislation changes in the EU will lead to similar requirements for the companion diagnostics for EMA. In summary, although the principles, procedures, and requirements for drug approvals may differ between the United States and EMA, novel efforts to harmonize them are being considered and implemented, thereby leading to simpler global drug development. It is of outmost importance that drug developers understand and appreciate differences in regional regulations. Otherwise, lack of understanding may lead to rejection or delays in drug approvals for useful anticancer agents.

### Assessment of food and drug administration-and European medicines agency-approved systemic oncology therapies and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life: a systematic review [^112SaMKH]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

For patients with cancer treated with palliative intent, quality of life (QOL) is a critical aspect of treatment decision-making, alongside survival. In some cases, patients with advanced cancer have even prioritized QOL over survival. However, submission of QOL data are not mandatory for oncology drugs seeking regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA). Thus, despite the value of QOL as a constituent of clinical benefit, it often does not appear to be a considerable factor in drug approval.

Clinical trials with the aim of drug registration are designed with primary objectives focused on demonstrating traditional components of clinical benefit, such as overall survival (OS). As such, trials are therefore powered to capture the statistically significant differences in these traditional end points, often without consideration of QOL evidence. However, regulatory approval is frequently based on surrogate outcomes for survival or clinical effectiveness, such as progression-free survival (PFS) or response rate. While such methods may serve to expedite drug approval, a drug's final efficacy (or the lack thereof) may not be apparent at the time of market authorization. Given an absence of clinically meaningful survival gains, any increase in length of life may not be associated with comparable increases in QOL.

The landscape of oncology therapeutics is rapidly evolving, but although moderate improvements in survival have been achieved, there is a paucity of literature surrounding clinically meaningful improvements in QOL for oncology drugs. While there has been growing attention to QOL end points, and greater consideration of QOL within the concept of value in cancer care, there is seemingly little consideration of QOL by regulatory agencies.

In an attempt to quantify value and systematically assess the clinical benefit of oncology drugs, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) have released valuation frameworks. Both frameworks intend to objectively quantify clinical benefit by considering outcome measures including survival, QOL, and toxic effects, and can be used to objectively evaluate the overall clinical benefit of oncology drugs or used in part to evaluate individual dimensions.

### Availability of evidence of benefits on overall survival and quality of life of cancer drugs approved by European medicines agency: retrospective cohort study of drug approvals 2009–13 [^112M3CTx]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and regulatory policy

Despite the EMA's statement that overall survival is the "most persuasive outcome" for studies investigating the clinical safety and efficacy of new oncology drugs and new uses of such drugs, European regulators commonly accept the use of surrogate measures of drug benefit as primary endpoints in pivotal trials for both conditional and regular pathways to market authorisation. In addition, any demonstration of a statistically significant difference in survival between treatments, however small and regardless of whether such a difference is clinically meaningful to patients, has recently been accepted as the basis for approving new cancer drugs. To a large extent, regulatory evidence standards determine the clinical value of, and the quality of the evidence base for, new oncology drugs. Our study suggests these standards are failing to incentivise drug development that best meets the needs of patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems.

Though surrogate endpoints are argued to have the advantage of allowing quicker drug development and patient access, it is questionable whether studies based on surrogate measures of efficacy provide optimal, or even meaningful, information for patients and clinicians. Moreover, our analysis raises the possibility that regulatory and current research practices have created a situation in which critical information about the outcomes that matter most to patients might never be generated once oncology drugs are approved for widespread use. The limited availability of studies showing either benefits to overall survival or quality of life in the postmarketing period underscores the importance of requiring robust evidence of clinical benefit at the time of marketing authorisation.

The EMA and other drug regulatory agencies should reconsider when, and to what extent, it is appropriate to approve new cancer drugs on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Furthermore, when gains in survival and quality of life are shown, these gains should be meaningful to patients and clinicians.

### Real-world evidence in drug approvals at the European medicines agency [^112p3eLj]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Integrating evidence generated during routine clinical use (real-world evidence) into regulatory science is important for addressing gaps left by randomized clinical trials, which often do not reflect clinical practice. In recent years, real-world evidence gained wide attention, particularly in the US, playing a growing role in regulatory decision-making by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thirty-one percent of FDA approvals from 2019 to 2021 incorporated data generated during routine clinical use, as reported by Purpura et al. While FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) decisions are highly concordant, little is known about how the EMA, as the second-largest regulator, incorporates such data into its approval processes.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^1114Yce5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

To address unresolved questions about drug safety and efficacy at the time of approval, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) may require that manufacturers conduct additional studies during the postmarketing period. As a growing proportion of new cancer drugs are approved on the basis of limited evidence of clinical benefit, timely completion of postmarketing requirements is important. We used publicly available regulatory documents to evaluate key characteristics of pivotal studies supporting EMA-approved cancer drugs from 2004–2014 and assessed completion rates of postmarketing data collection requirements after a minimum of 5years. From 2004–2014, 79% (45/57) of EMA-approved cancer drugs had to fulfill postmarketing requirements. Pivotal trials supporting the approval of cancer drugs with postmarketing requirements were less likely to have randomized designs (41/61, 67% vs. 11/11, 100%), include an active comparator (20/61, 33% vs. 10/11, 91%), or measure overall survival as the primary study end point (18/61, 30% vs. 6/11, 55%) compared with pivotal trials for drugs without postmarketing requirements. Among 200 postmarketing requirements, almost half were designed to assess drug safety. After a minimum of 5years, 60% (121/200) of requirements were completed, 10% (19/200) were ongoing, and 30% (60/200) were delayed. About half (40/75, 53%) of postmarketing requirements for new clinical studies were completed on time. Delays in the completion of postmarketing requirements often did not impact the likelihood of drugs receiving permanent marketing authorization (87%, 39/45) after 5years. Our findings highlight the need for EMA to better enforce its authority to require timely completion of postmarketing requirements and studies.

### Lessons learned from postmarketing withdrawals of expedited approvals for oncology drug indications [^116GFsX6]. The Lancet: Oncology (2024). High credibility.

In the past decade, there have been a record number of oncology therapy approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Besides the EMA's conditional marketing authorisation programme and the FDA's Accelerated Approval Program, we observe a tendency towards fast approval for exploratory studies with non-randomised, uncontrolled designs and surrogate endpoints. This issue raises concerns about the robustness and effectiveness of accepted treatments, leaving patients and health-care professionals in a state of uncertainty. A substantial number of accelerated approvals have recently been withdrawn in the United States, with some still authorised in Europe, emphasising discrepancies in regulatory standards that affect both patients and society as a whole. We highlight examples of drugs, authorised on the basis of surrogate endpoints, that were later withdrawn due to an absence of overall survival benefit. Our findings address the challenges and consequences of accelerated approval pathways in oncology. In conclusion, this Policy Review calls for regulatory bodies to better align their procedures and insist on robust evidence, preferably through unbiased randomised controlled trials. Drug approval processes should prioritise patient benefit, overall survival, and quality of life to minimise risks and uncertainties for patients.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^112Ff3Y1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

More than one‐third of postmarketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the EMA from 2004 to 2014 were ongoing or delayed after at least 5 years, including about one‐half of new clinical studies. Despite unfulfilled obligations, most drugs were converted to permanent marketing authorization. European regulators should work with manufacturers to develop postmarketing research plans that address limitations in the available evidence and improve compliance with study timelines.

### Assessment of food and drug administration-and European medicines agency-approved systemic oncology therapies and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life: a systematic review [^114DoqXG]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are oncology therapies recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) associated with clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life (QOL)?

Findings

In this systematic review of approved oncology therapies, 40% of FDA-approved and 58% of EMA-approved indications had published QOL evidence. However, only 6% and 11% of FDA- and EMA-approved indications, respectively, had clinically meaningful improvements in QOL beyond minimal clinically important differences.

Meaning

These findings suggest that oncology therapies are often approved without evidence of QOL improvement, despite the importance to patients.

### Design characteristics, risk of bias, and reporting of randomised controlled trials supporting approvals of cancer drugs by European medicines agency, 2014–16: cross sectional analysis [^1152nxPV]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Regulatory agencies are responsible for evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of new medicines. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) serves as the gatekeeper to the pharmaceutical market; clinicians can only prescribe a new drug after it receives the EMA's approval. The EMA bases its decisions on a small number of key clinical studies completed and submitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Between 2012 and 2016, about half of new drugs approved by the EMA were associated with a single pivotal study.

Recently, cancer drugs have comprised the single largest category of new drug approvals in Europe. In 2017, more than a quarter (24/92) of EMA approvals were for cancer drugs. There is considerable debate and controversy about the therapeutic and economic value of these drugs. Our recent research showed that most new cancer drugs were approved by the EMA without evidence of benefit on overall survival or quality of life. In recent years there has been a substantial shift towards use of surrogate endpoints such as progression free survival. There is growing recognition that the correlation between surrogate endpoints and overall survival is often poor.

About a third of "positive" randomised controlled trials of cancer drugs report treatment effects that are considered to be clinically meaningful according to the European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale. Moreover, there is no association between magnitude of benefit and drug price. Because cancer drugs are responsible for most of the recent increases in pharmaceutical spending across healthcare systems, the evidence base that supports their market entry warrants close scrutiny.

Previous work described the characteristics of pivotal studies supporting new cancer drug approvals in Europe and the United States. Regulators in both settings generally review the same set of clinical studies when approving new drugs. In a large evaluation that focused on US Food and Drug Administration approvals, clinical studies of cancer drugs were less likely to be randomised and double blinded than clinical studies of drugs in other therapeutic areas. In another US study, cancer drugs with orphan (rare disease) designations were less likely to be randomised and double blinded than non-orphan cancer drugs. In Europe, most of the new cancer drug approvals between 2009 and 2013 were supported by at least one randomised controlled trial. However, an increasing proportion of new cancer drugs are approved on the basis of non-randomised, single arm studies.

Discussion

Summary of findings

In this study, we evaluated the evidence base underpinning the EMA's recent cancer drug approvals. Between 2014 and 2016, a quarter of pivotal studies supporting cancer drug approvals were not randomised designs. Of the 39 randomised controlled trials that formed the basis of new cancer drug approvals, almost three quarters did not measure overall survival or quality of life outcomes as primary endpoints. Using the revised Cochrane tool, we judged 49% of randomised controlled trials to be at high risk of bias. Our judgments changed in either direction for a fifth of randomised controlled trials when we relied on information reported in regulatory documents and scientific publications separately. Regulators identified additional deficits beyond the domains captured in risk of bias assessments for several trials, which were not disclosed as limitations in scientific publications.

The three key findings of this study warrant further discussion. Firstly, our evaluation characterises the design features of contemporary cancer drug trials. Although randomised controlled trials accounted for about 90% of pivotal studies from 2009 to 2013, such designs accounted for 75% of studies from 2014 to 2016. A growing proportion of recent cancer drug approvals were based on single arm studies, which are more likely to receive conditional marketing authorisations that target indications with unmet medical need. Even when trials had comparators, their appropriateness was at times questionable. We found two randomised controlled trials in which participants were randomised to receive different doses of the same experimental treatment (without a control). In other cases, the comparator either precluded isolation of the effect of the experimental treatment or did not adequately reflect standard of care; these trials were subsequently criticised by the EMA. In terms of study endpoints, only a quarter of randomised controlled trials were powered to evaluate overall survival as the primary outcome. According to the recent EMA guidelines on the evaluation of anticancer treatments", convincingly demonstrated favourable effects on overall survival are from both a clinical and methodological perspective the most persuasive outcome of a clinical trial". Yet, most cancer drugs were approved on the basis of other endpoints, such as progression free survival and disease response. Recent systematic reviews showed that progression free survival and disease response do not consistently translate to survival gains or quality of life benefits. Cancer drugs that appear effective on these surrogate measures could even turn out to be harmful.

### Patient-reported outcome measures in oncology drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2017–2021 [^116jbF3J]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Recently, regulatory agencies have championed the value of collecting information directly from patients regarding symptoms, health-related quality of life, or physical functioning via patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).PROMs are self-completed instruments that can be generic (ie, suitable for a variety of conditions) or disease-specific (ie, tailored to a given patient population). The strategic vision of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeks to reinforce patient relevance in evidence generation for pharmaceutical products through a coordinated approach to PROMs collection. We recently conducted a study aimed at investigating the use of PROMs in new marketing authorizations for oncology drugs approved by the EMA between 2017 and 2021.

### Differences in the on-label cancer indications of medicinal products between Europe and the United States [^113rwiba]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

The definition of a therapeutic indication formulated by regulatory agencies is a decisive element for the marketing authorisation of medicinal products and for patient access. Trotta and colleagues found that oncological indications granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the period between 1999 and 2008 were clinically different in about 10% of cases. In this Policy Review, we compared the 162 therapeutic indications of 80 medicinal products for solid tumours and blood cancers authorised by the EMA between January, 2015, and September, 2022, with the corresponding labels approved by the FDA. Clinically relevant discrepancies in the EMA summary of product characteristics and FDA labels were identified for 51·9% of the evaluated indications. Differences arise in the place in therapy, in the need for patients to be refractory to previous therapies, in biomarker requirement for eligibility, in concomitant treatments, or in patient characteristics. These differences lead to a different population for which drugs can be prescribed on label, with the FDA granting broader indications more often than the EMA. Therapeutic indications are a legal basis that define the eligible population to specific treatments. The fact that about half of the indications are different between the United States and Europe affect patient access to medications and should stimulate a debate on the weight that uncertainty plays in regulatory decisions.

### Does conditional approval for new oncology drugs in Europe lead to differences in health technology assessment decisions? [^111fiZfu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

An early access pathway of conditional approval for potentially beneficial medicines is available within the European regulatory framework. However, marketing authorization does not necessarily result in recommendations for public funding by health technology assessment (HTA) agencies. As conditional approval goes along with less than complete data on benefits and risks of a treatment option for a high medical need, this raises the question how HTA decision-making is affected by these uncertainties.

### Availability of evidence of benefits on overall survival and quality of life of cancer drugs approved by European medicines agency: retrospective cohort study of drug approvals 2009–13 [^116pxpwN]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the availability of data on overall survival and quality of life benefits of cancer drugs approved in Europe. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Publicly accessible regulatory and scientific reports on cancer approvals by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) from 2009 to 2013. Main outcome measures Pivotal and postmarketing trials of cancer drugs according to their design features (randomisation, crossover, blinding), comparators, and endpoints. Availability and magnitude of benefit on overall survival or quality of life determined at time of approval and after market entry. Validated European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) used to assess the clinical value of the reported gains in published studies of cancer drugs. Results From 2009 to 2013, the EMA approved the use of 48 cancer drugs for 68 indications. Of these, eight indications (12%) were approved on the basis of a single arm study. At the time of market approval, there was significant prolongation of survival in 24 of the 68 (35%). The magnitude of the benefit on overall survival ranged from 1.0 to 5.8 months (median 2.7 months). At the time of market approval, there was an improvement in quality of life in seven of 68 indications (10%). Out of 44 indications for which there was no evidence of a survival gain at the time of market authorisation, in the subsequent postmarketing period there was evidence for extension of life in three (7%) and reported benefit on quality of life in five (11%). Of the 68 cancer indications with EMA approval, and with a median of 5.4 years' follow-up (minimum 3.3 years, maximum 8.1 years), only 35 (51%) had shown a significant improvement in survival or quality of life, while 33 (49%) remained uncertain. Of 23 indications associated with a survival benefit that could be scored with the ESMO-MCBS tool, the benefit was judged to be clinically meaningful in less than half (11/23, 48%). Conclusions This systematic evaluation of oncology approvals by the EMA in 2009–13 shows that most drugs entered the market without evidence of benefit on survival or quality of life. At a minimum of 3.3 years after market entry, there was still no conclusive evidence that these drugs either extended or improved life for most cancer indications. When there were survival gains over existing treatment options or placebo, they were often marginal.

### Access to innovative oncology medicines in Europe [^116vqgWf]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The field of cancer diseases is growing fast: the World Health Organization predicted 15 million new cases per year in 2020, but as investigations could show, we already reached an incidence of 14.1 million cancer cases and 8.2 deaths from cancer worldwide in 2012. The World Cancer Report 2014, published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, revealed that the cancer burden could rise to 22 million annually within the next two decades.

Having this in mind, more emphasis on cancer prevention, research, therapy and better-targeted anticancer drugs are required and, at the same time, there is a need for rapid licencing and market availability of innovative, more effective oncology drugs.

While the approval of new drugs belongs to the competences of regulatory agencies, most EU member states have delegated the assessments for relative effectiveness or additional clinical benefit to dedicated HTA bodies. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for the centralised authorisation procedure, which is mandatory for human medicines for the treatment of cancer inter-alia and results in a single marketing authorisation that is valid in all EU countries, as well as in the European Economic Area. Although the marketing authorisation is granted on a European level by the European Commission (EC), the decision on the pricing, reimbursement and funding for those medicines is taken independently in every single European country due to different operating health care systems. Among the European HTA bodies, the Haute Autorité de Santé in France and the 'Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (GBA)' make their price negotiation and decision based on the determination of an added clinical benefit. The legal basis is the 'Arzneimittelneuordnungsgesetz (AMNOG)'. The pharmaceutical companies can still set the initial list price for a new drug after marketing authorisation and after launch. Upon launch, however, they have to submit a detailed dossier based on the authorisation documents and all studies carried out on this pharmaceutical to the GBA. The GBA assesses recognition of any additional benefit claimed over the appropriate comparator and rates between 'extensive benefit' (level 1) to 'less benefit' (level 6) compared with the comparator, which is the basis for price negotiations. The benefit assessment can be delegated to the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) or third parties. One year after market launch, this reimbursement price replaces the initial list price of the drug.

### Added benefit and revenues of oncology drugs approved by the European medicines agency between 1995 and 2020: retrospective cohort study [^113vUsZE]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the added benefit and revenues of oncology drugs, explore their association, and investigate potential discrepancies between added benefit and revenues across different approval pathways of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Oncology drugs and their indications approved by the EMA between 1995 and 2020.

Main Outcome Measures

Added benefit was evaluated using ratings published by seven organisations: health technology assessment agencies from the United States, France, Germany, and Italy, two medical oncology societies, and a drug bulletin. All retrieved ratings were recategorised using a four point ranking scale to indicate negative or non-quantifiable, minor, substantial, or major added benefit. Revenue data were extracted from publicly available financial reports and compared with published estimates of research and development (R&D) costs. Finally, the association between added benefit and revenue was evaluated. All analyses were performed within the overall study cohort, and within subgroups based on the EMA approval pathway: standard marketing authorisation, conditional marketing authorisation, and authorisation under exceptional circumstances.

Results

131 oncology drugs with 166 indications were evaluated for their added benefit by at least one organisation within the required timeframe, yielding a total of 458 added benefit ratings; 189 (41%) were negative or non-quantifiable. The median time to offset the median R&D costs ($684m, £535m, €602m, adjusted to 2020 values) was three years; 50 of 55 (91%) drugs recovered these costs within eight years. Drugs with higher added benefit ratings generally had greater revenues. Negative or non-quantifiable added benefit ratings were more frequent for conditional marketing authorisations and authorisations under exceptional circumstances than for standard marketing authorisations (relative risk 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.89). Conditional marketing authorisations generated lower revenues and took longer to offset R&D costs than standard marketing authorisations (four years compared with three years).

Conclusions

While revenues seem to align with added benefit, most oncology drugs recover R&D costs within a few years despite providing little added benefit. This is particularly true for drugs approved through conditional marketing authorisations, which inherently appear to lack comprehensive evidence. Policy makers should evaluate whether current regulatory and reimbursement incentives effectively promote development of the most effective drugs for patients with the greatest needs.

### Cancer therapy approval timings, review speed, and publication of pivotal registration trials in the US and Europe, 2010–2019 [^1126bs97]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Market authorization of new therapies granted by regulatory agencies require evidence of safety and therapeutic efficacy based on adequate and well controlled studies. The 2 largest global regulators are the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). As such, they frequently set industry standards and guidance, routinely followed by other national regulatory agencies.

The past decade has witnessed a record number of new oncology therapy approvals, including many first-in-class or breakthrough therapies, requiring timely review and authorization from regulatory agencies to provide prompt access to patients in need. Over this same period, new review pathways have been developed by both the FDA (Breakthrough Designation) and EMA (Priority Medicines; PRIME) to enhance support for the development and review of medicines to treat serious conditions. Furthermore, expedited approval pathways (accelerated approval by the FDA and conditional marketing authorization by the EMA) have also been used to address many areas of unmet need within oncology. These approvals are made with less comprehensive clinical data but with the expectation for further data before granting regular approval.

The activities of the FDA and EMA are frequently compared, particularly in reference to approval times for new therapy and device registrations. Despite differences in approval processes, prior studies have shown a close alignment between FDA and EMA in more than 90% of new therapy registrations across all therapeutic areas. However, no recent comparisons of the regulatory activities of the FDA and EMA in the approval of new oncology therapies have been conducted. A study by Roberts and colleaguesfound that market authorization of new oncology therapies between 2003 and2010 was 238 days later in Europe compared with the US. However, it is unknown how expedited review, approval initiatives, and the challenge of new therapeutic classes over the past decade has affected review speed and approval timings between the FDA and EMA.

We therefore investigated new oncology therapies authorized by each regulator over the past decade, comparing initial market authorization date and characterizing submission dates, review length, and approval timings relative to publication of pivotal clinical studies supporting regulatory authorization.

### Design characteristics, risk of bias, and reporting of randomised controlled trials supporting approvals of cancer drugs by European medicines agency, 2014–16: cross sectional analysis [^111dHehi]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Results summary

Table 2 summarises our findings at the cancer drug level. Of 32 new cancer drugs approved by the EMA from 2014 to 2016, 27 entered the European market with at least one randomised trial. Of the cancer drugs with randomised controlled trials, only seven were evaluated in trials powered to measure overall survival as a primary or coprimary endpoint. Half (n = 16) of cancer drugs had at least one randomised controlled trial at low risk of bias. European regulators identified other concerns for 7 of the 16 drugs that had at least one randomised controlled trial at low risk of bias.

Table 2
Overview of findings at the drug level. For each cancer drug approval from 2014 to 2016, the table shows whether there was at least one randomised controlled trial supporting the EMA's approval decision; whether there was at least one randomised controlled trial evaluating overall survival as a primary or coprimary endpoint; whether there was at least one randomised controlled trial at low risk of bias; whether EMA scientists and committee members raised additional concerns about the appropriateness of the available evidence according to factors that were not captured in risk of bias assessments; and whether EMA committee members issued a divergent opinion on the approval decision based on those concerns

EMA = European Medicines Agency; NA = not applicable; OS = overall survival; RCT = randomised controlled trial.

Figure 4 summarises our findings according to approval characteristics. Of 13 cancer drugs approved in orphan conditions, 4 (31%) had at least one randomised controlled trial at low risk of bias and without major regulatory concerns. The corresponding number was 5 among the subset of 19 drugs (26%) approved in non-orphan conditions. A lower proportion of cancer drugs with conditional marketing authorisations had at least one randomised controlled trial at low risk of bias and without major regulatory concerns compared with drugs with regular EMA approvals (1/5 (20%) v 8/27 (30%), respectively).

Fig 4
Overview of findings at the drug level according to approval characteristics (orphan v non-orphan conditions; conditional marketing authorisations v regular approvals). The figure shows whether there was at least one randomised controlled trial at low risk of bias; and whether there was at least one randomised controlled trial at low risk of bias and without major regulatory concerns before approval

### Added benefit and revenues of oncology drugs approved by the European medicines agency between 1995 and 2020: retrospective cohort study [^114DJEB6]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Further policy recommendations for improved alignment might include increased use of parallel joint scientific consultations between regulatory authorities and HTA agencies, a key element within the recently adopted EU HTA Regulation. Differences in evidentiary requirements between the EMA and HTA bodies often lead to positive benefit-risk assessments but negative added benefit assessments. Through parallel joint scientific consultations, alignment on evidence requirements and assessment criteria can be established. In the context of expedited approvals that are inherently associated with less comprehensive evidence, parallel joint scientific consultations can prove invaluable to adequately navigate HTA requirements and truly achieve expedited patient access.

Moreover, our findings about the recovery of R&D costs can inform pharmaceutical pricing strategies. Managed entry agreements, for example, extend beyond simple reimbursement decisions and are effective strategies to mitigate uncertainties. Given that many oncology drugs generate substantial revenues despite providing minimal added benefit, managed entry agreements emerge as valuable tools to establish flexible payment structures that reflect the value (or the lack thereof) of drugs to patients. Building on this, improved price transparency is a critical prerequisite for managing drug costs and enhancing sustainable patient access, providing opportunities to shape fair pricing strategies and policies more effectively. Our study's findings and subsequent policy recommendations should be further discussed in initiatives aiming to ensure equitable, sustainable, and affordable patient access to innovative and expensive drugs, such as Beneluxa, the Oslo Medicines Initiative, and WHO's Novel Pricing Platform, or can be used as input to develop new initiatives in this critical domain.

Conclusion

Our study revealed that evaluations of oncology drugs frequently result in a conclusion of negative or non-quantifiable added benefit. This finding is especially true for drugs approved through expedited pathways that are intended for promising drugs, but are simultaneously associated with an inherent lack of comprehensive evidence, which indicates a misalignment between regulatory and reimbursement policies. Oncology drugs with higher levels of added benefit tend to generate higher revenues than drugs with less added benefit, potentially creating incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop high value drugs. However, drugs with lower added benefits are often able to recover their estimated R&D costs within a few years. It is crucial for policy makers to assess whether the current regulatory and reimbursement incentives are properly structured to promote and facilitate the development of the most effective drugs for patients with the greatest needs.

### Added benefit and revenues of oncology drugs approved by the European medicines agency between 1995 and 2020: retrospective cohort study [^1145qTXz]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To evaluate the added benefit and revenues of oncology drugs, explore their association, and investigate potential discrepancies between added benefit and revenues across different approval pathways of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Oncology drugs and their indications approved by the EMA between 1995 and 2020.

Main outcome measures

Added benefit was evaluated using ratings published by seven organisations: health technology assessment agencies from the United States, France, Germany, and Italy, two medical oncology societies, and a drug bulletin. All retrieved ratings were recategorised using a four point ranking scale to indicate negative or non-quantifiable, minor, substantial, or major added benefit. Revenue data were extracted from publicly available financial reports and compared with published estimates of research and development (R&D) costs. Finally, the association between added benefit and revenue was evaluated. All analyses were performed within the overall study cohort, and within subgroups based on the EMA approval pathway: standard marketing authorisation, conditional marketing authorisation, and authorisation under exceptional circumstances.

Results

131 oncology drugs with 166 indications were evaluated for their added benefit by at least one organisation within the required timeframe, yielding a total of 458 added benefit ratings; 189 (41%) were negative or non-quantifiable. The median time to offset the median R&D costs ($684m, £535m, €602m, adjusted to 2020 values) was three years; 50 of 55 (91%) drugs recovered these costs within eight years. Drugs with higher added benefit ratings generally had greater revenues. Negative or non-quantifiable added benefit ratings were more frequent for conditional marketing authorisations and authorisations under exceptional circumstances than for standard marketing authorisations (relative risk 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.89). Conditional marketing authorisations generated lower revenues and took longer to offset R&D costs than standard marketing authorisations (four years compared with three years).

Conclusions

While revenues seem to align with added benefit, most oncology drugs recover R&D costs within a few years despite providing little added benefit. This is particularly true for drugs approved through conditional marketing authorisations, which inherently appear to lack comprehensive evidence. Policy makers should evaluate whether current regulatory and reimbursement incentives effectively promote development of the most effective drugs for patients with the greatest needs.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^116aR5S2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Marketing authorization status

New drugs approved by the EMA are initially authorized under a temporary license lasting 5 years. This can be converted to permanent authorization if postapproval data confirms the safety and efficacy of the drug and resolves uncertainty associated with the initial evidence submission. We investigated if and when the initial marketing authorization status of cancer drugs was updated by searching the "procedural steps taken and scientific information after the authorization" in the public assessment report, and the summary of product characteristics in the European Union register of medicinal products for human use for entries corresponding to the renewal of the marketing authorization status.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^116cfYL9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This review of postmarketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the EMA from 2004–2014 found that more than one‐third were ongoing or delayed after at least 5 years of follow‐up according to information available from European regulatory documents. Despite some unfulfilled obligations, most drugs given initial temporary status were converted to permanent marketing authorization. These findings highlight shortcomings in the timely fulfillment of postmarketing requirements, which are particularly important for cancer drugs that often lack robust evidence of clinical benefit at the time of approval.

Our study shows that postmarketing requirements for many cancer drugs were ongoing or delayed after several years on the European market. Only about half of postmarketing requirements for new clinical studies were completed on time. As new cancer drugs are increasingly approved on the basis of changes to surrogate measures, postmarketing studies are essential to generate data on drug benefits and harms. Evidence generated during the postmarketing period may alter how the drug is prescribed, such as contraindications, restricted patient populations, safety communications, and boxed warnings. Therefore, timely completion of these requirements is essential for informing clinical practice.

We found that most cancer drugs were converted to permanent marketing authorization despite ongoing or delayed postmarketing requirements. European public assessment reports did not routinely reference the status of these requirements in approval decisions, which further demonstrates a lack of enforcement from European regulators in postmarket data collection.

Another finding from our study relates to the design of pivotal studies. Compared with cancer drugs without postmarketing requirements, cancer drugs with postmarketing requirements were often approved on the basis of non‐randomized studies, placebo comparators, and surrogate measures. In view of this, regulators may design postmarketing requirements to address uncertainties associated with pivotal studies. However, publicly available information on postmarketing requirements often did not include key information about study designs. Greater consideration should be given to developing postmarketing research plans that directly correspond to limitations in the available evidence at the time of approval.

Comparison to other studies

Our findings confirm and extend the findings of earlier studies. In the United States, completion and public reporting of postmarketing studies is frequently ongoing or delayed. This is also consistent for drugs with conditional marketing authorization in Europe. Our study extends the latter analyses and finds that timely completion across all postmarketing requirements for EMA‐approved cancer drugs is lacking.

### Review of all solid tumor drug approvals from 2019 to 2024 by US food and drug administration, European medicines agency, and Brazilian health regulatory agency [^111yj9Hj]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Regulatory agencies play a pivotal role in evaluating clinical evidence for oncology drug approvals. This study aimed to compare approved indications across the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), with a focus on the robustness of the supporting evidence and consistency between labeling and clinical trial data.

Methods

A systematic review identified all new drugs and indications for solid tumors approved by the FDA from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2024. Each approval was cross-referenced with corresponding decisions by EMA and ANVISA. For each indication, the pivotal trial's design, primary end point, study population, and the concordance between the approved label and the clinical evidence were identified.

Results

During the 6-year period, 199 new indications for solid tumors were approved by the FDA; 138 (69.3%) were also approved by EMA and 124 (62.3%) by ANVISA. Discrepancies between approved labels and the primary end point population occurred in 10.0% of FDA, 18.8% of EMA, and 12.9% of ANVISA approvals, most often due to label restrictions to subgroups, indicating a more conservative approach by EMA and ANVISA. Labeling differences were noted in 19 of 139 FDA-EMA and 10 of 124 FDA-ANVISA shared approvals. A total of 190 pivotal trials supported these approvals, including three phase I, 59 phase II, and 128 phase III studies. The most frequent end points were overall response rate and progression-free survival, including in phase III trials and regular approvals, rather than overall survival or quality of life.

Conclusion

Notable differences in timelines, regulatory mechanisms, and evidentiary thresholds across agencies result in divergent labeling. These variations have clinical and pol i cy implications for oncology drug access and adoption worldwide.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^114ibwCk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Policy implications

Our findings highlight the need to improve postmarketing evidence generation in Europe in several ways. First, regulators and manufacturers should work together to develop postapproval research plans that address gaps in knowledge about a drug's benefits or risks. For example, drugs that receive EMA approval on the basis of single‐arm studies should be required to validate drug benefits in randomized controlled trials during the postmarketing period. Second, postmarketing requirements should be fully integrated within the European clinical trials registry to ensure transparency about the status and outcomes of these studies. Third, regulators should enforce their existing authority and require the completion of postmarketing requirements within agreed upon timelines. Reasons for delays in the completion of postmarketing requirements may be multifaceted. For example, patient accrual can be slow because there is little incentive for most patients to participate in a clinical trial after a drug is approved for sale in Europe. In addition, protocol amendments may delay the initiation of a trial. Additional transparency from the EMA investigating the reasons for delays can help inform future policy decisions.

Limitations

The primary focus of our study was to identify information on postmarketing requirements using publicly available European regulatory documents. Therefore, it is possible that if additional requirements were requested by the EMA but omitted from regulatory documents, or if requirements were completed but not removed from regulatory documents, this would have influenced our results. Second, our categorization of postmarketing requirements was based on qualitative data synthesis, but we used prespecified criteria and confirmed difficult cases among multiple investigators to ensure high internal agreement and methodological consistency. Third, we were unable to determine specific dates for status updates to postmarketing requirements. Fourth, our sample consisted of novel drug approvals and may not be generalizable to postmarketing requirements for supplemental indications added to already‐approved drugs.

Finally, there is a possibility that the regulator and manufacturer can agree to the release of a postmarketing requirement if the study is no longer scientifically meritorious or has been answered by previous studies. However, this should be clearly disclosed in regulatory documents, which was not the case for any of the drugs in our sample.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^116w5caZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Since 2004, the marketing authorization of all new drugs approved by the EMA and drugs authorized under exceptional circumstances ("when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after authorization") is valid for 5 years, whereas drugs with conditional marketing authorization are renewed yearly. Prior to the initial marketing authorizations' expiration, manufacturers may be required to submit postapproval data to validate safety and efficacy and resolve outstanding uncertainty before permanent marketing authorization may be granted. For instance, drugs granted conditional marketing authorization are required to conduct postmarketing studies to confirm a positive risk–benefit ratio. Postmarketing studies can generate essential information on drug benefits and harms. Such studies typically generate additional data on dosing, safety, and real‐world effectiveness. However, compliance with postmarketing requirements often lacks enforcementand delays in study timelines are frequent.,

Cancer drugs comprise the largest category of drugs with postmarketing requirements. This is because evidence on the efficacy and safety of cancer drugs is often limited at the time of regulatory approval. In Europe, most new cancer drugs are approved based on changes to surrogate measures and without evidence on clinical outcomes, such as quality of life or overall survival.

Previous studies have examined the completion of postmarketing requirements for drugs with conditional marketing authorization in Europe. However, drugs with conditional marketing authorization account for a minority of new drug approvals with postmarketing requirements. In this study, we characterized postmarketing requirements for cancer drugs approved in Europe from 2004–2014 based on public information reported in European regulatory documents. We compared the characteristics of pre‐approval clinical trials for drugs with and without postmarketing requirements. Additionally, because drugs seeking to remain on the market after 5 years are required to apply for permanent marketing authorization, we examined whether the completion of postmarketing requirements influenced regulatory decisions for permanent authorization.

### Assessment of food and drug administration-and European medicines agency-approved systemic oncology therapies and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life: a systematic review [^113qTHVA]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. Patients enrolled in clinical trials are often highly selected compared with the typical oncology population. Specifically, older patients, those with multiple comorbidities, or patients with more complex cases may not be eligible to participate in clinical trials. Additionally, our study is based on publicly available evidence from the FDA, EMA, and informing trials. Despite our rigorous review, regulatory agencies may have access to additional evidence from trials that could be used to inform approvals beyond what is publicly available. The inability to assess heterogeneity in patient expectations surrounding the appropriate balance between quality and quantity of life is an additional limitation. Literature suggests that older patients may preferentially value QOL over quantity while younger patients may prefer quantity of life. Although this could not be assessed, our results highlight the need for QOL evidence alongside true efficacy to better inform individualized discussions surrounding patient preferences.

QOL data are inherently more difficult to collect and evaluate than survival outcomes. While our findings highlight the paucity of available QOL evidence overall in recently approved oncology drugs, and that even fewer indications offer statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in QOL, we recognize the limitations within individual trials to collect and analyze such data in meaningful ways.

### Ten years of marketing approvals of anticancer drugs in Europe: regulatory policy and guidance documents need to find a balance between different pressures [^114DyoJ7]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Mankind has never had so much knowledge and understanding of cancer as at present and this has generated a large number of approaches for developing new anticancer agents. However, despite important progress in understanding the molecular factors underlying the development of cancer and the improvement in response rates with new drugs, long-term survival is still disappointing for most common solid tumours. Most of the improvement in terms of age-standardised mortality in the EU is probably attributable to primary and secondary prevention, but survival gains with pharmacological treatments for common advanced/metastatic cancers are still measured in months, not years.

Several factors explain this gap between the explosion of information from basic (preclinical) research and its relatively poor yield for patients. One simple explanation is that very little of the modest gain is actually the result of new compounds discovered and marketed recently. Doubts have indeed been raised about the added value of the new 'targeted' molecules compared to the classic and less-expensive anticancer drugs, also in the framework of drug approvals.

Although much of the development of anticancer drugs continues after the regulatory agencies' approval, the US and EU agencies, FDA and EMEA, play a major role in improving public health as they fall between clinical trials and (public) health care and are thus responsible for the first scientific evaluation of the quality, safety and efficacy of new drugs. A look at the regulatory agencies' performance suggests some improvements. The FDA itself has recently reported its experience with oncology drugs.

The present analysis summarises and evaluates the types of studies and end points used by the EMEA over the last 10 years to approve new anticancer drugs through the centralised procedure, and discusses the application of the current regulations.

### A comparison of EMA and FDA decisions for new drug marketing applications 2014–2016: concordance, discordance, and why [^113aSYtR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Globalization of drug development has increased the need for harmonization and collaboration among drug regulatory authorities. 1 As such, activities and decisions of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are often compared, particularly regarding the time it takes to review marketing applications. 2, 3, 4 However, understanding differences in regulators' expectations for drug development and standards for assessment of efficacy and safety is critical to facilitating more global alignment while allowing for unique considerations of regional needs. Examination and comparison of decisions on applications may provide an understanding of how agencies consider and apply regulatory science. 5, 6, 7 To date, only a few comparisons of this type for the FDA and the EMA have been conducted, mostly qualitative and in specific therapeutic areas.

The FDA and the EMA are committed to further global alignment of sound regulatory standards in drug development, which ultimately link to assessment of marketing applications. Both participate in and have adopted guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH,), an organization whose aim is to facilitate harmonization across national and regional regulatory agencies to ensure safe, effective, and high‐quality drug products. 8 Over the past decade, under the auspices of their confidentiality agreements, both agencies have established forums for information sharing and collaboration around many aspects of medicinal drug product development and regulation through standing working groups. These "clusters" bring together technical experts to share information on topics such as plans for manufacturing or clinical site inspections, pediatric drug development, oncology products, pharmacogenomics, biostatistics, rare diseases, and vaccines. 9 The discussions on basics in regulatory science are a bedrock to facilitating alignment on high impact standards and approaches, even though specific development and decisions about marketing authorization for individual products must be made by the FDA and the EMA within their own legal and regulatory frameworks.

Our objective was to compare EMA and FDA decisions on new drug marketing applications over three calendar years (2014–2016) as a window to the impact of the agencies' activities in technical collaboration. We next examined applications for which the two agencies had differing outcomes in terms of approval and indication, assessing the scientific and regulatory reasons underlying these differences.

### Use of real-world data and evidence in drug development of medicinal products centrally authorized in Europe in 2018–2019 [^11167PhS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Real-world data/real-world evidence (RWD/RWE) are considered to have a great potential to complement, in some cases, replace the evidence generated through randomized controlled trials. By tradition, use of RWD/RWE in the postauthorization phase is well-known, whereas published evidence of use in the pre-authorization phase of medicines development is lacking. The primary aim of this study was to identify and quantify the role of potential use of RWD/RWE (RWE signatures) during the pre-authorization phase, as presented in the initial marketing authorization applications of new medicines centrally evaluated with a positive opinion in 2018–2019 (n = 111) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Data for the study was retrieved from the evaluation overviews of the European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs), which reflect the scientific conclusions of the assessment process and are accessible through the EMA website. RWE signatures were extracted into an RWE Data Matrix, including 11 categories divided over 5 stages of the drug development lifecycle. Nearly all EPARs included RWE signatures for the discovery (98.2%) and life-cycle management (100.0%). Half of them included RWE signatures for the full development phase (48.6%) and for supporting regulatory decisions at the registration (46.8%), whereas over a third (35.1%) included RWE signatures for the early development. RWE signatures were more often seen for orphan and conditionally approved medicines. Oncology, hematology, and anti-infectives stood out as therapeutic areas with most RWE signatures in their full development phase. The findings bring unprecedented insights about the vast use of RWD/RWE in drug development supporting the regulatory decision making.

### Decision making under uncertainty: comparing regulatory and health technology assessment reviews of medicines in the United States and Europe [^114WXGbx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Regulators must balance the size of clinical benefits of medicines against their harmful effects, taking into account uncertainties in both measures. 1, 2, 3, 4 After regulatory approval, use of a drug will depend on its incremental clinically relevant effects in relation to already available treatments. Use will also depend on the willingness or ability to pay for the drug and coverage by insurers. The process of clinical and economic value assessment is formalized in Europe through evaluations by Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies. In the United States, it often relies on assessments of independent clinicians or organizations, or individual insurance plans.

Having to accept some uncertainties at approval is inherent to the limited information on benefits and risks available at the time of marketing authorization, but current trends suggest that drugs are being approved by regulators on the basis of testing in fewer patients and with fewer pivotal trials. 5, 6 In recent years, over two‐thirds of all trials submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not have an active comparator, and 20% did not have a comparator at all. 7 Furthermore, 59% of pivotal trials submitted to the FDA used surrogate measures as their primary trial end points. 8 In Europe, only 35% of oncology indications approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had evidence of survival benefits over available treatments. Uncertainties relating to the evidence of newly approved drugs can remain unresolved for multiple years. With a median follow‐up postapproval between 3 and 5.4 years, there was no evidence of survival benefits in 28–58% of approved oncology indications in the United States and Europe. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Correlation of surrogate measures with survival is often low. 15

### Access to innovative oncology medicines in Europe [^116RdQ8h]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of cancer will increase within the next 5 years up to 15 million patients per year worldwide with a further increasing tendency. Therefore, there is a requirement for more emphasis on cancer prevention, research and effective anticancer drugs including a rapid licensing and market availability for the patients. In the EU, the centralized procedure (CP) of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) is mandatory for marketing authorization for anticancer drugs. A CP will result in one marketing authorization for all Member States granted by the European Commission. At variance, numerous independent healthcare sys-tems are in operation across the EU, and each Health Technology Assessment (HTA) body follows its own methodologies and scientific value judgements in the assessment of the ad-ditional clinical benefit of a new anticancer drug. Payer organisations in the various member states consider these assessments to a varying degree as input in their pricing and reim-bursement negotiations. At the same time international reference pricing and parallel trade have an inherent tendency to establish rather uniform price levels across member states. Consequently, drug access for patients differs considerably within the EU. Initiatives to im-prove the interface between the different stakeholders are currently on the way, but are unlikely sufficient to overcome these fundamental problems.

### Withdrawn accelerated approvals for cancer indications in the United States: what is the marketing authorisation status in the EU? [^112YejUz]. The Lancet: Oncology (2023). High credibility.

As of April, 2023, 23 accelerated approvals for cancer indications granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1992 have been withdrawn from the US market, with 17 (74%) of 23 withdrawn in the past 3 years. The marketing authorisation status of these indications in the EU has not been reported. A review of relevant documents from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was done to investigate whether the accelerated approvals for cancer indications withdrawn by the FDA have a marketing authorisation in the EU to date, and to compare the approval history of these indications by the EMA and FDA. We found that, as of April 20, 2023, nine (39%) of 23 withdrawn accelerated approvals for cancer indications in the United States have a marketing authorisation in the EU for a similar indication. By comparison, only two conditional marketing authorisations for cancer indications have been withdrawn from the EU; both are no longer approved in the United States. These findings indicate a discrepancy in the approval policies between the FDA and EMA and imply either that some patient groups in the United States do not get access to relevant medical treatment, or that some patient groups in the EU are treated with medicine without a positive benefit-risk balance. These discrepancies could potentially be reduced by increased collaboration and information sharing between the two agencies.

### Assessment of food and drug administration-and European medicines agency-approved systemic oncology therapies and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life: a systematic review [^111sNDTh]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Despite the in-depth review of data by the FDA and EMA for drugs seeking regulatory approval, the majority of approvals are based on survival end points, with limited published QOL evidence available at the time of approval. While 40% of FDA and 58% of EMA approved indications evaluated in our study had publicly available QOL evidence, few indications met the ASCO-VF and/or ESMO-MCBS QOL bonus criteria (13% FDA and 21% EMA approvals, and 18% FDA and 25% EMA approvals, respectively), while even fewer met clinically meaningful improvements in QOL beyond MCID (6% FDA and 11% EMA approvals). Our results suggest that while few recently approved FDA and EMA oncology drugs have published evidence to suggest QOL improvement, even fewer of those that do show statistical improvement have evidence of clinically meaningful improvements.

There are numerous aspects of clinical benefit to consider when evaluating a drug seeking regulatory approval, including survival, QOL, toxicity, and strength of evidence. While end points that are of greatest value to patients should be of highest consideration by regulatory boards, our findings highlight a disconnect between what is meaningful and important to patients and what is being favorably approved by regulatory boards. Nonetheless, it should be noted that QOL measures may be inherently subjective in measurement, especially in open-label randomized trials, and vary widely across a population. Therefore a standardized approach to QOL evaluation across all trials designed to seek approval from regulatory agencies presents challenges.

While regulatory approvals are most frequently based on promising findings in surrogate end points for survival, of the 71 solid-tumor drugs approved by the FDA between 2002 and 2014, there were only modest improvements in median PFS and OS (2.5 and 2.1 months, respectively). A plethora of previously published work suggests that, overall, recently approved oncology drugs demonstrate limited clinically meaningful benefits based on total ASCO-VF and ESMO-MCBS scores. Of note, Saluja et alsuggest that such marginal improvements in overall clinical benefit as measured by the ASCO-VF and ESMO-MCBS are accompanied by substantial increases in cost over time. Our findings serve to extend previously published work suggesting that, when considering QOL alone, a fairly limited subset of recently approved oncology drugs achieve differences in QOL that can be considered clinically meaningful. These findings are especially concerning for patients with advanced disease. As the goals of care may evolve throughout the course of disease, QOL may become of greater importance for those treated with palliative intent.

### Assessment of food and drug administration-and European medicines agency-approved systemic oncology therapies and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life: a systematic review [^113Vi3MN]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that systemic oncology therapies are often approved by regulatory agencies without evidence to demonstrate QOL improvement. Notably, of those indications with evidence of statistical improvement in QOL, our results suggest that limited indications also have evidence of clinically meaningful improvements. Given the high value patients place on QOL end points, the scarcity of available and favorable QOL evidence for approved systemic oncology therapies should be recognized. This is especially important in the context of systemic therapy with palliative intent, as the goals of therapy may evolve over the course of disease to prioritize QOL over quantity of life.

RCTs should be encouraged to not only improve collection and reporting of QOL evidence, but to do so in a manner that provides informative evidence of meaningful clinical benefit, to aid in regulatory approval and clinical decision-making that best supports patient-centered care. In addition, regulatory agencies should seek to enhance consideration of QOL evidence as a more considerable constituent of their approval processes and requirements, to reflect evolving patient priorities.

### Cancer therapy approval timings, review speed, and publication of pivotal registration trials in the US and Europe, 2010–2019 [^116Xbjba]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Oncology therapy development is distinctive, receiving the highest proportions of expedited approvals by the FDA (eg, priority review, fast-track, and accelerated approval) and EMA (eg, accelerated assessment and conditional marketing authorization). Both FDA accelerated approval and EMA conditional marketing authorization support earlier approvals of medicines which address unmet medical needs based on surrogate end points that are expected to predict clinical efficacy in later confirmatory trials. Conditional marketing authorization in Europe is valid for 1 year and renewed annually to ensure market authorization holders are fulfilling specific obligations within defined timelines. Accelerated approval by the FDA is not subject to annual review, however, confirmatory trials must be completed within a specific timeframe. Although, many confirmatory studies are not completed until more than 3 years after initial approval. Over the past decade, each regulator has introduced additional programs, such as breakthrough designations (FDA) and PRIME (EMA), to further expedite drug development. Despite these initiatives, the median review time at both regulators for new oncology therapies has increased ((by 14 days at the FDA and by 74 days at the EMA) compared with 2003 to 2010. The FDA accelerated approval reduces median review time by 31 days, whereas EMA conditional marketing authorization increases median review time by 60 days, suggesting differing regulatory approaches to market authorization of new therapies lacking definitive clinical outcome data. The delay between European Commission adoption and positive CHMP opinion has remained relatively unchanged.

### Cancer therapy approval timings, review speed, and publication of pivotal registration trials in the US and Europe, 2010–2019 [^114bHyTZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The balance between shortening approval times, allowing oncology patients to receive therapies earlier, and ensuring treatments are safe and efficacious is delicate. Concerns about the efficacy of oncology therapies authorized by accelerated review and surrogate end points have been raised as only 20% of drugs approved with a surrogate end point later showed improvement in overall survival. In addition, previous studies have shown that drugs that receive accelerated approval by the FDA are twice as likely to receive a black box warning (defined as known serious risk) or withdrawn from market.

Despite differing review processes, there is considerable overlap and potential synergy to be gained by harmonizing therapy approval among the FDA, EMA, and other medicine regulators. The FDA participates in Project Orbis, a global collaborative review to facilitate faster patient access to innovative cancer therapies across multiple countries. This allows for concurrent submission, review, and regulatory action among partner countries (eg, Health Canada) and has approved several new oncology therapies. However, this project does not currently include the EMA.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^115rhEvL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

From 2004 to 2014, the EMA approved 56 new cancer drugs. Forty‐two (75%) were approved via a special regulatory program. Twenty‐five (45%) of these were approved for rare diseases, whereas 12 (21%) received conditional marketing authorization.

Collectively, 72 pivotal trials supported approval of the 56 cancer drugs. Approximately three‐quarters were randomized (52/72, 72%) and 42% used an active comparator (30/72). Most trials used surrogate measures such as tumor response or time‐to‐progression (29/72, 40%), or progression‐free survival (19/72, 26%), as the primary end point. Among the 24 trials with overall survival as the primary (or co‐primary) end point, the median improvement was 2.4 months (interquartile range (IQR): 1.4–3.8).

Among the 56 cancer drugs approved from 2004–2014, 45 (80%) were required to fulfill postmarketing requirements. Twenty‐one (47%) drugs approved with postmarketing requirements received a rare disease drug designation compared with two drugs (27%) without postmarketing requirements. Additionally, 12 (27%) drugs with postmarketing requirements received conditional marketing authorization (Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of cancer drugs approved with and without postmarketing requirements

Pivotal trials supporting the approval of cancer drugs with postmarketing requirements compared with pivotal trials for drugs without requirements were less likely to have randomized designs (41/61, 67% vs. 11/11, 100%), include active comparators (20/61, 33% vs. 10/11, 91%), or measure overall survival as the primary study end point (18/61, 30% vs. 6/11, 55%; Table 2).

### European medicines agency's priority medicines scheme at 2 Years: an evaluation of clinical studies supporting eligible drugs [^11444XjZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme was launched by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2016 to expedite the development and approval of promising products targeting conditions with high unmet medical need. Manufacturers of PRIME drugs receive extensive regulatory advice on their trial designs. Until June 2018, the EMA granted PRIME status to 39 agents, evaluated in 138 studies (102 initiated before and 36 after PRIME eligibility). A third of the studies forming the basis of PRIME designation were randomized controlled trials, and a quarter of the studies were blinded. There was no statistically significant difference between trials initiated before and after PRIME designation in terms of randomized design and use of blinding. However, significantly more efficacy studies included a clinical end point after PRIME designation than before, and significantly fewer included surrogate measures alone. There were no statistically significant differences between the trial designs of PRIME and non-PRIME-designated products.

### Financial challenges of being on long-term, high-cost medications [^111eFvQo]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Europe

In Europe, drugs can be approved through 3 different regulatory procedures including centralized, decentralized, and national/individual approvals. The centralized approval process is through the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which coordinates and streamlines the drug approval process through the countries in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). The decentralized procedure refers to a simultaneous application and approval in several countries, but not the entire EU or EEA, while national procedures involve approving a drug in an individual country. Each of these procedures follows a similar process of a drug application to that of the FDA — Phase 1, 2, and 3 testing, followed by formal review — although the bar for regulatory approval and regulatory approaches frequently diverge.

Analogous to the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, the EMA utilizes a pathway called conditional approval for promising drugs with preliminary evidence of effectiveness for unmet medical needs, including in oncology. Drugs are priced through a combination of regulations and negotiation guided by HTAs, unlike in the United States, which utilizes a market-driven approach. For example, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evaluates the cost-effectiveness of approved medications and provides recommendations to the National Health Service (NHS). This analysis calculates the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by the new drug. Drug sponsors and companies submit economic models to justify the use of drugs. NICE also consults with stakeholders including patient groups, clinicians, and scientists. NICE then submits a report for guidance to the NHS with a recommendation to either use the drug at its manufacturer-specified price, use the drug but at a lower price, or not use the drug. While these recommendations are not binding, the NHS normally follows the guidance of NICE. For drugs that are expensive but still cost-effective, NICE may negotiate a patient access scheme with the drug manufacturer. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor commonly used in recurrent glioblastoma, was not deemed cost-effective and is therefore not covered by the NHS. In 2016, to cater to increasingly expensive cancer drugs, the British Government established the Cancer Drugs Fund, which offers interim funding to "provide access to promising new treatments, via managed access arrangement, while further evidence is collected to address clinical uncertainty".

### 21st century pharmacovigilance: efforts, roles, and responsibilities [^113BSR2W]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

In an era when the number of expedited and conditional review pathways for newly available brand-name drugs and biosimilar medicines to treat serious and life-threatening diseases is increasing, defining pharmacovigilance has never been more crucial. 21st century pharmacovigilance is not merely about uncovering, reporting, and addressing adverse events associated with already approved and marketed agents, but can be described as the systematic monitoring of the process of pre-market review and post-market surveillance, which includes the use of medicines in everyday practice. Pharmacovigilance identifies previously unrecognised adverse events or changes in the patterns of these effects, the quality and adequacy of drug supply, and should ensure effective communication with the public, health-care professionals, and patients about the optimum safety and effective use of medicines. In this paper, the first in a Series of three about drug safety in oncology, we discuss evolving challenges in the purview, roles, and responsibilities of the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency with respect to pharmacovigilance efforts, with a special emphasis on oncology treatment.

### Added benefit and revenues of oncology drugs approved by the European medicines agency between 1995 and 2020: retrospective cohort study [^114zXaJJ]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Health policy implications of findings

Creating regulatory incentives to effectively promote development of the most effective drugs for patients with the greatest needs is complex. On the one hand, approval might be expedited because drugs are expected to address unmet medical needs, while on the other hand, they more frequently create difficulties showing added benefits, potentially leading to negative added benefit ratings and lower revenues. Further collaboration on the interface of regulation and reimbursement is therefore needed to explore opportunities to more appropriately incentivise development of the most beneficial drugs addressing the most pressing unmet needs. In this context, it is noteworthy that the proposals for the reformed EU pharmaceutical legislation contain a definition of high unmet medical need based on morbidity and mortality reductions, ranging from meaningful to substantial. Our study's results align with and support this definition, enabling the accurate identification of treatments addressing the most critical needs. Connecting this definition to regulatory incentives, such as market exclusivity, becomes crucial in effectively fostering the development of these essential drugs. Our study further underscores that almost all oncology drugs, even those lacking added benefits, manage to recover their estimated R&D costs. Consequently, we strongly advocate for a more thorough understanding of added benefit assessments and expedited pathways by formulary committees and to investigate the apparent discrepancy between assessed added benefit and (extent of) appropriate use in clinical practice.

### From the European medicines agency to project orbis: new activities and challenges to facilitate UK oncology drug approval following brexit [^114cKRmH]. The Lancet: Oncology (2023). High credibility.

The departure of the UK from the European Union (EU) and affiliated European regulatory bodies, including the European Medicines Agency, on Dec 31, 2020, has resulted in the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency becoming an independent national regulator. This change has required a fundamental transformation of the UK drug regulatory landscape, creating both opportunities and challenges for future development of oncology drugs. New UK pharmaceutical policies have sought to make the UK an attractive market for drug development and regulatory review, by offering expedited review pathways coupled to strong collaborative relations with other leading international medicines regulators, outside of Europe. Oncology is a key global therapy area for both drug development and regulatory approval, and the UK Government has been keen to show regulatory innovation and international collaboration through approval of new cancer medicines. In this Policy Review, we examine the new UK regulatory frameworks, policies, and global collaborations affecting new oncology drug approvals after departure from the EU. We explore some of the challenges that might lie ahead as the UK creates new and independent regulatory review and approval processes for the next generation of cancer medicines.

### A comparison of EMA and FDA decisions for new drug marketing applications 2014–2016: concordance, discordance, and why [^112q2M9p]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have robust scientific and technical collaborations. As a window to the impact of these activities we compared the agencies' decisions on drug marketing applications. Decisions were compared for 107 new drug applications with a regulatory outcome at both agencies in the period 2014–2016. Further analysis addressed individual applications for which the agencies had differing outcomes in terms of marketing approval, type of approval, and approved indication, including reasons underlying differences. The EMA and the FDA had high concordance (91–98%) in decisions on marketing approvals. Divergence in approval decisions, type of approval, and approved indication were primarily due to differences in agencies' conclusions about efficacy based on review of the same data or differing clinical data submitted to support the application. This high rate of concordance suggests that engagement and collaboration on regulatory science has a positive impact.

### Transparency in European medicines agency and US food and drug administration decision making: is It possible to identify the rationale for divergences in approved indication from public assessment reports? [^111rXYEj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although it cannot be expected that different medicines' regulatory agencies always reach the same review outcome, it is important that decision making is documented and communicated to ensure transparency. This study examines whether justification for divergences between the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding approved indications could be identified from the agencies' public assessment reports (PARs). We focused on 9 products previously identified to have been submitted simultaneously to both agencies with the same indication but had a different indication approved; there were 15 differences in indications. Our analysis confirms that the rationale for observed divergent indication decisions was predominantly found in the benefit-risk section of the PAR (9 of 15 cases for the FDA and 10 of 15 for the EMA). If not found in the benefit-risk section, the rationale for these decisions was found in other PAR sections (eg, labeling or clinical efficacy section) or not at all. Our study found a small number of inconsistencies or gaps in how, where, and whether regulatory decision making on approved indications are documented by the FDA and the EMA. We believe it is important for regulators to standardize their approach and systematically and transparently document their rationale for the approved indication, using a structured benefit-risk assessment format within the PAR. This process is especially important for innovative products for which experience in evaluating similar products worldwide is limited, particularly as agencies are striving to build effective regulatory processes by leveraging assessments by trusted reference agencies through approaches such as reliance. Clear and systematic communication and documentation of the decisions in the PAR are central and should continue to evolve as a best practice; an enabling step toward this would be a harmonized PAR template for use by agencies globally.

### Early market access of cancer drugs in the EU [^116oZLj3]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Patient access to new cancer drugs in the EU involves centralised licensing decisions by regulators as well as reimbursement recommendations in the context of national healthcare systems. Differences in assessment criteria and evidence requirements may result in divergent decisions at central and national levels, ultimately compromising effective access to patients. Early access decisions are particularly challenging due to the limited clinical evidence available to conclude on the benefit-risk and relative (cost-) effectiveness of new high-priced cancer drugs. We describe mechanisms to accelerate approval of promising anticancer drugs that fulfil an unmet medical need, review the experience from the European Medicines Agency, compare timelines and outcomes of reimbursement decisions in major EU markets, and discuss shortcomings of the current system, ongoing initiatives, and future steps to facilitate effective early access.

### Expedited approval in oncology: a study of European regulators' perspectives and trade-offs [^114wvs6H]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Expedited approvals, such as "conditional approval" in the EU or "accelerated approval" in the United States, enable the authorization of promising new drugs or drug indications before "comprehensive data" are available. These marketing authorizations can be used in situations of high unmet medical needs when the potential benefits of early access outweigh the risks associated with the incomplete evidence.

In the EU, where this provision applies to new drugs rather than supplemental indications, approximately half of all conditional approvals have involved new drug applications for oncology indications, with around 5% of new cancer drug approvals granted on a conditional basis. In the United States, where the provision applies to both initial and supplemental indications, about 85% of accelerated approvals in the last decade were for cancer product indications. From 1992 to 2017, 35% of cancer product indications received accelerated approval. While expedited approvals of oncology drugs offer rapid access to patients with unmet needs, direct evidence to quantify treatment effects is often lagging behind. Moreover, despite limited proven added benefit, many of these drugs recoup R&D costs quickly, raising questions about reimbursement practices not aligned with uncertainties about benefit estimates.

In the EU, a conditional approval may be granted when a medicine meets specific criteria, including a positive benefit–risk balance, the likelihood of comprehensive post‐authorisation data, fulfillment of an unmet medical need, and the immediate benefit to patients outweighing the risks of incomplete data. These authorisations are valid for 1 year and can be renewed annually. The holder must meet specific obligations within defined timelines, such as completing studies or collecting additional data to confirm the medicine's benefit–risk balance remains positive.

Expedited approval in oncology is typically granted based on incomplete evidence of efficacy, which is instead inferred from the frequency of objective response (tumor shrinkage) and corroborating evidence such as mechanism of action, duration, and quality of response, and other clinical and nonclinical data. The motivation that prompted this study was to describe attitudes and attributes that may impact regulatory decisions for expedited approval. We asked clinical assessors from the EMA network of assessors about their general attitudes about expedited approvals and to state the convincingness of hypothetical drug application scenarios consisting of different combinations of objective response rate, toxicity, and expected timing of confirmatory trials. Overall, the study highlighted differences in attitudes about expedited approvals and an opportunity for increased communication about uncertainties to doctors and patients and greater alignment on evidentiary standards.

Objectives and characteristics of postmarketing requirements

We identified 200 postmarketing requirements for the 45 cancer drugs. The median number per drug was 3 (IQR 2–6). Table 3 shows the most common objective was for the evaluation of safety (94, 47%). The complete list of postmarketing requirements is provided in Table S2.

Table 3
Characteristics, status, and objective of cancer drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency with postmarketing requirements, 2004–2014

Most postmarketing requirements (125/200, 62%) were for retrospective secondary analyses or data from ongoing clinical trials. Fourteen drugs had only retrospective data collection requirements, whereas the remaining 31 were associated with 75 prospective postmarketing studies. Nine of the 31 drugs with requirements for new clinical studies were approved with conditional marketing authorization. Among 75 prospective postmarketing studies requested by the EMA, 72% (54/75) detailed interventional studies (clinical trials in which patients were to be assigned to an intervention via randomized or non‐randomized allocation) and 28% (21/75) observational studies (pharmacovigilance studies, registries, cohort studies, and case–control studies).

Information on the design characteristics of postmarketing studies is presented in Table 4. Among interventional study requirements for drugs with conditional marketing authorization, 19% (5/27) included requirements for randomized allocation of treatments, 7% (2/27) for double‐blinding, 15% (4/27) for using an active comparator, and 4% (1/27) for including overall survival as the primary study end point.

Drug approval processes

Many of the processes to approve drugs in the EU are similar to those of the FDA (Figure 1). An investigator of a proposed pharmaceutical first obtains pre-authorization for use of the drug in clinical trials. All European clinical trials were regulated under the Clinical Trials Directive of the European Commission (2001/20/EC), later repealed and replaced in 2014 by Regulation No. 536/2014 of the European Parliament.

After clinical trials, FDA drug approvals follow a centralized path, whereas European approval can occur through 4 different paths, depending on the nature of the drug and the preference of the manufacturer. EIND = emergency investigational new drug; EMA = European Medicines Agency; EU = European Union; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; IND = investigational new drug.

The drug then progresses through sequential studies analogous to those in the United States: Phase I trials conducted in a small number of healthy subjects to clarify pharmacology and dose range, Phase II trials conducted in several hundred patients with the target condition to investigate the dose-response relationship, and Phase III confirmatory trials in several hundred to several thousand patients to substantiate safety and efficacy. As in the United States, the EC provides means for approving "orphan drugs", or those that treat conditions that affect so few people that randomized controlled trials may be impossible to complete. There are also methods for obtaining conditional approval for drugs to be used in emergency conditions, or other conditional approvals.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) was formed in 1995 with funding from the EU, pharmaceutical industry, and member states. The EMA was charged with harmonizing processes in the member state regulatory agencies to reduce annual costs to drug companies (that previously were required to obtain separate approvals in each member state) as well as to eliminate competition-restricting regulation in sovereign states. However, the EMA does not oversee all drug approvals the way the FDA does in the United States. In Europe, there are 4 routes by which a drug can be approved, depending on the drug class and manufacturer preference.

Centralized process

The centralized process is controlled through the EMA. Every member state of the EU is represented on the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products, which issues a single license valid in all EU member states. This route of approval is mandatory for some classes of drugs, such as treatments for HIV/AIDS, oncology, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disease, and viral diseases.

### Assessment of food and drug administration-and European medicines agency-approved systemic oncology therapies and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life: a systematic review [^114toBGt]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

For patients with cancer treated with palliative intent, quality of life (QOL) is a critical aspect of treatment decision-making, alongside survival. However, regulatory approval can be based solely on survival measures or antitumor activities, without QOL evidence.

Objective

To investigate whether recently approved oncology therapies demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in QOL.

Evidence Review

This systematic review study identified oncology drug indications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) from January 2006 to December 2017 and supporting clinical trials (QOL publications identified to October 2019). Indications were evaluated for the presence of published QOL evidence; QOL benefits according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework version 2.0 (ASCO-VF) and European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale version 1.1 (ESMO-MCBS) QOL bonus criteria; and clinically meaningful improvements in QOL beyond minimal clinically important differences. Hematology trials were not evaluated by ESMO-MCBS. Associations between QOL evidence and approval year were examined using logistic regression models.

Findings

In total, 214 FDA-approved (77 [36%] hematological) and 170 EMA-approved (52 [31%] hematological) indications were included. QOL evidence was published for 40% and 58% of FDA- and EMA-approved indications, respectively. QOL bonus criterion for ASCO-VF and ESMO-MCBS was met in 13% and 17% of FDA-approved and 21% and 24% of EMA-approved indications, respectively. Clinically meaningful improvements in QOL beyond minimal clinically important differences were noted in 6% and 11% of FDA- and EMA-approved indications, respectively. Availability of published QOL evidence at the time of approval increased over time for EMA (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; p = 0.03), however not for FDA (OR, 1.10; p = 0.12). Over time, no increase in awarded QOL bonuses or clinically meaningful improvements in QOL were found.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this systematic review suggest that approved systemic oncology therapies often do not have published evidence to suggest QOL improvement, despite its recognized importance. Of indications with evidence of statistical improvement, few have demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements.

### Access to innovative oncology medicines in Europe [^11151RWV]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 3.
EMA - HTA parallel scientific advice. Eventiary requirements in an oncologic case study (adapted from Britta Paschen, EMA/HTA workshop 2013;) (PRO = patient reported outcome; SAWP = Scientific advice working party; HTA = Health technology assessment).

However, even if we could have a common EU HTA agency to establish one European Assessment procedure and subsequently a common price, it remains uncertain whether this would enhance access to cancer medicines. The key bottleneck is that Public Health is a national sovereignty matter at this time. All EU countries therefore initiate their own bureaucracy to manage health care costs. At present, this uses a form of HTA assessment to localise the value debate. If an EU price would be determined, then the focus will move to reimbursement and this would shift the bureaucracy and the debate. Even once national reimbursements are given the debate in many states moves to the regions since they have devolved budgets to the country regions. Thus, it is a far too sweeping statement to say that, by encouraging a pan EU price, it would improve access as it may just shift the debate.

In lack of a common EU health care system, of course, some aspects of the evaluation have still to be taken at the country level due to economical differences and different health care systems, but the initiatives may help to overcome some inequities in access to innovative oncological drugs due to different assessment criteria. In general, there is a need for a better science-based common position on methodology, greater commitments by politicians and health care decision makers to ensure a widely equal access as feasible for patients across the EU to innovative anti-tumour medicines.

### European medicines agency perspective on oncology study design for marketing authorization and beyond [^114QnYwm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

In the development of highly active anticancer drugs, the European situation may be viewed as paradoxical. Limited data may support marketing authorization, but may be insufficient for the health economic appraisal needed for reimbursement and market uptake. To achieve this, conventional confirmatory studies may be needed. For products of special interest, studies aimed at optimizing cost-effectiveness may be warranted. Efficient designs of studies to meet these objectives constitute challenges to all stakeholders.

### A comparison of EMA and FDA decisions for new drug marketing applications 2014–2016: concordance, discordance, and why [^111K36cV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings should be considered within the limitations of the study. The cohort covered a short time period and results reflect prevalent therapeutic areas such as oncology (25% of cohort). This field has undergone an explosion of new research and factors that impact marketing authorization decisions, such as identification of new treatment subpopulations and consideration of acceptable endpoints in clinical trials in addition to the already mentioned emphasis on use of expedited development pathways. Our cohort also did not include blood products, vaccines, or regenerative medicines, a decision made simply because most previous comparisons have also excluded these, but it is an area that could be interesting for future exploration.

Some might consider it limiting that determination of reasons for agency discordance was based solely on information in EMA and FDA written reviews. We did not include other documents as primary sources of information, such as FDA or EMA Scientific Advisory Committee meeting minutes, nor did we systematically interview agency staff. Nevertheless, EMA European Public Assessment Reports and FDA reviews are official records documenting the agencies' rationale for regulatory decisions, and we found them complete and informative. Reading them revealed striking similarities in how the agencies approached the same information, including assumptions, questions, and contextual considerations. We did not evaluate whether the two agencies' experts convened to discuss development programs or applications under review. This would have been most informative if we compared concordant outcomes, a more complex exploration. We do know that such discussions during 2014–2016 were not the norm, other than perhaps for some oncology application reviews.

We did not assess divergence between the EMA and the FDA with respect to labeled contraindications or other limitations of use, risk minimization requirements, and requirements for postapproval safety and efficacy studies. We concluded that such analyses would be minimally informative on such a broad scale, as the two agencies have distinctly different labeling practices and regulatory authorities in these areas. For example, whereas the EMA can require applicants to conduct postauthorization studies to further evaluate efficacy of any drug, the FDA can only require confirmatory trials for drugs under accelerated approval.

Lastly, we did not systematically compare order, timing, duration of application reviews, or time to approval across the two agencies. Although in some cases differential timing of submissions clearly influenced a small number of regulatory outcomes, in those cases it mostly reflected data availability or maturity. We believe evaluation of the rationale for differences in regulatory decision making is more informative for understanding regulatory science and the impact and direction of our collaborative regulatory efforts.

### Patient-reported outcome measures in oncology drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2017–2021 [^113NtmPD]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that 1 in 5 of the marketing authorizations for oncology medications still does not comprehensively assess information collected directly from patients. One limiation of this study is that our methods do not allow for back-tracing inclusion of PROMs in clinical trials supporting each marketing authorization submission, nor assessing the quality of these data.

More guidance on data quality, standardization of measures, and better harmonization of methods would facilitate the consideration of PROMs at all stages in the drug development process.

### Cancer therapy approval timings, review speed, and publication of pivotal registration trials in the US and Europe, 2010–2019 [^114oPMRq]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We found that drug manufacturers continue to submit regulatory documents earlier to the FDA than the EMA. This may be partly driven by the greater market share and higher cost of new oncology therapies in the US compared with Europe. Notably, although 72% of manufacturers submitted new market authorization applications to the FDA before the EMA, this has fallen slightly from 80% reported between 2003 and 2010. Submissions to the EMA and FDA are typically based on the same clinical trials, however, submission to the EMA contained more complete and less preliminary data due to later submission times.

An important consequence of early approval of therapies is uncertainty regarding appropriate use and overall benefit. For example, if a drug is approved prior to publication of the pivotal registration clinical trial, clinicians do not have complete information regarding the overall safety and efficacy. This can potentially put patients at risk in terms of patient selection for therapy and toxicity management. Furthermore, drugs approved using expedited approval pathways may be approved without randomized data and/or the use of surrogate end points, therefore leaving uncertainty regarding overall clinical benefit. The relative concordance in therapies approved by both regulators using expedited pathways suggests similarities in market authorization applications. However, the lower number of new oncology therapies receiving conditional marketing authorization and higher median review times suggests the EMA may have a more cautious approach to use. Furthermore, some drugs approved by the accelerated approval pathway have been subsequently pulled from the market after the confirmatory trial failed to show benefit (eg, durvalumab), and others have shown that confirmatory trials are often delayed and sometimes not completed at all.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^1168MRdp]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Status of postmarketing requirements

We used multiple publicly available regulatory documents to verify the completion of postmarketing requirements. This included renewal assessments available through the European Union register of medicinal products for human use, the summary of product characteristics, which includes a detailed clinical summary of information for each approved drug, and the "procedural steps taken and scientific information after the authorization" from the European public assessment report, which details changes that are introduced after the initial marketing authorization.

The status of postmarketing requirements was categorized as of December 31, 2019, according to the following criteria: first, if postmarketing requirements from the initial approval or subsequent renewal assessments were removed from the risk management plan or the list of conditions for granting marketing authorization, we categorized these as completed. We also categorized requirements as completed if new information was added to the summary of product characteristics that appeared to indicate that the requirements had been fulfilled. Second, if requirements were not yet complete but still within the timeframe requested by the EMA, these were categorized as ongoing. If there was no prespecified date of completion in the risk management plan and the requirements were not yet complete by the end of our study period, we categorized these as ongoing. Third, if postmarketing requirements had passed the requested timeframe and were not completed, or if the initial timeframe had been extended, we categorized these as delayed. Detailed examples of how we categorized postmarketing requirements are provided in Box S1.

Objective of postmarketing requirements

Postmarketing requirements were categorized as follows: efficacy (tumor response or disease progression, overall survival, or quality of life), safety (pharmacovigilance), pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, dosing, or others. When the study objective was not specified or was not clearly identifiable based on key terms (e.g. efficacy, safety, dosing, and pharmacokinetics), we categorized these requirements as relating to efficacy and safety.

Characteristics of clinical trials

We also documented the characteristics of pivotal studies and postmarketing requirements. Design features included treatment allocation (randomized or single arm), blinding (double‐blind, single blind, or open label), comparators (active, placebo, self, none), enrollment, and the primary study end point. Features not included in regulatory documents were verified by searching.

### Are the European medicines agency, US food and drug administration, and other international regulators talking to each other? [^113LLZSZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Clusters

Although informal collaboration had existed before, in 2003, the FDA and the EMA signed a memorandum of understanding and a confidentiality agreement that allow commercial confidential information, but not trade secrets, to be shared across agencies. 4 More recently, an expanded confidentiality commitment was signed by the European Union and the FDA, allowing for sharing of full inspection reports, including trade secret information. 5, 6 The first formal EMA‐FDA cluster was established in 2004 to discuss oncology‐hematology medicines. Over the years, more clusters have been added and these expert groups have grown in participation within the two agencies, then with inclusion of other regulatory agencies with which the EMA and the FDA have confidentiality arrangements. 4 Regular interactions are held on topics or issues where scientific collaboration and intensified exchange of information are necessary in the opinion of a participating agency (Figure 1). Each cluster has a slightly different way of operating but always builds on a core team of experts with ad hoc participants brought to the table depending on the topics under discussion. Core participants may be scientific experts, reviewers, regulatory affairs experts, international affairs staff, or managers. Meetings are organized as teleconferences with frequency and duration established by each cluster. Over the years, clusters have been created to cover many therapeutic areas or types of products, including as diverse topics as advance therapies, biosimilars, pediatric medicine development, rare diseases, and patient engagement. They provide a forum to share emerging regulatory science matters, discuss difficult product development, or review issues faced by one or more of the agencies. The discussions are a window to understanding differences in approach and perspectives across regions, even though harmonization is not always the objective. The robust participation, most simply illustrated by the number of clusters operating, affirms that agencies perceive benefit from such exchanges, especially as the complexity of medicine development increases. Not only does information sharing itself create new understandings and value, it provides a form of peer review among fellow regulators, which few other forums can.

### Regulatory and clinical consequences of negative confirmatory trials of accelerated approval cancer drugs: retrospective observational study [^1116NoGk]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

To assess the consequences of regulatory actions or negative confirmatory trial results on clinical practice, we searched the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to determine the recommendation for each accelerated approval indication on 12 May 2021. The NCCN guidelines are the most comprehensive and highly used clinical practice guidelines in oncology and serve as one of five compendia used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to make decisions on coverage.NCCN recommendation categories include category 1 (high level of evidence, uniform NCCN consensus), category 2A (lower level of evidence, uniform NCCN consensus), category 2B (lower level of evidence, NCCN consensus), and category 3 (any level of evidence, NCCN disagreement). We also noted the date when the latest revision of the NCCN guidelines was published relative to the date of the availability of negative confirmatory evidence. The NCCN guidelines also indicate whether a certain indication's recommendation category has been changed or removed compared with the previous version of the guidelines.

On 27–29 April 2021, the FDA held a meeting of the Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) to discuss six of the accelerated approvals that had failed to improve the primary endpoint in the confirmatory trials and vote on what regulatory actions might be appropriate. The FDA is not bound by recommendations from its advisory committees but usually follows them. We also included the outcome of that ODAC meeting vote for each indication. Finally, to provide a comparison of the FDA's approach to these drugs with those of international regulators, we searched for each drug in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) database and assessed whether each drug had received marketing authorisation by the EMA for the given indication.

Patient and public involvement

Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of this study, as this was a study conducted solely from publicly available records. However, this study was inspired by listening to patient advocates' and public voices and confusions in several media about the accelerated approval process for cancer drugs. During our talks/seminars, we have spoken to several members of the patient community who suggested that we pursue this work for clarification of the evidence base for cancer drugs that receive accelerated approval from the US FDA.

### Methodological insights on biomarker-based patient selection: a review of scientific advice procedures at the European medicines agency [^117BJwik]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Biomarkers play a crucial role in patient selection and enrollment of trial participants. At the time of initiating a clinical trial, there is often uncertainty about whether a biomarker is predictive or prognostic, and this ambiguity should be accounted for in the trial design. Currently, there is no dedicated regulatory guidance from EMA on biomarker‐based patient selection. However, drug developers can seek advice from EMA on their proposed drug development program, including biomarker‐based patient selection, through Scientific Advice procedures.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

This review aimed to identify commonly encountered methodological points for discussion on biomarker‐based patient selection between drug developers and EMA during Scientific Advice procedures.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

This review provides an overview of methodological considerations related to predictive and prognostic biomarkers discussed during Scientific Advice procedures between EMA and drug developers. A quantitative summary of key characteristics of the development programs characterizes areas where biomarker‐based patient selection plays an important role. A qualitative description highlights findings from the Scientific Advice procedures on selected methodological topics, such as the cutoff selection for continuous biomarkers and study design considerations.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

The findings of this review highlight common points of discussion on biomarker‐based patient selection. Practical recommendations are given which can inform and improve future dialogues between drug developers and regulators on the topic.

Principles guiding medicines development are constantly evolving due to technological and scientific progress. Research developments over the past years have paved the way toward a more patient‐centered approach to medicines development, coining the term of "personalized medicines", which is described in by the European Union law as "a medical model using characterisation of individuals' phenotypes and genotypes (e.g. molecular profiling, medical imaging, lifestyle data) for tailoring the right therapeutic strategy for the right person at the right time, and/or to determine the predisposition to disease and/or to deliver timely and targeted prevention". The terms precision medicine, stratified medicine, and personalized medicine are often used interchangeably.

### Assessment of food and drug administration-and European medicines agency-approved systemic oncology therapies and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life: a systematic review [^114pTKPJ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

Characteristics of Included Trials

Two-hundred and fourteen FDA- and 170 EMA-approved indications were included. Of these, 77 FDA-approved indications (36%) and 52 EMA-approved indications (31%) were hematological malignant neoplasms. One-hundred and fourteen identified trials were cited as evidence for both FDA and EMA approvals. Characteristics of included indications are outlined in Table 1.

Table 1.
Characteristics of Included Indications

Abbreviations: EMA, European Medicines Agency; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration.

Published QOL evidence at the time of regulatory approval was available in 31 of 214 FDA-approved indications (14%) and 44 of 170 EMA-approved indications (26%). Considering all published QOL evidence to our selected cutoff date, 85 of 214 FDA-approved indications (40%) and 99 of 170 and EMA-approved indications (58%) had published QOL evidence (Figure 1). All indications with reported QOL evidence were in a noncurative setting.

### Access to innovative oncology medicines in Europe [^113fDTBA]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Other methods, as practiced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK and the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV), make use of health economic analyses, which result in the comparison of costs per quality-adjusted life-year estimates to the threshold. Further European countries and their criteria taken into account in the evaluation of health technologies can be found in Figure 1. Those variations in HTA procedures affect the time needed by a new cancer drug to step to the market and lead to divergent prices in different countries. Prices proposed by HTA bodies and agreed by payer organisations may, in combination with other commercial considerations — e.g. market size and availability of competing products, prevent MAHs from marketing their products in some Member States. As a result, inequality of patients' access to medicines in the EU persists — in spite of the 20th anniversary of the EMA and the expansion of the mandatory scope of the centralised authorisation procedure.

Figure 1.
Heterogeneity of evaluation parameters of health technology agencies across Europe (AT = Austria, BE = Belgium, CH = Switzerland, DE = Germany, FI = Finland, NL = Netherlands, NO = Norway, SE = Sweden, UK = United Kingdom).

The development of a truly European HTA procedure, which links the knowledge of regulatory authorities and HTA bodies together, may be an important step towards a more equal access of European patients to innovative medicines. The regulatory assessment of the benefit–risk based on the evaluation of the pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy should be a plausible first building block for the subsequent work of HTA bodies. At the time of marketing authorisation, the efficacy and safety data gathered during drug development, which has been the basis of the preceding regulatory approval process, is all information available to determine the effectiveness of a drug.

### Weighing of evidence by health technology assessment bodies: retrospective study of reimbursement recommendations for conditionally approved drugs [^113UbgjQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmaceutical regulation needs to protect patients from harm due to ineffective or unsafe drugs, without unnecessarily delaying patient access to safe and effective medicines. 1, 2 To balance these interests, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has implemented the Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) in 2006 to speed up patient access to medicines. A CMA can be provided for medicines that fulfill unmet medical needs for patients, in which the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risks of increased uncertainty, and when it is likely that more comprehensive data will become available at a later stage. 3 The EMA will require the manufacturer to commit to performing postmarketing studies, but analyses of obligatory studies showed that more than half were completed with a substantial delay or not at all. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 An evaluation of the EMA oncology approvals in 2009–2013 demonstrated that, at a minimum of 3.3 years after market entry, there was still no solid evidence that these drugs improved or extended life. 11 Therefore, it can be questioned whether the more limited evidence package for medicines approved via expedited regulatory pathways is resolved through postauthorization studies. This emphasizes the importance of investigating downstream effects of expedited approvals.

Common evidence limitations for conditional approval drugs are the use of surrogate end points and uncontrolled studies. Although the impact of using surrogate end points for approvals has been extensively studied, 12, 13, 14, 15 less is known about approvals based on uncontrolled evidence only, even though they represent a significant proportion of drug approvals, including CMAs. 16 An analysis of the EMA oncology approvals between 1995 and 2004 showed that for 48% of indications, no phase III comparative clinical trial was available. 17 During 1999–2014, the EMA approved 44 indications solely on the basis of uncontrolled studies, whereas 9 applications with only uncontrolled data were rejected. During the same period, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 60 indications based on solely uncontrolled studies, rejecting only one. 18 Although approvals with solely uncontrolled studies represent a substantial proportion of regulatory approvals, little is known about their downstream impact.

### The advisory process for anticancer drug regulation: a global perspective [^112avEnR]. Annals of Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

This paper summarizes the role of external advisors in oncology drug development and regulation from a global perspective.

Design

Recently, representatives from the United States Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Health Canada held a meeting in conjunction with the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. The role of external advisors in oncology drug development and regulation in each of these jurisdictions was presented and discussed.

Results

All regulatory bodies described have experience with two forms of outside expertise: advice from individual experts and advice from a group of experts assembled as an advisory group. Regulatory jurisdictions use individual experts variably. In some regions, individual experts provide advice based on knowledge and experience during the drug development phase or in the planning phase for the submission of a drug registration package. In other regions, these individuals serve as external evaluators with the primary responsibility for the review of a clinical trials package submitted for drug registration. Advisory boards have been formalized in all jurisdictions discussed. Advisory boards have a role in discussing specific applications as well as broad policy issues. A common theme is a composition of a core panel of experts with augmentation by additional expertise as needed for consideration of specific scientific questions. In all jurisdictions, advisory board recommendations are not binding on the regulatory body.

Conclusions

Global oncology drug development and registration involves the use of experts by regulatory authorities. The types of experts needed, the expert's role and the transparency of the advisory process reflect the individual needs in different regions.

### Post-marketing requirements for cancer drugs approved by the European medicines agency, 2004–2014 [^111ukruD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Cohort identification

We used the EMA website to identify new molecular entities with an anatomic therapeutic chemical classification code covering antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (L01) approved from 2004–2014. We excluded generics, non‐therapeutic agents, pediatric indications, and supplemental indication extensions of existing drugs ("type 2 variations").

Identification of postmarketing requirements

We identified postmarketing requirements from European public assessment reports at the time of first marketing authorization and from annual or 5‐year renewal assessment reports. Postmarketing requirements are included in the "summary of product characteristics" or listed in the risk management plan along with the details and anticipated completion dates of these requirements. At the 5‐year mark, the EMA decides based on the submitted evidence whether to grant permanent marketing authorization or request further data for safety or efficacy ("grounds for one additional renewal").

We accessed European public assessment reports corresponding to renewal assessment dates published until December 31, 2019, via the European Union register of medicinal products for human use. If the public assessment report corresponding to the renewal assessment date was unavailable, the most recent complete assessment following the renewal was used, such as the modification, corrigendum, or variation assessment report. We extracted requirements relating to the collection of additional data on efficacy or safety from public assessment reports. We excluded "routine pharmacovigilance activities", but included pharmacovigilance studies specifically requested in the risk management plan as non‐routine activities or when they were affiliated with another postmarketing requirement (e.g. collection of pharmacovigilance data from an ongoing or requested study). Two investigators (authors A.C. and M.S.K.) independently extracted data for postmarketing requirements and the marketing authorization status for half of drugs to ensure high internal agreement. Differences were resolved through discussion and consensus among the investigators.

### A comparison of EMA and FDA decisions for new drug marketing applications 2014–2016: concordance, discordance, and why [^111ztZVr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

We observed remarkable similarity in the basic scientific and data interpretation issues raised by the FDA and the EMA during reviews of the same applications. Specifically, most of the FDA's second cycle approvals (i.e. approvals after resubmission of the applications) were based on submission by the sponsor of the same additional data that EMA had received during its initial review either from the start or following request after clock‐stops. We did not compare agency times from first submission to approval of the marketing applications to assess the impact of these differences in procedures.

The only therapeutic areas that stood out in terms of outcome divergence overall were oncology and hematology. In these areas, submissions to the EMA often were later than to the FDA and, as noted above, often included additional clinical trials or more mature data from the same clinical trial than were submitted to the FDA. In those instances, the EMA was more likely than the FDA to grant standard approval (whereas the FDA issued accelerated approval) or a broader indication.

In addition to constituting the majority of products in our cohort, the preponderance of outcome differences in oncology/hematology may have been influenced by factors relevant to its time frame, including increasing use of expedited development and access tools, marked by the FDA Safety and Innovation Act which, among other things, established the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2012, several years before establishment of the EMA's Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme in 2016. 12, 13

In assessing differences in indication, we observed themes of variation in EMA and FDA approaches. For example, among products for which supporting trials showed efficacy in patients who had failed first‐line therapy, the FDA's approved indications were typically limited to the population studied (treatment failures or relapses) while the EMA's also included patients for whom first‐line therapy was not appropriate. Other variations included descriptions of diagnostic criteria or pharmacogenomic characteristics (e.g. tumor subtype or hepatitis C virus genotype) to describe the recommended patient population, enough to make a notable difference in the target population. Since indications may impact clinical practice and medicines reimbursement, both of which have regional variation, there is room for further examination and discussion of the importance of some of the differences we observed.

### Demonstration of major therapeutic advantage from a review of EU conditional marketing authorizations in oncology and hematology [^1154Jjv2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The centralized procedure is an important regulatory pathway for the approval of medicines within the European Union (EU). It allows for a single marketing authorization that is valid across all EU member states, as well as in the European Economic area countries Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. This procedure is mandatory for certain types of medicines, such as those derived from biotechnology, and those intended for the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes. Additionally, it can be applied to products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation, or if an EU‐wide authorization is in the interest of patients. The European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s committees, the Committee for Medicinal Product for Human Use (CHMP), and for advanced therapies (CAT) play a central role in this process by conducting the scientific evaluation of marketing authorization applications. Under the centralized procedure, beyond the granting of "standard" marketing authorization, the conditional marketing authorization (CMA) and authorization under exceptional circumstances (AEC) are pathways designed to enable the timely availability of medicines that address unmet medical needs by enabling the approval of medicines when comprehensive clinical data is not available, on the condition that the benefits of immediate availability outweigh the risks associated with non‐comprehensive (clinical) data. An AEC is granted when comprehensive data cannot be obtained, often due to the rarity of the medical condition or ethical constraints in collecting such information. In contrast, a CMA is valid for 1 year renewable annually, and requires the marketing authorization holder to fulfill specific obligations within defined timelines, The impact of these tools is significant, as they provide a legal framework to foster early access to medicines addressing an unmet medical need, particularly for life‐threatening or seriously debilitating conditions. Excluding vaccines, 71 CMAs and 51 AECs were granted in the EU from 2006 and 2002, respectively, to 2022. In 2023, the CHMP recommended 77 medicines for marketing authorization, including 7 CMAs and 1 AEC.

### Clinical benefit and expedited approval of cancer drugs in the United States, European union, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, and Australia [^1121MBM4]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Regulatory agencies around the world have increasingly sought to speed up the development and approval of new medicines. Notably, since 2012, regulators in the United States (Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), Europe (European Medicines Agency [EMA]), Japan (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency [PMDA]), Switzerland (Swissmedic), and Australia (Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA]) have established new expedited programs. These expedited programs, as well as existing regulatory pathways, are frequently used to facilitate the approval of cancer therapies. For example, in 2019, all cancer drugs approved by the FDA qualified for at least one expedited program.

Nevertheless, regulatory agencies continue to face pressure to accelerate new drug approvals - and reduce delays in approval when drugs are approved first in a comparable country. In 2019, the FDA announced plans (Project Orbis) for concurrent submission and review of oncology products with regulators in Canada and Australia; this initiative was expanded in 2020 to include Switzerland and Singapore. In October 2020, the United Kingdom announced plans to join a consortium of drug regulatory agencies to jointly review certain new medicines with its exit from the European Union (EU). Ideally, both international initiatives and individual regulators' expedited programs would prioritize cancer therapies providing clinically meaningful benefits. Widely used value frameworks include the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (MCBS)and the ASCO's Cancer Research Committee (ASCO-CRC) targets.

Given substantial changes in the regulatory landscape in recent years, we aimed to assess trends in total regulatory review times for new cancer medicines in six jurisdictions: United States (FDA), EU (EMA), Switzerland (Swissmedic), Japan (PMDA), Canada (Health Canada), and Australia (TGA). We also evaluated the association between clinical benefit and times to approval and use of expedited programs.

### Added benefit and revenues of oncology drugs approved by the European medicines agency between 1995 and 2020: retrospective cohort study [^116XkdtV]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Results

Study cohort

Figure 1 presents a flowchart of the inclusion process and the characteristics of the three distinct study cohorts. There were 131 oncology drugs with 166 indications which had been evaluated for their added benefit by at least one organisation within the required timeframe, yielding a total of 458 added benefit ratings (added benefit cohort). Revenue data were available for 109 drugs (revenue cohort), of which 43 were evaluated by at least one organisation, had at least three years of revenue data, and were associated with a single indication at the end of the follow-up period. A total of 149 added benefit ratings corresponded to these 43 drugs (combined cohort). Supplementary materials table S1 presents a more detailed overview of the characteristics of the drugs and drug-indication combinations in the respective study cohorts.

Subgroup analyses were performed with SMAs, CMAs, and AECs in added benefit cohort, and with SMAs and CMAs in revenue cohort and combined cohort. AEC, authorisation under exceptional circumstances; ATC, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical; CMA, conditional marketing authorisation; EMA, European Medicines Agency; EPAR, European public assessment report; SMA, standard marketing authorisation

Added benefit

Of the acquired 458 added benefit ratings, 59 (13%) were classified as major benefit, 107 (23%) as substantial benefit, 103 (23%) as minor benefit, and 189 (41%) as negative or non-quantifiable benefit. The 166 drug-indication combinations included were most commonly assessed across one, two, or three organisations (n = 39, 23%; n = 41, 25%; n = 33, 20%, respectively), whereas none of the drug-indication combinations were evaluated by all seven organisations. Supplementary materials table S2 presents the distribution of added benefit ratings for each organisation.

### Incorporating patient preferences into drug development and regulatory decision making: results from a quantitative pilot study with cancer patients, carers, and regulators [^114UxRNw]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Currently, patient preference studies are not required to be included in marketing authorization applications to regulatory authorities, and the role and methodology for such studies have not been agreed upon. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) conducted a pilot study to gain experience on how the collection of individual preferences can inform the regulatory review. Using a short online questionnaire, ordinal statements regarding the desirability of different outcomes in the treatment of advanced cancer were elicited from 139 participants (98 regulators, 29 patient or carers, and 12 healthcare professionals). This was followed by face-to-face meetings to gather feedback and validate the individual responses. In this article we summarize the EMA pilot study and discuss the role of patient preference studies within the regulatory review. Based on the results, we conclude that our preference elicitation instrument was easy to implement and sufficiently precise to learn about the distribution of the participants' individual preferences.

### Cancer therapy approval timings, review speed, and publication of pivotal registration trials in the US and Europe, 2010–2019 [^114mCaUQ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This cross-sectional study found that 95% of new oncology therapies were approved in the US before receiving European market authorization. In addition, we found that most pharmaceutical companies submit new market authorization to the FDA before the EMA, and the FDA review time was half that of the EMA. However, shorter review times and earlier approval by the FDA mean that more drugs are withdrawn, 3 drugs by the FDA and 1 drug by the EMA, from the market and approximately one-third of medicines are approved before registrational study publication, compared with less than one-in-ten for new EMA oncology approvals.

Between 2003 and 2010, all new oncology therapies were approved earlier by the FDA, with a median delay of 238 days between FDA approval and European Commission adoption. We found that this delay between market authorizations continues to persist and has increased slightly to 241 days. However, unlike in previous studies, a small number of therapies, such as olaparib, were approved in Europe before receiving FDA approval. The number of concordant new oncology approvals by both regulators over the past decade has risen substantially compared with earlier studiesand include several new first-in-class therapies which may have compounded efforts to reduce review times. Notably, both lutetium Lu-177 dotatate and trabectedin required NDA resubmissions to the FDA following initial unsuccessful applications, likely resulting in earlier EMA approval. These findings add to the growing literature that shows the FDA, in oncology and beyond, consistently approves new therapies more rapidly than the EMA and other medical regulators.

### Cancer therapy approval timings, review speed, and publication of pivotal registration trials in the US and Europe, 2010–2019 [^115JiDW2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

This cross-sectional study did not involve individual patient information; involving only publicly available clinical trial and medicine regulator data, which has been previously reported. Therefore, this study was deemed to not require institutional review board approval, according to 45 CFR §46. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

The primary goal of this study was to compare market authorization dates for new oncology therapies approved both in the US and Europe. We also evaluated submission dates, review length, and approval relative to publication of the supporting clinical trial(s) in a peer-reviewed journal. We identified new cancer therapies approved by both the FDA and EMA from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, by a review of each medicine regulator's website, performed on April 1, 2021. To ensure all new therapies approved by both agencies were captured, we included any new oncology therapy approved within the 10-year period by either agency. Only initial approvals for new cancer therapies were considered, any supplementary licenses (indications beyond the initial license), supportive medicines, and biosimilars were excluded from analysis. New formulations of therapies with an existing market authorization were also excluded. We adopted similar methodology to prior studies to facilitate comparison of overall temporal trends in regulatory activities.

Data sources included approval letters, prescribing information, and review documents from both the EMA and FDA regulatory databases. For each new therapy approved in the US, we collected the submission date for the new drug application (NDA) or biologics license application (BLA), the date of market authorization and if accelerated approval had been granted. New therapy approval in the European Union requires 2 steps to allow market authorization. The EMA's committee for medicinal products for human use (CHMP) must first issue a positive opinion followed by European Commission adoptionn to allow market authorization in all European Union (EU) member countries. Therefore, for each new therapy, we collected the EMA submission date, positive CHMP opinion date, and formal European Commission (EU market authorization) adoption date. We also identified if drugs had received conditional authorization status by the EMA (akin to FDA accelerated approval program) with requirements for subsequent confirmatory data to be provided before full standard authorization can be granted. Further information on therapeutic classification, initial licensing indication, and pivotal trials used for efficacy evaluation were also recorded from each regulator's database.

### Access to innovative oncology medicines in Europe [^111JCPGR]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

This article intends to give an overview about developments in European Regulatory and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of new cancer drugs. As background information, it will refer to an overview article by Bergmann et al. which pointed out the status and the limitations of the current system. The authors discussed possible steps to improve the interface between regulators and HTA bodies but stated that this alone will not be sufficient to overcome heterogeneous HTA assessments between HTA agencies. Major issues and challenges for the foreseeable future will be to overcome the heterogeneity of patient access decisions of pharmaceutical payers across Europe which is due to (i) considerably different scientific approaches and methodology to the more or less formal evaluation of cost-effectiveness; (ii) differing health priorities across the countries that reflect historically developed cultural differences and values or different unmet medical needs and (iii) different economic strengths among nations, regions and locales that necessarily drive health care budgetary decisions. The authors consider that this needs a science-based common position on methodology, greater commitments by politicians and health care decision makers to ensure equal access for patients across the EU to anti-tumour medicines.

What is the present situation? For European patients, to benefit from a new medicine, three conditions must be fulfilled cumulatively: regulators need to approve the product, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has to put it on the market in the Member State of the patient, and reimbursement has to be assured. Therefore, new oncology drugs do not only have to prove efficacy, safety and quality in order to gain a marketing authorisation by a regulatory agency, but also need to show cost-effectiveness or additional clinical benefit, according to early drug assessment in Germany, when compared with other available therapies. HTA with its direct impact on pricing and reimbursement and its indirect impact on MAHs' decision to market (or not) in a given Member State has become an important determinant for patients' access to innovative oncology medicines.

### Ten years of marketing approvals of anticancer drugs in Europe: regulatory policy and guidance documents need to find a balance between different pressures [^112YDChB]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Despite important progress in understanding the molecular factors underlying the development of cancer and the improvement in response rates with new drugs, long-term survival is still disappointing for most common solid tumours. This might be because very little of the modest gain for patients is the result of the new compounds discovered and marketed recently. An assessment of the regulatory agencies' performance may suggest improvements. The present analysis summarizes and evaluates the type of studies and end points used by the EMEA to approve new anticancer drugs, and discusses the application of current regulations. This report is based on the information available on the EMEA web site. We identified current regulatory requirements for anticancer drugs promulgated by the agency and retrieved them in the relevant directory; information about empirical evidence supporting the approval of drugs for solid cancers through the centralised procedure were retrieved from the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). We surveyed documents for drug applications and later extensions from January 1995, when EMEA was set up, to December 2004. We identified 14 anticancer drugs for 27 different indications (14 new applications and 13 extensions). Overall, 48 clinical studies were used as the basis for approval; randomised comparative (clinical) trial (RCT) and Response Rate were the study design and end points most frequently adopted (respectively, 25 out of 48 and 30 out of 48). In 13 cases, the EPAR explicitly reported differences between arms in terms of survival: the range was 0–3.7 months, and the mean and median differences were 1.5 and 1.2 months. The majority of studies (13 out of 27, 48%) involved the evaluation of complete and/or partial tumour responses, with regard to the end points supporting the 27 indications. Despite the recommendations of the current EMEA guidance documents, new anticancer agents are still often approved on the basis of small single arm trials that do not allow any assessment of an 'acceptable and extensively documented toxicity profile' and of end points such as response rate, time to progression or progression-free survival which at best can be considered indicators of anticancer activity and are not 'justified surrogate markers for clinical benefit'. Anticipating an earlier than ideal point along the drug approval path and the use of not fully validated surrogate end points in nonrandomised trials looks like a dangerous shortcut that might jeopardise consumers' health, leading to unsafe and ineffective drugs being marketed and prescribed. The present Note for Guidance for new anticancer agents needs revising. Drugs must be rapidly released for patients who need them but not be at the expense of adequate knowledge about the real benefit of the drugs.

### A comparison of EMA and FDA decisions for new drug marketing applications 2014–2016: concordance, discordance, and why [^1113j21T]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Cohort characteristics

There were 126 and 125 new drug marketing applications for a new active substance, a new chemical entity (NCE), or a therapeutic biologic product submitted to the FDA and the EMA, respectively, and which had an outcome in the period 2014–2016. Of these, 74 applications were identified as having an initial outcome by both agencies during the study period. Also, 33 applications had been submitted to both agencies, with one agency's initial outcome in the study period and the other's outside of the period. In total, the cohort included 107 marketing applications.

The majority (71%) of the drugs in the cohort were for NCEs, while 29% were therapeutic biologics. Therapeutic areas of the applications were led by oncology (25%), as shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Product characteristics for cohort (2014–2016) of marketing applications reviewed by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)

Comparison of initial outcomes

Overall, 84% of the applications in the cohort were approved on their first submission ("initially approved") by both the EMA and the FDA, with the EMA having a higher rate of "first review cycle" approval (92%) compared with the FDA (85%).

Initial concordant and discordant regulatory outcomes

FDA and EMA decisions on whether to approve a product for marketing upon first submission and review were concordant (both agencies had the same regulatory outcome) for 92% (98/107) of the applications and discordant for 8% (9/107) (Table 2). Both agencies approved 84% (90/107) of the applications and both had initial negative outcomes (nonapproval or withdrawal) for 4% (4/107). There were four applications that were not approved by the FDA but withdrawn by the applicant prior to the regulatory decision by the EMA. In all four cases, at the time of the withdrawal from the EMA, the applicant was aware that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had concerns and was of the provisional opinion that the products were not approvable. Table 3 lists the nine drugs for which initial application decisions were discordant.

### Access to innovative oncology medicines in Europe [^116FNyzM]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

A consensual and aligned, or at least not contradictory, scientific interpretation of the available data by regulators and HTA bodies is needed for a more consistent basis of local price negotiations in Europe. The founding elements of the regulatory process remain exclusively efficacy, safety and quality (risk-benefit assessment). The relative effectiveness assessment (REA) is carried out in parallel with but separate from the regulatory approval process and information might be shared with EU REA Committee before publication of European Public Assessment report (EPAR), providing confidentiality. Two important initiatives support the development towards a European-wide facilitation of patients' access to medicines: EUnetHTA is a joint action on HTA founded by the EC and Member States and charged with the development of standards in the field of relative (clinical) effectiveness of pharmaceuticals. 'STAMP' is the acronym for the Expert Group on 'Safe and Timely Access to Medicines for Patients' initiated by the Directorate General for Health and Consumers of the European Commission with the intention to improve regulatory procedures, HTA and the interface. Currently, after methodological guidelines have been developed, EUnetHTA performs a second phase of joint action with the aim of strengthening the practical application of tools and approaches to cross-border HTA collaboration. This project to be in force until the end of 2015, consists of eight work packages of which work package 5 is of special interest, because it deals with the application of the so-called HTA Core Model for Rapid Assessment for national adaptation and reporting. The HTA Core Model defines the content elements to be considered in HTA and facilitates standardised reporting by sharing information and avoiding duplication of work. An objective is to test the capacity of national HTA bodies to produce structured core HTA information together and apply it in national context, including collection of data on costs and overall efficiency of the production in the network. The parallel progress and timeline of the EU regulatory process, including the decisions of Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) and EC and publication of the EPAR, and the HTA process ending with the final REA (Figure 2) is an important result achieved, so far. Presently this procedure is done on a voluntary initiation by the manufacturer until the process is proven to be validated by all parties.

### Queries raised during oncology business pipeline meetings at the European medicines agency: a 5-year retrospective analysis [^115WFVKh]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) offers guidance and support to pharmaceutical companies through bilateral discussions called business pipeline meetings (BPMs). An analysis of BPMs in oncology over a 5-year period was conducted to identify common topics and recurring queries. The documents of all BPMs available at the EMA regarding the field of oncology from January 1, 2018, to Decemer 31, 2022, were reviewed. For every query, a main category was assigned, and in case of multiple relevant topics, a secondary category was appointed too. For all queries, the follow-up offered by the EMA was documented, and whether the requested information was available. Subsequently, all queries were scanned for overlapping topics between meetings. From 2018 to 2022, 31 BPMs were held between the EMA and pharmaceutical companies to discuss oncology-related questions, for a total of 397 queries raised. They were classified into 24 topics, of which 15 were common topics (n ≥ 10 queries) with regulatory pathways/guidelines and trial design having the most queries. Post-BPM actions were taken or recommended by the EMA for 41.3% of queries, such as referrals to scientific advice or published guidelines. Forty-three queries were raised at more than one BPM. Targeted therapy, companion diagnostics, institutional collaboration, trial design, and regulatory pathways/guidelines were the most discussed topics in oncology BPMs, with molecular developments being the common denominator. Creating Q&A documents, publishing new guidelines, providing a framework for discussions, and questionnaire-based follow-up research can improve the quality of BPMs, and the accessibility of the information requested during the BPMs.

### The European landscape for gene therapies in orphan diseases: 6-year experience with the EMA committee for orphan medicinal products [^115XB1dj]. Molecular Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding PRIority MEdicines (PRIME), this scheme was launched by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. This voluntary scheme is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines, to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients earlier. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine must demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need to a significant extent. This could mean, for example, introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. To justify such potential, applicants must provide any available data showing a meaningful improvement of clinical outcomes, that show the treatment can prevent or delay the onset, as well as reduce the duration of a given condition, or show an improvement in the morbidity or mortality. Applicants from academia and small to medium enterprises (SMEs), who generally have less experience of the regulatory landscape, may submit an eligibility request for Early Entry PRIME status if compelling non-clinical in vivo data in a relevant model provide early evidence of promising activity, or proof-of-principle, and first-in-human studies indicate adequate exposure for the desired pharmacotherapeutic effects and tolerability.

As non-oncological rare diseases seem to be the main target of viral-vector-based gene therapies for OD and the associated incentives, the aim of this paper is to provide insights on the regulatory decision-making process for these products, with a view that our findings will ultimately help to improve the successful development. In addition to the classification of the applications in terms of therapeutic group and prevalence, we investigated the most common type of viral vector used over the years and how the medicines were delivered to the patients' cells.

Figure 2.
EUnetHTA project of parallel assessment of regulatory bodies and HTA agencies (adapted from). The aim of this project is to have early parallel assessments on new drugs between the regulatory body (EMA) and HTA agencies including early consultations. The participation of the HTA agencies is voluntary and the HTA bodies are selected by the sponsor.

The experiences collected in about 25 pilot procedures for parallel advice and protocol assistance of EMA and HTA bodies were discussed in a workshop held in November 2013. Afterwards, a draft best practice guidance for EMA-HTA parallel scientific advice was developed and published in May 2014 for 2 months of public consultation, but the final version has not been published yet. An example for a parallel EMA-HTA scientific advice dealing with evidentiary requirements in an oncology case study is shown in Figure 3. The parallel procedure, established so far, includes four stages: (i) Pre-notification, where applicants have early informal meetings with EMA and HTAs announcing their intentions for the procedure, product and timescale, and specifying which HTAs will participate. (ii) Pre-validation, which includes a teleconference with HTAs to discuss the scope, wording and clarity of the questions, and whether the material provided is sufficient to answer the questions posed. (iii) Meeting face-to-face between all stakeholders, for which the applicant prepares the agenda according to priorities, and (iv) outcome, when meeting minutes are circulated by the company for individual written HTA agreement and the regulatory scientific advice is provided in a CHMP advice letter.

### Market and patient access to new oncology products in Europe: a current, multidisciplinary perspective [^11311VEH]. Annals of Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

To air challenging issues related to patient and market access to new anticancer agents, the Biotherapy Development Association — an international group focused on developing targeted cancer therapies using biological agents — convened a meeting on 29 November 2007 in Brussels, Belgium. The meeting provided a forum for representatives of pharmaceutical companies and academia to interact with European regulatory and postregulatory agencies. The goal was to increase all parties' understanding of their counterparts' roles in the development, licensure, and appraisal of new agents for cancer treatment, events guided by an understanding that cancer patients should have rapid and equitable access to life-prolonging treatments. Among the outcomes of the meeting were a greater understanding of the barriers facing drug developers in an evolving postregulatory world, clarity about what regulatory and postregulatory bodies expect to see in dossiers of new anticancer agents as they contemplate licensure and reimbursement, and several sets of recommendations to optimize patients' access to innovative, safe, effective, and fairly priced cancer treatments.

### Therapeutic value of drugs granted accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization in the US and Europe from 2007 to 2021 [^112DJGFp]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Results

From 2007 to 2021, 146 drug indications (94 first indications, 52 supplemental indications) were granted accelerated approval by the FDA and 58 (all first indications) received conditional marketing authorization by the EMA, with use of both pathways increasing over time (Figure). Most of these approved indications targeted cancer (122 [83.6%] in the US; 40 [69.0%] in the EU). In Switzerland, 13 drug indications (all first indications only) were granted temporary authorization. As of December 2021, 48 accelerated approvals (32.9%) and 21 conditional marketing authorizations (35.0%) were converted to regular approval.

Figure.
Trends in Accelerated Approval and Conditional Marketing Approvals From 2007 to 2021

Of the 146 drug indications granted accelerated approval, 33 (22.6%) were also conditionally approved in the EU. Fifty-four (37%) were granted regular approval, 2 (1.4%) were approved through an expedited pathway, 5 (3.4%) were refused, 3 (2%) had applications withdrawn, and 49 (33.6%) were still under review or had not been submitted to the EMA. Of the 58 drug indications conditionally approved in the EU, most (33 [56.9%]) were also granted accelerated approval; 14 (24.1%) were granted at least 1 expedited review program (but not accelerated approval), 4 (6.9%) were approved through the regular pathway, 2 (3.4%) were refused, and 5 (8.7%) were still under review or had not been submitted to the FDA by the end of our data collection process.

### Understanding the role of comparative clinical studies in the development of oncology biosimilars [^113tmTNk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

How Have Regulatory Authorities Interpreted Comparative Clinical Study Data Within the Context of the Totality of the Evidence?

As described earlier, biosimilarity is determined on the basis of the totality of evidence. To illustrate how regulators interpret data from comparative clinical efficacy studies within the overall assessment of biosimilarity, it is helpful to consider the evaluation of SB3 and ABP 980 by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) as described in European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) and the subsequent EU approval of these biosimilars.,

In the SB3 study in EBC, equivalence was assessed on the basis of an analysis of the 95% CIs of both the ratio of bpCR rates and the difference in bpCR rates between arms. The 95% CI for the adjusted ratio of bpCR rates was contained within the predefined equivalence margin, demonstrating equivalence (Table 2). In contrast, the upper limit of the 95% CI for the adjusted difference in bpCR rates was outside the predefined equivalence margin, meaning that while noninferiority of SB3 was demonstrated, nonsuperiority was not. The CHMP primarily considered the difference in bpCR rates in its assessment of SB3. Structural and functional analyses conducted by the sponsor of numerous lots of reference trastuzumab identified that certain lots exhibited a marked downward drift in glycosylation levels, FcγRIIIa binding, and ADCC. ADCC is a known component of the trastuzumab MOA, and some of the affected lots were used in the clinical study. It was considered by the CHMP that this apparent shift in ADCC activity could have added variability to the estimation of the treatment difference, thereby contributing to the upper limit of the CI exceeding the margin. As noted in the EPAR for SB3, "the magnitude of the differences observed can be in part attributed to other factors and the true difference is considered likely to fall within the equivalence margins and [be] of no clinical relevance".

### Biomarkers as drug development tools: discovery, validation, qualification and use [^111VT4fy]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The 21st Century Cures Act, approved in the United States in December 2016, has encouraged the establishment of the national Precision Medicine Initiative and the augmentation of efforts to address disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment on the basis of a molecular understanding of disease. The Act adopts into law the formal process, developed by the FDA, of qualification of drug development tools, including biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments, to increase the efficiency of clinical trials and encourage an era of molecular medicine. The FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have developed similar processes for the qualification of biomarkers intended for use as companion diagnostics or for development and regulatory approval of a drug or therapeutic. Biomarkers that are used exclusively for the diagnosis, monitoring or stratification of patients in clinical trials are not subject to regulatory approval, although their qualification can facilitate the conduct of a trial. In this Review, the salient features of biomarker discovery, analytical validation, clinical qualification and utilization are described in order to provide an understanding of the process of biomarker development and, through this understanding, convey an appreciation of their potential advantages and limitations.

### Clinical benefit and expedited approval of cancer drugs in the United States, European union, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, and Australia [^116yxqWo]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Regulatory agencies have sought to speed up the review of new cancer medicines and reduce delays in approval between countries. We examined trends in regulatory review times and association with clinical benefit for new cancer medicines in six jurisdictions: United States (Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), European Union (European Medicines Agency [EMA]), Switzerland (Swissmedic), Japan (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency [PMDA]), Canada (Health Canada), and Australia (Therapeutic Goods Administration).

Methods

We studied all new cancer drugs approved in the six aforementioned jurisdictions from 2007 to 2020. We extracted all applicable expedited programs, total regulatory review times, and, for drugs first approved by the FDA, times to subsequent regulatory approval. Clinical benefit was assessed using the European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale value framework and ASCO-Cancer Research Committee's targets. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare total review times for high versus low clinical benefit drugs.

Results

One hundred and twenty eight drugs received initial approval in at least one of the six included jurisdictions. Most drugs approved by the FDA (91%) and Health Canada (59%) qualified for at least one expedited program within those jurisdictions, compared with 46% of EMA approvals and 18% of PMDA approvals. The FDA was the first regulator to approve 102 (80%) drugs. Delays in submission accounted for a median of 20.2% (EMA) to 83.8% (PMDA) of the time to subsequent approval. There was no association between high clinical benefit and shorter total review times.

Conclusion

Most new cancer therapies were approved first by the FDA, and delays in submission of regulatory applications accounted for substantial delays in approving cancer drugs in other countries. Regulators should prioritize faster review for drugs with high clinical benefit.

### Advancing rare disease treatment: EMA's decade-long insights into engineered adoptive cell therapy for rare cancers and orphan designation [^113xSpCb]. Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), particularly chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, has emerged as a promising approach for targeting and treating rare oncological conditions. The orphan medicinal product designation by the European Union (EU) plays a crucial role in promoting development of medicines for rare conditions according to the EU Orphan Regulation. This regulatory landscape analysis examines the evolution, regulatory challenges, and clinical outcomes of genetically engineered ACT, with a focus on CAR-T cell therapies, based on the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products review of applications evaluated for orphan designation and maintenance of the status over a 10-year period. In total, 30 of 36 applications were granted an orphan status, and 14 subsequently applied for maintenance of the status at time of marketing authorisation or extension of indication. Most of the products were autologous cell therapies using a lentiviral vector and were developed for the treatment of rare haematological B-cell malignancies. The findings revealed that 80% (29/36) of the submissions for orphan designation were supported by preliminary clinical data showing a potential efficacy of the candidate products and an added clinical benefit over currently authorised medicines for the proposed orphan condition. Notably, in 89% (32/36) of the cases significant benefit of the new products was accepted based on a clinically relevant advantage over existing therapies. Twelve of fourteen submissions reviewed for maintenance of the status at time of marketing authorisation or extension of indication demonstrated significant benefit of the products over existing satisfactory methods of treatment within the approved therapeutic indications, but one of the applications was withdrawn during the regulatory evaluation. This article summarises the key findings related to the use of engineered ACT, primarily CAR-T cell therapies, in targeting and treating rare cancers in the EU. It emphasises the importance of use of clinical data in supporting medical plausibility and significant benefit at the stage of orphan designation and highlights the high success rate for these products in obtaining initial orphan designations and subsequent maintaining the status at the time of marketing authorisation or extension of indication.

### Clinical benefit and expedited approval of cancer drugs in the United States, European union, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, and Australia [^112G54Tb]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE:

Regulatory agencies have sought to speed up the review of new cancer medicines and reduce delays in approval between countries. We examined trends in regulatory review times and association with clinical benefit for new cancer medicines in six jurisdictions: United States (Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), European Union (European Medicines Agency [EMA]), Switzerland (Swissmedic), Japan (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency [PMDA]), Canada (Health Canada), and Australia (Therapeutic Goods Administration).

METHODS:

We studied all new cancer drugs approved in the six aforementioned jurisdictions from 2007 to 2020. We extracted all applicable expedited programs, total regulatory review times, and, for drugs first approved by the FDA, times to subsequent regulatory approval. Clinical benefit was assessed using the European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale value framework and ASCO-Cancer Research Committee's targets. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare total review times for high versus low clinical benefit drugs.

RESULTS:

One hundred and twenty eight drugs received initial approval in at least one of the six included jurisdictions. Most drugs approved by the FDA (91%) and Health Canada (59%) qualified for at least one expedited program within those jurisdictions, compared with 46% of EMA approvals and 18% of PMDA approvals. The FDA was the first regulator to approve 102 (80%) drugs. Delays in submission accounted for a median of 20.2% (EMA) to 83.8% (PMDA) of the time to subsequent approval. There was no association between high clinical benefit and shorter total review times.

CONCLUSION:

Most new cancer therapies were approved first by the FDA, and delays in submission of regulatory applications accounted for substantial delays in approving cancer drugs in other countries. Regulators should prioritize faster review for drugs with high clinical benefit.

### Evolving recommendations for patient populations among oncology medicines: a quantitative and qualitative analysis [^1136jNy6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Based on 25 populations for oncology medicines, we were able to develop a population framework that describes eligible patients for a medicine in detail, allowing for consistency between decision‐makers and countries. The framework consists of 20 reporting elements in four domains: disease specifics, patient characteristics, positioning in a treatment pathway, and exclusion criteria. Our framework aligns with the approach taken in the framework for regulatory assessors published by the EMA. Both frameworks have overlapping elements, such as the severity of disease, aim of treatment, place of product, and use in combination. Our new framework is more specific on each of these elements, including diagnostic or genetic criteria, separating tumor staging from a general description of the tumor "advancedness" and detailing prior treatment requirements. This allows for communication of the nuances necessary for decision making.

The patient population descriptions for the included oncology cohort were on average adjusted twice at every step from trial inclusion, to the submission and approval for marketing authorization, to the submission and approval for HTA, and finally to inclusion in clinical guidelines. One of the two adjustments in each step represents an element that had been adjusted by another decision‐maker in an earlier step. Discrepancies in reporting the patient populations as well as the variety in the remits of decision‐makers play a critical role in these findings. However, the many and varying adjustments in later decision steps decision‐makers seem to not agree on when and to what extent this is appropriate. This is supported by the provided examples in our last presented exploratory analysis.

On average, 10 adjustments were made throughout a single decision sequence for one medicine. Five out of 10 adjustments are made in the initial step, translating the demarcated clinical trial population into a regulatory label. Regulators, HTA organizations, and guideline developers imposed fewer adjustments in each step (the other 5 adjustments distributed over four decision steps). These results suggest that regulators, HTA organizations, and clinical guideline developers accept most of the developers adjustments from trial to a general description of eligible patient populations.

### Association between FDA and EMA expedited approval programs and therapeutic value of new medicines: retrospective cohort study [^116NEEeC]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Results

From 2007 through 2017, the FDA approved 320 new medicines and the EMA approved 268 new medicines (table 3). As of 1 April 2020, 239 (75%) of the FDA's new drug approvals were also approved by the EMA, and an additional 15 (5%) were approved through national approval procedures. Most new drugs approved by the FDA and EMA were indicated to treat oncologic (25% and 31%, respectively), alimentary and metabolic (13% and 13%), or blood and cardiovascular (12% and 11%) disorders. Among the 320 new drugs approved by the FDA, 181 (57%) qualified for at least one expedited program, and roughly half (163; 51%) qualified for priority review. By contrast, 39 (15%) of the 268 new drugs approved by the EMA qualified for either accelerated assessment or conditional marketing authorisation.

Ratings of therapeutic value

Ratings of therapeutic value by one of the organizations included in the study were available for 267 drugs (83% of FDA approvals; all but one of EMA approvals). Overall, 31% (84/267) of FDA drug approvals and 31% (83/267) of EMA drug approvals were rated as having high therapeutic value by at least one organization. Drugs that were approved by the FDA but not the EMA were less likely than drugs approved by both regulators to be rated as having high therapeutic value (14% v 33%; odds ratio 3.02, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 9.02; P = 0.04). The relative proportion of drug approvals rated as having high therapeutic value did not change over the study period for either the FDA (odds ratio for time trend 1.00, 0.92 to 1.08; P = 0.92) (fig 1) or the EMA (1.00, 0.92 to 1.09; P = 0.92).

### Clinical benefit and expedited approval of cancer drugs in the United States, European union, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, and Australia [^1174KpJe]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We identified new cancer drugs approved by the FDA (United States), EMA (EU), Swissmedic (Switzerland), PMDA (Japan), Health Canada (Canada), and TGA (Australia) from January 2007 to May 2020 using publicly available registers of drug approvals available for each regulatory agency. The study period was chosen to include key expedited programs that have been established by regulators, including EMA's conditional marketing authorization in 2006 and the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation in 2012. For each drug, we used the ingredient (generic) name to determine whether it had been approved by any of the other regulators. We included drugs for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and focused on the first approved indication, which corresponds to initial market availability of these therapies.

### The timing of cancer drug approvals in the United States and Europe… [^116SUnXK]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study by Lythgoe and colleagues1 provides insights into regulatory processes for cancer drug approvals between the 2 largest medical regulators in the world — the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. 1 Over the past decade, the FDA approved oncology drugs twice as fast as the EMA, more often through accelerated pathways, and often prior to study publication. Of the 89 cancer medicines approved both in the United States and Europe between 2010 and 2019, the FDA approved 95% before European market authorization. The speed of review times and increasing number of FDA-approved cancer medicines has long been used as a metric for successful regulatory processes and improvements in patient outcomes. But do quicker review times result in better outcomes for patients, such as meaningful improvements in survival and quality of life.

Although the speed of FDA review times and subsequent number of approvals have increased over time, the proportion of cancer drugs that improve survival has declined. 2 Furthermore, although other countries approve fewer medicines than the US, available therapies tend to offer more benefit to patients. For example, 48 of 78 drugs recommended by the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review — the national Canadian health technology assessment body — demonstrated substantial clinical benefit according to the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale3 compared with 43. 8% of FDA approvals within the same period. 4 Similarly, although review times are longer in Europe, data for overall survival is more likely to be available, considerably reducing uncertainty regarding the magnitude of clinical benefit.
5. The study by Lythgoe and colleagues1 highlights additional considerations. First, faster review times increase evidential uncertainty and expose patients to additional risk.

Lythgoe et al1 found that more drugs in the US received accelerated approval compared with the EMA and more than one-third are approved prior to study publication. 1 Consequently, more drugs were also withdrawn from the US market. These findings could be interpreted positively; that the system is working as it should. However, the FDA's inconsistent follow-up of postmarketing studies leaves a substantial proportion of cancer drugs approved through accelerated pathways on the market for years without confirmation of their benefit. 6 The FDA Oncology Center of Excellence Center recently announced Project FrontRunner, an initiative to open up the accelerated approval program to earlier lines of treatment. 7 In line with these concerns, newly appointed FDA Commissioner Robert Califf has acknowledged the need to improve postmarket data to support this initiative.
7.

Second, increased speed of US review times lowers global standards for testing and creates a culture of widespread drug access that impose challenges on other countries to obtain the evidence they need for appropriate drug coverage decisions. 8 Cancer drugs are routinely approved using surrogate end points that are often not well correlated with overall survival, increasing uncertainty about the magnitude of clinical benefit. The impact of these FDA practices on other countries are underappreciated. As one Canadian decision maker explained: "the low-bar for FDA approval… makes it very difficult for us to impose an additional bar around what value is it providing and what prices or the cost effectiveness in a culture that wants to use drugs whenever they want to use them. "8 Furthermore, low- and middle-income countries often rely on safety and efficacy assessments from the FDA, a practice called foreign regulatory reliance.

### The European medicines agency (EMEA) guideline on oncology drug development… [^1129i1Z2]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract 6636 Background: The scientific assessment and positive opinion of the EMEA is mandatory for the approval of new oncology drugs in the European Union. One of the tasks of the EMEA is to provide guidance on the conduct of the various tests and trials necessary for approval. The EMEA has recently revised its guideline on the clinical development of new anticancer drugs. The revised version includes specific guidance on the development of non-cytotoxic agents. Specific guidance is given about methodological issues using progression-free survival as primary endpoint in confirmatory trials for registration. Methods: The key elements of the revised guideline are described with particular reference to requirements for approval.

Results: The early stages of clinical drug development have to be tailored according to the assumed pharmacology of the individual compound as defined in non-clinical studies. The integration of information from exploratory and confirmatory studies is of primary importance. In general, phase III trials should be designed with the aim of establishing the benefit risk balance of the drug, in a well-characterized target population. These studies should be randomized controlled and, where possible, blinded or include blinded evaluation. Acceptable primary endpoints include overall survival and PFS or disease-free survival. It is acknowledged that there are situations where PFS can be considered as a primary endpoint that measures clinical benefit. Adherence to protocol-defined schedules for tumor assessments, typically by imaging techniques, is important and deviations should be reported.

Independent, blinded review and confirmation of best tumor response and progression should be undertaken if PFS is the primary endpoint. Conclusions: The current revision of the EMEA guideline provides useful clinical regulatory guidance for the development of cytostatic agents. When recommended guidelines are considered suboptimal, sponsors are encouraged to seek regulatory scientific advice. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### CDER collaborates with global regulators on pharmaceutical… [^112ohGgQ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Theresa Mullin, Ph. D. CDER's Associate Center Director for Strategic Initiatives, and Michael Kopcha, Ph. D. R. Ph., director of CDER's Office of Pharmaceutical Quality FDA and the European Medicines Agency recently completed the first collaborative assessment of a proposed post-approval change for a critical oncology biologic with the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency serving as an observer. The work, in which FDA and EMA reviewed and approved a proposal to add new manufacturing and quality control sites, can help assure the supply of the medicine. This collaboration is the first achievement in an international pilot program conducted as part of the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities Pharmaceutical Quality Knowledge Management System effort to bring regulators together to enable better industry quality management to reliably supply critical medicines for patients in need.

CDER's Role in ICMRA This collaboration comes on the heels of global regulators joining forces to address challenges with drug availability. Drug manufacturers often make changes to their processes or facilities to keep equipment and processes up to date and address supply chain hurdles. Depending on the extent of the change, regulators may need to assess, inspect, and approve it. Because drug manufacturers often sell the same product in many countries, they must work with global regulators that have different expectations and review timelines for such changes. A single manufacturing change, even when critically important, can be complex and time-consuming to implement.

With FDA as a founding member of ICMRA, in 2019 CDER saw a unique opportunity to utilize the strategic role of ICMRA to propose a multi-year project that would lead to greater regulatory reliance when making decisions about a product and enable greater manufacturing quality management and agility for industry. The ICMRA PQKMS project was launched in November 2020. ICMRA PQKMS aims to strengthen international collaboration by building the collaborative processes and information infrastructure needed to support global development, manufacture, and supply of pharmaceutical medicinal products. As part of the PQKMS work, ICMRA introduced two pilot programs to identify differences and potential areas for collaboration in pharmaceutical quality assessment and inspection across ICMRA regions.

This is an important first step to help harmonize chemistry, manufacturing, and controls assessments and inspection-related regulatory procedures worldwide, which will lead to more efficient drug application reviews across regulators. ICMRA Pilot Programs These pilot programs were borne out of the unprecedented stress that COVID-19 imposed on the global drug supply chain. Immediate actions were warranted to implement flexible approaches that would allow manufacturers to rapidly increase manufacturing capacity for production of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines and avoid or mitigate shortages for non-COVID-19-related products, without compromising patient safety or product quality.
