## Question

Antigen testing for diagnosing COVID-19 infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antigen testing for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the test performance characteristics and how they vary by symptoms, timing, and viral load. Next, I will examine serial testing strategies and their evidence base. After that, I need to align recommendations with major guidelines and regulatory guidance. Finally, I will translate this into practical, scenario-based advice and highlight special populations and evidence gaps, making sure I double-check any figures before I state them.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why antigen testing matters. Antigen tests detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins and provide results in about 15–30 minutes, enabling rapid decisions on isolation, treatment, and public health measures, but their accuracy depends on pretest probability, symptom status, and timing relative to exposure or symptom onset, so I need to keep those modifiers front and center when interpreting results [^4a44e776] [^1d927257].

> I should confirm the core performance characteristics. Pooled analyses show antigen tests have high specificity, around 99–100%, meaning a positive result is highly actionable and generally does not require confirmation, whereas sensitivity is lower and variable, roughly 81% in symptomatic individuals and about 63% in asymptomatic individuals, with performance falling further after the first week of symptoms as viral load declines [^3a203b96] [^f379a3b9] [^c35cbffb]. Wait, let me verify the timing effect: sensitivity is highest in the first 5 days of symptoms and drops to about 54% after day 5, which is why timing is critical to minimize false negatives [^f379a3b9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single negative antigen result. I need to ensure I incorporate serial testing because sensitivity improves with repeat testing. Modeling and regulatory guidance support repeating antigen testing: for symptomatic individuals, two tests 48 hours apart, and for asymptomatic individuals, three tests over five days with 48-hour intervals, which meaningfully reduces the false-negative rate compared with a single test [^2e4f5386] [^0c098201]. I should double-check that this aligns with FDA's current stance; yes, FDA continues to recommend serial antigen testing to increase confidence in negative results, especially early in infection or in the absence of symptoms [^2e4f5386].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. The IDSA recommends standard NAAT over antigen testing when results will be timely, but supports antigen testing when NAAT is unavailable or delayed, with the caveat that negative antigen results in symptomatic patients with ongoing suspicion should be confirmed by NAAT; positive antigen results generally do not require confirmation due to high specificity [^046727cb] [^40d1ca3c]. The CDC similarly treats NAAT as the gold standard and advises serial antigen testing to reduce false negatives, which reinforces the need to repeat negatives rather than assume clearance [^0c098201] [^97e38424]. WHO's living guidance supports self-testing with antigen RDTs as part of comprehensive testing strategies, reflecting their public health utility when used appropriately [^c92b455e].

> Let me consider symptomatic patients first. In the first 5 days of symptoms, antigen sensitivity is about 89%, so a positive antigen test is reliable for diagnosis and isolation decisions; however, a negative antigen test does not rule out infection, and if clinical suspicion remains, I should confirm with NAAT or repeat antigen testing within 48 hours to improve sensitivity [^f379a3b9] [^40d1ca3c]. I should confirm that this approach balances access and accuracy; yes, IDSA explicitly prioritizes NAAT when feasible but accepts antigen testing when NAAT is delayed, with repeat testing mitigating sensitivity limitations [^046727cb].

> Now, for asymptomatic individuals, I need to be more cautious. Sensitivity is lower, around 63%, so a single negative antigen test is insufficient; serial testing is essential to reduce missed infections, and even then, I should counsel that a negative series lowers but does not eliminate risk, particularly early after exposure when viral load is still rising [^c35cbffb] [^2e4f5386]. But wait, what if the person had a known exposure? In that case, testing is generally recommended around day 5 post-exposure, and if antigen is used, repeating tests improves detection; if results will change management, NAAT is preferred when available [^3c7a8441] [^64d18a70].

> I will now examine special populations and settings. In children, specificity remains high, but sensitivity is lower and data are limited; therefore, I should apply the same principles with a lower threshold to confirm negatives when suspicion is high and consider repeat testing to improve detection [^89b60171]. In immunocompromised hosts, antigen sensitivity may be further reduced, so I should have a lower threshold to use NAAT and to repeat testing if antigen results are negative but suspicion persists [^notfound]. For large gatherings or screening programs, evidence is sparse; modeling suggests potential benefit in high-prevalence settings, but IDSA highlights an evidence gap and does not make a firm recommendation, so any pre-event antigen strategy should be paired with mitigation measures and clear communication about false negatives [^d1118f32] [^c2e76b90].

> Let me think about the role of antigen testing in public health and transmission control. Antigen tests detect infection when viral load is high, which correlates with greater infectiousness, so positive results align with periods of higher transmission risk; however, negative antigen results, including serial negatives, do not guarantee absence of infectiousness, and I should communicate this uncertainty explicitly to avoid false reassurance [^9e88a075] [^2e4f5386]. I should confirm that guidelines caution against using antigen results alone to infer contagiousness; yes, IDSA notes no direct evidence that antigen results predict transmission, reinforcing the need for layered precautions even with negative results in the right clinical context [^9e88a075].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details. Both observed and unobserved self-collection are acceptable for antigen testing, with performance appearing comparable in available studies, though unobserved testing carries a higher risk of user error; clear instructions and counseling mitigate harms from false negatives and improve adherence to serial testing protocols [^474cf969] [^8d1914b9]. I need to ensure I specify that positive results should trigger isolation and that patients should follow local public health guidance on duration and precautions, while negative results in symptomatic patients warrant confirmatory testing or repeat antigen testing rather than immediate return to normal activities [^2e4f5386] [^0c098201].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make sure I am not overstating any claims. Antigen testing is a valuable, rapid tool with high specificity and moderate sensitivity that performs best early in symptomatic infection; its greatest limitation is false negatives, which can be mitigated by testing within 5 days of symptom onset and by serial testing when suspicion remains high or in asymptomatic individuals, with NAAT reserved for confirmation when results will change management or when antigen is negative but clinical suspicion is strong [^f379a3b9] [^046727cb] [^2e4f5386]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with the highest-quality sources; yes, IDSA and CDC converge on these principles, and WHO's endorsement of self-testing supports accessibility when paired with appropriate interpretation and repeat testing strategies [^046727cb] [^0c098201] [^c92b455e].

Antigen testing is a **rapid, point-of-care** method that detects SARS-CoV-2 proteins, with results in 15–30 minutes [^4a44e776]. It has **high specificity** (~99%) [^3a203b96] but **lower sensitivity** than NAAT, especially in asymptomatic or low-viral-load cases [^00c324fe], so a negative result does not exclude infection [^1d927257]. Antigen tests are best used within 5 days of symptom onset [^f379a3b9] or for repeat screening in high-risk settings [^notfound]; positive results are actionable, while negative results in symptomatic or high-risk patients should be confirmed by NAAT [^046727cb] [^40d1ca3c]. They are less sensitive than NAAT [^00c324fe] but enable faster, cheaper, and more accessible testing [^3288147a], supporting public health control when used strategically [^dad72b5f].

## Mechanism of antigen testing

Antigen tests detect **nucleocapsid protein** from SARS-CoV-2 using lateral flow immunoassays, providing results in 15–30 minutes [^4a44e776]. They identify active infection when viral load is high, typically early in disease [^00c324fe].

---

## Clinical performance of antigen testing

### Sensitivity and specificity

- **Sensitivity**: ~81% in symptomatic patients [^3a203b96]; ~89% within 5 days of symptom onset [^f379a3b9]; ~63% in asymptomatic individuals [^c35cbffb].
- **Specificity**: ~99% in both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations [^3a203b96] [^c35cbffb].
- **Performance varies by timing**: sensitivity declines after 5 days of symptoms and with lower viral loads [^f379a3b9] [^00c324fe].

---

### Comparison with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)

NAAT (PCR) remains the **diagnostic gold standard** due to higher sensitivity [^0c098201], but antigen tests offer faster turnaround and lower cost [^7a5be9ec], making them valuable for rapid decision-making and screening [^dad72b5f].

---

## Clinical scenarios for antigen testing

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients within 5 days of onset | Recommended; high sensitivity and specificity [^f379a3b9] [^3a203b96] |
| Asymptomatic individuals with known exposure | Conditional; lower sensitivity, consider repeat testing [^da587ae0] [^2076f369] |
| Screening in high-risk settings (e.g. outbreaks, congregate settings) | Useful for rapid identification and isolation [^dad72b5f] [^bde61149] |
| Pre-event screening (e.g. gatherings, travel) | Conditional; limited evidence, use with caution [^d1118f32] [^c2e76b90] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Lower sensitivity**: Higher false negatives, especially in asymptomatic or low-viral-load cases [^00c324fe] [^c10a10b8].
- **False negatives**: Can delay diagnosis and treatment; confirm with NAAT if suspicion is high [^046727cb] [^40d1ca3c].
- **Variant impact**: Emerging variants may affect performance; ongoing evaluation is needed [^e9fcc3a1] [^32aac08f].
- **User error**: Self-collection and interpretation can reduce accuracy without clear instructions [^72fc799d] [^2e4f5386].

---

## Public health implications

Antigen testing enables **rapid case identification**, isolation, and outbreak control [^dad72b5f], and is cost-effective and scalable, supporting broad access and frequent testing [^3288147a]. When combined with NAAT and public health measures, it enhances overall control efforts [^bde61149].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **IDSA**: Prefer NAAT when available; use antigen tests when NAAT is delayed or unavailable; confirm negative antigen results with NAAT if suspicion remains [^046727cb] [^40d1ca3c].
- **CDC**: Use antigen tests for rapid screening; repeat negative results per FDA guidance to reduce false negatives [^0c098201] [^2e4f5386].
- **WHO**: Supports antigen testing for rapid diagnosis and screening, especially where NAAT is limited [^c92b455e] [^dad72b5f].

---

Antigen testing is a **valuable tool** for rapid COVID-19 diagnosis and screening, with high specificity and moderate sensitivity [^3a203b96]. It is most effective when used early in symptomatic infection or in repeat-testing strategies, with negative results confirmed by NAAT when clinical suspicion is high [^f379a3b9] [^046727cb].

### Interpreting SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests: common questions and answers [^1d927257]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19. Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^ff545f3e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection could contribute to clinical and public health strategies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Point-of-care antigen and molecular tests to detect current infection could increase access to testing and early confirmation of cases, and expediate clinical and public health management decisions that may reduce transmission.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups.

Search Methods

Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on 30 Sept 2020. We checked repositories of COVID-19 publications and included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and the Diagnostics Global Health website to 16 Nov 2020. We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of people with either suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen or molecular tests suitable for a point-of-care setting (minimal equipment, sample preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results within two hours of sample collection). We included all reference standards that define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and established diagnostic criteria).

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were screened independently in duplicate with disagreements resolved by discussion with a third author. Study characteristics were extracted by one author and checked by a second; extraction of study results and assessments of risk of bias and applicability (made using the QUADAS-2 tool) were undertaken independently in duplicate. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test and pooled data using the bivariate model separately for antigen and molecular-based tests. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status.

Main Results

Seventy-eight study cohorts were included (described in 64 study reports, including 20 pre-prints), reporting results for 24,087 samples (7,415 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly from Europe (n = 39) or North America (n = 20), and evaluated 16 antigen and five molecular assays. We considered risk of bias to be high in 29 (50%) studies because of participant selection; in 66 (85%) because of weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection; and in 29 (45%) for participant flow and timing. Studies of antigen tests were of a higher methodological quality compared to studies of molecular tests, particularly regarding the risk of bias for participant selection and the index test. Characteristics of participants in 35 (45%) studies differed from those in whom the test was intended to be used and the delivery of the index test in 39 (50%) studies differed from the way in which the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (97%) defined the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 based on a single RT-PCR result, and none included participants meeting case definitions for probable COVID-19. Antigen tests Forty-eight studies reported 58 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies. There were differences between symptomatic (72.0%, 95% CI 63.7% to 79.0%; 37 evaluations; 15530 samples, 4410 cases) and asymptomatic participants (58.1%, 95% CI 40.2% to 74.1%; 12 evaluations; 1581 samples, 295 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (78.3%, 95% CI 71.1% to 84.1%; 26 evaluations; 5769 samples, 2320 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (51.0%, 95% CI 40.8% to 61.0%; 22 evaluations; 935 samples, 692 cases). Sensitivity was high in those with cycle threshold (Ct) values on PCR ≤ 25 (94.5%, 95% CI 91.0% to 96.7%; 36 evaluations; 2613 cases) compared to those with Ct values > 25 (40.7%, 95% CI 31.8% to 50.3%; 36 evaluations; 2632 cases). Sensitivity varied between brands. Using data from instructions for use (IFU) compliant evaluations in symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities ranged from 34.1% (95% CI 29.7% to 38.8%; Coris Bioconcept) to 88.1% (95% CI 84.2% to 91.1%; SD Biosensor STANDARD Q). Average specificities were high in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, and for most brands (overall summary specificity 99.6%, 95% CI 99.0% to 99.8%). At 5% prevalence using data for the most sensitive assays in symptomatic people (SD Biosensor STANDARD Q and Abbott Panbio), positive predictive values (PPVs) of 84% to 90% mean that between 1 in 10 and 1 in 6 positive results will be a false positive, and between 1 in 4 and 1 in 8 cases will be missed. At 0.5% prevalence applying the same tests in asymptomatic people would result in PPVs of 11% to 28% meaning that between 7 in 10 and 9 in 10 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. No studies assessed the accuracy of repeated lateral flow testing or self-testing. Rapid molecular assays Thirty studies reported 33 evaluations of five different rapid molecular tests. Sensitivities varied according to test brand. Most of the data relate to the ID NOW and Xpert Xpress assays. Using data from evaluations following the manufacturer's instructions for use, the average sensitivity of ID NOW was 73.0% (95% CI 66.8% to 78.4%) and average specificity 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 4 evaluations; 812 samples, 222 cases). For Xpert Xpress, the average sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 88.1% to 100%) and average specificity 97.2% (95% CI 89.4% to 99.3%; 2 evaluations; 100 samples, 29 cases). Insufficient data were available to investigate the effect of symptom status or time after symptom onset.

Authors' Conclusions

Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. The assays shown to meet appropriate criteria, such as WHO's priority target product profiles for COVID-19 diagnostics ('acceptable' sensitivity ≥ 80% and specificity ≥ 97%), can be considered as a replacement for laboratory-based RT-PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT-PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. Positive predictive values suggest that confirmatory testing of those with positive results may be considered in low prevalence settings. Due to the variable sensitivity of antigen tests, people who test negative may still be infected. Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts was limited. Test accuracy studies cannot adequately assess the ability of antigen tests to differentiate those who are infectious and require isolation from those who pose no risk, as there is no reference standard for infectiousness. A small number of molecular tests showed high accuracy and may be suitable alternatives to RT-PCR. However, further evaluations of the tests in settings as they are intended to be used are required to fully establish performance in practice. Several important studies in asymptomatic individuals have been reported since the close of our search and will be incorporated at the next update of this review. Comparative studies of antigen tests in their intended use settings and according to test operator (including self-testing) are required.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^bafd95af]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges. Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify or rule out current infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Point-of-care antigen and molecular tests to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection have the potential to allow earlier detection and isolation of confirmed cases compared to laboratory-based diagnostic methods, with the aim of reducing household and community transmission.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has current SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Search Methods

On 25 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of people with suspected current SARS-CoV-2 infection, known to have, or not to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antigen or molecular tests suitable for a point-of-care setting (minimal equipment, sample preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results available within two hours of sample collection). We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. One review author independently extracted study characteristics, which were checked by a second review author. Two review authors independently extracted 2x2 contingency table data and assessed risk of bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We present sensitivity and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each test using paired forest plots. We pooled data using the bivariate hierarchical model separately for antigen and molecular-based tests, with simplifications when few studies were available. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer.

Main Results

We included 22 publications reporting on a total of 18 study cohorts with 3198 unique samples, of which 1775 had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ten studies took place in North America, two in South America, four in Europe, one in China and one was conducted internationally. We identified data for eight commercial tests (four antigen and four molecular) and one in-house antigen test. Five of the studies included were only available as preprints. We did not find any studies at low risk of bias for all quality domains and had concerns about applicability of results across all studies. We judged patient selection to be at high risk of bias in 50% of the studies because of deliberate over-sampling of samples with confirmed COVID-19 infection and unclear in seven out of 18 studies because of poor reporting. Sixteen (89%) studies used only a single, negative RT-PCR to confirm the absence of COVID-19 infection, risking missing infection. There was a lack of information on blinding of index test (n = 11), and around participant exclusions from analyses (n = 10). We did not observe differences in methodological quality between antigen and molecular test evaluations. Antigen tests Sensitivity varied considerably across studies (from 0% to 94%): the average sensitivity was 56.2% (95% CI 29.5 to 79.8%) and average specificity was 99.5% (95% CI 98.1% to 99.9%; based on 8 evaluations in 5 studies on 943 samples). Data for individual antigen tests were limited with no more than two studies for any test. Rapid molecular assays Sensitivity showed less variation compared to antigen tests (from 68% to 100%), average sensitivity was 95.2% (95% CI 86.7% to 98.3%) and specificity 98.9% (95% CI 97.3% to 99.5%) based on 13 evaluations in 11 studies of on 2255 samples. Predicted values based on a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people with suspected COVID-19 infection (with a prevalence of 10%) result in 105 positive test results including 10 false positives (positive predictive value 90%), and 895 negative results including 5 false negatives (negative predictive value 99%). Individual tests We calculated pooled results of individual tests for ID NOW (Abbott Laboratories) (5 evaluations) and Xpert Xpress (Cepheid Inc) (6 evaluations). Summary sensitivity for the Xpert Xpress assay (99.4%, 95% CI 98.0% to 99.8%) was 22.6 (95% CI 18.8 to 26.3) percentage points higher than that of ID NOW (76.8%, (95% CI 72.9% to 80.3%), whilst the specificity of Xpert Xpress (96.8%, 95% CI 90.6% to 99.0%) was marginally lower than ID NOW (99.6%, 95% CI 98.4% to 99.9%; a difference of -2.8% (95% CI -6.4 to 0.8)) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies early-stage evaluations of point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, largely based on remnant laboratory samples. The findings currently have limited applicability, as we are uncertain whether tests will perform in the same way in clinical practice, and according to symptoms of COVID-19, duration of symptoms, or in asymptomatic people. Rapid tests have the potential to be used to inform triage of RT-PCR use, allowing earlier detection of those testing positive, but the evidence currently is not strong enough to determine how useful they are in clinical practice. Prospective and comparative evaluations of rapid tests for COVID-19 infection in clinically relevant settings are urgently needed. Studies should recruit consecutive series of eligible participants, including both those presenting for testing due to symptoms and asymptomatic people who may have come into contact with confirmed cases. Studies should clearly describe symptomatic status and document time from symptom onset or time since exposure. Point-of-care tests must be conducted on samples according to manufacturer instructions for use and be conducted at the point of care. Any future research study report should conform to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guideline.

### Effectiveness of tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, to inform COVID-19 diagnosis: a rapid systematic review [^3ab1da44]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objectives

We undertook a rapid systematic review with the aim of identifying evidence that could be used to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? (2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis?

Design and Setting

Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework.

Main Outcome Measures

Measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods.

Results

38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test. For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management.

Conclusions

Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^00c324fe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection would be a useful tool to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Testing strategies that use rapid antigen tests to detect current infection have the potential to increase access to testing, speed detection of infection, and inform clinical and public health management decisions to reduce transmission. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of rapid, point-of-care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups. Sources of heterogeneity investigated included setting and indication for testing, assay format, sample site, viral load, age, timing of test, and study design.

Search Methods

We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) on 08 March 2021. We included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, FIND and the Diagnostics Global Health website. We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of people with either suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen tests. We included evaluations of single applications of a test (one test result reported per person) and evaluations of serial testing (repeated antigen testing over time). Reference standards for presence or absence of infection were any laboratory-based molecular test (primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)) or pre-pandemic respiratory sample.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard screening procedures with three people. Two people independently carried out quality assessment (using the QUADAS-2 tool) and extracted study results. Other study characteristics were extracted by one review author and checked by a second. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test, and pooled data using the bivariate model. We investigated heterogeneity by including indicator variables in the random-effects logistic regression models. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status.

Main Results

We included 155 study cohorts (described in 166 study reports, with 24 as preprints). The main results relate to 152 evaluations of single test applications including 100,462 unique samples (16,822 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly conducted in Europe (101/152, 66%), and evaluated 49 different commercial antigen assays. Only 23 studies compared two or more brands of test. Risk of bias was high because of participant selection (40, 26%); interpretation of the index test (6, 4%); weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection (119, 78%); and participant flow and timing 41 (27%). Characteristics of participants (45, 30%) and index test delivery (47, 31%) differed from the way in which and in whom the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (91%) used a single RT-PCR result to define presence or absence of infection. The 152 studies of single test applications reported 228 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies, with consistently high specificities. Average sensitivity was higher in symptomatic (73.0%, 95% CI 69.3% to 76.4%; 109 evaluations; 50,574 samples, 11,662 cases) compared to asymptomatic participants (54.7%, 95% CI 47.7% to 61.6%; 50 evaluations; 40,956 samples, 2641 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (80.9%, 95% CI 76.9% to 84.4%; 30 evaluations, 2408 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (53.8%, 95% CI 48.0% to 59.6%; 40 evaluations, 1119 cases). For those who were asymptomatic at the time of testing, sensitivity was higher when an epidemiological exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was suspected (64.3%, 95% CI 54.6% to 73.0%; 16 evaluations; 7677 samples, 703 cases) compared to where COVID-19 testing was reported to be widely available to anyone on presentation for testing (49.6%, 95% CI 42.1% to 57.1%; 26 evaluations; 31,904 samples, 1758 cases). Average specificity was similarly high for symptomatic (99.1%) or asymptomatic (99.7%) participants. We observed a steady decline in summary sensitivities as measures of sample viral load decreased. Sensitivity varied between brands. When tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, average sensitivities by brand ranged from 34.3% to 91.3% in symptomatic participants (20 assays with eligible data) and from 28.6% to 77.8% for asymptomatic participants (12 assays). For symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities for seven assays were 80% or more (meeting acceptable criteria set by the World Health Organization (WHO)). The WHO acceptable performance criterion of 97% specificity was met by 17 of 20 assays when tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, 12 of which demonstrated specificities above 99%. For asymptomatic participants the sensitivities of only two assays approached but did not meet WHO acceptable performance standards in one study each; specificities for asymptomatic participants were in a similar range to those observed for symptomatic people. At 5% prevalence using summary data in symptomatic people during the first week after symptom onset, the positive predictive value (PPV) of 89% means that 1 in 10 positive results will be a false positive, and around 1 in 5 cases will be missed. At 0.5% prevalence using summary data for asymptomatic people, where testing was widely available and where epidemiological exposure to COVID-19 was suspected, resulting PPVs would be 38% to 52%, meaning that between 2 in 5 and 1 in 2 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed.

Authors' Conclusions

Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. Assays that meet appropriate performance standards, such as those set by WHO, could replace laboratory-based RT-PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT-PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. However, they are more suitable for use as triage to RT-PCR testing. The variable sensitivity of antigen tests means that people who test negative may still be infected. Many commercially available rapid antigen tests have not been evaluated in independent validation studies. Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts has increased, however sensitivity is lower and there is a paucity of evidence for testing in different settings. Questions remain about the use of antigen test-based repeat testing strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening programmes at reducing transmission of infection, whether mass screening or targeted approaches including schools, healthcare setting and traveller screening.

### Diagnostics for COVID-19: moving from pandemic response to control [^dad72b5f]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostics have proven to be crucial to the COVID-19 pandemic response. There are three major methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their role has evolved during the course of the pandemic. Molecular tests such as PCR are highly sensitive and specific at detecting viral RNA, and are recommended by WHO for confirming diagnosis in individuals who are symptomatic and for activating public health measures. Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others. Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery. With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear. All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role in the transition from pandemic response to pandemic control.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^c211127c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunoassays designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens (Ag) are commonly used to diagnose COVID-19. The most widely used tests are lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Ag assays have also been developed. The number of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Ag detection tests has increased rapidly, as has the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best-practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is an update to the third in a series of frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by the IDSA. IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and nonmedical settings. A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. A review of relevant, peer-reviewed published literature was conducted through 1 April 2022. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel made 10 diagnostic recommendations that address Ag testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and assess single versus repeat testing strategies. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) have high specificity and low to moderate sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Ag test sensitivity is dependent on the presence or absence of symptoms and, in symptomatic patients, on timing of testing after symptom onset. In most cases, positive Ag results can be acted upon without confirmation. Results of point-of-care testing are comparable to those of laboratory-based testing, and observed or unobserved self-collection of specimens for testing yields similar results. Modeling suggests that repeat Ag testing increases sensitivity compared with testing once, but no empirical data were available to inform this question. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the testing methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, when timely molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, Ag testing helps identify individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were insufficient to make a recommendation about the utility of Ag testing to guide release of patients with COVID-19 from isolation. The overall quality of available evidence supporting use of Ag testing was graded as very low to moderate.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing [^c10a10b8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Immunoassays designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens are now commercially available. The most widely used tests are rapid lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) assays have also been developed. The overall accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests, however, is not well defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is the third in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and non-medical settings.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on five diagnostic recommendations. These recommendations address antigen testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as well as assess single versus repeat testing strategies.

Conclusions

Data on the clinical performance of U.S. Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with Emergency Use Authorization is mostly limited to single, one-time testing versus standard nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) as the reference standard. Rapid Ag tests have high specificity and low to modest sensitivity compared to reference NAAT methods. Antigen test sensitivity is heavily dependent on viral load, with differences observed between symptomatic compared to asymptomatic individuals and the time of testing post onset of symptoms. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the diagnostic methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, when molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, Ag testing can help identify some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall quality of available evidence supporting use of Ag testing was graded as very low to moderate.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^e89c93b8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The availability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic testing has rapidly increased. Current assays use a variety of technologies, measure different classes of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin combinations and detect antibodies directed against different portions of the virus. The overall accuracy of these tests, however, has not been well-defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests in a variety of settings. We also highlight important unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, public health surveillance, vaccine development and the selection of convalescent plasma donors.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on eight diagnostic recommendations.

Conclusions

Information on the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests are rapidly emerging. Based on available evidence, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be useful for confirming the presence of current or past infection in selected situations. The panel identified three potential indications for serologic testing including: 1) evaluation of patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when molecular diagnostic testing is negative and at least two weeks have passed since symptom onset; 2) assessment of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; and 3) for conducting serosurveillance studies. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for either diagnosis or epidemiology was, however, graded as very low to moderate.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^1f1f3f2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has evolved during the pandemic as seroprevalence in global populations has increased. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct updated best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is an update to the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations and identify unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, decisions related to vaccination and administration of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma in immunocompromised patients, and identification of a serologic correlate of immunity.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature reviewed, identified, and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel recommends against serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first two weeks after symptom onset (strong recommendations, low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing should not be used to provide evidence of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients with a high clinical suspicion and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification test results (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing may assist with the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). To seek evidence for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the panel suggests testing for IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies to nucleocapsid protein three to five weeks after symptom onset (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, we suggest against routine serologic testing given no demonstrated benefit to improving patient outcomes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence.) The panel acknowledges further that a negative spike antibody test may be a useful metric to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy.

Conclusions

The high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide limits the utility of detecting anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for diagnosis was graded as very low to low. Future studies should use serologic assays calibrated to a common reference standard.

### ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines: diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 [^fea9363b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope

The objective of these guidelines is to identify the most appropriate diagnostic test and/or diagnostic approach for SARS-CoV-2. The recommendations are intended to provide guidance to clinicians, clinical microbiologists, other health care personnel, and decision makers.

Methods

An ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines task force was established by the ESCMID Executive Committee. A small group was established, half appointed by the chair and the remaining selected with an open call. Each panel met virtually once a week. For all decisions, a simple majority vote was used. A list of clinical questions using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) format was developed at the beginning of the process. For each PICO, two panel members performed a literature search focusing on systematic reviews, with a third panellist involved in case of inconsistent results. Quality of evidence assessment was based on the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation - adoption, adaptation, and de novo development of recommendations) approach.

Recommendations

A total of 43 PICO questions were selected that involve the following types of populations: (a) patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19; (b) travellers, healthcare workers, and other individuals at risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2; (c) asymptomatic individuals, and (d) close contacts of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The type of diagnostic test (commercial rapid nucleic acid amplification tests and rapid antigen detection), biomaterial, time since onset of symptoms/contact with an infectious case, age, disease severity, and risk of developing severe disease are also taken into consideration.

### Guidelines on newly identified limitations of diagnostic tools for COVID-19 and consequences [^bd739e85]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus has spread worldwide and has become the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century. Such rapid spread is predominantly attributed to the poor diagnosis and its asymptomatic transmission. In the absence of treatment regime, timely diagnosis is the best available remedy that can restrict its spread. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for determining the line of treatment and preventing long term complications in the infected subject. Unfortunately, available rapid antigen and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false-negative results imposed a major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications. In this article, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures have been elaborated and plausible combination approach has been advised.

### Update of European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases coronavirus disease 2019 guidelines: diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [^71daaccf]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Scope

Since the onset of COVID-19, several assays have been deployed for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first set of guidelines on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnosis in February 2022. Because the COVID-19 landscape is rapidly evolving, the relevant ESCMID guidelines panel releases an update of the previously published recommendations on diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2. This update aims to delineate the best diagnostic approach for SARS-CoV-2 in different populations based on current evidence.

Methods

An ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines task force was established by the ESCMID Executive Committee. A small group was established, half appointed by the chair, and the remaining selected with an open call. The panel met virtually once a week. For all decisions, a simple majority vote was used. A list of clinical questions using the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) format was developed at the beginning of the process. For each PICO, 2 panel members performed a literature search focusing on systematic reviews with a third panellist involved in case of inconsistent results. The panel reassessed the PICOs previously defined as priority in the first set of guidelines and decided to address 49 PICO questions, because 6 of them were discarded as outdated/non-clinically relevant. The 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)-adoption, adaptation, and de novo development of recommendations (ADOLOPMENT)' evidence-to-decision framework was used to produce the guidelines.

Questions Addressed By The Guidelines and Recommendations

After literature search, we updated 16 PICO questions; these PICOs address the use of antigen-based assays among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with different ages, COVID-19 severity status or risk for severe COVID-19, time since the onset of symptoms/contact with an infectious case, and finally, types of biomaterials used.

### When should asymptomatic persons Be tested for COVID-19? [^f204b8d3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

On 24 August 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its website to highlight that asymptomatic individuals, even those with exposure to a COVID-19-positive contact, do not necessarily need to be tested unless they have medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The CDC subsequently updated its guidance on 19 September 2020 to support testing of asymptomatic persons, including close contacts of persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this editorial, the American Society for Microbiology Clinical and Public Health Microbiology Committee's Subcommittee on Laboratory Practices comments on testing of asymptomatic individuals relative to current medical knowledge of the virus and mitigation measures. Specific points are provided concerning such testing when undertaking contact tracing and routine surveillance. Limitations to consider when testing asymptomatic persons are covered, including the need to prioritize testing of contacts of positive COVID-19 cases. We urge the CDC to consult with primary stakeholders of COVID-19 testing when making such impactful changes in testing guidance.

### Interpreting COVID-19 test results in clinical settings: It depends! [^9bf139f5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as "cohorting" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.

### The laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019-frequently asked questions [^b475ba0a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic testing has played and will continue to play a major role in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The ability to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory secretions is essential to determine when an individual is infected and potentially infectious to others. Viral detection is used for the identification, management, and isolation of individual patients. Viral detection is also used to determine when the virus has entered a community and how rapidly it is spreading. As communities attempt to reopen following periods of shutdown, the detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and specific antibodies that recognize the virus will become increasingly important as a means to assess infection and immunity in individuals and communities. Here, we discuss questions commonly asked by clinicians about COVID-19 diagnostic testing.

### The role of antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2: is there one? [^7ba86f5d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) brought with it rapid development of both molecular and serologic assays for identification of COVID-19 infections. While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays. The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen, and the acceptable specimen types. An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate or, perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate. Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role during our global response to this pandemic.

In this commentary, we provide a broad overview of how the rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostic landscape has impacted clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We review aspects of both molecular and serologic testing and discuss the logistical challenges faced with each. We also highlight the progress that has been made in the development and implementation of these assays as well as the need for ongoing improvement in diagnostic testing capabilities.

### Considerations for diagnostic COVID-19 tests [^ba3baee9]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

During the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, design, development, validation, verification and implementation of diagnostic tests were actively addressed by a large number of diagnostic test manufacturers. Hundreds of molecular tests and immunoassays were rapidly developed, albeit many still await clinical validation and formal approval. In this Review, we summarize the crucial role of diagnostic tests during the first global wave of COVID-19. We explore the technical and implementation problems encountered during this early phase in the pandemic, and try to define future directions for the progressive and better use of (syndromic) diagnostics during a possible resurgence of COVID-19 in future global waves or regional outbreaks. Continuous global improvement in diagnostic test preparedness is essential for more rapid detection of patients, possibly at the point of care, and for optimized prevention and treatment, in both industrialized countries and low-resource settings.

### Quantifying the potential value of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19: a modelling analysis [^bde61149]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Testing plays a critical role in treatment and prevention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to nucleic acid tests (NATs), antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can be more accessible, but typically have lower sensitivity and specificity. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aimed to inform decisions about when an Ag-RDT would offer greater public health value than reliance on NAT.

Methods

Following an expert consultation, we selected two use cases for analysis: rapid identification of people with COVID-19 amongst patients admitted with respiratory symptoms in a 'hospital' setting and early identification and isolation of people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 in a 'community' setting. Using decision analysis, we evaluated the health system cost and health impact (deaths averted and infectious days isolated) of an Ag-RDT-led strategy, compared to a strategy based on NAT and clinical judgement. We adopted a broad range of values for 'contextual' parameters relevant to a range of settings, including the availability of NAT and the performance of clinical judgement. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis to all of these parameters.

Results

In a hospital setting, an Ag-RDT-led strategy would avert more deaths than a NAT-based strategy, and at lower cost per death averted, when the sensitivity of clinical judgement is less than 90%, and when NAT results are available in time to inform clinical decision-making for less than 85% of patients. The use of an Ag-RDT is robustly supported in community settings, where it would avert more transmission at lower cost than relying on NAT alone, under a wide range of assumptions.

Conclusions

Despite their imperfect sensitivity and specificity, Ag-RDTs have the potential to be simultaneously more impactful, and have a lower cost per death and infectious person-days averted, than current approaches to COVID-19 diagnostic testing.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19 disease, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The tests included in this review concern the identification of current infection, as defined by reference standard methods of diagnosis, including molecular assays such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), or internationally recognized clinical guidelines for diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2. In the context of test evaluation, and throughout this review, we use the term 'reference standard' to denote the best available method (test or tests) for diagnosing the target condition, as opposed to other uses of the term in diagnostic virology (such as reference methods or reference materials).

### The role of antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2: is there one? [^ff3af558]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

TEXT

Shortly after its emergence in December 2019, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. A betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses and is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Given the acute and rapid onset of COVID-19, molecular testing of respiratory tract sample(s) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA remains the preferred diagnostic test for assessment of symptomatic patients who meet COVID-19 testing criteria as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and/or state and local health departments. In addition to molecular testing, there is increasing interest for use of serologic assays to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike molecular testing, detection of an immune response to the virus is an indirect marker of infection. As such, development of robust serologic tests, alongside guidelines for appropriate utilization and interpretation relative to clinical and epidemiological needs, is essential to maintain safe patient care standards and support ongoing public health efforts.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^c327e1e2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Tracking contacts of SARS‐CoV‐2 cases for evidence of infection provides the best insight into the dynamics of viral transmission, however this requires longitudinal follow‐up and predictive modelling to take into account host, agent and environmental factors, all of which influence risk of transmission. This contrasts with the diagnostic test accuracy paradigm which can only determine if individuals are infected at a single point in time.

Because of the lack of a suitable reference standard for detection of 'infectiousness', this review only focuses on the target condition of 'infection' for applications of tests in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Although the presence of COVID‐19 can be defined clinically (e.g. for individuals with negative RT‐PCR results), the primary reference standard for presence or absence of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is RT‐PCR. While acknowledging the potential for between‐study variability in viral load associated with Ct values in particular, we report results in subgroups by Ct value and by RNA copies/mL, and continue to advise caution in interpretation. Given the current state of the scientific knowledge we do not consider it appropriate to consider these as groups that are 'infectious' or 'not infectious'.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — For symptomatic patients, the IDSA panel suggests using standard NAAT over rapid antigen (Ag) tests due to higher sensitivity, and because Ag tests have very high specificity a positive result is actionable immediately and does not require routine confirmation; however, if Ag tests are used, a negative Ag test result should be confirmed with a standard NAAT when clinical suspicion remains, and testing within the first 5 days of symptoms optimizes Ag sensitivity with Ag testing done within 5 days of symptom onset to minimize false negatives and to diagnose patients within the treatment eligibility window.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 antigen testing — conclusions on diagnostic performance and use: Antigen (Ag) testing had a sensitivity of 80% in symptomatic individuals and 63% in asymptomatic persons, with pooled specificities of close to 100% in both populations, compared with a single standard nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Despite the low sensitivity of Ag tests, standard NAAT remains the benchmark testing approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially when the pretest probability of infection is moderate to high or the harms of falsely negative results are significant. When standard NAAT is not available, timely, or feasible, Ag testing can be used without the need to routinely confirm positive test results. A negative Ag test does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection; ideally, negative Ag test results should be confirmed by standard NAAT if the suspicion of COVID-19 is moderate or high, and repeat Ag testing may be considered when standard NAAT is not an option. A negative Ag test does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness, although a positive Ag test makes infectiousness more likely.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — diagnostic accuracy in symptomatic populations: Due to lack of direct evidence comparing Ag testing and standard NAAT with a threshold for determination, we relied on diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection using standard NAAT as the reference standard. To calculate standard NAAT diagnostic test accuracy, pooled results from 5 studies yielded sensitivity 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) and specificity 100% (95% CI: 96% to 100%). For comparative results, 70 studies — 65 informing Ag testing and the 5 informing standard NAAT — reported 26 021 positive and 51 593 negative results. The pooled sensitivity for Ag testing was 81% (95% CI: 78% to 84%) and the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 100% to 100%). This resulted in an additional 8 to 80 false-negative Ag test results.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing in symptomatic individuals is addressed with the recommendation: test over no test. (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence) Symptomatic individuals were defined as those with at least 1 of the common symptoms of COVID-19. For optimal performance, Ag tests should be used within 5 days of symptom onset; the panel identified no studies that reported Ag test performance on the first or second day of symptoms. If clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains high, a negative Ag result should be confirmed by standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). A single Ag test has high specificity; a positive result can be used to help guide treatment and isolation decisions without confirmation. There were limited data regarding the analytical performance of Ag tests in children, immunocompromised or vaccinated individuals, or in those who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The panel was unable to identify studies that compared the risk of transmission among patients recovering from COVID-19 who were released from isolation based on results of Ag testing versus no testing. We found no direct evidence that assessed patient- or population-centered outcomes of testing versus no testing in symptomatic patients. The reference standard in the included studies was standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). We identified 65 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Ag testing as compared with NAAT as a reference test in symptomatic individuals. The studies included 20 272 individuals for sensitivity.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing in symptomatic patients — benefits and harms indicate that within 5 days of symptom onset the false-negative rate ranged from 5 (range: 3 to 8) per 1000 at 5% prevalence to 55 (range: 35 to 85) per 1000 at 50% prevalence, while specificity remained close to 100% regardless of time from symptom onset. After 5 days of symptoms, sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 44% to 64%), and because of potential harms a negative result in someone with continued suspicion for COVID-19 should be confirmed promptly with a standard NAAT. As currently available therapies are recommended to be started within 5 days of symptoms, Ag testing during this period yielded almost no false-positive results even when prevalence was as low as 5% (range: 0 to 9 false-positive results per 1000 patients tested).

We considered 5%, 10%, and 20% as prevalences of SARS-CoV-2 in the overall population, and point-of-care Ag testing showed 3 to 14 more false-negatives per 1000 individuals tested compared with laboratory-based Ag testing, depending on the prevalence. If the test was completed at the bedside immediately after specimen collection, it was considered as POC, whereas if the test was completed after transport of a specimen to a laboratory, it was considered laboratory based.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing — recommendation strength and clinical use relative to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) — uses Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), where recommendations are categorized as "strong" or "conditional", with "recommend" indicating a strong recommendation and "suggest" indicating a conditional recommendation. Given the superior sensitivity of molecular diagnostics, the panel suggests using standard NAAT over Ag tests if standard NAAT is available and results of testing will be timely; however, rapid Ag testing has value when timely NAAT is unavailable, especially when results are positive, because the high specificity of Ag testing means that positive results are actionable without needing confirmation. In contrast, negative Ag results should be confirmed by standard NAAT when clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is high, and the panel notes treatment options are typically approved for administration within 5 days of symptom onset.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — first 2 weeks after symptom onset: The IDSA panel recommends against using serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 weeks following symptom onset (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Most studies included in this recommendation's literature review assessed unvaccinated individuals and so the panel's findings might not apply to individuals who have been vaccinated, especially with respect to specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Similarly, in today's population there is a higher likelihood of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than assessed in the included studies, which could also negatively affect specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Analogous to other respiratory viruses where nonserologic tests are preferred for diagnosis of acute infection, serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

Serologic testing to assess previous SARS-CoV-2 infection — antibody class — Recommendation 4 states that when evidence of previous infection is desired, the panel suggests testing for IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies 3 to 5 weeks after symptom onset and suggests against testing for IgM (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). For diagnosis of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 NAAT and antigen tests have superior performance characteristics compared with serology, and there are very limited situations in which antibody testing might be useful (eg, helping to diagnose MIS-C). Across included studies, sensitivity analyses used 24 to 2591 samples and specificity analyses used 386 to 1537 samples; pooled sensitivity ranged at week 3 from 83% to 93%, at week 4 from 86% to 95%, at week 5 from 89% to 95%, at week 6 from 85% to 97%, at week 7 between 73% and 92%, and at week 8 between 73% and 94%, while pooled specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. IgM consistently demonstrated the lowest analytical sensitivity compared with IgG alone, IgM/IgG, or total antibodies. The certainty of evidence was low for sensitivity and moderate for specificity, quality was rated downward for serious indirectness and unexplained inconsistency, and results may overestimate test accuracy in contemporary populations with high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence.

### Testing for COVID-19… [^0c098201]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests Nucleic acid amplification tests, including PCR tests, are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. NAATs tests are the "gold standard" for COVID-19 tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing and may take up to 3 days to receive results. Some NAATs may be performed at the point-of-care and provide results more quickly. Antigen Tests Antigen tests are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15–30 minutes. Positive results are accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than NAAT tests, especially when symptoms are not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection. To be confident you do not have COVID-19, FDA recommends 2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart.

A single NAAT test can be used to confirm an antigen test result. Self-tests, or at-home tests, are antigen tests that can be taken anywhere without having to go to a specific testing site. Read self-test package inserts thoroughly and follow the instructions closely when performing the test. When you get tested
- Choose the right type of test for your circumstance.
- When using an antigen test, follow the recommendations provided by FDA and the test's manufacturer.
- If you do not, your results may be less likely to correctly indicate whether you have COVID-19 or not. Choosing a COVID-19 test I want to get tested and: I have not had COVID-19 or I have not had a positive test within the past 90 days. You may choose a NAAT, including PCR, or antigen test. If you use an antigen test and your result is negative, repeat testing following FDA recommendations. I tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days.

My first positive test result was within 31–90 days: I have symptoms: Use an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following FDA recommendations. I do not have symptoms: Use an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following FDA recommendations. After a positive test result, you may continue to test positive for some time. Some tests, especially NAAT tests, may continue to show a positive result for up to 90 days.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^b05f6bd8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing in patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) offers low clinical benefit with very low-certainty evidence; reported positivity varied widely (IgM or IgG 11% to 62%; PCR-negative/total antibody-positive 0% to 60%), studies varied by assay and timing (eg, < 20 days vs > 15 days), and in unvaccinated or previously uninfected individuals the negative predictive value is high when testing is performed more than 2 weeks after symptom onset. In this instance, negative serologic results should prompt further evaluation for alternative etiologies if symptoms persist. Serology cannot distinguish recent from remote infection or vaccine response from infection, and assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies provides no added benefit over repeat NAATs for diagnosing acute COVID-19 and may lead to diagnostic uncertainty.

SARS-CoV-2 testing in the absence of COVID-19–like symptoms should be individualized. A one-time standard NAAT may be considered if the test result will impact an individual's subsequent actions. Access to timely results of standard NAAT may be unavailable or limited in some settings; in such situations, use of an Ag test can be considered. The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting COVID-19 therapy in asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatments approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19 but acknowledges that individual clinical decisions may need to be made and discussed with patients.

### Overview of testing for SARS-CoV-2 | COVID-19… [^97e38424]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Test types Viral tests, including nucleic acid amplification tests and PCR tests, as well as antigen tests, are used as diagnostic tests to detect current infection with SARS-CoV-2, determine the need for prevention measures, and inform a person's medical care.
- Antigen tests are immunoassays that detect the presence of specific viral proteins, called antigens. A positive test indicates current infection. Antigen tests generally have high specificity, similar to NAATs, but are less sensitive than most NAATs. Because antigen tests have lower sensitivity, FDA recommends that negative antigen tests be repeated up to three times, with each test 48 hours apart to confirm a negative result. Most antigen tests are less expensive than NAATs and can provide results in minutes. Antigen tests are available for at-home testing, at the point of care, or in a laboratory.

Antibody tests detect specific antibodies that target different parts of the virus. Detection of anti-nucleocapsid antibody indicates SARS-CoV-2 infection, while anti-spike protein antibody may be induced by COVID-19 vaccination or by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This should be considered when choosing whether to test for antibodies originating from past infection versus those from vaccination. Diagnostic testing T esting individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 Positive test results using a viral test in individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 indicate that the person has COVID-19. A negative antigen test in individuals with signs or symptoms of COVID-19 should be repeated following FDA recommendations or confirmed by NAAT.

Antibody testing is not currently recommended to assess a person's protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 following COVID-19 vaccination or prior infection, or to assess the need for vaccination in an unvaccinated person. Antibody testing can be used in the diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults. To evaluate for evidence of previous infection in a vaccinated individual, use an antibody test specifically evaluating IgM/IgG to the nucleocapsid protein. For example, specific antibody tests can be used for public health surveillance. Additional information

IDSA algorithm for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection — community exposure testing timing and assay approaches are outlined as follows: individuals who have been exposed to someone known or suspected of having COVID-19 should be tested at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days, they should get tested immediately. For nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), either rapid or standard laboratory-based testing is suggested, and NAAT refers to rapid (i.e. ≤ 60 minutes in-laboratory turnaround time) or laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification test. Either point-of-care or laboratory-based antigen testing is suggested. The panel makes no recommendation for or against antigen testing for students in educational settings, employees at work, or individuals planning to attend a large social gathering, and no recommendation for or against home testing using NAAT. For timing of repeat testing for a specific assay, users should consult the respective assay package insert or the latest FDA guidance.

At-home over-the-counter COVID-19 antigen tests, often referred to as rapid tests, detect proteins called antigens from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. At-home COVID-19 antigen tests are less likely to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus than molecular tests, such as polymerase chain reaction tests and other nucleic acid amplification tests, which detect genetic material called RNA from the virus. This is especially true early in an infection or in people who do not have COVID-19 symptoms. Currently, all at-home COVID-19 antigen tests that are FDA-authorized are authorized for repeat testing, also called serial testing. This means people who receive a negative test result should use multiple tests over a certain period, testing at least twice over three days if they have symptoms and at least three times over five days if they do not have symptoms. A positive resultusing an at-home COVID-19 antigen test means you likely have COVID-19.

Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19, or who likely has COVID-19, should contact their health care provider and follow the CDC's guidelines for staying at home and away from people. A negative resultusing at-home COVID-19 antigen test means the test did not detect the virus that causes COVID-19, but it does notrule out COVID-19 because some tests may not detect the virus early in an infection. Always do a repeat test at minimum after 48 hours following a negative test result when using an antigen test. Use the following guidance to help interpret your negative test result and determine what steps to take next. In addition to COVID-19 test results, and when determining the likelihood of having the virus, consider:

- Recent symptoms
- Close contact with someone who has COVID-19
- The level of COVID-19 in your community.

What At-home COVID-19 Antigen Tests Do Not Tell You
- If you have an infection immediately after you are exposed to COVID-19 because it may take 2 to 5 days, and sometimes longer, for the virus to be detected by a COVID-19 antigen test. How long it takes before a test can detect the virus may vary between different COVID-19 variants and different tests.

IDSA COVID-19 diagnostics — evidence summary for asymptomatic exposure: There were no studies that reported patient- or population-based outcomes of Ag testing versus no testing in asymptomatic persons. The reference standard in the studies included was standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). For calculation of the standard NAAT reference standard, pooled results from 5 studies comparing standard NAAT with a composite reference showed a pooled sensitivity of 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96% to 100%). For this PICO question, 64 studies were included — 59 informing Ag testing and 5 informing standard NAAT with 4902 positive and 98 071 negative patient test results — and for Ag testing the pooled sensitivity was 63% (95% CI: 56% to 69%) and the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 100% to 100%); the IDSA panel considered 1%, 5%, and 10% as the prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients with known exposure.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^64a36b77]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — diagnostic accuracy within the first 2 weeks after symptom onset is based on 11 studies comparing serology with reverse transcription PCR, with included sample sizes for sensitivity analyses ranging from 1137 to 5161 and for specificity analyses from 4388 to 22,321; pooled specificity ranged from 98% to 99%. At 1 week after symptom onset, pooled sensitivity was 27% for IgM and 24% for IgG, and at 2 weeks it was 64% for IgM and 66% for IgG; although IgM responses often occur earlier for infections in general, with SARS-CoV-2 there does not appear to be a substantial difference in detection timing between IgM and IgG. If performed within 14 days of symptom onset, low sensitivity can yield many falsely negative results, and despite calculated specificity of 98%–99%, low-specificity assays can produce false-positive results for recent infection leading to incorrect conclusions and unnecessary actions. Serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — benefits and harms of unobserved self-collection: The potential benefit of unobserved Ag testing is that tests are readily available, and testing may be more likely to be performed and performed faster than if observed testing needed to be arranged, which may particularly benefit individuals without convenient access to a testing facility or those who prefer to avoid healthcare facilities. Observed testing adds cost to patient care. The potential harm of Ag testing is the risk of a false-negative result, which can provide false assurance and facilitate spread, and in symptomatic infected persons may result in failure to treat; harms may be mitigated by clear instructions and understanding that a negative test does not rule out infection and should prompt follow-up testing.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — false positives and confirmatory testing: Given the high specificity of EUA rapid Ag tests, routine confirmation of positive test results is not usually necessary; positive results can be used immediately to help guide treatment, isolation, and quarantine decisions. Even when the pretest probability or prevalence is low (ie, 1%), the expected number of false-positive Ag results is very small, on the order of 0–10 false-positive results per 1000 individuals tested, and confirmation of positive Ag test results may be considered rarely on a case-by-case basis when the pretest probability or prevalence of infection is very low (ie, < 1%) and/or if the impact of a potential false-positive result is deemed to be significant and detrimental. Concerns about false-positive Ag results were not borne out in the medical literature.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic exposed individuals — benefits and harms: The panel placed high value on minimizing the number of false-negative results, especially in higher-risk healthcare settings, and found no evidence that the use of Ag tests reduces transmission of SARS-CoV-2; furthermore, treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic persons. Users of rapid Ag tests may not understand the limits of a negative test; in 1 study, two-thirds of participants believed that they were noninfectious the day following a negative rapid Ag test. Sensitivity is linked to timing of exposure; a negative result may convert to positive within hours early in infection. At 1% prevalence, the number of true-positive Ag test results was small and approximated the number of false-negative results, quantified as 6 true positives and 4 false negatives per 1000 asymptomatic individuals tested.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic individuals — modeled outcomes and practical considerations: With a 10% prevalence of infection, 63 true positives (95% CI: 56–69) and 37 false negatives (95% CI: 31–44) were detected, and the number of false-positive results was estimated to be 0 with a true prevalence between 1% and 10%; routine confirmation of positive Ag test results does not appear to be necessary in most cases. Additional considerations include that there are currently no treatment options approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, the panel found no direct evidence that testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals reduces risk of transmission, postexposure monoclonal antibody prophylaxis may be an alternative to testing in high-risk asymptomatic individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 if and when EUA options exist, and education on interpretation of rapid Ag tests is important; the decision to pursue rapid Ag testing versus no testing should be individualized, and antigen testing may be useful in guiding mitigation efforts during an outbreak.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing — serial testing and evidence gaps — had no empirical data identified to inform the value of serial versus single sample testing compared with molecular testing, so mathematical modeling suggested that repeat testing would improve sensitivity; on 11 August 2022, the FDA issued recommendations for repeat Ag testing to diagnose COVID-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. A cited preprint reported improved sensitivity when asymptomatic study participants tested 3 times at 48-hour intervals and symptomatic study participants tested 2 times within 48 hours. Evidence gaps included performance in vaccinated, previously infected, immunocompromised, or recent variant-infected individuals; in a literature search through April 2022, the panel identified only 1 study that included persons tested after November 2021, and all studies compared Ag with molecular test results with none using a clinical reference standard.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) testing — EUA status, indications, and timing — is characterized as follows: As of September 2022, 51 SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests have received EUA from the FDA, including lateral flow assays with results read either visually or by an instrument in approximately 15 minutes, while other immunoassays typically generate results in under 1 hour of instrument run time. Most EUA Ag tests are labeled for symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19, an increasing number are labeled for postexposure screening of asymptomatic persons, and most Ag tests have indications for use within the first 5, 7, 12, or 14 days of symptom onset depending on the test. During the public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services allowed use of all Ag tests in asymptomatic individuals, and Ag testing may be completed once (single test) or sequentially over time (repeated tests). On 23 September 2021, the FDA revised certain EUAs to require evaluation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations and updated authorized labeling, and this guideline addresses the use of EUA-designated Ag tests but not their use for public health surveillance; rapid Ag testing can also be deployed outside clinic or hospital settings with assays performed by nonmedical staff.

COVID-19 symptomatic testing — additional considerations for NAAT versus repeat antigen testing: While repeat Ag testing is potentially a faster option, by definition it means that an initial test is negative but the person may still be infected. In symptomatic individuals, the recommended test is NAAT; however, access to NAAT testing may be limited (eg, on weekends and holidays) and is more costly than Ag testing, and therefore Ag testing may be preferred in some scenarios, and the time to results of standard NAAT may be delayed if there is not a rapid and reliable system in place to communicate results to healthcare providers and patients.

The panel notes there was no direct evidence comparing 2 Ag tests vs a single standard NAAT and therefore based its analysis on modeling diagnostic test accuracy using a repeat testing algorithm involving 2 consecutive Ag tests, with assumed SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, 5%, and 10% in an asymptomatic population and with household contacts representing high-risk exposure (eg, 10% prevalence of a secondary case of asymptomatic COVID-19). In this modeling, the sensitivity and specificity of Ag testing and repeat testing were found to be 86% (95% CI: 80% to 90%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively, and standard NAAT diagnostic test accuracy data were pooled from 5 studies.

### Greater public health impact of COVID-19 antigen detection tests [^3288147a]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection prevents widespread transmission, manages outbreak control, improves poor prognosis, and reduces mortality of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Policymakers, public health authorities, healthcare providers, and physicians have deployed COVID-19 control intervention and have made crucial decisions in choosing the appropriate COVID-19 diagnostic tests.

Advantages of antigen detection tests

Antigen detection tests are diagnostic tests that quickly detect viral components or the virus directly without the need for a laboratory by testing samples collected from nasopharyngeal swabs and urine, and only reveal the active viral infection, not the recovery situation. They are faster, cheaper, and easier-to-use compared with nucleic acid tests, and provide good clinical performance with more reliable results for patients with a shorter clinical course of the disease or a higher viral load. The sensitivity of antigen detection tests are generally lower than that of nucleic acid tests, even though their specificity are comparable. Currently, a new COVID-19 antigen detection test with higher sensitivity (greater than 95%) and 100% specificity is available. Antigen detection tests with high sensitivity and specificity are expected to play an increasingly important role in the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and will be more useful in hospitals, communities, and airports around the world.

Impact of antigen detection tests

Ricks et al. now report in BMC Medicine greater healthcare cost-saving and health outcomes of antigen detection rapid diagnostic tests compared to nucleic acid tests for symptomatic persons. The main outcomes in the study are the health system costs and health impacts (deaths averted and infectious days isolated). Antigen-detection rapid diagnostic test-led strategy is compared to a strategy based on nucleic acid tests and clinical judgment. Two important case scenarios are considered; in the hospital setting where the test is used to support infection control and treatment decisions among patients being admitted to hospital with respiratory symptoms, and in the community setting where the test is used in decentralized community clinics to identify cases of COVID-19 who should self-isolate. The authors extend their approach across countries by consulting experts from India, Nigeria, South Africa, and Brazil. They demonstrate that an antigen-detection rapid diagnostic test-led strategy is likely to improve health outcomes and be more inexpensive than a strategy based on nucleic acid tests and clinical judgment, in both hospital and community settings. Their approach is distinct from a conventional cost-effectiveness plane.

### Combining rapid antigen testing and syndromic surveillance improves community-based COVID-19 detection in a low-income country [^1ae98acb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

A key limitation of both rapid tests and syndromic surveillance is their low effectiveness at COVID-19 detection in asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic cases are known to play a role in driving transmission. Resource limitations mean that many health agencies and governments have exclusively or temporarily targeted interventions towards symptomatic individuals to reduce transmission. Asymptomatic cases can still be identified through contact tracing from symptomatic patients. Reliable diagnosis of symptomatic cases of COVID-19, therefore, is a priority in many settings and is the focus of this paper.

Even for symptomatic patients, neither rapid tests nor syndromic surveillance can match PCR in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. However, lower sensitivity and specificity may be admissible depending on the scale and impact of misclassification. Indeed, there are costs to both individuals and societies that must be considered when making policy decisions to determine the most appropriate approach to testing. Low specificity means more common COVID-19 misdiagnoses (false positives), leading to unnecessary self-isolation, which is expensive to individuals and society. Low sensitivity means COVID-19 cases will be missed (false negatives) and mitigation measures not put in place leading to increased transmission and disease burden. These misclassifications are complementary for a given diagnostic, meaning increasing specificity will lead to decreased sensitivity, and vice versa.

Assessment of methodological quality

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS‐2 checklist tailored to this review (Appendix 6; Whiting 2011). The two review authors resolved any disagreements by discussion.

Ideally, studies should prospectively recruit a representative sample of participants presenting with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19, either in community or primary care settings or to a hospital setting, and they should clearly record the time of testing after the onset of symptoms. Studies in asymptomatic people at risk of infection should document time from exposure. Studies should perform tests in their intended use setting, using appropriate samples with or without viral transport medium and within the time period following specimen collection as indicated in the 'instructions for use' document. Tests should be performed by relevant personnel (e.g. healthcare workers), and should be interpreted blinded to the final diagnosis (presence or absence of SARS‐CoV‐2). The reference standard diagnosis should be blinded to the result of the rapid test, and should not incorporate the result of the index test. We did not consider a comparison of a rapid molecular‐based test against an RT‐PCR assay to be at risk of incorporation bias. If the reference standard includes clinical diagnosis of COVID‐19 for RT‐PCR‐negative patients, then established criteria should be used. Studies including samples from participants known not to have COVID‐19 should use pre‐pandemic sources or contemporaneous samples with at least one RT‐PCR‐negative test result. Data should be reported for all study participants, including those where the result of the rapid test was inconclusive, or participants in whom the final diagnosis of COVID‐19 was uncertain. Studies should report whether results relate to participants (one sample per participant), or samples (multiple samples per participant).

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing guidelines — overview of diagnostic role and evidence: Immunoassays detecting SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens are commonly used, with lateral flow assays generating results in approximately 15 minutes at the point of care. US Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests with Emergency Use Authorization have high specificity and low to moderate sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification testing, and sensitivity depends on symptom status and, in symptomatic patients, on timing after symptom onset. In most cases, positive results can be acted upon without confirmation. Results of point-of-care testing are comparable to laboratory-based testing, and observed or unobserved self-collection yields similar results. Modeling suggests repeat antigen testing increases sensitivity compared with testing once, but no empirical data were available. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the testing methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection; when timely molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, antigen testing helps identify individuals with infection. The panel used GRADE, reviewed literature through 1 April 2022, and graded the overall quality of evidence as very low to moderate.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing — performance versus nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) — shows very high specificity with variable sensitivity by symptoms and timing; the overall specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests was 99% or higher compared with standard NAAT, and routine confirmation of positive Ag results by a reference molecular method is not necessary in most settings. Pooled Ag test sensitivity was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78% to 84%) for symptomatic individuals and 89% (95% CI: 83% to 93%) if testing occurred within the first 5 days of illness; after 5 days of symptoms, sensitivity dropped to 54% (95% CI: 42% to 66%). Among asymptomatic individuals, the pooled sensitivity of Ag testing was 63%, and antigen tests performed similarly in adults and children although data on children were limited.

Asymptomatic antigen testing prior to large gatherings — evidence and guidance: No direct evidence compared antigen (Ag) testing with no testing before large gatherings, and therefore no recommendation for or against testing was made. Available data came from a single home Ag study in asymptomatic individuals with 86 positive and 601 negative nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results; rapid home Ag test sensitivity and specificity were 41% (95% CI: 25% to 61%) and 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%), respectively, considered alongside community prevalence scenarios of 1%, 5%, and 10%. Certainty of evidence was very low for sensitivity and low for specificity due to indirectness and imprecision. One-time Ag testing immediately before an event may potentially reduce transmission in settings of moderate to high community asymptomatic infection prevalence (ie, ≥ 10%) where distancing is not possible, attendees are unmasked, or ventilation is poor; however, there is no empirical evidence to date that Ag testing reduces the risk of transmission.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing in asymptomatic individuals — benefits, harms, and implementation considerations emphasize that antigen tests have reduced sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals compared with standard NAAT, and Ag testing detects infection during a narrower window of time, while the specificity of Ag testing compared with standard NAAT is high, approaching 100% (Table 7). The potential harm of using an Ag test instead of a standard NAAT is the potential for false-negative results, which may be most harmful in high-risk settings such as healthcare settings and may also lead to transmission, especially if infection-prevention practices depend on test results. The panel highlights that there are currently no treatment options approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic individuals, assumed that asymptomatic individuals are contagious at some point during infection, and found no direct evidence that testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals reduces risk of transmission. The panel concludes that standard NAATs will detect the larger number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a greater number of opportunities to prevent transmission compared with currently available Ag tests, with the greatest impact when community prevalence is moderate to high (ie, ≥ 10%); however, less-sensitive rapid Ag tests may still be helpful in some lower prevalence settings when standard NAAT is not available, antigen testing is expected to detect infection when viral load is high, and routine confirmation of positive results is not necessary in most situations. Prior analysis on this question estimated additional 4 to 34 false-negative results with Ag testing when the prevalence ranged between 1% and 10%.

If standard NAAT is not available or results are expected to be delayed more than 1 day, the IDSA panel suggests using a rapid Ag test over standard NAAT. For optimal performance, Ag tests should be used within 5 days of symptom onset; the panel was unable to identify any study that reported results of Ag testing within 2 days of symptom onset. The panel was unable to identify studies comparing the risk of transmission among patients recovering from COVID-19 who were released from isolation based on results of Ag testing versus results of standard NAAT.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — serial testing to reduce transmission and cost-effectiveness: Despite the common use of single or serial Ag testing to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools, colleges, workplaces, and before large social gatherings, we were unable to identify any empirical evidence in support of these practices. Mathematical modeling has suggested that repeated Ag testing will help overcome the sensitivity limitations of rapid Ag tests and that the frequency of testing and turnaround time to results may be just as important as test sensitivity in certain situations. Well-designed studies are needed to measure the effect of repeated testing strategies on analytical test performance and transmission events in a variety of settings, and the cost-effectiveness of repeated Ag testing versus less-frequent rapid RT-PCR, or potentially no testing depending on prevalence, needs to be determined; assessments of cost should also factor in the resources required to scale-up testing.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — discussion of rapid point-of-care (POC) versus laboratory-based assays: The availability, simplicity, and relative low cost of rapid Ag tests have enabled expanded testing initiatives, particularly outside clinical settings. Laboratory-based Ag testing allows testing larger numbers of specimens at one time, but transport to centralized laboratories increases turnaround time. More performance data were available for rapid Ag tests than for laboratory-based tests, yet the sensitivity and specificity of rapid POC versus laboratory-based Ag tests appear to be comparable, and a key finding of this review is that rapid Ag tests have very high specificity.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — Recommendation 9 (testing modality) states that for individuals for whom Ag testing is desired, the IDSA panel suggests either POC or laboratory-based Ag testing, while noting that results appear comparable but studies did not report symptomatic versus asymptomatic proportions, which may have minimized differences between the 2 strategies. (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — clinical interpretation and research needs in symptomatic individuals: Positive Ag tests in symptomatic individuals have a high positive-predictive value for COVID-19 and can be used to help guide decision making about treatment and isolation of patients, consistent with local public health guidance. Negative Ag tests in symptomatic individuals do not rule out infection; individuals with a negative Ag test result who remain symptomatic and for whom an alternative diagnosis has not been established should undergo prompt testing for SARS-CoV-2 using standard NAAT. The panel identified a few studies that reported better positive percent agreement between Ag testing and viral culture than between standard NAAT and viral culture but identified no empirical evidence that informed the question of whether Ag test results predict infectiousness, as measured by transmission; further, the IDSA panel found no empirical evidence to support the use of Ag test results to guide release of patients with COVID-19 from isolation.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — association with viral culture and contagion: The panel analyzed the relation between Ag positivity and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 and noted that while culture-positive specimens were also likely to be Ag positive, culture negativity or Ag negativity does not mean that transmission of infection is not possible. Across studies using culture as a comparator, false-negative Ag results were observed (range, 3%–21% false-negative Ag tests vs culture). It is likely that some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who test negative by Ag and/or culture are contagious, and while the use of Ag testing to infer contagiousness and need for isolation is common, the panel identified no studies that provided direct empirical evidence in support of this practice.

Types of Tests There are different types of COVID-19 tests – diagnostic tests and antibody tests. Diagnostic tests can show if you currently are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. There are two common types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests:

- Molecular tests, such as polymerase chain reaction and other nucleic acid amplification tests tests, which detect genetic material called RNA from the virus
- Antigen tests, often referred to as rapid tests or, for some, at-home or self tests, which detect proteins called antigens from the virus. Samples for COVID-19 diagnostic tests are typically collected using an anterior nares swab sample. Some diagnostic tests use other samples such as mid-turbinate, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, or saliva samples. Depending on the intended use, COVID-19 diagnostic tests can be performed at a laboratory, a standalone testing site, a doctor's office or health clinic, or at home.

For most molecular COVID-19 diagnostic tests, you go to a testing site to have your sample collected and for others you can collect your own sample at home using a home collection kit and mail it to a laboratory for testing. Some tests, including most antigen tests, can be performed completely at home, giving you results within minutes, without needing to send your sample to a laboratory. To increase the accuracy of an at-home COVID-19 antigen diagnostic test, it is important to perform repeat testing, after 48 hours, following a negative test result, whether you have symptoms or not, to reduce your risk of a false negative test result. For more information about how to reduce your risk of getting a false negative result on an at-home COVID-19 antigen test, read our FDA Safety Communication. For additional information on reading and understanding your test results, see Understanding At-Home OTC COVID-19 Antigen Diagnostic Test Results.

Antibody tests look for antibodies in your blood that your immune system produced in response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose a current SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 and, at this time, should also not be used to check for immunity. More research is needed to determine what, if anything, antibody tests can tell us about a person's immunity.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^09a842a6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 antigens targeted by serology describes that coronavirus genomes encode four major structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N); both the S and N proteins are immunogenic in humans and current serologic tests target antibodies against these antigens. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein has been a focus for vaccine development and targeted antibody therapies because neutralizing antibodies against this region effectively block viral entry, and the N protein is an RNA-binding protein that is abundantly expressed during infection and plays a role in RNA transcription and replication.

IDSA COVID-19 serology — MIS-C diagnosis states the IDSA panel recommends using both IgG antibody testing and NAATs to provide evidence of current or recent past COVID-19 (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Combining IgG antibody testing and NAAT may improve both the ability to diagnose MIS-C and to rule it out, and knowing the patient's vaccination and COVID-19 history may be helpful in interpreting serology results. The January 2023 definition of MIS-C agreed upon by US public health officials requires evidence of current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen, or serologic testing. Differentiating MIS-C from Kawasaki disease is important because Kawasaki disease requires treatment with specific therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin or rituximab if diagnosed.
