## Question

Transcathater intervention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about transcatheter interventions, specifically their definition, scope, indications, evidence base, and practical considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and scope of transcatheter interventions. Then, I should verify the major valve targets and the strength of evidence for each. Next, I will examine patient selection, risk stratification, and the role of the Heart Team. After that, I need to check procedural access, imaging, and antithrombotic strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations, durability and reintervention, and synthesize a concise clinical takeaway with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead us. "Transcatheter intervention" refers to catheter-based, minimally invasive procedures that treat structural heart disease, most prominently transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), transcatheter mitral valve repair/replacement (TMVR), and transcatheter tricuspid interventions, with emerging work in pulmonary valves and adult congenital heart disease; I should confirm that these are the principal domains supported by contemporary guidelines and reviews, which they are [^96f2867f] [^eeb59760] [^62c75dee].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and not jump to conclusions. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses provide the highest-quality evidence for TAVR across risk strata, while mitral and tricuspid data are anchored by pivotal RCTs and growing observational cohorts; I need to ensure I cite the landmark trials and guidelines accurately, including PARTNER for TAVR and COAPT for secondary mitral regurgitation, and align indications with ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS guidance [^f3491fe2] [^967c4dcb] [^5587311c] [^96f2867f] [^eeb59760].

> For TAVR, let me verify the evolution of indications. Initially reserved for inoperable and high-risk patients, TAVR now has validated outcomes extending to low-risk cohorts, with 5-year PARTNER 3 data showing noninferiority to surgery for death, stroke, or rehospitalization and contemporary meta-analyses demonstrating early mortality and cardiovascular mortality advantages; however, I should double-check durability and pacemaker tradeoffs, which remain key considerations in younger patients [^967c4dcb] [^3c233073] [^f1daef43] [^81dda9b6].

> Hold on, I should verify mitral indications because they are nuanced. For primary mitral regurgitation, edge-to-edge repair is appropriate in high or prohibitive surgical risk patients; for secondary MR, COAPT established reduced heart failure hospitalizations and mortality with MitraClip on a background of optimized guideline-directed medical therapy, whereas MITRA-FR did not show benefit, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and Heart Team oversight; I need to ensure I distinguish these phenotypes and the strength of evidence [^5587311c] [^646b464f] [^480be5ed].

> For tricuspid regurgitation, I should confirm the current status. Historically neglected, TR now has emerging transcatheter options, with ESC/EACTS recommending consideration of transcatheter therapy in symptomatic, inoperable patients with secondary severe TR at experienced centers; edge-to-edge repair has the most robust dataset, and 2024 marked FDA approval of TriClip and EVOQUE, signaling a new therapeutic era; I should note that long-term durability and mortality data are still maturing [^9604c0d2] [^92ffad60] [^091c5a29].

> Let me consider pulmonary valve disease and adult congenital heart disease so I don't omit important niches. Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation is established for dysfunctional right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduits with high procedural success and improved outcomes when prestenting is used; in adult congenital heart disease, transcatheter interventions are increasingly used to palliate or repair complex lesions, reducing the need for repeat surgeries, though lifetime management often requires staged procedures [^1c622e00] [^62c75dee].

> I need to ensure patient selection is framed correctly. Risk stratification should integrate surgical risk scores, frailty, anatomy, and lifetime considerations; for TAVR, transfemoral access is preferred when feasible, and nonfemoral routes carry higher mortality and should prompt discussion of surgery or palliative alternatives; for mitral and tricuspid disease, candidacy hinges on etiology, severity, ventricular function, and the likelihood of durable benefit; shared decision-making is essential across all scenarios [^49141cbb] [^f1daef43] [^eeb59760].

> Next, I should review procedural planning and imaging. Multidetector CT is the workhorse for TAVR annular sizing, access planning, and coronary height assessment, while echocardiography guides valve selection and intraprocedural positioning; for mitral procedures, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable for clip placement and for assessing valve-in-valve landing zones; I should confirm that consensus statements endorse these imaging standards, which they do [^b262a6b1] [^d21c2047] [^e00a408a].

> I will now examine antithrombotic therapy, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. After TAVR, single antiplatelet therapy is reasonable in patients without an OAC indication, whereas adding antiplatelet therapy to OAC increases bleeding; randomized data support avoiding routine dual antiplatelet therapy after TAVR in most patients; for mitral and tricuspid edge-to-edge repair, single antiplatelet therapy is commonly used, and after transcatheter mitral or tricuspid valve replacement, at least 3 months of oral anticoagulation is suggested, though high-quality RCT data are sparse; I should flag this as an evidence gap [^fd45df9a] [^dff89048].

> But wait, what about special populations and durability. In adults under 65, SAVR remains preferred given proven durability and limited long-term TAVR data, though shared decision-making is key; bicuspid aortic valves and complex coronary anatomy require individualized assessment and may favor surgery; for TAVR valves, mid-term durability looks acceptable, yet 10+ year data are still limited, which matters for lifetime planning and the feasibility of valve-in-valve strategies [^81dda9b6] [^f1daef43] [^3e79662c].

> I should double-check systems-of-care requirements because outcomes depend on them. Consensus documents mandate institutional volumes, operator experience, and multidisciplinary Heart Teams for TAVR and TMVR, with explicit thresholds for interventionalists, surgeons, and echocardiographers; quality metrics and registry participation are emphasized to ensure safe dissemination of these technologies [^85e6bcb1] [^af79cc0d] [^1487815f].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical takeaway, and I will keep it concise. Transcatheter interventions have transformed valvular heart disease care, offering less invasive, guideline-endorsed options across aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves; TAVR is appropriate across risk strata with favorable early outcomes but requires balance against durability and pacemaker risk in younger patients; mitral edge-to-edge repair benefits selected secondary MR patients on optimized therapy; tricuspid repair/replacement is now feasible for inoperable TR; success hinges on meticulous patient selection, advanced imaging, experienced teams, and judicious antithrombotic therapy, all embedded in shared decision-making [^96f2867f] [^eeb59760] [^5587311c] [^92ffad60].

Transcatheter interventions are **minimally invasive, catheter-based procedures** that treat structural heart disease without open surgery, most notably for aortic stenosis (TAVR) [^f3491fe2], mitral regurgitation (MitraClip) [^5587311c], and tricuspid regurgitation (TriClip/EVOQUE) [^92ffad60]. They offer **lower perioperative risk, shorter recovery, and comparable or superior outcomes to surgery** in high-risk patients [^f3491fe2] [^5587311c], and are now approved across risk strata for TAVR [^967c4dcb] and for selected mitral/tricuspid cases [^bf8907d5] [^9604c0d2]. Key limitations include durability concerns in younger patients [^3e79662c], pacemaker needs [^985bf164], and limited long-term data; patient selection and Heart Team evaluation are essential [^e62a7097] [^eeb59760].

## Types of transcatheter interventions

| **Valve** | **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aortic | TAVR (SAPIEN, Evolut) | Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, all risk strata [^967c4dcb] | High (RCTs, guidelines) [^96f2867f] |
| Mitral | Edge-to-edge repair (MitraClip) | Primary MR (high surgical risk); secondary MR with persistent symptoms despite GDMT [^bf8907d5] [^5587311c] | High (COAPT, guidelines) [^5587311c] [^dd8f0485] |
| Tricuspid | Edge-to-edge repair (TriClip); valve replacement (EVOQUE) | Symptomatic severe TR in inoperable or high-risk patients [^9604c0d2] [^92ffad60] | Moderate (trials, guidelines) [^9604c0d2] [^92ffad60] |
| Pulmonary | TPVI (Melody, SAPIEN) | Dysfunctional RV-PA conduits or bioprostheses [^1c622e00] | Moderate (observational, guidelines) |

---

## Clinical indications and patient selection

- **TAVR**: Indicated for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis across all surgical risk categories [^967c4dcb]; selection considers anatomy, coronary disease, and lifetime management [^e62a7097] [^f1daef43].
- **MitraClip**: For primary MR in high surgical risk; for secondary MR, use after GDMT optimization and Heart Team confirmation of persistent symptoms/severity [^bf8907d5] [^5587311c].
- **Tricuspid interventions**: For symptomatic severe TR in inoperable or high-risk patients, ideally at experienced centers [^9604c0d2] [^92ffad60].

---

## Comparative outcomes with surgical alternatives

- **TAVR vs SAVR**: Noninferior or superior to surgery in high/intermediate risk; in low-risk patients, 5-year PARTNER 3 showed similar rates of death/stroke/rehospitalization, with faster recovery and less bleeding but more pacemaker implants [^967c4dcb] [^f1daef43].
- **MitraClip vs surgery**: Inferior to surgical repair for primary MR but beneficial in high-risk or inoperable patients; for secondary MR, COAPT showed reduced HF hospitalizations and mortality vs medical therapy alone [^5587311c] [^646b464f].
- **Tricuspid interventions**: Observational data show improved symptoms and quality of life vs medical therapy; randomized data are emerging [^92ffad60] [^091c5a29].

---

## Risks, benefits, and limitations

Benefits include **lower invasiveness**, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less bleeding, and fewer wound infections [^985bf164] [^f1daef43]. Risks include vascular injury, stroke, paravalvular leak, conduction disturbance requiring pacemaker, and limited long-term durability data in younger patients [^4e2a6f7d] [^3e79662c]. Limitations include durability concerns in low-risk/younger patients, limited evidence in complex anatomy (e.g. bicuspid aortic valves), and the need for lifelong surveillance and potential reintervention [^3e79662c] [^ef59e0b9].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Both ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS recommend TAVR as a **standard option across risk strata** for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, with shared decision-making and Heart Team evaluation [^96f2867f] [^eeb59760]. Mitral edge-to-edge repair is recommended for selected high-risk primary MR and for secondary MR after GDMT optimization and Heart Team confirmation [^bf8907d5] [^5587311c]. Tricuspid interventions are reasonable in symptomatic inoperable severe TR at experienced centers [^9604c0d2] [^92ffad60].

---

## Future directions and emerging technologies

- **Durability**: Ongoing studies and device iterations aim to improve long-term valve performance and reduce reintervention [^3e79662c] [^c6bd0b3f].
- **Expanded indications**: Research explores TAVR in bicuspid valves, pure aortic regurgitation, and younger low-risk patients [^a0f40ef2] [^ef59e0b9].
- **New devices**: Next-generation mitral and tricuspid repair/replacement systems, including annuloplasty and fully percutaneous options, are in trials [^5e5b59a7] [^92ffad60].
- **Personalized medicine**: Advanced imaging and computational modeling will refine patient selection and procedural planning [^2a43ad0d].

---

Transcatheter interventions are **established, guideline-endorsed alternatives to surgery** for selected valvular diseases, with favorable short- to intermediate-term outcomes and expanding indications. Long-term durability and optimal patient selection remain key challenges, requiring multidisciplinary care and ongoing evidence generation [^96f2867f] [^eeb59760].

### The future of transcatheter mitral valve interventions: competitive or complementary role of repair vs. replacement? [^7daf3939]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Transcatheter mitral interventions has been developed to address an unmet clinical need and may be an alternative therapeutic option to surgery with the intent to provide symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Beyond MitraClip therapy, alternative repair technologies are being developed to expand the transcatheter intervention armamentarium. Recently, the feasibility of transcatheter mitral valve implantation in native non-calcified valves has been reported in very high-risk patients. Acknowledging the lack of scientific evidence to date, it is difficult to predict what the ultimate future role of transcatheter mitral valve interventions will be. The purpose of the present report is to review the current state-of-the-art of mitral valve intervention, and to identify the potential future scenarios, which might benefit most from the transcatheter repair and replacement devices under development.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in lower-risk patients: what is the perspective? [^b463007b]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In the last decade, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), a disruptive technology, has revolutionized the therapy of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, and current guidelines state that the recommendations for TAVI and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are equivalent in patients at high-risk. Increased operator experience, technical advances in the new generation of transcatheter heart valves (THV) and excellent TAVI results in recently published randomized controlled trials have led to the expansion of TAVI indication as an alternative to SAVR in intermediate-risk subjects, given appropriate patient selection. The time is opportune to examine the role of TAVI in low-risk patients, currently the objective of on-going randomized trials. This review aims to summarize the available knowledge on TAVI in low- to intermediate-risk patients and to discuss the potential advantages and pitfalls TAVI will face in this clinical setting.

### Antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter valve interventions: current status and future directions [^fd45df9a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The optimal antithrombotic strategy after transcatheter valve interventions is a subject of ongoing debate. Although there is evidence from randomized trials in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), current evidence on optimal antithrombotic management after transcatheter mitral or tricuspid valve interventions is sparse. This article appraises the current evidence on this topic.

Methods

This narrative review presents key research findings and guideline recommendations, as well as highlights areas for future research.

Findings

After TAVR, randomized trial evidence suggests that single antiplatelet therapy is reasonable for patients without pre-existing indications for oral anticoagulation (OAC). If there is a concurrent indication for OAC, the addition of antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding risk. Whether direct oral anticoagulants achieve better outcomes than vitamin K antagonists is uncertain in this setting. Although OAC has been shown to reduce subclinical leaflet thrombosis (which may progress to structural valve degeneration), bleeding events are unacceptably high. There is a lack of randomized trial data comparing antithrombotic strategies after transcatheter mitral or tricuspid valve replacement or after mitral or tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. Single antiplatelet therapy after mitral or tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair may be appropriate, whereas at least 3 months of OAC is suggested after transcatheter mitral valve replacement or transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement.

Implications

Randomized studies are warranted to address the knowledge gaps in antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter valve interventions and to optimize outcomes.

### Evolution of transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^8c418b1d]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement emerged ≈20 years ago and changed the landscape of structural interventional cardiology. The first experiments in animal models provided proofs of the concept and the substrate for the first percutaneous valve implantation in patients. The initial promising results in a clinical setting drew the attention of the industry and of the scientific community, and an effort was made for the past 12 years to address the limitations of the technology, facilitate the procedure, minimize the risk of complications, and broaden the applications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This article reviews the evolution of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, presents the first steps in this field, cites the evidence from registries and clinical trials, highlights the limitations of this treatment, and discusses the future perspectives and the developments proposed to address the current pitfalls.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in lower-risk patients with aortic stenosis: is It justified to be the preferred treatment? [^56c60217]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation underwent progressive improvements until it became the default therapy for inoperable patients, and a recommended therapy in high-risk operable patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. In the lower-risk patient strata, a currently costly therapy that still has important complications with questionable durability is competing with the established effective and still-improving surgical replacement. This report tries to weigh the clinical evidence, the recent technical improvements, the durability, and the cost-effectiveness claims supporting the adoption of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in intermediate-low risk patients. The importance of appropriate patients' risk stratification and a more comprehensive approach to estimate that risk are also emphasized in the present report.

### Interventions for adult congenital heart disease [^62c75dee]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Advances in imaging diagnostics, surgical techniques and transcatheter interventions for paediatric patients with severe congenital heart disease (CHD) have substantially reduced mortality, thereby extending the lifespan of these individuals and increasing the number of adults with complex CHD. Transcatheter interventions have emerged as an alternative to traditional open-heart surgery to mitigate congenital defects. The evolution of techniques, the introduction of new devices and the growing experience of operators have enabled the treatment of patients with progressively more complex conditions. The general cardiology community might be less aware of contemporary interventions for adult CHD, their clinical indications and associated outcomes than interventional cardiologists and congenital heart specialists. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the available transcatheter interventions for adult patients with CHD.

### 2021 ESC / EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^eeb59760]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for aortic stenosis, more specifically with respect to aortic valve replacement, choice of approach, EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines recommend to decide between surgical and transcatheter intervention based upon careful evaluation of clinical, anatomical, and procedural factors by the heart team, weighing the risks and benefits of each approach for an individual patient. Discuss the heart team recommendation with patients allowing them to make an informed treatment choice.

### Transcatheter mitral valve interventions [^b6837a4f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

While there are dozens of novel transcatheter mitral devices in various stages of development, they remain years away from FDA approval. The existing approved transcatheter mitral interventions-transcatheter edge to edge repair for primary and secondary mitral regurgitations and transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve and valve-in-ring procedures for failing surgical prostheses-have seen a marked increase in both use and published data over the past several years. Transcatheter edge to edge repair with MitraClip has revolutionized the management of functional mitral regurgitation in heart failure with demonstrated reductions in mortality and heart failure hospitalization and is an appropriate option for patients with primary mitral regurgitation at high or prohibitive surgical risk. In patients with failing surgical mitral prostheses transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve and valve-in-ring procedures are an appealing alternative to repeat mitral valve surgery. Existing data and relevant concerns for these procedures are discussed herein.

### 2021 ESC / EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^9604c0d2]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for tricuspid regurgitation, more specifically with respect to transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention, EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider performing transcatheter intervention in symptomatic inoperable patients with secondary severe TR at a heart valve center with expertise in the treatment of tricuspid valve disease.

### Catheter-based intervention of the "Forgotten" valve: time to reconsider tricuspid valve intervention? [^eac8809f]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

We congratulate the authors for sharing their experimental findings with the scientific community and would encourage others to do the same. Understanding the nature of the challenges is an important step forward in this complex, yet at the same time exciting field. However, as has happened with other innovative technologies in the past, regulatory agencies must be prepared to put into perspective the experimental findings based on the clinical needs and variations in human anatomy. The road to clinical success of transcatheter tricuspid therapies will be long and complex, and we need to ensure that lessons learned from early preclinical and clinical studies pave the way for future improvements and technological changes. Tricuspid regurgitation is no longer a "forgotten" condition, and exciting catheter-based technologies are already under development. It is still early to predict whether any of these technologies will have a major impact on long-term clinical outcomes. However, they have the potential to improve quality of life by reducing debilitating clinical symptoms such as lower extremity edema. Only if this is the case, transcatheter tricuspid intervention may play a major role in the treatment of this debilitating condition affecting millions of patients worldwide.

### Valvular disease in 2011: breakthrough for intervention? [^e82acd52]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

In 2011, both the PARTNER-A trial, in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, and EVEREST II, in patients with mitral insufficiency, showed noninferiority of transcatheter interventions compared with surgery for the chosen primary end points. However, both of the trials, and important registry data, identified limitations of transcatheter valve interventions.

### Treatments for venous… [^b5838e8e]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatments for Hemorrhage TRANSARTERIAL EMBOLIZATION Transarterial embolization involves insertion of hemostatic material through a catheter into a target artery to stop hemorrhage. 30, 31 Pelvic transarterial embolization can be used to treat severe postpartum hemorrhage. A systematic review of 1, 739 cases of severe postpartum hemorrhage showed that transarterial embolization achieved hemostasis in 89% of cases, with 2% of successful procedures occurring after ineffective emergency hysterectomy. 42 Catheter-directed thrombolysis delivers thrombolytics to the clot, which can be augmented with endovascular mechanical manipulation and ultrasound-enhanced catheterization. 43, 44 Although the use of thrombolytic therapy has been studied to prevent postthrombotic syndrome in patients with DVT, its effectiveness is uncertain.

45 A 2016 Cochrane review showed that catheter-directed thrombolysis has a number needed to treat of 7 to prevent one case of postthrombotic syndrome within five years, and a number needed to harm of 36 for bleeding. 46 However, in a subsequent large, multicenter, randomized trial, catheter-directed thrombolysis did not reduce postthrombotic syndrome compared with anticoagulation after two years but decreased postthrombotic severity. 47 Further research is needed to clarify the role of catheter-directed thrombolysis in DVT treatment. 48 However, a meta-analysis of noncontrolled trials favors catheter-directed thrombolysis over systemic thrombolysis, with an NNT of 13 for preventing death and 5 for preventing major complications. 49, 50 For submassive PE, guidelines primarily recommend anticoagulation, with consideration of catheter-directed thrombolysis.

48 Systemic thrombolysis lowers mortality over anticoagulation with an NNT of 65, but it has an NNH of 19 for major bleeding. 51 Catheter-directed thrombolysis has the same mortality benefit as systemic thrombolysis with less major bleeding, improving the NNH to 41.
51. 86 Quality-adjusted survival after radiofrequency ablation appears to be improved over no intervention and over surgery for smaller tumors. 86 Other liver-directed therapies can be palliative, such as placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts or biliary drainage procedures. 76.

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^c6bab23e]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Since the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease, a large amount of new data have accumulated, in particular in the field of TAVR. Indications for TAVR have expanded as there is new evidence for lower-risk populations. This required an update of the recommendations in the new 2017 guidelines. Broadly speaking, patients at higher risk for surgery should receive TAVR — especially if they can be treated by transfemoral approach — and those at low risk — in particular younger patients — should undergo SAVR. The choice of SAVR or TAVR should not simply be based on a risk score or age. The Heart Team must weigh the risks and benefits of both procedures, particularly in the intermediate risk situation. Discussion should include age, comorbidities, anatomy and outcomes of the centre for surgery and transcatheter intervention.

### 2019 AATS / ACC / SCAI / STS expert consensus systems of care document: operator and institutional recommendations and requirements for transcatheter mitral valve intervention: a joint report of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, the American college of cardiology, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [^af79cc0d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Registry reporting for transcatheter MV intervention programs — the Writing Committee endorses recommendations that, as applied to transcatheter MV intervention programs, would comprise annual reports from the STS/ACC TVT Registry and the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database containing summary statistics including the number of all active transcatheter MV intervention programs and frequency distribution of yearly site volume, where the report should identify the number and percentage of active transcatheter MV intervention programs whose yearly volume falls below the minimum requirements outlined in this document; the number of all active surgical MV programs and frequency distribution of yearly site volume, where the report should identify the number and percentage of active MV surgical programs whose yearly volume falls below the minimum requirement for a complementary transcatheter MV intervention program; the number of active transcatheter MV intervention programs that meet and fail to meet the data quality and completeness requirements of the STS/ACC TVT Registry; the number of active surgical MV programs that meet and fail to meet the data quality and completeness requirement of the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database; the number of transcatheter MV intervention programs that meet and fail to meet the outcomes standards outlined in Table 1; and the number of surgical MV programs that achieve each category of star rating for MV surgery. Sites that fail to meet volume, quality of care, and compliance for reporting performance metrics as outlined in this document should receive notice from the relevant national registry informing them of this finding.

### Transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions: current devices and associated evidence [^37deef63]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common finding in patients with chronic cardiopathy, and often a marker of an advanced disease. Being silent or with symptoms intertwined with the primitive left heart disease, TR has often been neglected, leading to the late referral of patients with advanced right-heart failure. Hence, isolated tricuspid surgery has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, the worse of all valve interventions, and medical management has been limited to symptomatic treatment. In this context, percutaneous therapies for severe TR have gained traction, addressing the unmet therapeutic gap for a less invasive disease-modifying management. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview on transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions, focusing on devices' characteristics, associated evidence, and future perspectives.

### Impact of complications during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement: how can they Be avoided and managed? [^4e2a6f7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis and is the treatment of choice for patients at prohibitive and high surgical risk. Extension of indications into intermediate surgical risk has begun, and recently 2 large randomized trials demonstrated that TAVR may be superior to surgery in patients at low surgical risk and can potentially offer better results at initial follow‐up. 1, 2, 3 TAVR practice has evolved continuously with concomitant simplification of the procedure. If one disregards the financial considerations, predictability of the procedural outcome and certainty regarding the durability of TAVR prostheses are 2 of the main remaining restrictions to universal implementation.

Transfemoral access is the preferred approach, as it has a 20% relative reduction in mortality compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) (hazard ratio HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69–0.93; P = 0.024). 3 Understanding the mechanisms that underlie complications during transfemoral TAVR is essential, and familiarity with the techniques for their prevention and treatment is mandatory. In this review, we provide a state‐of‐the‐art overview on the avoidable procedural complications of contemporary transfemoral TAVR practice, with a specific focus on strategies for their prevention and management.

Abstract:

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a relatively recent revolutionary treatment that has now become a standard procedure for treating severe aortic stenosis. In this article, the authors review the clinical history of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, summarize the major clinical trials, and describe the evolution of the technique over time. In doing so, the authors hope to provide a clear and concise review of the history and clinical evidence behind transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

### Lifetime management of aortic stenosis: transcatheter versus surgical treatment for young and low-risk patients [^b7fb5a4b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is now indicated across all risk categories of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and has been proposed as first line option for the majority of patients > 74 years old. However, median age of patients enrolled in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement low-risk trials is 74 years and transcatheter aortic valve replacement has never been systematically investigated in young low risk patients. Although the long-term data in surgical aortic valve replacement in young patients (age < 75) are well known, such data remain lacking in transcatheter aortic valve replacement. In the absence of clear guideline recommendations in patients with challenging anatomies (eg, hostile calcium, bicuspid), it is important to know the potential advantages and disadvantages of each treatment and to consider how they might integrate with each other in the lifetime management of such patients. In this review, we discuss current outstanding issues on the management of severe aortic stenosis from a lifetime management perspective, particularly in terms of initial intervention and future reinterventions.

### Is transcatheter aortic valve replacement becoming the standard of care in octogenarians? [^41e1e4bf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Where Are We Going?

As a general trend, when evaluating patient risk, age is becoming the most frequent reason to consider TAVR instead of SAVR. After age, frailty is the second most important reason to select the less invasive treatment. 6 However, at a country or center level, the translation of this large consensus into clinical practice still remains heterogeneous. With the expected results of low‐risk TAVR randomized trials in the next few months, the continued technological improvements, and the demographic projections, there is no doubt that TAVR will rapidly and universally become standard of care in octogenarians with severe aortic stenosis.

### TAVR in 2023: who should not get It? [^90ade96a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the first transcatheter delivery of an aortic valve prosthesis was performed by Cribier et al in 2002, the picture of aortic stenosis (AS) therapeutics has changed dramatically. Initiated from an indication of inoperable to high surgical risk, extending to intermediate and low risk, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now an approved treatment for patients with severe, symptomatic AS across all the risk categories. The current evidence supports TAVR as a frontline therapy for treating severe AS. The crucial question remains concerning the subset of patients who still are not ideal candidates for TAVR because of certain inherent anatomic, nonmodifiable, and procedure-specific factors. Therefore, in this study, we focus on these scenarios and reasons for referring selected patients for surgical aortic valve replacement in 2023.

This study shows excellent transcatheter aortic valve replacement hemodynamic mid-term durability, aligned with prior research up to 5-years. Long-term (10+ years) data are needed before treating young low-risk people with aortic stenosis. Data so far are excellent, indicating a prosperous future for this procedure in young patients.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: current status and future directions [^60402262]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a revolutionary therapy for patients with aortic stenosis. Large registries and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that TAVR is safe and effective in patients considered inoperable because of severe comorbidities and those who are high-risk surgical candidates. As TAVR evolves for lower-risk patients, attention will need to focus on reducing the rates of vascular injury, stroke, and paravalvular regurgitation. In this review, we discuss the status of TAVR in clinical practice, including patient selection, preoperative evaluation, techniques, and complications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) program background and scope — the goal of the writing committee was to provide a quality framework for any center providing TAVR as a treatment option for aortic valve disease in the United States; since publication of the original document in 2012, TAVR indications have been extended into groups of patients who are eligible for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) at intermediate to high risk, and TAVR has also become an alternative to reoperation for those with severe bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration; programs are now evaluating a broad spectrum of patients who may be appropriate after either form of valve replacement; the approval of a TAVR valve for a specific STS SAVR risk population does not necessarily mean that TAVR should be the chosen procedure for any particular patient in that population.

7 CONCLUSION

Since its inception in 2002, the TAVR procedure has made striking advances. Minimally invasive procedures have become the dominant forms of treatment for a variety of conditions. Challenges relating to durability, complications and cost still need to be overcome, but TAVR will continue to generate excitement in the field of interventional cardiology for years to come.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Transcatheter mitral valve (MV) intervention — surgical consultation criteria are specified. Not all heart failure (HF) patients with secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) need individual surgical evaluation unless therapy other than transcatheter edge-to-edge clip device repair is potentially indicated after initial multidisciplinary team (MDT) review, and because surgical MV repair provides reduction of primary MR superior to edge-to-edge clip device repair, surgical consultation for these patients is critical to verify that operative risk is indeed high enough to warrant transcatheter intervention.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk of TAVR and shared decision-making — the final treatment decision should be individualized using clinical and imaging evaluation, risk category, patient goals and expectations, and futility considerations. If the evaluation indicates that AS is not severe or symptoms are not due to AS, it may be prudent to continue periodic monitoring of AS severity and symptoms, deferring intervention until guideline-based criteria are met. Alternatively, the Heart Valve Team evaluation may conclude that the SAVR is the best option if surgical risk is low, the durability of a mechanical or other tissue valve is preferable in a younger patient, or concurrent procedures such as aortic root replacement or coronary bypass grafting are needed. Even when severe symptomatic AS is present, TAVR is considered futile when the expected benefit from TAVR is less than the expected risk; in these patients, palliative care may be the best option in terms of both quality and length of life. In patients who meet guideline-based criteria for TAVR and whose evaluation indicates the benefit is greater than risk, discussion with the patient and family should again review the likelihood of symptom relief or improved survival, possible complications and the expected recovery process, and alignment of patient goals and expectations with possible procedural outcomes.

Currently aortic valve replacement is performed for patients with severe aortic stenosis and symptoms or objective pathophysiologic consequences such as left ventricular dysfunction. For transcatheter mitral valve interventions, the complex pathophysiology of mitral regurgitation with varying causes along with challenging imaging and delivery issues has led to slower than anticipated clinical introduction. Transcatheter pulmonary valve intervention was primarily designed to treat the difficult problem of right ventricular to pulmonary artery conduit stenosis in the congenital population. These techniques are reviewed in this article.

Transcatheter Interventions

Transcatheter TV intervention is currently in its early stages of development and investigation, encountering challenges due to the complex anatomy of the TV apparatus. The first transcatheter TV procedural proof of concept on animal models was published in 2005. The authors found unique features of the TV including a large valve area; complex annulus, which makes anchoring valves challenging; and crescent RV structure, which makes steering difficult, and authors noted annular repairs or reductions would help prevent valve replacement leaks. When considering transcatheter interventions, there are 2 main options: repairs and replacements. The first published valve‐in‐valve transcatheter TV implantation was in 2010, and the first transcatheter TV repair in 2015.TV edge‐to‐edge repair stands out as the technique with the most comprehensive data to date (Table 2).

Table 2
Summary Table of Trials Evaluating Tricuspid Valve Transcatheter Intervention

Transcatheter Repair

There are 2 categories of transcatheter repair: annuloplasty and coaptation devices. Annular dilation and coaptation defects are interconnected in the progressive nature in TR. Thus, these defects became the focus of valve repair. Annuloplasty aims to reduce the size and restore the crescent shape of a dilated annulus. Coaptation devices function to bridge a gap between TV leaflets with a focus on the septal leaflet, the most common culprit leaflet in TR. Theoretically, if you address annular dilation, you indirectly affect coaptation and vice versa, which has been demonstrated through TTE follow‐up data, which makes both techniques valid in combatting the underlying broad pathophysiology of TR.

Tricuspid transcatheter edge‐to‐edge repair (TEER) devices, also referred to as coaptation devices, represent the most extensively studied transcatheter technique for the TV. Notably, it is the only technique that has been evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial with a control group for comparison. Transcatheter TV coaptation was first investigated using a device designed for the mitral valve, the MitraClip system, under compassionate use in 2015. Subsequently in 2017 a multicenter study assessed MitraClip compassionate use for TR in patients with high or prohibitive surgical risk and observed promising safety and efficacy data. This sparked the development of the TriClip device with a unique delivery system, improved steerability, and 2 different clip sizes.

### Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in young, low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis [^ef59e0b9]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is approved for all patient risk profiles and is an option for all patients irrespective of age. However, patients enrolled in the low- and intermediate-risk trials were in their 70s, and those in the high-risk trials were in their 80s. TAVR has never been systematically tested in young (< 65 years), low-risk patients. Unanswered questions remain, including the safety and effectiveness of TAVR in patients with bicuspid aortic valves; future coronary access; durability of transcatheter heart valves; technical considerations for surgical transcatheter heart valve explantation; management of concomitant conditions such as aortopathy, mitral valve disease, and coronary artery disease; and the safety and feasibility of future TAVR-in-TAVR. The authors predict that balancing these questions with patients' clear preference for less invasive treatment will become common. In this paper, the authors consider each of these questions and discuss risks and benefits of theoretical treatment strategies in the lifetime management of young patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Figure 2
Aspects to be considered by the Heart Team for the decision between TAVR and SAVR in patients at increased surgical risk. (+) favours TAVR; favours SAVR. Based on the recommendations formulated in the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease. EACTS, European Association of CardioThoracic Surgery; ESC, European Society of Cardiology, SAVR, surgical aortic valve replacement; TAVR, transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

In the updated 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines, patients are no longer divided into high risk, intermediate risk or low risk groups. Also the use of EuroSCORE I is no longer recommended to guide decision making. It is recommended to categorise patients into 'low surgical risk' or 'increased surgical risk', based on an STS or EuroSCORE II < or ≥ 4%, or other risk factors not included in these scores such as frailty, porcelain aorta, and sequelae of chest radiation.

The choice of intervention must be based on careful individual evaluation of technical suitability and weighing risks/benefits of each modality. In addition, the local expertise and outcome data for the given intervention must be taken into account.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk and decision-making pathways — guided actions for aortic valve replacement (AVR) selection are organized as: No current indication for AVR lists periodic monitoring of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and symptoms and re-evaluation when AS is severe or symptoms occur. When AVR is indicated but surgical AVR (SAVR) is preferred over TAVR, the document states 'SAVR recommended in lower-risk patients', notes valve durability considerations in younger patients, and that a concurrent surgical procedure may be needed. For a TAVR candidate with expected benefit > risk, actions include discussion with patient and family and proceeding with TAVR imaging evaluation and procedure. For severe symptomatic AS but benefit < risk (futility), thresholds include life expectancy < 1 year and chance of survival with benefit at 2 years < 25%, with actions including discussion with patient and family, palliative care inputs, and palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty in selected patients.

Valvular heart disease — top take-home messages (items 6–10) highlight that "indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation are expanding", and for severe aortic stenosis "the choice of type of intervention… should be a shared decision-making process that considers the lifetime risks and benefits" including valve type and approach. For valvular regurgitation, "indications for intervention… are relief of symptoms and prevention of the irreversible long-term consequences of left ventricular volume overload", and "thresholds for intervention now are lower than they previously were because of more durable treatment options and lower procedural risks". "A mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is of benefit to patients with severely symptomatic primary mitral regurgitation who are at high or prohibitive risk for surgery", and to a select subset with secondary mitral regurgitation despite guideline-directed therapy. Patients with severe symptomatic isolated tricuspid regurgitation "may benefit from surgical intervention" if performed before severe right ventricular dysfunction or end-organ damage. For prosthetic valves, "bioprosthetic valve dysfunction may occur" from leaflet degeneration or thrombosis, and "catheter-based treatment… is reasonable in selected patients" with leaflet degeneration or paravalvular leak without active infection.

Tricuspid regurgitation is a common yet clinically complex problem, traditionally managed with diuretic therapy with no observable mortality benefit. Older studies on surgical intervention observed poor outcomes; however, this clinical reasoning predates current surgical approaches and novel transcatheter technology. The tricuspid apparatus is a complex structure that poses a technical challenge for surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Recent advances in surgical techniques and transcatheter therapy, particularly edge-to-edge repair devices, have demonstrated promising results for safety, reduction in tricuspid regurgitation, and improving quality of life. We review the clinical, imaging, and hemodynamic findings that characterize patients who should be considered for intervention, alongside the rapidly evolving approaches to interventional management.

More than 1.6 million people in the United States are affected by tricuspid regurgitation each year; however, definitive treatment options have often been limited due to the high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with isolated tricuspid valve surgery. The year 2024 marked a milestone for percutaneous tricuspid valve interventions, with the Food and Drug Administration approving the EVOQUE valve for transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement and the TriClip for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. The TriClip and EVOQUE valve, along with the previous Conformité Européene-marked Cardioband and PASCAL devices, have greatly expanded our understanding of the key principles of transcatheter tricuspid interventions that will help shape the next generation of devices. As an integral member of the multidisciplinary heart valve team, the cardiac anesthesiologist plays a critical role in the perioperative care of patients undergoing transcatheter tricuspid interventions. Many patients undergoing transcatheter therapies are older or high risk, so the cardiac anesthesiologist is uniquely positioned to assist with perioperative optimization. A thorough understanding of the unique anesthetic considerations, factors influencing procedural success, and potential complications of these devices is essential to optimize patient outcomes. All four devices are reviewed in detail, including their indications, performance in clinical trials, intraprocedural imaging guidance, and current limitations in transcatheter tricuspid therapies that future investigational devices should aim to address.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) — scope and methods — states that TAVR is "currently approved for use in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who are at intermediate to high surgical risk or are inoperable". Since "the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2011, over 50,000 patients have undergone TAVR in the United States alone". The pathway "starts at the point where a patient with severe AS has an indication for AVR and is being considered for TAVR" and "only addresses TAVR for native aortic stenosis; valve-in-valve procedures are not addressed". Echocardiography is assumed completed beforehand — "Echocardiographic assessment of AS severity has been performed before making the decision that AVR is needed. Thus, echocardiography is not discussed in detail in this document". Practical guidance is organized into "4 sections: 1) preprocedure evaluation of the patient being considered for TAVR; 2) imaging modalities and measurements; 3) key issues in performing the TAVR procedure; and 4) recommendations for patient follow-up after TAVR", and it highlights "The central role of the Heart Valve Team in decision-making at each step along the way".

### Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement in low-risk patients at five years [^967c4dcb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) was published by Michael J Mack and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the trial question was: what is the role of TAVR in low-risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis? In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the population was: 950 patients (292 female, 658 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis at low surgical risk. The key exclusion criteria were native aortic annulus size unsuitable for sizes 20, 23, 26, 29 mm transcatheter heart valve; evidence of acute myocardial infarction ≤ 30 days before randomization; aortic valve unicuspid, bicuspid, or noncalcified; severe aortic regurgitation; complex coronary artery disease. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 496 TAVR (TAVR with a SAPIEN 3 valve) n = 454 surgery (SAVR with a commercially available bioprosthetic valve). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death, stroke, or rehospitalization related to the valve, procedure, or HF at 5 years (22.8% vs. 27.2%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.02). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death, disabling stroke, nondisabling stroke, and rehospitalizations at 5 years (221% vs. 19%; WR 1.17, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.51) No significant difference in death from any cause at 5 years (10% vs. 8.2%; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.9) No significant difference in stroke at 5 years (5.8% vs. 6.4%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.48). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis at low surgical risk, TAVR was not superior to surgery with respect to death, stroke, or rehospitalization related to the valve, procedure, or HF at 5 years.

### Future of transcatheter aortic valve implantation-evolving clinical indications [^a0f40ef2]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Accumulating clinical experience and technological improvements have provided the basis for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to emerge as a well-established means for treating patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis at high or prohibitive surgical risk. During this decade, TAVI has emerged as a valid alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in patients at intermediate surgical risk, and several studies are currently being performed to evaluate the role of TAVI in patients at low surgical risk. Furthermore, promising, but preliminary, data are emerging on the efficacy of TAVI for treating patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease, as well as patients with pure aortic regurgitation. In this Perspectives article, we summarize the evolving indications for TAVI, and give our opinion on the future perspectives for this procedure.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate-and low-risk patients [^9c65516c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Initially restricted to high‐risk and inoperable patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly being offered to younger and lower‐risk patients with fewer comorbidities who are otherwise good operative candidates and until now would have undergone surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This evolution in clinical practice is underpinned by robust evidence, but do the data support the universal use of TAVR in all patients with AS, or is there still a role for surgery? In this review, we will review the data of TAVR in operable patients, examine potential limitations of TAVR in younger patients, and highlight the areas in which more research is required.

### Transcatheter versus surgical aortic-valve replacement in high-risk patients [^f3491fe2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The use of transcatheter aortic-valve replacement has been shown to reduce mortality among high-risk patients with aortic stenosis who are not candidates for surgical replacement. However, the two procedures have not been compared in a randomized trial involving high-risk patients who are still candidates for surgical replacement.

Methods

At 25 centers, we randomly assigned 699 high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis to undergo either transcatheter aortic-valve replacement with a balloon-expandable bovine pericardial valve (either a transfemoral or a transapical approach) or surgical replacement. The primary end point was death from any cause at 1 year. The primary hypothesis was that transcatheter replacement is not inferior to surgical replacement.

Results

The rates of death from any cause were 3.4% in the transcatheter group and 6.5% in the surgical group at 30 days (P = 0.07) and 24.2% and 26.8%, respectively, at 1 year (P = 0.44), a reduction of 2.6 percentage points in the transcatheter group (upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, 3.0 percentage points; predefined margin, 7.5 percentage points; P = 0.001 for noninferiority). The rates of major stroke were 3.8% in the transcatheter group and 2.1% in the surgical group at 30 days (P = 0.20) and 5.1% and 2.4%, respectively, at 1 year (P = 0.07). At 30 days, major vascular complications were significantly more frequent with transcatheter replacement (11.0% vs. 3.2%, P < 0.001); adverse events that were more frequent after surgical replacement included major bleeding (9.3% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (8.6% vs. 16.0%, P = 0.006). More patients undergoing transcatheter replacement had an improvement in symptoms at 30 days, but by 1 year, there was not a significant between-group difference.

Conclusions

In high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, transcatheter and surgical procedures for aortic-valve replacement were associated with similar rates of survival at 1 year, although there were important differences in periprocedural risks.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: not for everyone yet? [^8746871e]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Since its inception, indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (SAS) have expanded to include all risk categories. Indications have been based on results from RCTs (randomized controlled trials) demonstrating either superior or equivalent results to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Given patient preference for a less invasive therapy, patients with indications originally excluded from RCTs are now being offered TAVR when deemed appropriate by the heart team. Though there are no RCTs comparing outcomes of TAVR for off-label vs on label indications, there are several early observational studies that raised concerns. Frerker et alreported that the 156 patients who received off-label TAVR at a single center between 2008 and 2012 had a higher mortality at 30 days compared with 435 patients who received on label TAVR. Another study using data from the multicenter TVT registry demonstrated that the 2,272 patients who received off-label TAVR between 2011 and 2014 had a higher adjusted 30-day mortality compared with 21,575 patients who received on label TAVR. However, there was no difference in the adjusted 1-year mortality. Importantly, these studies only included a few off-label TAVR indications and also represented earlier experience with TAVR and older generation devices. Since then, TAVR valves and delivery systems have undergone several iterations and improvements with smaller sheaths, better skirt seal to reduce paravalvular leak (PVL), and better techniques of implantation to reduce pacemaker risk and one may expect better outcomes with these. Moreover, not all off-label TAVR can be considered equal and the question remains whether certain off-label indications may do better than others when treated with TAVR.

Transcatheter mitral valve interventions — operator qualifications and skills emphasize that echocardiography laboratory certification by the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission or a similar body is desirable, the MDT echocardiography expert should be able to acquire and interpret transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) studies, echocardiographic guidance is critical to procedural success and the implanting physician must be able to interpret intraprocedural images, and expertise in cardiac computed tomography (CT) is needed to determine eligibility for transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement and for assessment of valve-in-ring and valve-in-MAC candidates; minimum requirements include understanding basic radiation safety and use of x-ray contrast agents, training in mitral valve hemodynamics and selective contrast injections, catheter and wire skills to access complex anatomy, and transseptal access to the mitral valve as a prerequisite and fundamental skill, with surgical transapical access potentially required for some TMVR systems; experience with catheter-based techniques (examples listed on-page) is beneficial; prior experience with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is highly desirable but should not be considered adequate experience for transcatheter MV interventions; and because procedures may involve open or partially open surgical components, operating theater sterile standards are mandatory and the interventionalist must be able to enforce compliance with these standards.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: current perspectives and future implications [^97e7129b]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an attractive treatment strategy for the treatment of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), particularly those who are inoperable or at high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. Several multicentre registries and randomised trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this technology in improving the survival as well as functional capacity of patients with AS. Most of the elderly patients with severe AS have multiple non-cardiac comorbidities, which might limit survival and impede the improvement in functional capacity afforded by TAVR. Therefore, optimal patient selection based on precise risk assessment is currently the cornerstone of evaluation of patients for TAVR. Due to the need for a multifaceted approach in patient evaluation, procedural conduct as well as postprocedure management, multidisciplinary heart valve teams have assumed a paramount role in the TAVR process. This review presents the current perspectives in patient selection, risk assessment, procedural considerations and outcomes following TAVR, along with implications for the future.

### The future of transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^1128a475]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) into clinical practice, the treatment of aortic stenosis has changed dramatically. In the past, medical therapy with or without balloon aortic valvuloplasty was the only option for inoperable patients. More recently, TAVI has become the treatment of choice for these patients and the preferred alternative for high-risk operable patients. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) currently remains the gold standard for patients at low or intermediate operative risk. As randomized trials have demonstrated comparable results between TAVI and SAVR in the high-risk population, there is now a clear trend towards performing TAVI even in intermediate-risk patients while awaiting the results of randomized trials in that population. Nevertheless, there are still questions regarding TAVI involving paravalvular leak (PVL), stroke, pacemaker requirements, and durability that remain to be more definitively answered before TAVI can routinely be performed in a broader, lower risk population. Improvements in patient selection, imaging, and second and third generation devices have decreased the incidence of PVLs and vascular complications that followed the earliest TAVI procedures, but the rates of perioperative stroke and permanent pacemaker implantation must still be addressed. Furthermore, the long-term durability of TAVI devices and a role for post-procedure antithrombotic management remain unanswered. Until these questions are more clearly answered, it is the Heart Team's task to determine the optimal treatment for each patient based on risk scores, frailty metrics, comorbidities, patient preference, and potential for improvement in quality of life.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) — trial scope and long-term outcomes note that "at present, 2 trials are randomizing low-risk patients to SAVR or TAVR", while earlier controlled trials excluded many coexistent diseases and thus "a substantial minority of patients (so-called Cohort C patients) were not included", and "frailty and liver disease" were not incorporated. Despite exclusions, "the all-cause 5-year mortality rates of patients who received TAVR in the PARTNER 1B and PARTNER 1A trials were 72%… and 68%…, respectively". Current evaluation has "focused on… predictors of optimal, suboptimal, or bad outcomes, both early and at 1-year follow up", and such outcomes "are best understood when they are compared before and after TAVR".

### Trends in transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement outcomes in patients with low-surgical risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^05b3cbc4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valvular heart disease, especially prevalent in the elderly population, and symptomatic severe AS is associated with a poor prognosis. Conventionally, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the gold standard for treating severe AS. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a less invasive alternative, initially indicated for patients with high surgical risk. Over time, TAVR has demonstrated promising short‐ to intermediate‐term outcomes in both efficacy and safety, prompting consideration of its use in a broader patient population, including those at lower surgical risk, defined by a Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality (STS‐PROM) score of < 4%.

The annual number of TAVR interventions surpassed SAVR in the United States in 2019 and rapidly expanded worldwide. This trend is likely to continue because of the aging population and the expanding role of the procedure to include intermediate‐ and low‐risk populations. Nevertheless, the use of TAVR in patients at low surgical risk has raised concerns because of their relatively younger age, greater life expectancy, and potential TAVR‐specific complications. A thorough understanding of temporal trends in complications following TAVR and SAVR is critical to guide individual treatment decisions for patients with severe AS. Currently, 7 clinical trials focusing on low‐surgical risk patients often used varied primary composite end points, with only 3 trials — Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention (NOTION), Evolut low risk, and Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves 3 (PARTNER 3) — having follow‐up durations of > 1 year. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis, integrating recent evidence from clinical trials targeting low surgical‐risk patients with severe AS to evaluate the trends in outcomes after TAVR compared with SAVR.

### Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised trials [^ab56406b]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is the gold standard for treating aortic valve stenosis in operable patients. Even though SAVR improves symptoms and survival, subgroups of patients are at increased risk for mortality and morbidity and it would be desirable for this cohort to undergo a less invasive procedure. Transcatheter AVR (TAVR) can be performed by the transfemoral (TF) or transapical route. Results of recent randomised prospective trials demonstrate both the future promise and current problems of the TAVR approach. The PARTNER Trial Investigatorshave shown that patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who are high risk developed complications with conventional surgery, SAVR and TAVR have similar mortality at 30 days and 1 year and lead to comparable improvements in symptoms. Transcatheter replacement could be a substitute for surgical replacement in the high-risk subgroup of patients with AS. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety end points of TAVR with SAVR through a meta-analysis and review the evidence published so far.

### The potential impact and timeline of engineering on congenital interventions [^cdc0bc7d]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Congenital interventional cardiology has seen rapid growth in recent decades due to the expansion of available medical devices. Percutaneous interventions have become standard of care for many common congenital conditions. Unfortunately, patients with congenital heart disease often require multiple interventions throughout their lifespan. The availability of transcatheter devices that are biodegradable, biocompatible, durable, scalable, and can be delivered in the smallest sized patients will rely on continued advances in engineering. The development pipeline for these devices will require contributions of many individuals in academia and industry including experts in material science and tissue engineering. Advances in tissue engineering, bioresorbable technology, and even new nanotechnologies and nitinol fabrication techniques which may have an impact on the field of transcatheter congenital device in the next decade are summarized in this review. This review highlights recent advances in the engineering of transcatheter-based therapies and discusses future opportunities for engineering of transcatheter devices.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) volume–outcome commentary — Figure 2 shows the categorization of sites based on their TAVR volume and risk-adjusted outcome measures, such as the observed-to-expected ratio of an outcome measure (e.g., risk-adjusted in-hospital, 30-day, and ultimately, 1-year mortality). It is anticipated that most low-volume sites will steadily increase their number of procedures due to the approval of moderate-risk patients for TAVR, FDA approval of additional indications for TAVR usage, and ongoing aging of the U.S. population. Preliminary data note that many low-volume sites have seemingly acceptable outcomes; however, due to the low number of cases in such sites, the assessment of their outcomes is statistically challenging, resulting in substantial random sampling variation (i.e., wide confidence intervals). The volume-outcome relationship and learning curve shown during the initial U.S. experience in TAVR require updating.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis in people with low surgical risk [^985bf164]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The definitive management for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR). The choice of transcatheter approach versus open-heart surgery for AVR in people with severe AS and low surgical risk remains a matter of debate.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in people with severe AS and low surgical risk.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 29 April 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched all databases from inception to present and imposed no restriction on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared TAVI and SAVR in adults (18 years of age or older) with severe AS and low surgical risk.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias in the studies included. We analysed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using the mean difference (MD), with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow-up). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, length of hospital stay (LOS), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and any bleeding.

Main Results

We identified four studies (13 reports), with 2818 participants, and one ongoing study. Overall certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. There is probably little or no difference between TAVI and SAVR for the following short-term outcomes: all-cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; SAVR 11 deaths per 1000, TAVI 8 deaths per 1000 (95% CI 4 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; SAVR 21 strokes per 1000, TAVI 16 strokes per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 27); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; SAVR 14 MI per 1000, TAVI 11 MI per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 21); 2748 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); and cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56; SAVR 10 cardiac deaths per 1000, TAVI 7 cardiac deaths per 1000 (95% CI 3 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). TAVI may reduce the risk of short-term rehospitalisation, although the confidence interval also includes the possibility of no difference in risk between groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; SAVR 30 cases per 1000, TAVI 19 cases per 1000 (95% CI 12 to 32); 2468 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). TAVI, compared with SAVR, probably increases the risk of PPM implantation (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.87; SAVR 47 per 1000, TAVI 170 cases per 1000 (95% CI 70 to 413); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 7; 2683 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the LOS in days, although it appears to be associated with shorter LOS. TAVI, compared with SAVR, reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30; 2683 participants; 3 studies), AKI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58; 2753 participants; 4 studies), and bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62; 2753 participants; 4 studies) (all high-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicates that, in the short term, TAVI probably has little or no mortality difference compared to SAVR for severe AS in individuals with low surgical risk. Similarly, there is probably little or no difference in risk of stroke, MI, and cardiac death between the two approaches. TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation, but we are uncertain about the effects on LOS. TAVI reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, AKI, and bleeding. However, this benefit is offset by the increased risk of PPM implantation. Long-term follow-up data are needed to further assess and validate these outcomes, especially durability, in the low surgical risk population.

### Transcatheter mitral-valve repair in patients with heart failure [^5587311c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study COAPT was published by Stone GW and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Mitral regurgitation and Heart failure. In the COAPT study, the trial question was: what is the role of transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with HF and symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe secondary MR? In the COAPT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the COAPT study, the population was: 614 patients (221 female, 393 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HF and symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe secondary MR despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy. The key exclusion criteria were untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization, CABG, PCI or TAVR within the prior 30 days, cerebrovascular accident within prior 30 days, severe symptomatic carotid stenosis, carotid surgery or stenting within prior 30 days. In the COAPT study, the interventions were: n = 302 transcatheter repair (mitral valve repair with the MitraClip™ device within 14 days after randomization plus guideline-recommended medical therapy) n = 312 medical therapy alone (guideline-recommended medical therapy alone). In the COAPT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in all hospitalizations for HF within 24 months (35.8% / p-y vs. 67.9% / p-y; HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.7). In the COAPT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from any cause at 2 years (29.1% vs. 46.1%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.82). In the COAPT study, the conclusion was: in patients with HF and symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe secondary MR despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy, transcatheter repair was superior to medical therapy alone with respect to all hospitalizations for HF within 24 months.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^81dda9b6]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2020 aortic valve intervention — adults < 65 years: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has demonstrated excellent durability, and earlier randomized trials of SAVR versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) enrolled older adults with a mean age in the mid-80s, while more recent lower-risk trials had a mean age in the mid-70s with very few patients < 65 years of age, so the evidence base cannot be extrapolated to these patients. Based on the published evidence, the guideline states that the most prudent course is to recommend SAVR for adults < 65 years of age unless life expectancy is limited by comorbid cardiac or noncardiac conditions, and there are no data for the use of TAVI in patients < 65 years of age; the final choice is made through shared decision-making that accounts for the patient's values and preferences.

### 'Valve for life': tackling the deficit in transcatheter treatment of heart valve disease in the UK [^5410c2ce]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Valve for Life initiative was launched by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) in 2015 with the objective of improving access to transcatheter valve interventions across Europe. The approach has been founded on four tenets: to raise awareness of the importance of valvular heart disease in the general population, to facilitate access to transcatheter heart valve interventions, to raise educational standards and thereby reduce obstacles to therapy implementation and to diminish age and gender discrimination in the access to care.

The objectives of Valve for Life are ambitious, requiring improved delivery of transcatheter valve interventions within countries as well as reducing disparities between them. Countries selected are those where penetration of transcatheter procedures is low; the Valve for Life programme is an opportunity to identify the obstacles that contribute to this and engage change. The inaugural Valve for Life initiative was launched in Poland and quickly made its mark, with the Polish Ministry of Health allocating sufficient funds to increase the number of transcatheter valve interventions by 20% for the following year. Subsequent projects in France and Portugal have been well received and successful, and the UK has been selected as the fourth country to be included in the programme. This article, focussing exclusively on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as the dominant established transcatheter valve therapy (TVT), will outline the nature and scale of the problem to be tackled in the UK and will describe the proposals of the UK Valve for Life team to overcome them.

### Catheter-based intervention of the "Forgotten" valve: time to reconsider tricuspid valve intervention? [^71c70927]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is one of the most common valvular disorders seen among heart failure patients, and its presence is associated with a worse clinical prognosis. In the adult population, primary tricuspid valve disease is rare, and TR usually results from chronic underlying mitral valve conditions. The therapeutic approach to "functional TR" has historically been conservative and focused on treating the underlying mitral valve pathology first. Recent data suggest that medically treated TR continues to worsen over time and carries a worse prognosis among patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. In the last several years, a growing academic interest in the early diagnosis and therapy of the so-called "forgotten valve" is gaining momentum.

Many questions still remain unanswered regarding the proper treatment of patients with functional TR. In response to this unmet clinical need, several transcatheter-based technologies aimed to either repair or replace the tricuspid valve are under development. This large number of devices and technological approaches has resulted from the need to develop solutions to a condition with a high degree of anatomic variability and the technical desire to replicate proven surgical techniques.

### Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analyses of observational studies [^1c622e00]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation is approved for the treatment of dysfunctional right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits. However, the literature is limited because of a small patient population, and it does not reflect changing procedural practice patterns over the last decade.

Methods and Results

A comprehensive search of Medline and Scopus databases from inception through August 31, 2016 was conducted using predefined criteria. We included studies reporting transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation in at least 5 patients with a follow‐up duration of 6 months or more. In 19 eligible studies, 1044 patients underwent transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation with a pooled follow‐up of 2271 person‐years. Procedural success rate was 96.2% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 94.6–97.4) with a conduit rupture rate of 4.1% (95%, 2.5–6.8) and coronary complication rate of 1.3% (95%, 0.7–2.3). Incidence of reintervention was 4.4 per 100 person‐years overall (95%, 3.0–5.9) with a marked reduction in studies reporting ≥ 75% prestenting (2.9 per 100 person‐years [95%, 1.5–4.3] versus 6.5/100 person‐years [95%, 4.6–8.5]; P < 0.01). Pooled endocarditis rate was 1.4 per 100 person‐years (95%, 0.9–2.0).

Conclusions

Our study provides favorable updated estimates of procedural and follow‐up outcomes after transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation. Widespread adoption of prestenting has improved longer‐term outcomes in these patients.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): recent updates [^c6bd0b3f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Within the last two decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the management of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS). Newer generations of transcatheter valve design, optimized imaging planning, growing operator experience, and technical refinements have driven enhancements in safety and reduction of procedural complications over time. These improvements have allowed expansion to lower risk patients, in which TAVR confirmed favorable outcomes compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Based on current evidence, the 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines provided updated recommendations on indications for TAVR, with several clinical indications remain with SAVR. As TAVR expands to younger, low-risk patients with longer life expectancies, different issues of utmost importance have emerged, such as long-term durability, bioprosthetic valve performance, coronary reaccess, prognostic impact of conduction disturbances and paravalvular leak, reintervention after TAVR, and optimal pharmacological management after the procedure.

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^fbcee7b9]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aortic valve stenosis is the most common primary valve disease leading to surgical or transcatheter valve replacement in Europe and North America, with a growing prevalence due to the ageing population. Driven by technological developments, the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis has seen a significant change over the past decade.

Since the 2012 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Association of CardioThoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease, a large amount of new data have accumulated, particularly in the field of catheter-based treatment of aortic valve stenosis. There have been five randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as well as large-scale registry data. Indications for TAVR have expanded as there is new evidence for the lower risk populations. This has resulted in an exponential growth in the number of TAVR procedures performed in Europe and North America, with the number of TAVR now surpassing the number of isolated SAVR in several European countries. Surprisingly, the number of SAVR procedures have long been unaffected by the rise of TAVR; however, a modest decline in the number of SAVR procedures has been reported since 2 years. Overall, the total 'AVR landscape' has significantly changed within the last 5–10 years (figure 1), driven by new technologies and new clinical evidence.

Besides this shift in intervention mode, there is also new evidence regarding predictors of outcome in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and on antithrombotic therapy in the SAVR and TAVR population.

This required an update of the ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease. These guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease are joint guidelines between cardiologists and surgeons. It is absolutely essential that both specialties follow the same recommendations as they are treating the same patients.

This document aims to give an update and comprehensive overview on the position of TAVR in the latest 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease.

### Current status of transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^6fef6872]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has long been the mainstay of therapy for severe aortic stenosis. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now generally accepted as the new standard of care for patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis who are not candidates for open surgery. Arguably TAVR may also be a preferred alternative to SAVR in carefully selected high-risk, but still operable, patients in whom morbidity and mortality may be reduced. Although TAVR outcomes continue to improve, concerns remain with respect to vascular injury, stroke, paravalvular regurgitation, and valve durability. However, it seems likely that with ongoing refinement of transcatheter valve systems, techniques, and patient selection TAVR is becoming an increasingly appealing option for a much broader range of patients. Randomized trials and ongoing surveillance will play an important role as we enter a new era of rigorous clinical evaluation for minimally invasive therapies for structural heart disease.

ACC/AHA 2020 aortic valve intervention — adults 65–80 years: Both SAVR and TAVI are effective approaches to aortic valve replacement (AVR) in adults 65 to 80 years of age, and the guideline makes the same recommendations for symptomatic patients with confirmed severe aortic stenosis (AS) regardless of flow rate. In this age group, TAVI has a slightly lower mortality risk and is associated with a shorter hospital length of stay, more rapid return to normal activities, lower risk of transient or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF), less bleeding, and less pain than SAVR, whereas SAVR is associated with a lower risk of paravalvular leak, less need for valve reintervention, and less need for a permanent pacemaker. Individualized factors must be considered when choosing between procedures, and durability of transcatheter valves beyond 5 to 6 years is not yet known.

All‐Cause Mortality

TAVR was associated with a decreased risk of all‐cause mortality compared with SAVR after both 30‐day (HR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.26–0.77], P: 0.003, I 2: 0%; Figure 2A) and 30‐day to 1‐year (HR: 0.55 [95% CI: 0.37–0.81], P: 0.003, I 2: 16.1%; Figure 2B) follow‐ups. The risk of all‐cause mortality was similar between TAVR and SAVR during the > 1‐year follow‐up (HR: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.74–1.21], P: 0.68, I 2: 24.2%; Figure 2C).

### ACR appropriateness criteria imaging for transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^b262a6b1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Although aortic valve replacement is the definitive therapy for severe aortic stenosis, almost half of patients with severe aortic stenosis are unable to undergo conventional aortic valve replacement because of advanced age, comorbidities, or prohibitive surgical risk. Treatment options have been recently expanded with the introduction of catheter-based implantation of a bioprosthetic aortic valve, referred to as transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Because this procedure is characterized by lack of exposure of the operative field, image guidance plays a critical role in preprocedural planning. This guideline document evaluates several preintervention imaging examinations that focus on both imaging at the aortic valve plane and planning in the supravalvular aorta and iliofemoral system. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Expanding indications of transcatheter heart valve interventions [^390abb26]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been established as a less invasive alternative to open-heart surgery in inoperable or high-risk patients presenting with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. The feasibility and efficacy of valve-in-valve implantation in degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses have also been described and can currently be considered a valuable treatment option in patients deemed unsuitable for repeat cardiac surgery. However, the clinical use of TAVR devices is not limited to the treatment of the tricuspid stenotic aortic valve. Several additional indications including treatment of the bicuspid stenotic aortic valve, aortic regurgitation, and valve-in-valve or valve-in-ring implantation in the mitral or tricuspid position as well as treatment of pure mitral, tricuspid, or pulmonary regurgitation have been described. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the available evidence concerning the emerging off-label use of TAVR devices in current clinical practice. Case examples have been selected to highlight the main procedural steps of each particular intervention.

Patients with inoperable, high-risk, and intermediate-risk aortic stenosis can now be treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration selectively choose centers based on experience and require a collaborative, multidisciplinary team approach in the treatment and decision making for these patients. The work-up has been streamlined. Gated multislice computed tomography angiogram has emerged as the gold standard for assessment of valve anatomy and sizing of the transcatheter heart valve. Assessment of risk has evolved to include a more comprehensive functional and frailty evaluation. Long term-results are needed before the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement into the low-risk category.

### European journal of heart failure expert consensus statement on transcatheter treatment of mitral regurgitation in heart failure [^5e5b59a7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) is highly prevalent in patients with heart failure (HF), associated with poor prognosis, and its treatment is typically preceded by implementing pharmacotherapy for HF as well as cardiac resynchronization therapy. Given the increase in experience and important technological iterations, transcatheter mitral valve repair has witnessed increasing safety and efficacy. Recently, two randomized controlled trials extended the level of evidence for this intervention in patients with SMR: RESHAPE-HF2 randomized patients with less severe SMR to either medical therapy alone versus adjunct transcatheter repair, whereas the MATTERHORN trial compared surgical therapy with transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with SMR and increased risk for surgery. These two trials have a potential impact on the indications of transcatheter repair. Here we discuss updated indications for transcatheter mitral valve therapy across the different subtypes of SMR, revisit the current body of evidence for transcatheter mitral valve repair and classify this technique into the current treatment hierarchy of SMR in patients with HF.

### Transcatheter mitral valve repair for functional mitral regurgitation: evaluating the evidence [^42b42dd9]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Two trials (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation Trial and Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation Trial) were published in 2018 evaluating the effectiveness and safety of transcatheter repair for patients with heart failure with significant functional mitral regurgitation, which yielded different results. This article reviews the strength of the evidence, differences in trial designs, ethical and implementation implications, and delineates future research needs to help guide the appropriate dissemination of transcatheter repair for functional patients with mitral regurgitation.

Methods

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a workshop of interdisciplinary experts to address these objectives.

Results

Transcatheter repair of functional mitral regurgitation can provide significant benefits in terms of heart failure hospitalizations, survival, and quality of life when appropriate heart failure candidates with moderate to severe or severe mitral regurgitation while on optimal guideline-directed medical therapy can be identified. Key ingredients for success are preoperative evaluation and management and postoperative care by an interdisciplinary heart team.

Conclusions

Given the discordance observed between trials, ongoing innovation in patient management, and potential expansion of indications for use, the evidence base must be expanded to optimize appropriate implementation of this complex therapy. This will require more complete capture of outcome data in real-world settings for all eligible candidates whether or not they receive this therapy. Inevitably, the indications for use of this therapy will expand, as will the devices and therapeutic approaches for this population, necessitating the study of comparative effectiveness through randomized trials or observational studies. Moreover, given the substantial variations in care delivery, conducting implementation research to delineate characteristics of the optimal care model would be of benefit.

Major cardiovascular comorbidity — coronary angiography is indicated in all patients because coronary artery disease is common in patients undergoing TAVR (40% to 75%); concurrent coronary revascularization may be needed, particularly if multivessel or left main coronary disease is present, although it is unclear if 30-day mortality is influenced by revascularization status; until more definitive randomized data are available, the Heart Valve Team should decide whether to revascularize before TAVR on a case-by-case basis; in a post hoc analysis of the PARTNER 2A trial, revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass graft in addition to TAVR did not increase the risk of death or disabling stroke at 2-year follow-up compared with TAVR or SAVR alone; other conditions that might increase procedural risk or limit benefit include LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension, and low flow — defined as stroke volume index less than 35 mL/m2 — may also be associated with poor outcomes post-TAVR regardless of EF.
