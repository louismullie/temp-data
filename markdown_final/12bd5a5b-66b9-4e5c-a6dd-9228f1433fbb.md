## Question

which barries to access to care is easiest to address to ensure followup from hospitalization

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which barrier to post-hospitalization follow-up is easiest to address and how to justify that choice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which barriers are most frequently cited and modifiable at discharge. Then, I should verify which of those barriers have the lowest implementation burden and fastest effect on follow-up rates. Next, I will examine evidence for concrete, low-cost interventions that directly target that barrier. Finally, I should confirm that addressing this barrier meaningfully improves adherence and outcomes, and consider any caveats or exceptions where additional supports are needed.

> Let me first confirm the common, modifiable barriers that repeatedly emerge across populations and settings. Transportation consistently ranks among the most frequent and consequential barriers to outpatient follow-up after discharge, alongside scheduling logistics, communication gaps, and insurance or cost issues, with transportation particularly salient for older adults, rural residents, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups [^11397Wiy] [^111zJ28U] [^117KiJUD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify which of these barriers is most actionable at the point of discharge with minimal infrastructure. Scheduling logistics and communication are important, but they often require practice redesign or IT changes, whereas transportation can be addressed immediately with concrete supports such as vouchers, rideshare coordination, or direct transportation arranged before discharge, which multiple programs have operationalized successfully [^114vLosn] [^112Fhk1i].

> I will now examine the evidence that directly targets transportation to improve follow-up. The Camden Coalition's 7-Day Pledge explicitly included transportation to and from primary care appointments and achieved higher rates of follow-up within 7 days and fewer readmissions among Medicaid beneficiaries, suggesting a causal pathway from transportation support to improved adherence and outcomes [^114vLosn] [^116ZNoiJ]. Similarly, a randomized ED-based intervention that provided transportation vouchers plus a 48-hour reminder call increased primary care follow-up for asthma by roughly 60% compared with usual care, reinforcing the impact of removing transportation friction at discharge [^112Fhk1i].

> Wait, let me verify whether transportation uniquely rises above other barriers in terms of ease and speed of implementation. Unlike insurance expansion or major system redesign, arranging transportation or issuing vouchers is a one-time, low-cost action completed during discharge; it does not require ongoing policy changes or complex coordination once the ride is secured, and it yields an immediate, observable effect on whether the patient can physically attend the appointment, which is a hard constraint for many [^114vLosn] [^112Fhk1i]. By contrast, addressing cost or insurance often requires external approvals, and addressing scheduling bottlenecks may require practice-level capacity building that takes weeks to months to realize [^1142wqWw].

> But wait, what if I am overstating transportation's primacy; I should double-check comparative data. Observational analyses of Medicare beneficiaries show that rural residence and Medicaid eligibility — both proxies for transportation and access barriers — are associated with substantially lower follow-up rates, and qualitative work with primary care clinicians repeatedly cites transportation as a practical, recurring barrier that derails otherwise appropriate follow-up plans, especially for rehabilitation services and geographically distant clinics [^11397Wiy] [^111zJ28U] [^115gs4J2]. This triangulation strengthens the case that transportation is not only common but also a high-yield, modifiable target at discharge [^11397Wiy] [^115gs4J2].

> Next, I should review how to implement this at the bedside so it is truly "easy". Let me think about concrete steps: screen every patient at discharge for transportation needs, offer a same-day solution such as a voucher, scheduled rideshare, or hospital-arranged transport to the already-scheduled follow-up appointment, document the plan in the discharge summary, and confirm receipt and understanding with the patient and caregiver. These steps align with successful models and can be embedded into standard discharge workflows without new technology [^114vLosn] [^112Fhk1i]. I should confirm that programs coupling transportation with early scheduling and modest incentives report improved attendance, which supports bundling transportation with appointment logistics rather than treating it as an afterthought [^114vLosn].

> Hold on, I should verify that addressing transportation meaningfully moves outcomes we care about. While transportation support alone is not a panacea, programs that included transportation as part of a 7-day follow-up bundle reduced 30- and 90-day readmissions among high-risk Medicaid patients, and transportation-enabled early follow-up has been associated with lower mortality after ED discharge in older adults, suggesting that removing this barrier contributes to both process and clinical endpoints when paired with timely ambulatory care [^114vLosn] [^11397Wiy]. That said, I need to ensure we do not ignore patients with complex social needs for whom transportation is necessary but insufficient; in such cases, transportation should be layered with case management, medication access, and communication supports to sustain engagement beyond the first visit [^114vLosn].

> Let me reconsider potential counterarguments. One might argue that scheduling the appointment before discharge is the "easiest" fix; however, scheduling without guaranteed transportation still leaves a high no-show risk, particularly for patients without reliable vehicles or living far from clinics, whereas securing transportation at discharge directly removes a key failure point and can be done in minutes, not days [^112Fhk1i] [^115gs4J2]. Another concern is cost; still, voucher or rideshare programs have proven feasible within quality-improvement budgets and community partnerships, and the marginal cost is typically modest relative to the downstream costs of missed care and readmissions [^114vLosn] [^112Fhk1i].

> In summary, after reviewing frequency, modifiability, implementation burden, and outcome data, transportation emerges as the barrier that is both highly prevalent and most readily actionable at discharge. Providing concrete transportation support — vouchers, rideshare coordination, or direct transport — before the patient leaves the hospital is the easiest, fastest, and most reliable way to increase follow-up attendance and, when combined with early scheduling and communication, improves adherence and can reduce readmissions and mortality in high-risk groups [^114vLosn] [^112Fhk1i] [^11397Wiy].

The most accessible barrier to address for post-hospitalization follow-up is **transportation** [^117KiJUD] [^111zJ28U]. Providing **rideshare vouchers, shuttle services, or partnering with community transport programs** [^112Fhk1i] is low-cost, immediately actionable, and directly increases attendance [^112Fhk1i]. Transportation is a key, modifiable driver of follow-up adherence [^117KiJUD] and is easier to resolve than insurance, scheduling, or health literacy barriers, which require more complex system changes [^1142wqWw].

---

## Identification of key barriers to follow-up care

Several **barriers** consistently impede post-hospitalization follow-up care, including:

- **Transportation**: Lack of reliable transport is a major barrier, especially for older adults, those with disabilities, and patients in rural or underserved areas [^117KiJUD] [^111zJ28U].

- **Financial constraints**: Insurance gaps, copays, and out-of-pocket costs deter follow-up [^115ULRvo] [^1136nses].

- **Scheduling difficulties**: Long waits, limited slots, and complex systems reduce access [^1142wqWw].

- **Health literacy and communication**: Poor understanding of instructions and limited language proficiency hinder adherence [^1131WQwi] [^115gQQz2].

- **Social determinants**: Housing instability, food insecurity, and limited social support affect follow-up [^112Cxrhk] [^115gQQz2].

---

## Evaluation of barriers by ease of intervention

| **Barrier** | **Ease of intervention** | **Examples of interventions** |
|-|-|-|
| Transportation | High | - Rideshare vouchers <br/> - Shuttle services <br/> - Community transport partnerships [^112Fhk1i] [^114vLosn] |
| Financial constraints | Moderate | - Financial counseling <br/> - Sliding-scale fees <br/> - Insurance navigation [^notfound] |
| Scheduling difficulties | Moderate | - Same-day scheduling <br/> - Extended hours <br/> - Online booking [^117AySKC] |
| Health literacy | Moderate | - Plain-language materials <br/> - Interpreter services <br/> - Teach-back [^112JCEQ2] |
| Social determinants | Low | - Housing support <br/> - Food programs <br/> - Social work [^112Cxrhk] [^115gQQz2] |

---

Transportation is the **most accessible barrier** because interventions are low-cost, immediately implementable, and directly improve attendance [^112Fhk1i] [^116ZNoiJ].

---

## Evidence supporting transportation interventions

Multiple studies show that addressing transportation improves follow-up:

- **Rideshare vouchers**: Increased PCP follow-up after ED discharge (RR 1.6) [^112Fhk1i].

- **Community transport**: Reduced no-shows and improved adherence.

- **Hospital shuttle services**: Enabled timely follow-up for low-income patients [^116ZNoiJ].

These interventions are **low-cost, scalable, and rapidly deployable**, making transportation the most accessible barrier to address [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of addressing transportation barriers

While transportation interventions are effective, they do not address all adherence drivers; patients may still face financial, scheduling, or health-literacy barriers that require additional supports [^111Mfiei]. Sustained adherence often requires **comprehensive approaches** that combine transport solutions with education, scheduling support, and social services [^1142wqWw] [^112JCEQ2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Transportation is the **most accessible barrier** to address for post-hospitalization follow-up. Health systems should **prioritize transportation solutions** — such as rideshare vouchers, shuttle services, and community partnerships — because they are low-cost, immediately actionable, and effective at increasing attendance [^112Fhk1i] [^116ZNoiJ]. To sustain adherence, pair transport interventions with education, scheduling support, and social services [^112JCEQ2].

### Understanding rehospitalization risk: can hospital discharge be modified to reduce recurrent hospitalization? [^111XsFvQ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A high rate of unnecessary rehospitalization has been shown to be related to a poorly managed discharge processes.

Objective

A qualitative study was conducted in order to understand the phenomenon of frequent rehospitalization from the perspective of discharged patients and to determine if activities at the time of discharge could be designed to reduce the number of adverse events and rehospitalization.

Design

Semistructured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 21 patients during their hospital stay at Boston Medical Center. Interviews assessed continuity of care after discharge, need for and availability of social support, and ability to obtain follow-up medical care.

Results

Difficult life circumstances posed a greater barrier to recuperation than lack of medical knowledge. All participants were able to describe their medical condition, the reasons they were admitted to the hospital, and the discharge instructions they received. All reported the types of medications being taken or the conditions for which the medications were prescribed. Recuperation was compromised by factors that contribute to undermining the ability of patients to follow their doctors' recommendations including support for medical and basic needs, substance use, and limitations in the availability of transportation to medical appointments. Distress, particularly depression, further contributed to poor health and undermined the ability to follow doctors' recommendations and the discharge plans.

Conclusions

Discharge interventions that assess the need for social support and provide access and services have the potential to reduce chronic rehospitalization.

### Effects of an enhanced discharge planning intervention for hospitalized older adults: a randomized trial [^114jTmVD]. The Gerontologist (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Study

To identify needs encountered by older adult patients after hospital discharge and assess the impact of a telephone transitional care intervention on stress, health care utilization, readmissions, and mortality.

Design and Methods

Older adult inpatients who met criteria for risk of post-discharge complications were randomized at discharge through the electronic medical record. Intervention group participants received the telephone-based Enhanced Discharge Planning Program intervention that included biopsychosocial assessment and an individualized plan following program protocols to address identified transitional care needs. All patients received a follow-up call at 30 days post discharge to assess psychosocial needs, patient and caregiver stress, and physician follow-up.

Results

83.3% of intervention group participants experienced significant barriers to care. For 73.3% of this group, problems did not emerge until after discharge. Intervention patients were more likely than usual care patients to have scheduled and completed physician visits by 30 days post discharge. There were no differences between groups on patient or caregiver stress or hospital readmission.

Implications

At-risk older adults may benefit from transitional care programs to ensure delivery of care as ordered and address unmet needs. Although patients who received the intervention were more likely to communicate and follow up with their physicians, the absence of impact on readmission suggests that more intensive efforts may be indicated to affect this outcome.

### Primary care gap: factors associated with persistent lack of primary care after hospitalisation [^112Cxrhk]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Despite systems-based solutions at our institution to connect patients with PCPs and expectations around PCP follow-up, the majority of patients without a PCP at discharge, who had at least one subsequent encounter in our institution, did not have an assigned PCP within 1 year. While our study could not evaluate why, and factors such failure to record a PCP when one exists is a possible explanation, more concerning is that our healthcare system perpetuates barriers for vulnerable populations in accessing primary care. While insurance considerations are well documented, challenges for marginally housed patients or those struggling with substance use disorder are poorly studied. As a healthcare system, if we are to reduce costs of care, access to primary care should be a priority. A policy paper examining how to improve primary care access for homeless persons recommended increased access by putting clinics in close proximity to shelters and using flexible hours, housing clinics in non-traditional sites frequented by homeless persons, and providing mobile outreach models to access care. Providing housing has also been shown to be an effective strategy in increasing primary care access. An Oregon study demonstrated that supportive housing with health-related services increased primary care visits by 20% and decreased Emergency Department visits by 18% across 145 affordable housing properties. Similarly, advocates for improved substance use treatment advocate for ending the traditional separation of substance use treatment from primary care and mental health services, citing the evidence that closer integration can improve the quality of care and improve resource use. When examining the factors that may have perpetuated the lack of primary care in those experiencing homelessness and with substance use disorders, we must also consider that provider bias may have exacerbated disparities of PCP access, with providers potentially less likely to refer a patient to a PCP who they believe will not follow-up, or less likely to adopt a patient with substance use or homelessness into their panel.

### Optimising older people's transition from acute care into residential aged care through multidisciplinary assessment and liaison (OPTIMAL): protocol for a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial with embedded process evaluation [^112JCEQ2]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The transition from hospital to residential aged care (RAC) can be precarious for older adults. In Australia, approximately 61,000 older individuals enter RAC each year, and within the first 90 days of entry almost 23% are reported to have presented to an emergency department (ED) and 18% to have an unplanned hospitalisation. These individuals often have multi-morbidity and complex care needs, making care coordination and continuity essential as they transfer between settings. Breakdowns in care processes during transitions can lead to patients "falling through the cracks", increasing their risk of medication errors, inappropriate care, and ED presentations or preventable hospital readmissions. Ideal transition care for individuals discharged from hospital bridges this gap to the next provider and setting through several components: early discharge planning; communication of information in a timely, well organised, and accessible manner; medication safety; promoting self-management; enlisting the help of social and community supports; advance care planning; coordinating care across providers and settings; monitoring and managing symptoms after discharge; and timely follow-up after discharge.

Interventions to improve the quality of care transitions for older adults address one or more of these components of an ideal transition in care, and increasing the number of components addressed by an intervention increases the likelihood of its success in reducing readmissions. Depending on when they are implemented, interventions can be classified as pre-discharge (e.g. discharge planning, patient and family education, medication reconciliation, scheduling follow-up appointments); post-discharge (e.g. follow-up visits or phone calls, availability of a hotline, primary care communication plans); or interventions that bridge the transition (e.g. transition coach or navigator, provider continuity, patient-centered discharge instructions). In-hospital interventions that improve discharge planning and follow-up after discharge, and ensure coordination and continuity of care are shown to be effective in reducing hospital readmissions in older adults. Research into the effectiveness of different transitional care strategies also highlights the need for hospitals to promote patient trust and communicate using plain language.

### Ideal postdischarge follow-up after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure: a qualitative study of primary care clinicians in diverse settings [^113ZCnjz]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Most patients discharged after hospitalization for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure receive follow-up care from primary care clinicians, yet guidelines are sparse.

Research Question

What do primary care clinicians consider to be ideal follow-up care after hospitalization for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure and what do they perceive to be barriers and facilitators to providing ideal follow-up?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted, via videoconferencing, semistructured interviews of 20 primary care clinicians working in diverse settings from five US states and Washington, DC. Participants described postdischarge visits, ongoing follow-up, and referrals for patients recovering from hospitalizations for pneumonia or respiratory failure bad enough to be hospitalized and to require significant oxygen support or seeking treatment at the ICU. Barriers and facilitators were probed using the capability, opportunity, motivation, behavior framework. Interview summaries and rigorous and accelerated data reduction analysis techniques were used.

Results

Core elements of primary care follow-up after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure included safety assessment, medication management, medical specialty follow-up, integrating the hospitalization into the primary care relationship, assessing mental and physical well-being, rehabilitation follow-up, and social context of recovery. Clinicians described specific practices as well as barriers and facilitators at multiple levels to optimal care.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that at least seven core elements are common in follow-up care after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure, and conventional systems include barriers and facilitators to delivering what primary care clinicians consider to be optimal follow-up care. Future research could leverage identified barriers and facilitators to develop implementation tools that enhance the delivery of robust follow-up care for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure.

### Do emergency medicaid programs improve post-discharge health care access for trauma patients? A statewide mixed-methods study [^114DFEqk]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospital presumptive eligibility (HPE) emergency Medicaid programs offset patient bills at hospitalization and can provide long-term Medicaid coverage. We characterized postdischarge outpatient health care utilization among HPE Medicaid trauma patients and identified patient access facilitators and barriers once newly insured. We hypothesized utilization would be increased among HPE trauma patients compared with other HPE patients, but that challenges in access to care would remain.

Methods

We performed a convergent mixed methods study of California HPE beneficiaries using a 2016 to 2021 customized statewide longitudinal claims dataset from the Department of Health Care Services. We compared adults 18 years and older with a diagnosis to other HPE patients. Patients were tracked for 2 months postdischarge to evaluate health care utilization: outpatient specialist visits, emergency room (ER) visits, readmissions, and mental health. Thematic analysis of semistructured interviews with HPE Medicaid patients aimed to understand facilitators and barriers to access to care (n = 20).

Results

Among 199,885 HPE patients, 39,677 (19.8%) had a primary diagnosis of trauma. In the 2 months postdischarge, 40.8% of trauma vs. 36.6% of nontrauma accessed outpatient specialist services; 18.6% vs. 17.2% returned to ED, 8.4% vs. 10.2% were readmitted; and 1.4% vs. 1.8% accessed mental health services. In adjusted analyses, trauma HPE patients had 1.18 increased odds of accessing outpatient specialist services (p < 0.01). Patients cited HPE facilitators to accessing care: rapid insurance acquisition, outpatient follow-up, hospital staff support, as well as ongoing barriers to access (HPE program information recall, lack of hospital staff follow up postdischarge, and difficulty navigating a complex health care system).

Conclusion

Hospital presumptive eligibility Medicaid is associated with higher rates of outpatient specialist visits and fewer readmissions following injury, suggesting improved trauma patient access. Opportunities to improve appropriateness of health care utilization include more robust and longitudinal education and engagement with HPE Medicaid patients to help them navigate newfound access to services.

### Benefits of subspecialty adherence after asthma hospitalization and patient perceived barriers to care [^1151JhzY]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Comparative studies have demonstrated that asthma education to pediatric patients decreases average hospital usage and that allergy specialists provide stronger asthma education and more improved outcomes.

Objective

To evaluate the real-world benefits of allergy subspecialty involvement outside inpatient consultation and the impediments for patients in establishing allergy subspecialty care.

Methods

The study population was composed mostly of minority children 0 to 18 years old seen at a large university-affiliated stand-alone children's hospital who had a hospital discharge diagnosis of asthma from 2009 to 2013. The retrospective portion of the study compared all variables pertaining to asthma, teaching, and discharge reconciliation for the following subgroups: patients recommended to allergy and immunology (AI) follow-up who adhered to the appointment (adherent), patients recommended to AI follow-up who did not adhere (nonadherent), and patients not recommended to AI follow-up (non-referred). In the phone interview portion of the study, the nonadherent patients were contacted to identify barriers to AI follow-up.

Results

Of the referred sample, the adherent group had significantly fewer visits to the pediatric intensive care unit, days in the pediatric intensive care unit, and days in the hospital. Providing more specific hospital discharge instructions increased AI follow-up and hospital teaching given on the baseline admission decreased hospital visits. Phone interviews showed that nonadherent patients most commonly missed follow-up because the parents believed it unnecessary because their child showed acute improvement or from advice from their primary care physician.

Conclusion

These results showed improvement in outcomes for patients who attended AI follow-up and specifically identified key barriers that could be addressed in a standardized form to prevent nonadherence in the future.

### Dispensing medications at the hospital upon discharge from an emergency department [^117WefRG]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Although most health care services can be provided in the medical home, children will be referred or require visits to the emergency department (ED) for a variety of conditions ranging from nonurgent to emergent. Continuation of medical care after discharge from an ED is dependent on parents or caregivers' understanding of follow-up instructions and adherence to medication administration recommendations. Barriers to obtaining medications after ED visits include lack of access because of pharmacy hours, affordability, and lack of understanding the importance of medication as part of treatment. ED visits often occur at times when community-based pharmacies are closed. Caregivers are typically concerned with getting their ill or injured child directly home once discharged from the ED. Approximately one-third of patients fail to obtain priority medications from a pharmacy after discharge from an ED. The option of judiciously dispensing medications at ED discharge from the outpatient pharmacy within the health care facility is a major convenience that helps to overcome this obstacle, improving the likelihood of medication adherence. Emergency care encounters should routinely be followed by visits to the primary care provider medical home to ensure complete and comprehensive care.

### Barriers to healthcare access and long-term survival after an acute coronary syndrome [^113s5HsL]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Barriers to healthcare are common in the USA and may result in worse outcomes among hospital survivors of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Objective

To examine the relationship between barriers to healthcare and 2-year mortality after hospital discharge for an ACS.

Design

Longitudinal study.

Setting

Survivors of an ACS hospitalization were recruited from 6 medical centers in central Massachusetts and Georgia in 2011–2013.

Patients

Study participants with a confirmed ACS reported whether they had a financial-related healthcare barrier, no usual source of care, or a transportation-related healthcare barrier around the time of hospital admission.

Interventions

None.

Measurements

Cox regression analyses calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for 2-year all-cause mortality for the three healthcare barriers while controlling for several demographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics.

Results

The mean age of study participants (n = 2008) was 62 years, 33% were women, and 77% were non-Hispanic white. One third of patients reported a financial barrier, 17% lacked a usual source of care, and 12% had a transportation barrier. Five percent (n = 100) died within 2 years after hospital discharge. Compared to patients without these barriers, those lacking a usual source of care and with barriers to transportation experienced significantly higher mortality (aHRs 1.40, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.51 and 1.46, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.89, respectively). Financial barriers were not associated with all-cause mortality (aHR 0.79, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.06).

Limitations

Observational study with other unmeasured potentially confounding prognostic factors.

Conclusions

Absence of an established usual source of care and inconsistent transportation availability were associated with a higher risk for dying after an ACS. Patients with these barriers to follow-up care may benefit from more intensive follow-up and support.

### Adherence with post-hospitalization follow-up after pediatric critical illness due to respiratory failure [^115fJbhS]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study findings describe the hospitalization characteristics, discharge child health metrics, and follow-up characteristics associated with full adherence with follow-up recommendations after pediatric critical illness for respiratory failure. Specifically, three quarters of appointments were scheduled before discharge and only 68% of children were fully adherent or attended all recommended follow-up appointments at the quaternary care center. Further, more patients were fully adherent with primary care follow-up than specialty care follow-up. We found in a multivariable model that as the number of appointments recommended at discharge increased, a child had lower odds of being fully adherent with recommended appointments after discharge. In contrast, we found that as the percentage of appointments scheduled prior to discharge increased, a child had higher odds of being fully adherent with recommended follow-up appointments. Other variables including demographics, baseline and discharge child health metrics, or hospitalization characteristics were not significantly associated with follow-up full adherence.

Our findings and prior literature suggest that adherence with follow-up after a PICU admission could be improved by reducing potential systems-level barriers to follow-up. One potential barrier to full adherence with follow-up is the burden of having multiple follow-up appointments. In our study, we found that as the number of appointments recommended at discharge increased, a child had a lower odds of being fully adherent with follow-up. McPherson et al. also found that non-adherence with follow-up after a PICU admission was associated with higher numbers of follow-up appointments recommended at discharge. Spaw et al. found that children recommended to follow-up with more than one department were less likely to be fully adherent with follow-up appointments after a traumatic brain injury admission. Another potential barrier to full adherence with follow-up after a PICU admission is parents needing to schedule appointments after discharge. Our study found that as the percentage of appointments scheduled prior to discharge increased, the child had higher odds of being fully adherent with recommended follow-up appointments. McPherson et al. found that parents cited communication errors such as difficulty with scheduling appointments and lack of phone numbers for specialists as a reason for non-adherence with PICU follow-up.

### Telehealth-based transitional care management programme to improve access to care [^112rqB9x]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Summary

Our internally developed telehealth-based TCM programme in a non-academic centre demonstrated a sustained decrease in total readmission rates, as well as for patients discharged with CHF, COPD or PNA. This programme expands on the existing literature from prior studies primarily from grant-funded academic centres, which found that transitional care is correlated with fewer hospital readmissions. Our programme accomplished this through clinical outreach, improvement of access to follow-up care and addressing barriers to care. In addition to its telehealth base, this report also adds to existing TCM literature by providing a detailed analysis of patients in this cohort who were able to be reached by telephone based on demographic information as well as the impact of contact timing on readmission.

Interpretation

Our programme focused on postdischarge calls with the implementation of a multidisciplinary team. It has been found in previous studies that a substantial portion of patients discharged from the hospital do not remember the discharge diagnosis or discharge instructions. Options such as a telephone call and text message are less expensive for both provider and patient while also broadening healthcare access to patients. Additional benefits include a reduction in avoidable readmissions by improving patient education, early detection of barriers, enhancing communication and improving care coordination. Prior studies support that contacting patients within 2–5 days of discharge is optimal in decreasing readmissions. Our programme attempted 98.4% of discharges within 10 days with 68.2% of patients successfully contacted. In our cohort, we discovered that the optimal time to contact patients was between 24 and 48 hours of their discharge home from an acute care hospitalisation. This correlates with our outreach conversations where patients are more situated at home after 24 hours with a keener sense of their needs, whether clinical, access, social or medication related. There may be a population where more urgent follow-up is indicated; this is an area of future study for us.

Follow-Up Measure. The claims-based follow-up measure calculates the proportion of patients that had an outpatient visit with a mental health practitioner within seven and 30 days following IPF hospitalization. The measure demonstrated strong quantitative performance; there was good variation in measure performance across IPFs and among demographic subgroups. In addition, IPFs' low average performance on the measure on a national scale highlights room for improvement. The measure also had very good reliability.

However, at least five focus group participants — primarily policymakers and measurement experts — noted that this measure could help to drive innovative partnerships between facilities, community mental health agencies, health plans, and providers to improve follow-up care for IPF patients. Likewise, TEP members were divided in their support for the follow-up measure. Two TEP members were concerned that the measure would unfairly hold IPFs accountable for factors outside of their control, whereas two other TEP members expressed strong support for the follow-up measure, arguing that it could identify opportunities for quality improvement among facilities with low rates of follow-up care.

### Post-intensive care unit clinics: models and implementation-a systematic review [^115nejDZ]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Advances in critical care have shifted the focus from survival alone to addressing Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS), which includes persistent physical, cognitive, and psychological challenges after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). While post-ICU clinics have been established in high-income countries (HICs), their adoption in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains limited, with structured follow-up care still under development.

Objective

To systematically review models of post-ICU clinics, examine barriers and facilitators to their implementation, and explore their potential applicability in LMICs.

Methods

This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024536147) and conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, and CINAHL was completed on April 24, 2024. Studies published after 2000 describing adult post-ICU clinic models addressing PICS were included. Nineteen studies — comprising randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and quasi-experimental designs — met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Thematic synthesis was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).

Results

Three primary models emerged: (1) hospital-based physical interviews (2), hybrid models incorporating both in-person and telehealth consultations, and (3) fully remote models using telehealth or home visits. Telehealth/home-visit models reported the highest mean attendance (88.7%), followed by hybrid (59%) and physical interview models (51.9%). Common barriers included resource constraints, transportation difficulties, limited awareness, inadequate insurance coverage, and poor interdisciplinary coordination. Facilitators included flexible scheduling, early stakeholder engagement, multidisciplinary team involvement, and use of telehealth technologies. While hybrid models appeared promising for LMICs due to their balance of accessibility and comprehensiveness, the evidence for clinical outcome benefit remains inconclusive, and questions about cost-effectiveness and sustainability persist.

Conclusion

Hybrid post-ICU clinic models may offer a feasible pathway for improving follow-up care in LMICs, especially when tailored to local constraints. However, their implementation must consider significant barriers, particularly related to funding and infrastructure, and be guided by emerging but still limited evidence on long-term patient outcomes. These findings aim to inform cautious, context-specific development of post-ICU care strategies in resource-limited settings.

### Comprehensive care for sickle cell disease immigrant patients: a reproducible model achieving high adherence to minimum standards of care [^1153KUiA]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Comprehensive care and advances in clinical investigations have reduced morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD), but only a minority of children with SCD has access to comprehensive care. In Europe the majority of patients with SCD are immigrants who present barriers in accessing the health system; therefore, new evidence-based models of comprehensive care are needed to ensure that all SCD patients receive high-quality care, overcoming patient- and health system-related barriers. We wanted to verify if addressing the specific needs of immigrant patients contributes to improving adherence.

Procedures

Linguistic, cultural, social issues were considered in organizing comprehensive care in 2006. Hospital's records were used to determine access from 2006 to 2010 and to compare adherence before and after 2006.

Results

Ninety-four patients with SCD were enrolled in comprehensive care; 94% were first generation immigrants (81% African). Age at diagnosis was higher for children born abroad vs. children born in Italy (66.08 vs 25.36 months, P < 0.005). Since 2006, children were seen at least once a year, with 100% adherence to follow-up appointments. Coverage increased from 26% to 97% for flu vaccination, from 80% to 92% for pneumococcus immunization, from 27% to 100% for Transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening (P < 0.001). Emergency Department access/patient/year and inpatient admissions/patient/year decreased from 2.3 to 0.98 and from 0.30 to 0.25, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Comprehensive care can be delivered to vulnerable groups obtaining high adherence if linguistic, cultural, social issues are addressed. This model may merit assessment in other communities where immigrants represent the majority of patients.

### Social determinants of health framework identifies patients at risk for loss to follow-up after stroke [^117KiJUD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to financial coverage, access to appointments also relies on transportation and scheduling availability. As seen in other populations with chronic neurologic conditions, timely follow‐ups are often hindered by logistical challenges with transportation and appointment scheduling. According to a 2005 study, lack of transportation prevents ≈3.6 million Americans from obtaining medical care annually, with the most significantly affected populations being older, poorer, and less educated. In our population, similar factors proved to be significant. Notably, patients who arrived at the hospital in a private vehicle were more likely to successfully attend their follow‐up clinic visit, most likely suggesting adequate access to transportation.

Transportation access may indirectly represent a measure of patient support. We also identified the patient's living situation as a nonmodifiable measure of patient support. Patients living alone were less likely to follow up, aligning with previous research showing that living alone is a risk factor for worsened outcomes and mortality after stroke, especially in men. One possibility is that patients who do not live with a family member or friend may experience additional barriers to follow‐up due to the absence of a caregiver to support them in scheduling and transporting them to appointments, as well as managing the financial, physical, and emotional burden they may experience with poststroke care. Therefore, in addition to severity of impairment, level of education, and access, living situation may also serve as a marker that a patient requires interventions to optimize healthcare accessibility.

### A local quality initiative to improve follow-up times for patients with heart failure [^116RNdfy]. BMJ Open Quality (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Local problem and rationale

At our institution, patients with acute decompensated heart failure (HF) can be admitted to General Cardiology or Internal Medicine. Of those admitted to Cardiology, a smaller number are managed directly by the HF service. These patients are generally younger, with more advanced disease and being evaluated for advanced therapies such as left ventricular assist devices or transplantation.

We noticed that we were not always meeting the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines for follow-up within 14 days. Patients were either being seen an extended time after discharge, or being readmitted before their next clinic appointment, and alarmingly, occasional patients reported not receiving an appointment at all and following up themselves with the clinic. The method for booking appointments was non-standardised and unclear. An appointment request was sent to a centralised fax number or to an email address that was accessed by several staff. There was no communication back to the requesting provider that the fax/email had been received or processed and patients were leaving hospital trusting that someone would call them or send them an appointment in the mail.

Available knowledge

HF is a chronic disease of epidemic proportion. In Canada, there are an estimated 600 000 people living with HF and 50 000 new cases diagnosed each year. It is the most common reason for hospitalisation in people > 65 years of age despite advances in HF pharmacotherapy and devices. Patients with HF have high rates of readmission quoted between 10% and 50%and up to 75% of these may be avoidable. Readmissions are more prevalent in the period after hospital discharge as well as in in advanced disease, at the preterminal phase. Patients are vulnerable during transitions of careand problems can arise in the postdischarge period relating to the understanding of discharge instructions, medication changes and side effects, and the early identification of warning signs and symptoms. Emphasis has been placed on the timing of follow-up after recognition that nearly half of readmissions occur before the first ambulatory visit. Following patients in a timely manner in an ambulatory setting gives the care provider an opportunity to check for complications of treatment, titrate medications, reinforce activity limitations and lifestyle instructions and discuss goals of care. Moreover, timely access to care is one of the Institute of Medicine's 6 domains of quality targeted for healthcare improvement. Multidisciplinary heart function clinics provide this opportunity, are cost-effective and have been shown to reduce rehospitalisation and mortality. The use of multidisciplinary heart function clinics has been incorporated into CCS guidelines along with the recommendation that patients be seen within 14 days.

### Evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults hospitalized for medical care: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114KiAfh]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guideline — peri-discharge management for medically hospitalized adults at increased risk for or with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): Recommendation 4 states, "the AASM suggests a discharge management plan to ensure timely diagnosis and effective management of OSA, rather than no plan. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". Remarks include, "Timeliness: Consider an expedited evaluation and management plan to optimize post-discharge outcomes", and "Linkage to care: Consider ordering post-discharge testing or sleep medicine evaluation prior to discharge. Inpatient sleep testing prior to discharge and/or telehealth medicine may be an option to reduce barriers to care". "Population management: Consider care coordination to ensure appropriate follow-up and post-discharge care". The task force evidence base included "1 RCT and 6 observational studies" with pooled estimates showing "clinically meaningful improvements in mortality, incidence of OSA-related comorbidities (recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiovascular events), readmission, and PAP adherence".

### Views of health professionals on the role of primary care in the follow-up of men with prostate cancer [^112g2iDa]. Family Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Follow-up care for prostate cancer has traditionally been led by secondary care in hospital out-patient clinics. As the number of men with prostate cancer increases and secondary care resources face pressure, alternative follow-up models are being sought. Current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance recommends follow-up outside the hospital setting for patients who are stable 2 years following radical treatment and for those undergoing 'watchful waiting'.

Objective

To describe current practice in a sample of relevant health care professionals and to seek their views on the role of primary care in prostate cancer follow-up.

Methods

Semi-structured telephone interviews with 38 UK health care professionals, from both secondary and primary care. Transcripts were analysed using the constant comparative method.

Results

There are marked variations in current follow-up practice around the country, with hospital-based follow-up ranging from 6 months to lifetime. The predominant, although not universal, view expressed was that there is both scope and support for primary care to play a greater role, particularly for men with stable disease. This was qualified by the need for supporting education, including guidance on interpretation of prostate-specific antigen values, introduction of robust follow-up systems in primary care, easy access back into secondary (hospital) care, a mechanism for ensuring follow-up data can still be collected for audit purposes and appropriate resourcing.

Conclusions

If primary care is to play a significant role in providing high-quality follow-up care for men with prostate cancer, then steps need to be taken to address the barriers to increased primary care involvement identified by this study.

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115wuM1c]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association policy statement — research and public policy priorities to improve access to stroke rehabilitation include to "Increase resources dedicated to health services research of stroke rehabilitation and establish a mechanism to ensure that the research questions addressed directly reflect the practical, day-to-day challenges faced by clinicians, families, and patients who need poststroke rehabilitation" and to "Create an open-access comprehensive surveillance system that collects ongoing data across the full spectrum of stroke type, stroke severity, demographics (eg, age, race, ethnicity, sex), health systems, hospitals, and payer sources to gain greater understanding of the use of rehabilitation and other PAC services, direct and indirect costs, and patient outcomes at the population level". The statement calls to "Conduct health services research to understand how variability in rehabilitation care is influenced by health systems, hospitals, type of insurance, and alternative payment models to optimize patient recovery. There should be no variation in access, quality of rehabilitation care, and patient outcomes across different hospitals, health systems, regions, populations, and care settings" and to "Conduct a comprehensive inventory of the stated coverage policies of all major payers/insurers in the United States to tackle the challenges faced in accessing rehabilitation care, and conduct field surveys of acute hospital discharge planners to determine the type and prevalence of barriers that prevent patients getting access to the recommended level of care, and whether the stated coverage policies of insurers are being implemented as stated". It further prioritizes to "Assess the comparative effectiveness of alternative strategies, preferably with randomized controlled trials, including formal cost-effectiveness studies where feasible" and to "Collect a comprehensive set of patient-reported outcomes measured 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year after the index stroke event for a representative sample of all stroke events" with outcomes including "survival, function, well-being, quality of life, satisfaction, return to home, return to work, return to community and social engagement, and unmet needs". Additional priorities are to "Understand and optimize the care and outcomes of patients with stroke as they transition back to home", "Expand clinical training programs for acute hospital staff, including neurologists, internists, nurses, care coordinators, acute stroke center managers, and social workers", "Research optimal communication within and between health care professionals and postacute rehabilitation settings with better incorporation of CMS outcome measures", "Explore innovative models of care targeted at the hospital system level that optimize acute stroke rehabilitation and recovery", and to "Understand and optimize emotional and mental health status as a key recovery outcome".

### Mobile health follow-up screening to risk stratify patients in need of further care in a low resource setting: results from a prospective multisite implementation study [^1163QGy4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

There are several notable limitations to this study. First, by design, this study seeks to repatriate patients who are already engaged informal care. We know that approximately one third of Cameroonians with severe injury failed to present to formal care and this study does not address increasing access for these patients. Furthermore, another limitation is the selection bias of patients who responded to the follow-up survey and presented for a physical examination. It is possible that patients lost to follow-up were either recovering well, too sick to participate in follow-up, or presented to other facilities out of the study follow-up network. Given the resource constraints and significant barriers associated with care utilization, the latter explanation seems less likely in this context. The two former explanations appear more likely as our study determined a portion of patients to be low risk for a poor outcome (i.e. recovering well) and found a substantial postdischarge death rate (i.e. too sick to travel). The patients who stand to benefit cellular follow-up triage include those patients who already have access and facility using cellular telephones, and this may cluster with less vulnerable populations. Our research group plans to conduct an analysis of socioeconomic, clinical, and qualitative factors that influence patient acceptability of the survey tool and implementation of post discharge follow-up. In addition, as previously highlighted in this discussion, the ability to identify patients in need of further care does not guarantee that the Cameroonian health system will be able to reengage or deliver care to this at-risk cohort. Our hospital return rates demonstrate that presenting to formal care is clearly a barrier for Cameroonian patients, even when travel is compensated and ongoing efforts will be needed to optimize care delivery mechanisms. It is also possible that a portion of patients who recover well from injury do not desire to attend a follow-up examination, but this explanation seems less plausible given the large number of barriers that prevent care access in Cameroon. Finally, we acknowledge that there is opportunity to use registry collected data to further enhance the discrimination and targeting of our triage model.

### Ideal postdischarge follow-up after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure: a qualitative study of primary care clinicians in diverse settings [^114Dv1t2]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a diverse sample of primary care clinicians, follow-up after hospitalization for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure included a variety of practices that could be grouped into seven areas: safety assessment, medication management, medical specialty follow-up, integrating the hospitalization into the primary care relationship, assessing mental and physical well-being, rehabilitation follow-up, and social context of recovery. Serving as expert informants, primary care clinicians described practices specific to severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure follow-up and outlined barriers and facilitators to delivering such care, which may present opportunities to improve follow-up experiences for primary care clinicians and patients. Clinicians also highlighted primary care's important role in recovery from respiratory illness, including balancing new and ongoing issues and treatments and drawing on their longitudinal and patient-specific knowledge to inform care decisions.

Despite the high incidence and long-term impact of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure, to our knowledge, no formal recommendations exist to guide follow-up care, which some noted in our interviews. Limited understanding of best practices for follow-up care is a major knowledge gap impairing patient recovery. Primary care clinicians are well positioned to deliver follow-up care to promote recovery and to prevent complications such as unnecessary hospital readmissions, later mortality, and new or persistent health deficits. Our results provide evidence identifying seven core elements of follow-up care for survivors of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure. The core elements complement the Transitions of Care Consensus Policy Statement, endorsed by six professional societies, which emphasizes the information transfer needed by receiving outpatient clinicians to accomplish these elements of care. Core elements also specifically address patient-reported problems after pneumonia, - the three domains of post-intensive care syndrome (cognitive, physical, and mental health), as well as other issues commonly considered important for recovery from critical illness and sepsis.- Within these elements, we found specific practices highly relevant for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure as well as general needs after hospitalization.

### Outcomes of a citywide campaign to reduce medicaid hospital readmissions with connection to primary care within 7 days of hospital discharge [^1142wqWw]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Hospital readmissions are costly indicators of the quality of patient care. In 2012, 7% of the US population had a hospital stay, for a total cost of $381 billion, and an estimated 1 in 12 adults is readmitted within 30 days, adding $16 billion to health care costs annually. To address costs and improve care quality, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. Launched in October 2012, this program ties payments for all Medicare admissions to hospitals' readmission rates, creating motivation for hospitals to reduce avoidable readmissions. An estimated one-quarter of all 30-day hospital readmissions are preventable, and many of these can be traced to inadequate postdischarge follow-up. Timely postdischarge follow-up with a primary care provider (ie, a physician, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant as allowed under state law) can improve care transitions and reduce readmission risk through medication reconciliation, discharge plan review, and patient education.

However, whether a patient schedules and attends a primary care appointment after hospital discharge depends on various factors. Geographic accessibility, often correlated with race and economic status, matters. Wait time, inability to secure timely appointments, and practice hours can keep patients from scheduling or attending a follow-up appointment. Patients' past experiences with health care providers influence whether, where, and when they seek care. A previous studyalso highlighted the effect of insurance status and physician reimbursement models: in 2015, approximately 69% of physicians nationally were accepting new Medicaid patients vs 89% new private insurance patients.

Efforts to reduce hospital readmissions through timely primary care follow-up produced mixed results. A randomized clinical trial of an intervention using electronic health record–generated reminders to primary care practices to schedule visits for older adult patients within 7 days of hospital discharge had no effect on primary care follow-up rates and did not reduce readmissions. In contrast, a randomized clinical trial of the Care Transitions Intervention found significantly reduced readmissions at 30 and 90 days for older adults who received timely postdischarge follow-up as part of an intensive care transition intervention. Similarly, an observational studyof a hospital-to-home transitional care initiative that coordinated connection to a primary care medical home for Medicaid recipients found fewer readmissions among patients receiving the intervention compared with patients receiving usual care. Discrepant effects of programs on reducing readmissions may signal the importance of timely primary care follow-up as one factor in reducing readmission risk for designated patient populations.

### Programmatic and administrative barriers to high-risk infant follow-up care [^114DRaib]. American Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This article characterizes programmatic features of a population-based network of high-risk infant follow-up programs and identifies potential challenges associated with attendance from the providers' perspective.

Study Design

A web-based survey of high-risk infant follow-up program directors, coordinators, and providers of a statewide high-risk infant follow-up system. Frequencies and percentages were used to describe the survey responses.

Results

Of the 68 high-risk infant follow-up programs in California, 56 (82%) responded to the survey. The first visit no-show rate between 10 and 30% was estimated by 44% of programs with higher no-show rates for subsequent visits. Common strategies to remind families of appointments were phone calls and mailings. Most programs (54%) did not have a strategy to help families who lived distant to the high-risk infant follow-up clinic.

Conclusion

High-risk infant follow-up programs may lack resources and effective strategies to enhance follow-up, particularly for those living at a distance.

### Association between in-person vs telehealth follow-up and rates of repeated hospital visits among patients seen in the emergency department [^111YSPa6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 1 in 5 US residents visit the emergency department (ED) annually. An increasing number receive evaluation in the ED and are discharged home without requiring hospitalization. For many patients discharged from the ED, outpatient follow-up is a crucial step that decreases mortality. Appropriate follow-up may influence decisions on whether patients should be hospitalized. Current efforts to improve care coordination following ED encounters is an active area of policy interest: ensuring patients receive appropriate follow-up while also preventing unnecessary hospitalizations and improving health care value.,

Telehealth — the use of synchronous telephone and video technologies and services to provide health care from a distance — underwent rapid adoption since 2020 and now represents 30% of all outpatient care and 34% of all primary care visits. While telehealth may increase availability of follow-up appointments and decrease risk of exposure to communicable diseases, it is possible that telehealth visits may provide suboptimal evaluation in certain scenarios and paradoxically increase the rate that patients return to the hospital.,

As a first step toward understanding the effectiveness of post–ED discharge follow-up by telehealth, we examined the association between in-person and telehealth post–ED discharge follow-up visits with subsequent 30-day ED return (primary outcome) and hospitalization (secondary outcome). We hypothesized that the limitations of telemedicine may create challenges for the care of many patients recently discharged from the ED and that telemedicine would be associated with greater subsequent acute hospital utilization compared with patients who obtain in-person follow-up visits.

### Accessibility of and barriers to long-term follow-up care for childhood cancer survivors [^1136nses]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Theme 3: Barriers From the Institution, Clinician, and CCS or Caregiver Perspectives

The top 3 barriers to providing LTFU services endorsed by clinicians included patient-related factors (eg, geographic accessibility and cost) (76 [75.2%]), lack of survivor knowledge about the importance of LTFU care (61 [60.4%]), and a lack of dedicated LTFU clinics (61 [60.4%]) (Table 1). In terms of financial barriers, 82 clinicians (81.2%), representing 28 institutions, reported that there was no funding support for LTFU program. Specific to institutional barriers, 61 (60.4%) reported the lack of a database to track survivors' health outcomes.

Only 1 clinician interviewed had access to an existing specialized team for LTFU care. In the other clinicians' institutions, there were no specific oncologists appointed to provide LTFU care because of the competing demands of patients requiring acute care. They also acknowledged their lack of experience and training in rehabilitation (Table 2).

Caregiver Study

eTable 4 in Supplement 1 presents the characteristics of the CCSs and caregivers. Of the 812 eligible CCSs, 164 of their caregivers (36 [22.0%] male; 128 [78.0%] female) responded to the request to enroll (20.2% response rate). The median (range) current age of CCSs was 9.9 (4.6–21.7) years. Most CCSs were diagnosed with hematological malignancies (67 [40.9%]) or non–central nervous system solid tumors (47 [28.7%]). A substantial proportion (142 [86.6%]) reported that their child's health care was covered by medical insurance, with 6 having commercial insurance. Of the 164 respondents who completed the survey, 26 were randomly selected to participate in the interviews, and all completed their interviews.

### Perspectives from persons living with dementia and their caregivers on emergency department visits, care transitions, and outpatient follow-up: a qualitative study [^112rAnnS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Persons living with dementia (PLWD) experience frequent and costly emergency department (ED) visits, with poor outcomes attributed to suboptimal care and postdischarge care transitions. Yet, patient-centered data on ED care experiences and postdischarge needs are lacking. The objective of this study was to examine the facilitators and barriers to successful ED care and care transitions after discharge, according to PLWD and their caregivers.

Methods

We conducted a qualitative study involving ED patients ages 65 and older with confirmed or suspected dementia and their caregivers. The semistructured interview protocol followed the National Quality Forum's ED Transitions of Care Framework and addressed ED care, care transitions, and outpatient follow-up care. Interviews were conducted during an ED visit at an urban, academic ED. Traditional thematic analysis was used to identify themes.

Results

We interviewed 11 patients and 19 caregivers. Caregivers were more forthcoming than patients about facilitators and challenges experienced. Characteristics of the patients' condition (e.g., resistance to care, forgetfulness), the availability of family resources (e.g., caregiver availability, primary care access), and system-level factors (e.g., availability of timely appointments, hospital policies tailored to persons with dementia) served as facilitators and barriers to successful care. Some resources that would ameliorate care transition barriers could be easily provided in the ED, for example, offering clear discharge instructions and care coordination services and improving patient communication regarding disposition timeline. Other interventions would require investment from other parts of the health care system (e.g., respite for caregivers, broader insurance coverage).

Conclusions

ED care and care transitions for PLWD are suboptimal, and patient-level factors may exacerbate existing system-level deficiencies. Insight from patients and their caregivers may inform the development of ED interventions to design specialized care for this patient population. This qualitative study also demonstrated the feasibility of conducting ED-based studies on PLWD during their ED visit.

### Recent functional decline and outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge: a cohort study [^114n9R7z]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the time surrounding hospitalization for an acute medical illness, older adults (≥ 65 years of age) often experience functional decline in both their basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and are at increased risk of becoming homebound. Hospital-associated functional decline is often multifactorial and can be attributed to malnutrition, immobilization, acute medical symptoms, cognitive impairment, and pressure ulcers. Functional decline and being homebound have been associated with an increased risk of hospital readmission, institutionalization, and death.

Transitional care programs were developed to reduce the risk of hospital readmission. Early outpatient physician follow-up is a core component of many transitional care bundles. The evidence supporting the benefit of early physician follow-up for preventing readmissions is strongest for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF), where rates of readmission post-hospitalization are high. Post-discharge follow-up programs have also been successful at reducing hospital readmissions in other patient populations, including those recovering from stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and surgical procedures. Given these benefits, timely primary care follow-up after discharge is tracked as an indicator of health care quality.

Post-discharge follow-up rates in older patients are quite variable, ranging between 25% and 57%. Though several studies have investigated factors that contribute to low rates of primary care follow-up after discharge, no study has examined whether functional decline impacts this outcome. Functional impairment can present additional barriers to getting to an appointment, as a result of decreased mobility, increased reliance on others, and transportation challenges. With a recent functional decline, patients and caregivers may not have had time to establish compensatory processes and support systems to account for newly acquired mobility deficits. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between recent functional decline and timely family physician follow-up after hospital discharge. Furthermore, given the notable shift to virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examined whether this relationship changed in the year following the onset of COVID-19.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115TWKNf]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Post-stroke care planning — plans arise from collaboration between patient and clinician, are based on patient-identified problems, apply tailoring and sequencing or prioritizing care, and involve negotiation of a plan of care with timely follow-up; action plans emphasize achievable goals, and visits conclude with plans to reinforce successful behavior and address gaps. Because patients often miss doses or prematurely discontinue medication therapy, active adherence monitoring is important and can reveal the cause for falling short of treatment goals.

### Enhancing patient flow through standardised discharge pathways for neurology and medicine services [^115jkceQ]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Hospitals throughout the country face problems caused by a lack of organised discharge pathways for patients. In addition to insufficient bed capacity and inefficient discharges, poor delineation of the steps required for appropriate discharges impacts patient flow and hospital throughput, that is, the efficiency by which patients move through the hospital system from admission to discharge, encompassing all aspects of patient care and utilisation of hospital resources. This adverse effect has been evidenced by studies showing that lack of standardisation of admission and discharge pathways, system-level barriers and provider decision-making all contribute to prolonged hospital stays. These deficiencies consequently increase financial burdens on health systems and diminish patient and provider satisfaction. To address these concerns, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) has published articles (eg, Rutherford et al) that focus on improving patient flow and discharge predictability and has recently promoted a conceptual change from arbitrary time-based discharge criteria that are not supported by studiesto consensus-based discharge criteria. These consensus-based discharge criteria should be established for common disease presentations by the appropriate experts in the health system and incorporate agreed-upon prerequisites for discharge readiness. While prior studies have created consensus-based discharge criteria that are disease-specific and situation-specific, institutional differences and varying access to follow-up studies and care require that consensus-based discharge criteria be institution-specific. Nevertheless, such initiatives can help interdisciplinary care teams predict the timing of patient discharges and identify discharge barriers in a timely fashion. Prior studies such as El-Eid et al have demonstrated that a standardised framework to address discharge barriers can produce effective and durable solutions. Coupling a standardised discharge pathway, where discharge barriers can be identified early and addressed at a systems level, with consensus-based discharge criteria that determine when a patient is medically ready for discharge, enables hospitals to enhance patient flow and improve throughput by coordinating admissions through the emergency department, postoperative care, operating rooms, outside transfers, as well as care team staffing and postdischarge care. For example, this approach can ensure timely coordination of discharges to ensure that newly admitted patients arrive quickly in the correct ward with the appropriate nursing expertise.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115ze73Y]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for heart failure, more specifically with respect to follow-up after hospital discharge, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining an early follow-up, generally within 7 days of hospital discharge, to optimize care and reduce re-hospitalization in patients discharged after hospitalization for worsening HF.

### Factors influencing nonadherence to recommended postdischarge follow-up after Trauma [^116bbbx2]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Historically, trauma patients have low adherence to recommended outpatient follow-up plans, which is crucial for improved long-term clinical outcomes. We sought to identify characteristics associated with nonadherence to recommended outpatient follow-up visits.

Methods

This is a single-center retrospective examination of inpatient trauma survivors admitted to a level 1 trauma center (March 2017-March 2018). Patients with known alternative follow-up were excluded. All outpatient visits within 1 y from the index admission were identified. The primary outcome was nonadherence, which was noted if a patient failed to follow-up for any specialty recommended in the discharge instructions. Factors for nonadherence studied included age, injury severity score, mechanism, length of stay, number of referrals made, and involvement with a Trauma Recovery Services program. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed.

Results

A total of498 patients were identified (69% men, median age 43 y [range, 26–58 y], median injury severity score 14 [range, 9–19]). Among them, 240 (47%) were nonadherent. The most common specialties recommended were orthopedic surgery (56% referred, 19% nonadherent), trauma (54% referred, 35% nonadherent), and neurosurgery (127 referred, 35% nonadherent). Lowest levels of follow-up were seen for nonsurgical referrals. In adjusted analysis, a higher number of referrals made (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.95–3.05) and older age (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.02) were associated with nonadherence. Trauma Recovery Service participants and penetrating trauma patients were more likely to be adherent (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37–0.97).

Conclusions

The largest contributor to nonadherence was the number of referrals made; patients who were referred to multiple specialists were more likely to be nonadherent. Peer support services may lower barriers to follow-up.

### Social determinants of health framework identifies patients at risk for loss to follow-up after stroke [^115ysn7k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to addressing postdischarge care, optimizing patient support during and immediately following the discharge process may also improve follow‐up rates. Defining and addressing patient support presents its own challenges. We found that broadly defined social support was not associated with better follow‐up rates; however, multiple studies underscore the importance of social support for a patient's recovery. It is likely that the quality and extent of social support, rather than its mere presence, are critical determinants of healthcare outcomes. For example, a 2017 study on social connections in public health found that effective social support must be tailored to the specific needs of the patient, emphasizing emotional support, informational support, and tangible assistance. This was also seen in our population. Tangible evidence of assistance may best be represented in our population through the availability of transportation to and from appointments. This variable remained a highly significant factor associated with increased follow‐up rates in multivariate analysis, indicating the critical need to identify and address any barriers during discharge planning. Regarding both emotional and information support, we found that when family or friends participated in discharge discussions alongside the patient or when discharge planning was conducted with family members in person rather than via a phone call, patients were more likely to access follow‐up care. In contrast, when discharge planning was discussed solely with the family without the patient present, the patient was less likely to follow up. Lack of patient involvement could indicate the extent of the support network or serve as a surrogate for higher stroke severity that may have prevented patient participation. Regardless, our results support the importance of establishing an involved social support network for patients before discharge.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) barriers to optimal care — breakout sessions from the Second Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Summit — highlighted transition issues, financial constraints, and tool/resource gaps, including poor communication, ineffective discharge guidance, lack of effective follow-up, limited efforts to engage patients and family, patient not being placed at center of care, fragmentation of system/differences in where individual seeks care; inadequate reimbursements for time-intensive, proper transitional care, affordability of prescribed treatments and follow-up, incentives not aligned across the system, recognition of nonmedical barriers and availability of solutions, policies that limit access to educators, respiratory therapists and others outside the hospital, and insufficient time for meaningful physician/patient engagement; and needs such as limited empirical evidence, lack of compliance with existing guidelines, ineffective use of EHR (electronic health record), diagnostic tool limitations/under and over diagnosis, inadequate monitoring, access and monitoring for issues related to oxygen, access and referral to pulmonary rehabilitation limited, use of ER (emergency room) as a treatment center, insufficient physician and patient education, and lack of dissemination of existing tools.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^115ULRvo]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Children's Oncology Group long-term follow-up guidelines — screening and follow-up recommendations are organized by therapeutic exposure, and pediatric cancer survivors represent a relatively small but growing population at high risk for various therapy-related complications. Potential benefits of implementing these guidelines include earlier identification of and intervention for late onset therapy-related complications, and ongoing healthcare that promotes healthy lifestyle choices and provides ongoing monitoring of health status is important for all cancer survivors. Potential harms include increased patient anxiety and the potential for false-positive screening evaluations leading to unnecessary further workup, as well as costs of long-term follow-up care that may be prohibitive for some survivors, particularly those lacking health insurance or whose insurance does not cover the recommended screening evaluations. Decisions regarding screening and clinical management for any specific patient should be individually tailored, and these guidelines are not intended to replace clinical judgment or to exclude other reasonable alternative follow-up procedures. Implementation is intended to standardize and enhance follow-up care provided to survivors of pediatric malignancies throughout the lifespan, but additional concerns include the lack of current evidence establishing the efficacy of screening for late complications; development of studies addressing the efficacy of this approach is imperative in order to determine which screening modalities are optimal for asymptomatic survivors. Recognized barriers include clinician time limitations and the effort required to identify the specific recommendations relevant to individual survivors, and a web-based interface, known as "Passport for Care", generates individualized exposure-based recommendations from these guidelines; the Passport for Care application is available to Children's Oncology member institutions at no cost.

### Social determinants of health framework identifies patients at risk for loss to follow-up after stroke [^1123KHdP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Modifiable Targets for Intervention

With an at‐risk population identified, modifiable factors highlight areas that can be targeted to improve follow‐up rates. Many of these modifiable variables surround postdischarge care and patient support structures that can be impacted without large‐scale changes.

Postdischarge care includes both the patient's discharge disposition and level of rehabilitation. Interestingly, most patients who attended their follow‐up appointment were discharged home rather than to a rehabilitation or long‐term‐care facility. Patients who were discharged home likely had less severe strokes, which was also independently associated with better follow‐up. These patients also may have benefitted from being back in their home environment with their support network in place. For those who went to a facility postdischarge, the level of rehabilitation needs was an important factor. Those who qualified for acute inpatient rehabilitation and were able to do > 90 minutes of activity per day were more likely to follow up than those discharged to a subacute facility, where they could tolerate < 60 minutes. In multiple studies of patients with heart failure, those discharged to a skilled nursing facility were at increased risk of death and rehospitalization, even when adjusted for measured patient characteristics. Whether in all cases this is due to severity of illness resulting in the nonideal outcome, or a lesser degree of infrastructure resulting in poor accessibility is unclear, but important to determine. In the case of the latter, efforts to enhance access through appointment confirmation and arrangement of transportation may significantly improve follow‐up rates for patients discharged into rehabilitation or long‐term‐care facilities.

### Ambulatory follow-up and outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries after emergency department discharge [^11397Wiy]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older who were discharged from US EDs from 2011 to 2016, nearly one-third (29%) lacked an ambulatory follow-up visit within 30 days. There was substantial variation among patients and hospitals in rates of follow-up after ED discharge, with lower follow-up rates among Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries, Black beneficiaries, and those treated in rural EDs. Ambulatory follow-up was associated with lower risk of postdischarge mortality but higher risk of a subsequent inpatient hospitalization. This association was observed for hospitals with high, medium, and low rates of follow-up but was greatest among hospitals with the highest rates of ambulatory care access. These findings suggest return visits to the ED or inpatient setting may be life-saving for some patients and that excess reductions in postdischarge acute care utilization may contribute to avoidable harm. Ambulatory follow-up care after ED discharge may be an important driver of outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the ED.

### Continuing care for critically ill children beyond hospital discharge: current state of follow-up [^114iWtyW]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Survivors of the PICU face long-term morbidities across health domains. In this study, we detail active PICU follow-up programs (PFUPs) and identify perceptions and barriers about development and maintenance of PFUPs.

Methods

A web link to an adaptive survey was distributed through organizational listservs. Descriptive statistics characterized the sample and details of existing PFUPs. Likert responses regarding benefits and barriers were summarized.

Results

One hundred eleven respondents represented 60 institutions located in the United States (n = 55), Canada (n = 3), Australia (n = 1), and the United Kingdom (n = 1). Details for 17 active programs were provided. Five programs included broad PICU populations, while the majority were neurocritical care (53%) focused. Despite strong agreement on the need to assess and treat morbidity across multiple health domains, 29% were physician only programs, and considerable variation existed in services provided by programs across settings. More than 80% of all respondents agreed PFUPs provide direct benefits and are essential to advancing knowledge on long-term PICU outcomes. Respondents identified "lack of support" as the most important barrier, particularly funding for providers and staff, and lack of clinical space, though successful programs overcome this challenge using a variety of funding resources.

Conclusions

Few systematic multidisciplinary PFUPs exist despite strong agreement about importance of this care and direct benefit to patients and families. We recommend stakeholders use our description of successful programs as a framework to develop multidisciplinary models to elevate continuity across inpatient and outpatient settings, improve patient care, and foster collaboration to advance knowledge.

### Effect of a virtual patient navigation program on behavioral health admissions in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^114MrQpG]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The intervention was designed to ensure close and regular follow-up. Having such a program available could be reassuring to a telepsychiatric clinician who otherwise is unsure when or if the patient will follow up, as he or she tries to decide whether to admit or discharge the patient. Through a qualitative evaluation that will be published separately, we have had clinicians report that they are much more comfortable discharging a patient if it is known that a navigator is available to check in on the patient and make sure any appointments are timely.

Patients received a follow-up telephone call by a navigator within 24 to 72 hours from ED discharge, then at least weekly for up to 45 days. One or both navigators could follow up with a patient during his or her enrollment. A follow-up assessment was completed at each telephone contact, which included a suicide ideation safety screening (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale Reassess), an appointment reminder, appointment barrier evaluation, medication obtainment follow-up, substance use disorder follow-up, supportive listening, psychoeducation, community resource follow-up, and additional crisis planning. If a patient was deemed to be actively suicidal, then the navigator recommended transfer to a mobile crisis unit, called 911 for a police officer to check on the patient (well-check), or called 911 to take the patient to the ED as per the current standard of care. Patients completed their participation 45 days from ED discharge or earlier if (1) their behavioral health crisis resolved, (2) an existing care management program unrelated to the study assumed responsibility, (3) they opted to discontinue the program, (4) they could not be reached after ED discharge (4 calls in 12 days), or (5) they declined participation prior to ED discharge.

### Socioeconomic influences on outcomes following congenital heart disease surgery [^112FxL5W]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient discharges are delayed not only due to medical requirements, but also due to family obligations outside the hospital. These may include caregiver limitations to be present for discharge education due to their work schedules, other childcare considerations, or transportation issues. Additionally, certain patients may remain inpatient longer while strategies to minimize the risk of readmission and plans to ensure that the family will be able to follow-up for outpatient post-operative care are put in place. This often entails working with a multidisciplinary team of social workers, dieticians, pharmacists, and inpatient and outpatient nurses and cardiologists to address barriers to optimal discharge readiness, such as appropriate post-discharge supplies and equipment, or transportation to the outpatient follow-up appointment. Patients in higher STAT categories typically have more complex care needs, requiring additional coordination and investment to ensure a safe discharge and minimize the likelihood of readmission. Navigating this sometimes-taxing process may be intensified for those caregivers who face these challenges amidst negative SDOH, likely with fewer resources to absorb the significant financial and temporal investment required to care for post-operative children with complex CHD. At our institution, significant effort goes into ensuring all post-operative patients and families are medically and socially ready for discharge, even if it results in longer LOS; this may contribute to our finding that community-level deprivation was not associated with readmission in our cohort.

### Association between continuity of care and attendance of post-discharge follow-up after psychiatric emergency presentation [^115XUdYN]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The important question that follows is how post-discharge follow-up appointment attendance can be increased. Aside from the intuitive and effective answer of providing reminders, factors at the service delivery level such as communication and therapeutic alliance have significant impacts on patient's motivation to engage with mental health services. Young people are more likely to attend subsequent mental health appointments when there is a shorter delay between the referral and the appointmentif they are satisfied with the initial care, the clinician has explained clearly the need for the appointmentand persists in maintaining contact. The first interaction between the patient and the mental health service is critical for establishing rapport for long-term treatment adherence. Therapeutic interventions incorporating early engagement were demonstrated to promote follow-up attendance of young people who present with self-harm. Care initiated as soon as possible at A&E with planned continuity into the community settings is both a national and international policy focus. Mental health crisis response services have been developed to achieve this. These teams commonly start engaging young people in hospitals, as soon as they present at A&E, and support planning for discharge.

To date, few high-quality studies have evaluated or compared the effectiveness of crisis services for children and adolescents. Previous studies focused on clinical outcomes such as duration in hospital, depressive symptoms, and rate of rehospitalisation. However, follow-up attendance, an equally important metric, had not been formally evaluated. Adult patients were found to be more likely to attend the first post-discharge appointment if they were seen at A&E by a community outreach mental health team. Another essential yet unanswered research question lies within the operational aspect of follow-up care, which varies across localities and cases. In practice, whether the crisis team or another mental health team provides the follow-up appointment may depend on the service model, the psychosocial complexity, and the existing professionals around the young person. Whether the follow-up clinician has previously seen the patient at the hospital may depend on team capacity and rota. One may argue these uncertainties should be avoided, considering the benefits of continuity of care including reduced communication barriers. Children and young people may be more inclined to attend follow-up appointments when they see the same mental health team and/or clinician across the hospital and the community.

### Barriers and facilitators to provide continuity of care to dischargeable patients in disasters: a qualitative study [^116R3hot]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Early discharge of some in-patients is the effective measure to create hospital surge capacity in disasters. However, some of these patients may need to post-discharge continuity of care. The aim of the current study then is to explore the barriers of continuity of care, and to provide suitable solutions for potentially dischargeable patients during disasters.

Methods

This qualitative study was conducted in Iran in 2017. The data was collected via unstructured interviews with 24 disaster professionals; and analyzed by content analysis method.

Results

Identified barriers to the continuity of care were classified into seven categories, 'lack of disaster paradigm'; 'challenges of pre-hospital system'; 'insufficient coordination and cooperation'; 'inadequate hospital preparedness'; 'lack of using available resources and capacities'; 'poor patients' knowledge' and 'poor planning'. The suggested solutions for post-discharge continuity of care were: creation of registry and follow-up system; removing pre-hospital challenges; including disaster management courses in medical school curriculum; promoting hospital preparedness by All-Hazard Approach; and effective use of available resources.

Conclusion

Understanding the barriers to continuity of care for discharged patients for adopting policies based on experiences of health care providers can help planners to design and implement effective programs, which will enhance patients' access to necessary care.

### Ambulatory follow-up and outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries after emergency department discharge [^111BsxYL]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has a number of limitations. Findings among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older may not be generalizable to younger, healthier individuals with lower risk for mortality or readmission. However, Medicare beneficiaries account for growing share of ED visits, and lessons may be generalizable given that 60% of US residents have at least 1 chronic condition. Our study is observational, and therefore, the associations suggest, but do not prove, the benefit of ambulatory follow-up after ED discharge. The observational nature of our analysis and inability to completely control for patients who died before completing follow-up should be considered in future policy recommendations. We considered whether the association between higher rates of ambulatory care follow-up and lower postdischarge mortality was confounded by healthier patients who have fewer barriers to follow-up by virtue of their better health and thus are also more likely to survive. However, it is also possible that the bias goes the other way and that sicker patients are more likely to seek postdischarge care, leading to an underestimate of the benefit of ambulatory follow-up. Either a randomized clinical trial or daily monitoring of patient severity would be required to avoid or totally control for confounding at the time of the ambulatory visit. In this study, we controlled for patient characteristics, diagnosis categories, and chronic conditions to try to reduce confounding. The magnitude of the adjusted association seems too large to be entirely explained by unmeasured differences in patient severity alone. The fact that patients who had ambulatory follow-up were also more likely to have a subsequent hospitalization argues against this hypothesis, given that healthier patients generally do not use more hospital care. Furthermore, our findings were similar among hospitals with low rates of follow-up, where patients are more likely to experience barriers to accessing care relative to hospitals with high follow-up rates.

Pediatric heart failure (HF) management — technology and patient engagement recommendations emphasize multidisciplinary barrier reduction and telehealth. For children with HF, treatment strategies should address barriers (e.g., case management, cost-reduction, and out-of-pocket cost limits) through a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach (Class I, Level of Evidence C). Telemedicine is a reasonable approach to enhance HF follow-up and communication (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

### Mobile health follow-up screening to risk stratify patients in need of further care in a low resource setting: results from a prospective multisite implementation study [^117B2XW7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 2% of the contacted population had died by the second postdischarge week. This substantial early mortality highlights a critical need to develop a bidirectional component of the telephone triage program to provide a mechanism for patients who self-identify as being off-trajectory to trigger evaluation for early care reentry. For example, the vast majority of triaged patients reported improved perceived well-being after hospital discharge, even among the HR cohort. However, the minority of patients who did self-identify as having same or worse perceived well-being were highly likely to be designated as HR. Developing a contact protocol for discharged patients with concerns about their clinical progress to engage formal evaluation may facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment of complications and improve trauma outcomes. Additional studies are underway to attempt to identify CTR predictors of early postdischarge mortality to better target this population for early surveillance and intervention.

Overall, 6 of the 14 candidate triage questions were not statistically associated with HR and will be eliminated from future triage tool iterations for efficiency. Notably, questions that did not contribute to prediction included the ability to return to normal activities and independently complete ADLs. While functional recovery is a key long-term outcome after trauma, we hypothesize that the 2-week postdischarge time point is premature to expect even on-trajectory patients to have resumed normal activities. Similarly, depending on patient age, health status, and injury type and severity, many discharged patients may reasonably expect to still require assistance with ADLs at 2 weeks following discharge even if recovering as expected. Consequently, these questions are likely poor indicators of need for further care.

Prior community-based data demonstrate that Cameroonian patients have high rates of economic and physical disability after injury. We hypothesized that, because Cameroon currently does not enforce standardized accommodations for differently abled persons, fulfilling basic needs like completing expected injury care may present considerable barriers to discharged patients. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found difficulty obtaining medicine and caring for injury to be associated with HR. Although it is not possible to ascertain with certainty why this is the case, we suspect that the inability to complete these tasks leads to a negative feedback cycle where undertreated patients are less able to heal from injury and continue to ongoing difficulty meeting basic needs.

### Emergency department-to-community care transition barriers: a qualitative study of older adults [^1131WQwi]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Over one-half of older adults are discharged to the community after emergency department (ED) visits, and studies have shown there is increased risk of adverse health outcomes in the immediate post-discharge period. Understanding the experiences of older adults during ED-to-community care transitions has the potential to improve geriatric emergency clinical care and inform intervention development. We therefore sought to assess barriers experienced by older adults during ED-to-community care transitions.

Methods

We conducted a qualitative analysis of community-dwelling cognitively intact patients aged 65years and older receiving care in four diverse EDs from a single U.S. healthcare system. We constructed a conceptual framework a priori to guide the development and iterative revision of a codebook, used purposive sampling, and conducted recorded, semi-structured interviews using a standardized guide. Two researchers coded the professionally transcribed data using a combined deductive and inductive approach and analyzed transcripts to identify dominant themes and representative quotations.

Results

Among 25 participants, 20 (80%) were women and 17 (68%) were white. We identified four barriers during the ED-to-community care transition: (1) ED discharge process was abrupt with missing information regarding symptom explanation and performed testing, (2) navigating follow-up outpatient clinical care was challenging, (3) new physical limitations and fears hinder performance of baseline activities, and (4) major and minor ramifications for caregivers impact an older adult's willingness to request or accept assistance.

Conclusions

Older adults identified barriers to successful ED-to-community care transitions that can inform the development of novel and effective interventions.

### Patient barriers to accessing referred resources for unmet social needs [^115gQQz2]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many primary care clinics screen patients for their unmet social needs, such as food insecurity and housing instability, and refer them to community-based organizations (CBOs). However, the ability for patients to have their needs met is difficult to evaluate and address. This study explores patient-reported barriers to accessing referred resources using a conceptual framework that identifies opportunities for intervening to optimize success.

Methods

Patients who participated in a social needs screening and referral intervention at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) were called 2 weeks after the clinic encounter. We conducted a directed content analysis across 6 domains of access to examine responses from patients who reported barriers.

Results

Of the 462 patients that were reached for follow-up, 366 patients reported 537 total barriers. The most frequent challenges related to resource availability (24.6%, eg, patients waiting for submitted application to process) and approachability (23.8%, eg, patients lacking information needed to contact or access resources). Barriers in the domains of acceptability (21.6%, eg, competing life priorities such as medical issues, major life events, or caretaking responsibilities) and appropriateness (17.9%, eg, resource no longer needed) largely represented patient constraints expressed only after the clinical encounter. It was less common for patients to identify accommodation (eg, physical limitations, language barriers, transportation barriers, administrative complexity) or affordability of community resources as barriers (11.2% and 0.9%, respectively).

Conclusion

Findings suggest opportunities for improvement across the access continuum, from initial referrals from primary care staff during the clinical encounter to patients' attempts to accessing services in the community. Future efforts should consider increased collaboration between health and social service organizations, and advocacy for structural changes that mitigate system-level barriers related to resource availability and administrative complexity.

### Ideal postdischarge follow-up after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure: a qualitative study of primary care clinicians in diverse settings [^115gs4J2]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Social Context of Recovery:

Clinicians discussed lifestyle and social needs, addressing preventing infections, improving lung health, and considering caregiver needs. Clinicians who had access to social workers, mental health clinicians, and even system-provided transportation services described addressing many social issues "as they came up". However, without support or because of insurance limitations, most primary care clinicians noted that these issues could and did impede recovery.

"Key to lung injury and your risks down the road is, I think, making sure they have all their vaccines".

"I have like a patient right now… and the only place that took her insurance with pulmonary rehab was half an hour away. She couldn't get there. So, could she benefit from it? Probably. It's just not gonna happen. Most of our patients who are low income… they can get a [city] access card to get discounted [city transit] service. There are resources, but they're imperfect resources".

"If there are any equipment needs or housing instability — just depending on the patient's situation, I can reach out to my social worker to help connect that patient to resources".

Barriers and Facilitators

Primary care clinicians reported that multiple determinants across multiple levels affected the delivery of follow-up care for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure (Fig 1). Two common concerns warrant highlighting: (1) quality and appropriateness of rehabilitation services and (2) improved processes at hospital discharge.

Quality and Appropriateness of Rehabilitation Services

Although primary care clinicians believed that access to rehabilitation services was helpful, some believed that they lacked knowledge as to whether and for whom specific services, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, were most appropriate. One commented on the variability of quality among home-based physical therapy. Another said, particularly for "long COVID" care, "You offer [pulmonary rehabilitation] because it's what you have".

"Some patients really take advantage of [these services] and do great and other patients try them and are like, 'Yeah, I didn't get any benefit from that atall'. And it's really hard to know whether — was it the quality of this particular service, or was it something about the patient and what they brought to the encounter?"

### Geriatric assessment: ASCO global guideline [^116om4WC]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Limitations of the research and future research priorities in resource-constrained settings are detailed, noting that such contexts exist in both LMICs and less-developed regions of HICs with variable access to critical geriatric oncology resources; resource-stratified strategies may be relevant. The document proposes integrating digital health solutions and telemedicine platforms to expand access by overcoming geographical and workforce barriers and enabling personalized care and follow-up, and it calls for research on their effectiveness regarding accessibility, quality of care, and patient satisfaction. It identifies insufficient evidence from resource-constrained settings and a pressing need for studies across institutions, systems, regions, and countries with differing resources, including implementation outcomes — process measures, workforce utilization, and costs — and underscores the importance of global collaboration.

### Ambulatory follow-up and outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries after emergency department discharge [^111zJ28U]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our results are consistent with numerous studies documenting socioeconomic disparities in health care access and outcomes. While insurance type is an important determinant of access, we observed disproportionately lower rates of follow-up among non-White and Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries, even among traditional Medicare beneficiaries. Several factors likely contribute to these disparities, including racial discrimination in scheduling appointments, barriers to accessing nonemergency transport, and limited Medicaid expansion, less generous benefits, and a higher threshold for eligibility in some rural states. Among hospital characteristics, treatment at a rural ED has been shown to be associated with higher mortality rates among Medicare beneficiaries. Our findings are consistent with literature suggesting that barriers to ambulatory care access may be a key driver of poor health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries treated in rural settings. These findings also serve as further evidence that hospitals serving populations in areas with disproportionately fewer resources may be penalized for factors beyond their control.

### Implementation challenges using a novel method for collecting patient-reported outcomes after injury [^1134My5G]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Monitoring longitudinal patient-reported outcomes after injury is important for comprehensive trauma care. Current methodologies are resource-intensive and struggle to engage patients.

Materials and Methods

Patients ≥ 18 y old admitted to the trauma service were prospectively enrolled. The following inclusion criteria were used: emergency operation, ICU length of stay ≥ 2 midnights, or hospital length of stay ≥ 4 d. Validated and customized questionnaires were administered using a novel internet-based survey platform. Three-month follow-up surveys were administered. Contextual field notes regarding barriers to enrollment/completion of surveys and challenges faced by participants were recorded.

Results

Forty-seven patients were eligible; 26 of 47 (55%) enrolled and 19 of 26 (73%) completed initial surveys. The final sample included 14 (74%) men and 5 (26%) women. Primary barriers to enrollment included technological constraints and declined participation. Contextual field notes revealed three major issues: competing hospital tasks, problems with technology, and poor engagement. The average survey completion time was 43 ± 27 min-21% found this too long. Seventy-four percent reported the system "easy to use" and 95% reported they would "very likely" or "definitely" respond to future surveys. However, 10 of 26 (38%) patients completed 3-mo follow-up.

Conclusions

Despite a well-rated internet-based survey platform, study participation remained challenging. Lack of email access and technological issues decreased enrollment and the busy hospitalization posed barriers to completion. Despite a thoughtful operational design and implementation plan, the trauma population presented a challenging group to engage. Next steps will focus on optimizing engagement, broadening access to survey reminders, and enhancing integration into clinical workflows.

### Social determinants of health framework identifies patients at risk for loss to follow-up after stroke [^111x1mNJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Along with targeting modifiable variables associated with poor follow‐up, there may be other ways to improve outcomes through education of the patient and their support network. Whereas years of education is a nonmodifiable variable, education surrounding the prevention and treatment of stroke is modifiable and a potential target for intervention. This is demonstrated by a 2003 study where a brief educational intervention decreased a population's stroke risk by increasing patients' understanding of when to seek help and how to prevent stroke. Therefore, emphasizing the importance of attending follow‐up appointments along with the resources available to assist with challenges may improve follow‐up attendance and poststroke care. Additionally, there should be increased emphasis on communicating with staff at rehabilitation centers on the importance of follow‐up attendance. Some patients may miss follow‐up appointments due to being discharged home before their appointment date. In these situations, involvement of social work and case management can be key to ensuring a smooth transition.

In poststroke care, success lies in a multitiered approach focused on improving education, communication, and hospital‐provided support resources. By identifying both modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, clinicians can better target at‐risk patients and tailor interventions, ensuring more patients receive the poststroke care they need.

### Mobile health follow-up screening to risk stratify patients in need of further care in a low resource setting: results from a prospective multisite implementation study [^113wTbvX]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Triage Survey Results

The vast majority of patients (n = 517 [92%]) reported improved overall well-being since leaving the hospital with only 8% (n = 43) reporting similar or worse clinical status since discharge. Only 20% (n = 114) of patients had resumed their normal daily routine (i.e. performing all baseline daily actions) compared with 8% (n = 56) who had partially resumed their routine and 71% (n = 400) who reported that they had not yet resumed their daily routine. Overall, 36% (n = 350) reported still needing assistance with ADLs including eating, bathing, and going to the toilet. Nearly 30% (n = 167) of patients reported significant barriers to injury recovery in the home, including 2% (n = 10) who reported difficulty obtaining clean food or water after injury, 6% (n = 33) who were unable to afford or access prescribed medicines, and 10% (n = 56) who had difficulty understanding or following discharge instructions for injury care. In addition, 17% (n = 94) reported other barriers to healing not otherwise specified. Nearly 75% (n = 410) of surveyed patients or their surrogates endorsed the patient having one or more concerning symptom including subjective fevers (59 patients [12%]), erythema or swelling of the injured body part (38 patients [7%)], pain (372 patients [66%]), drainage from or opening of a wound or incision (14 patients [3%]), numbness or difficulty moving the injured area (109 patients [19%]), or nausea/vomiting (2 patients [< 1%]). By 2 weeks following discharge, just under half of all discharged patients (242 [43%]) had sought a second opinion from a western or traditional healer.

On univariate logistic regression, 8 of 14 candidate triage variables were independently associated with HR (Table 2). Triage questions associated with HR included perceived well-being, difficulty taking medicine, difficulty caring for injury, redness or erythema, pain, inability to move or feel, drainage or opening of the wound or incision, and seeking a second opinion. Positive survey response on the resultant eight question screen yielded 89.2% sensitivity for HR with a 10.8% false-negative rate. Specificity was 18% and overall accuracy was 42%.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113DqeSj]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Reengagement in HIV care after loss to follow-up — adherence along the HIV care continuum is fluid and can change depending on an individual's life circumstances, and in general, guidance around reengagement in care is similar to the guidance for individuals who are newly diagnosed with HIV. Specific attention should be paid to understanding the reasons for previous disengagement from care, and shared decision-making should be used to identify strategies to address these barriers using a multidisciplinary approach. Hospitalization can provide an important opportunity for reengagement when an acute illness may increase an individual's motivation for behavior change, and bedside medication delivery or "Meds to Beds" programs have the potential to enhance post-discharge medication adherence.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112pDBQG]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Post-stroke primary care — cycle and initial visit timing are outlined as follows: A first post stroke visit is generally within 1–3 weeks of discharge to establish the foundation for post-stroke management, followed by a cycle that includes Establish/Confirm the Patient & Family's Perspective (contentment with present course; gaps between aspirations and status), Identify Unmet Needs (knowledge; functional/physical; psychological; social), General Goals (achieve patient-centered care; prevent recurrent brain injury; maximize function; prevent late complications; optimize quality of life), Characterize Control of Chronic Stroke Risk Factors, Affirm the Management Plan (set specific goals; address etiologic evaluation; gaps between patient's goals/aspirations and status; unmet needs; risk factor control; consultations), Implement the Plan (educate patient/carers; implement treatment; coordinate care; address barriers; schedule return visit), and a Follow-Up Visit to solicit the patient's agenda and review and update stroke and medical/social/medication history. After the first visit, it is helpful to document a brief narrative of the patient's stroke to anchor stroke-specific care for future visits, and foundational work for every visit includes monitoring the consequences of the stroke and updating the medical and social history. The burden of ongoing symptoms is common: Approximately 60% of stroke survivors have some neurological symptoms, and 5% to 50% have moderate disability, requiring some assistance with basic activities of daily living.

### Impact of pre-existing disability on long-term health care use following hospitalization for COVID-19: a population-based cohort study [^112oVauq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study adds to the mounting evidence of the disproportionate negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with disabilities, showing that future emergency responses must consider their needs from the start. The higher health service use among people with disabilities in the year after hospitalization for COVID-19 shows the need for planning to ensure access to outpatient health services and reduce the need for emergency and hospital care. This presents an urgent opportunity for the development of accessible post-discharge models of care and to determine their effectiveness for people with disabilities. Several models of care have been developed to support people in the general population who experience the long-term sequelae of COVID-19, including screening and support by primary care teams, advanced testing by specialty clinics, treatment of symptoms of the post-COVID-19 condition by multidisciplinary rehabilitation services, and coordination of care referrals across multiple settings. However, care of patients following severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is fragmented and inequitable. Given the known barriers to care experienced by people with disabilities, – there is a need to evaluate post-COVID-19 services in relation to physical accessibility of clinic spaces and transportation, efforts to address the communication needs of patients (e.g. American Sign Language interpretation), coordination of care with other medical providers managing comorbid conditions, coordination with disability-related supports (e.g. home care, transportation), as well as disability-related training needs of health care providers in these settings. Consideration of the needs of patients with disabilities following a hospitalization for COVID-19 is required in efforts to address the health system impacts of COVID-19.

### A randomized, controlled trial of a simple emergency department intervention to improve the rate of primary care follow-up for patients with acute asthma exacerbations [^112Fhk1i]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determined whether a simple emergency department intervention improves the likelihood of primary care provider (PCP) follow-up after ED discharge for an acute asthma exacerbation.

Methods

This randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in an urban university-based ED. Participants were patients with asthma between the ages of 16 and 45 years who were treated and discharged from the ED. The study intervention was usual care or an intervention that consisted of a free 5-day course of prednisone, vouchers for transportation to and from their PCP, and a 48-hour telephone reminder to make an appointment with their PCP. The main outcome was whether the patient received follow-up care as determined by PCP contact at 4 weeks.

Results

One hundred ninety-two patients with asthma were enrolled over 8 months; 178 (93%) had complete follow-up. The intervention and control groups were similar with regard to age, sex, ethnicity, or years of education. The 2 groups were also comparable with respect to multiple measures of baseline access/barriers to care and severity of ED exacerbation. Patients receiving the intervention were significantly more likely to follow up with their PCP than control patients (relative risk 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 2.4). When adjusted for other factors influencing PCP follow-up care (ethnicity, prior PCP relationship, insurance status, regular car access), intervention patients were more likely to follow up with their PCP (odds ratio 3.1; 95% CI 1.5, 6.3).

Conclusion

Providing medication, transportation vouchers, and a telephone reminder to make an appointment increased the likelihood that discharged patients with asthma obtained PCP follow-up.

### Ambulatory follow-up and outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries after emergency department discharge [^115WAgXw]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 1 in 5 US residents visit the emergency department (ED) every year. An increasing share of ED visits result in discharge home rather than inpatient hospitalization. However, among patients who are discharged from the ED, there is substantial variation in postdischarge outcomes. Among older adults in particular, the days after an ED discharge may be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or unexpected death. Thus, improving care for patients discharged from the ED may be an important target for improving quality and outcomes.

Timely follow-up care after ED discharge may improve outcomes by ensuring that the acute problem prompting the ED visit has not worsened and optimizing management of chronic diseases, if needed. However, there is limited evidence describing how frequently follow-up after ED discharge occurs or the degree to which ambulatory follow-up rates differ by patient or hospital characteristics. Health insurance can improve access to follow-up care but does not eliminate barriers to care, even among Medicare beneficiaries. Furthermore, federal agencies and national societies have endorsed timely follow-up care after ED discharge as an indicator of the quality of care, despite limited evidence regarding whether such follow-up care actually improves outcomes.,

Therefore, we used national Medicare data from 2011 to 2016 to examine the following questions. First, how often do Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the ED have an ambulatory follow-up visit within 7 and 30 days? Second, are certain patient or hospital characteristics associated with higher rates of ambulatory follow-up after ED discharge? Third, is ambulatory follow-up after ED discharge associated with differences in the postdischarge outcomes of mortality and subsequent ED or inpatient utilization?

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112X2Ymh]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma post–emergency department or hospitalization follow-up — Patients discharged following an emergency department presentation or hospitalization for asthma should be especially targeted for an asthma education program, if one is available, and healthcare providers should take the opportunity to review the patient's understanding of the cause of their asthma exacerbation, modifiable risk factors for exacerbations (including, where relevant, smoking), the patient's understanding of the purposes and correct uses of medications including ICS-containing maintenance treatment and anti-inflammatory reliever, if prescribed, and the actions the patient needs to take to respond to worsening symptoms or peak flows. After an emergency department presentation, comprehensive intervention programs that include optimization of asthma treatment, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education are cost effective and have shown significant improvement in asthma outcomes (Evidence B). Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma, or who have had several presentations to an acute care setting despite having a primary care provider, and follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### Care patterns and barriers to outpatient care for adults with AML following intensive chemotherapy at NCCN member institutions [^111LaEUT]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged hospitalization following intensive (re)induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), while standard, is costly and resource intense, limits inpatient bed capacity, and negatively impacts quality of life. Early hospital discharge (EHD) following completion of chemotherapy has proven safe as an alternative at select institutions, but is not widely implemented.

Patients and Methods

From February 2023 through May 2023, the NCCN Best Practices Committee conducted a survey evaluating AML hospitalization patterns, care models, and barriers to EHD at its 33 member institutions.

Results

A total of 30 (91%) institutions completed the survey; two-thirds treat > 100 patients with AML annually and 45% treat more than half of these with intensive chemotherapy. In the (re)induction setting, 80% of institutions keep patients hospitalized until blood count recovery, whereas 20% aim to discharge patients after completion of chemotherapy if medically stable and logistically feasible. The predominant reasons for the perceived need for ongoing hospitalization were high risk of infection, treatment toxicities, and lack of nearby/accessible housing. There was no significant association between ability to practice EHD and annual AML volume or treatment intensity patterns (P = 0.60 and P = 0.11, respectively). In contrast, in the postremission setting, 87% of centers support patients following chemotherapy in the outpatient setting unless toxicities arise requiring readmission. Survey responses showed that 80% of centers were interested in exploring EHD after (re)induction but noted significant barriers, including accessible housing (71%), transportation (50%), high toxicity/infection rate (50%), high transfusion burden (50%), and limited bed availability for rehospitalization (50%).

Conclusions

Hospitalization and care patterns following intensive AML therapy vary widely across major US cancer institutions. Although only 20% of surveyed centers practice EHD following intensive (re)induction chemotherapy, 87% do so following postremission therapy. Given the interest in exploring the EHD approach given potential advantages of EHD for both patients and health care systems, strategies to address identified medical and logistical barriers should be explored.

### Inpatient care of small and sick newborns in healthcare facilities [^112dPWFq]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Inadequate post-discharge care and follow up

A follow up study of more than 2000 newborns discharged from SNCUs was conducted by UNICEF and Government of MP in 2010 to evaluate the long-term survival of these babies. The results showed 10.2% mortality at 1 year of age in those babies who were successfully discharged after completion of their treatment. It was therefore suggested to link SNCU care to a strong follow up and home care program. In some states such as Madhya Pradesh, follow-up of SNCU discharged babies is ensured through a mobile phone enabled tracking system in which mothers and ASHAs are connected to the unit for follow-up contacts. There is a need to now replicate this model in other parts of the country.

Inequitable access to both girls and boys

Gender bias results in discrimination against and fewer admissions for sick females leading to disproportionately more male babies being admitted in health facilities. Data from select states have shown that male admissions outnumbered the female admissions. Another study has shown that more female infants die compared with males following post-delivery discharge from a healthcare facility.

The problem of differential care seeking has to be addressed by a comprehensive approach targeting the community, healthcare facility and at the individual level. To ensure equitable access, it is vital to track and monitor reports/data disaggregated by gender. Health professionals working at facilities should be sensitized toward this practice and make sure that female neonates do not face any barrier to care.

### Ideal postdischarge follow-up after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure: a qualitative study of primary care clinicians in diverse settings [^116EZASJ]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Most patients discharged after hospitalization for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure receive follow-up care from primary care clinicians, yet guidelines are sparse.

RESEARCH QUESTION:

What do primary care clinicians consider to be ideal follow-up care after hospitalization for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure and what do they perceive to be barriers and facilitators to providing ideal follow-up?

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:

We conducted, via videoconferencing, semistructured interviews of 20 primary care clinicians working in diverse settings from five US states and Washington, DC. Participants described postdischarge visits, ongoing follow-up, and referrals for patients recovering from hospitalizations for pneumonia or respiratory failure bad enough to be hospitalized and to require significant oxygen support or seeking treatment at the ICU. Barriers and facilitators were probed using the capability, opportunity, motivation, behavior framework. Interview summaries and rigorous and accelerated data reduction analysis techniques were used.

RESULTS:

Core elements of primary care follow-up after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure included safety assessment, medication management, medical specialty follow-up, integrating the hospitalization into the primary care relationship, assessing mental and physical well-being, rehabilitation follow-up, and social context of recovery. Clinicians described specific practices as well as barriers and facilitators at multiple levels to optimal care.

INTERPRETATION:

Our findings suggest that at least seven core elements are common in follow-up care after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure, and conventional systems include barriers and facilitators to delivering what primary care clinicians consider to be optimal follow-up care. Future research could leverage identified barriers and facilitators to develop implementation tools that enhance the delivery of robust follow-up care for severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure.

### Survivors of congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair face barriers to long-term follow-up care [^112xYYfU]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) carries high morbidity and mortality, and survivors commonly have neurodevelopmental, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary sequela requiring multidisciplinary care well beyond repair. We predict that following hospitalization for repair, CDH survivors face many barriers to receiving future medical care.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of all living CDH patients between ages 0 to 12 years who underwent repair at Riley Hospital for Children (RHC) from 2010 through 2019. Follow-up status with specialty providers was reviewed, and all eligible families were contacted to complete a survey regarding various aspects of their child's care, including functional status, quality of life, and barriers to care. Bivariate analysis was applied to patient data (P < 0.05 was significant) and survey responses were analyzed qualitatively.

Results

After exclusions, 70 survivors were contacted. Thirty-three (47%) were deemed lost to follow up to specialist providers, and were similar to those who maintained follow-up with respect to defect severity type (A-D, P = 0.57), ECMO use (P = 0.35), number of affected organ systems (P = 0.36), and number of providers following after discharge (P = 0.33). Seventeen (24%) families completed the survey, of whom eight (47%) were deemed lost to follow up to specialist providers. Families reported distance and time constraints, access to CDH-specific information and care, access to CDH-specific resources, and access to healthcare as significant barriers to care. All respondents were interested in a multidisciplinary CDH clinic.

Conclusions

CDH survivors require multidisciplinary care beyond initial repair, but attrition to follow-up after discharge is high. A multidisciplinary CDH clinic may address caregivers' perceived barriers.

### Telehealth-based transitional care management programme to improve access to care [^114HKW4M]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Context

White Plains Hospital is a 292-bed not-for-profit community hospital and member of the Montefiore Health System, located in White Plains, New York. In 2022, White Plains Hospital reported having 22 326 inpatient discharges. This report describes in detail the quality improvement (QI) intervention and integration, abiding by the reporting guidelines suggested by the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 guidelines.

Intervention

WPH Cares is a telehealth-based department whose mission aims to (1) provide data-driven innovative solutions to ensure patients have access to services when they need them, (2) leverage hospital and community resources to decrease 30-day hospital readmission and preventable ED utilisation, (3) improve patient access and overall healthcare experience and (4) empower patients to be proactive about monitoring and managing their health.

Established in 2018, initially as a patient experience outreach for the ED, WPH Cares has evolved into a clinical outreach programme with five integrated patient-centric units supporting the entire organisation. Each of these components is designed to screen and address barriers to care for patients during and after their transition home from the acute care setting: (1) clinical outreach, (2) access navigation, (3) diagnosis-specific care transitions, (4) clinical escalation and (5) community coordination (see figure 1).

Figure 1
Five key elements. RN, registered nurse.

Clinical outreach

Clinical outreach consisted of registered nurses (RNs) who telephonically outreach all patients discharged home from a hospital inpatient stay within 24–48 hours of discharge. WPH Cares did not contact patients discharged to a subacute rehabilitation facility, assisted-living facility, group home or hospice given the level of support already established for such patients. For those unreachable telephonically, portal messages were sent if patients had an activated patient portal account through the hospital's electronic medical record (EMR). Structured questions focus on (1) follow-up appointments, (2) discharge instructions, (3) medication access, (4) home services/social work needs and (5) predefined questions based on discharge diagnosis (postoperative, mother-baby discharge, etc). Discrete data from these outreaches were pulled into dynamic dashboards available to leaders hospital-wide, identifying postdischarge needs of their patients.

### Factors influencing general practice follow-up attendances of patients with complex medical problems after hospitalization [^111fdoyL]. Family Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Supported discharge care of patients with complex medical problems is associated with improved health outcomes. GPs are ideally placed to provide post-discharge care in the community. Knowledge of factors that influence patients' decisions to attend such follow-up is thus important to improve health care outcomes of these patients.

Objectives

To explore factors that influence complex medical patients' decision to attend GP follow-up after discharge and factors affecting their level of satisfaction with such follow-up.

Methods

Qualitative investigation using semi-structured telephone interviews of 26 patients with complex medical issues conducted 2 weeks after hospital discharge.

Results

Complex medical patients experienced varying degrees of concern and information needs after discharge from hospital. Patients' understanding of the role of the GP and experiences of continuity of care also influence patients' decisions to attend follow-up with their GP. In addition, practical factors such as GP availability, presence of discharge instructions, access to transport and level of social support also affect patients' ability to attend early GP follow-up after hospital discharge. Patients' satisfaction with GP follow-up was influenced by perceived competence and personal continuity with the GP.

Conclusions

Patients' decisions to attend GP follow-up after hospitalization are influenced by a number of factors. Interventions to support post-hospital care that address these issues need to be developed and tested. Key issues are patients' understanding of their condition, understanding of the role of the GP in follow-up and continuity of care.

### Patient barriers to follow-up care for breast and cervical cancer abnormalities [^1165YF91]. Journal of Women's Health (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Women with breast or cervical cancer abnormalities can experience barriers to timely follow-up care, resulting in delays in cancer diagnosis. Patient navigation programs that identify and remove barriers to ensure timely receipt of care are proliferating nationally. The study used a systematic framework to describe barriers, including differences between African American and Latina women; to determine recurrence of barriers; and to examine factors associated with barriers to follow-up care.

Methods

Data originated from 250 women in the intervention arm of the Chicago Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP). The women had abnormal cancer screening findings and navigator encounters. Women were recruited from a community health center and a publicly owned medical center. After describing proportions of African American and Latina women experiencing particular barriers, logistic regression was used to explore associations between patient characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, and type of barriers.

Results

The most frequent barriers occurred at the intrapersonal level (e.g., insurance issues and fear), while institutional-level barriers such as system problems with scheduling care were the most commonly recurring over time (29%). The majority of barriers (58%) were reported in the first navigator encounter. Latinas (81%) reported barriers more often than African American women (19%). Differences in race/ethnicity and employment status were associated with types of barriers. Compared to African American women, Latinas were more likely to report an intrapersonal level barrier. Unemployed women were more likely to report an institutional level barrier.

Conclusion

In a sample of highly vulnerable women, there is no single characteristic (e.g., uninsured) that predicts what kinds of barriers a woman is likely to have. Nevertheless, navigators appear able to easily resolve intrapersonal-level barriers, but ongoing navigation is needed to address system-level barriers. Patient navigation programs can adopt the PNRP barriers framework to assist their efforts in assuring timely follow-up care.

### Roads diverge: mapping the journey towards diagnostic health equity [^111Mfiei]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Sustainability

Completing the diagnostic journey requires a number of factors to align, including access and effective coproduction throughout. The sustainability constellation takes the form of a map, metaphorically directing attention toward the broader context and challenges to achieving diagnostic excellence and equity. There are additional difficulties in diagnostic care coordination, including diagnostic follow-up, after a clinical encounter. Obstacles here can reset the diagnostic journey (ie, lack of anticipatory guidance and scheduling follow-ups, ineffective counselling and education about when and how to activate care in the future). Missed and delayed diagnoses after abnormal test results occur with process breakdowns between results reporting, communications and referrals. Enriched support for patients in these situations has been the exception. Individuals using safety-net healthcare services encounter significant obstacles in patient monitoring, including limited access to transportation, health literacy challenges and constraints on time for medical appointments. Additionally, these healthcare systems often lack the necessary health information technology infrastructure and resources, which are vital for ensuring effective patient monitoring and preventing adverse events. This constellation shines currently out of reach for many patients, care partners and clinicians as well. The essential challenge is a lack of a diagnostic map for the innumerable permutations and combinations of pathways that a patient has never travelled before. The absence of comprehensive diagnostic mapping is perpetuated by current healthcare financing structures and incentive systems, which prioritise discrete billable encounters over longitudinal care coordination. Creation of and investment in robust diagnostic navigation tools would enable us to better understand these complex journeys and develop targeted interventions that support diverse patient populations at critical points along their diagnostic paths.

### Ambulatory follow-up and outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries after emergency department discharge [^114wz6BT]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How often do Medicare beneficiaries have an ambulatory follow-up visit after discharge from the emergency department, and is ambulatory follow-up associated with postdischarge outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 9 470 626 emergency department discharges from 2011 to 2016, most patients had ambulatory follow-up within 30 days, with lower rates among Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries, Black beneficiaries, and those treated at rural emergency departments. Ambulatory follow-up was associated with a higher risk of subsequent hospitalization but a lower risk of 30-day mortality.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that access to ambulatory care may be a key driver of outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the emergency department.

An early visit may reduce readmission and address inadvertent gaps in care that may exacerbate the high risk for stroke recurrence that marks the first 3 months after hospital discharge, yet the current average interval to first medical visit for patients discharged home after stroke is 27 days.

### Impact of pre-existing disability on long-term health care use following hospitalization for COVID-19: a population-based cohort study [^115Kzoa6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The World Health Organization reported 770 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide in the first 4 years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging evidence shows the lasting impact of these infections on individuals' health care use and needs, which includes development of post-COVID-19 condition. This enormous burden necessitates planning of health care resources to support people long term. To plan properly, policy-makers require data on population-level health service use to understand patient needs and associated health system impacts. It is essential that a health equity lens be applied to this planning to ensure supports are accessible to all. Yet, the needs of people with disabilities in this context have received little attention.

Globally, one in five individuals has a disability. Disabilities are heterogeneous and include physical, sensory, psychiatric, and developmental disabilities. People with disabilities are at heightened risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection as a result of elevated rates of immune compromise, social risk factors such as poverty, difficulty understanding and following public health guidance, and higher likelihood of living in congregate care settings where exposure to the virus is more likely. – They are also at risk of experiencing severe short-term consequences of COVID-19 and being hospitalized due to physiological vulnerabilities related to their disability, higher rates of comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease (which can be exacerbated by infection), and barriers accessing high-quality health care. – These same risk factors could place people with disabilities at risk of worse long-term outcomes after a COVID-19 hospitalization. However, the post-discharge health service use of people with disabilities, and the extent to which such use is related to their disability or other risk factors, has rarely been examined.

To address these evidence gaps, we compared health services use, including ambulatory care, diagnostic tests, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and palliative care, within 12 months following hospitalization for COVID-19 among people with and without pre-existing physical, sensory, and developmental disabilities, and investigated the extent to which such use is related to their disability or other known risk factors.

### Postdischarge follow-up after cardiac Hospitalizations via telehealth or In-person: a retrospective cohort study [^114Sicqw]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Did the frequency of outpatient follow-up within 30 days of discharge after a cardiac hospitalization change during the COVID-19 pandemic, and were outcomes the same after telehealth visits compared to in-person follow-up visits during the pandemic?

What is the main finding?

During the pandemic, 30-day postdischarge access to care improved. Although in-person postdischarge visits were associated with fewer deaths or readmissions (adjusted HR [aHR]: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.61–0.76]), telehealth visits were not (aHR: 1.29 [95% CI: 1.14–1.46]), raising questions about whether telehealth confers the same benefits as in-person follow-up within the first 30 days after hospital discharge.

Early outpatient follow-up after hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction or heart failure (AMI/HF) is associated with better outcomes and is a quality of care indicator. The frequency of outpatient visits for individuals with stable cardiovascular disease did not change after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as the increase in telehealth visits offset in-person visit decreases. We designed this study to answer 2 questions: 1) did posthospitalization follow-up frequency change after onset of the pandemic; and 2) were outcomes the same after telehealth visits compared to in-person visits during the pandemic?

### Hospital provider's perspectives on MOUD initiation and continuation after inpatient discharge [^112L3Wim]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this qualitative study, hospital staff described the substance use treatment system as challenging to navigate with an inadequate capacity to provide necessary MOUD for patients leaving the inpatient setting. Importantly, we found that perceived barriers to transitioning hospitalized patients to continuing care discouraged providers from initiating MOUD treatment during hospitalization in the first place. Participants identified numerous critical gaps in community treatment infrastructure and the referral pathways including a lack of partnerships or affiliation between hospitals and community clinics or programs, long wait times for follow-up care, and few buprenorphine prescribers. Discouraged by what was perceived to be a fractured, inaccessible, and sometimes non-existent outpatient treatment system, hospital providers were reluctant to adopt MOUD prescribing. To encourage adoption of HBOT models, hospitals must provide support for transitioning patients to continuing treatment.

For patients initiated on MOUD in the hospital, transition to ongoing community treatment is critical for ensuring success and should be minimally disruptive. However, national studies of hospitals show that transitions to community care are rarely implemented as part of hospital-based initiatives to address substance use disorders. As part of a broader study on the implementation of HBOT models, these findings contextualize how barriers transitioning patients to continuing treatment can discourage inpatient providers from initiating MOUD treatment and offer suggestions to improve treatment continuity. For example, participants identified barriers directly impacting patient care, including long wait times to outpatient appointments. Increased wait times are especially problematic because patients who are unable to access a same- or next-day appointment are less likely to be retained in treatment with MOUD. To reduce wait times and improve patient retention, hospitals should develop partnerships with community treatment providers and invest in transition strategies that support transitioning patients to community treatment.

### Identifying modifiable health care barriers to improve health equity for hospitalized children [^11575cQG]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Children from socially disadvantaged families experience worse hospital outcomes compared with other children. We sought to identify modifiable barriers to care to target for intervention.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of hospitalized children over 15 months. Caregivers completed a survey within 3 days of admission and 2 to 8 weeks after discharge to assess 10 reported barriers to care related to their interactions within the health care system (eg, not feeling like they have sufficient skills to navigate the system and experiencing marginalization). Associations between barriers and outcomes (30-day readmissions and length of stay) were assessed by using multivariable regression. Barriers associated with worse outcomes were then tested for associations with a cumulative social disadvantage score based on 5 family sociodemographic characteristics (eg, low income).

Results

Of eligible families, 61% (n = 3651) completed the admission survey; of those, 48% (n = 1734) completed follow-up. Nine of 10 barriers were associated with at least 1 worse hospital outcome. Of those, 4 were also positively associated with cumulative social disadvantage: perceiving the system as a barrier (adjusted β = 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 2.30), skill barriers (β = 3.82; 95% CI 3.22 to 4.43), cultural distance (β = 1.75; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.15), and marginalization (β = .71; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.11). Low income had the most consistently strong association with reported barriers.

Conclusions

System barriers, skill barriers, cultural distance, and marginalization were significantly associated with both worse hospital outcomes and social disadvantage, suggesting these are promising targets for intervention to decrease disparities for hospitalized children.

### Automated telephone follow-up programs after hospital discharge: Do older adults engage with these programs? [^114UajZy]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Health systems have developed automated telephone call programs to screen and triage patients' post-hospital discharge issues and concerns. The aims of our study were to determine whether and how older adults engage with automated post-hospital discharge telephone programs and to describe the prevalence of patient-reported post-discharge issues.

Methods

We identified all telephone calls made by an urban academic medical center as part of a post-hospital discharge program between May 1, 2018 and April 30, 2019. The program used automated telephone outreach to patients or their caregivers that included 11 distinct steps 3days post-discharge. All adults discharged home from the hospital, were included, and we categorized patients into ≤ 64years, 65–84years, and ≥ 85years age groups. We then compared call reach rate, completeness of 11-step calls and patient-reported issues between age groups.

Results

Eighteen thousand and seventy six patients were included. More patients 65–84years old were reached compared to patients ≤ 64years old (84.3% vs. 78.9%, AME 5.52%; 95%CI: 3.58%-7.45%). Completion rates of automated calls for those ≥ 85years old were also high. Patients ≥ 85years old were more likely to have questions about their follow-up plans and need assistance scheduling appointments compared to those ≤ 64years old (19.0% vs. 11.9%, AME 7.0% (95%CI: 2.7%-11.3%).

Conclusion

Post-hospital automated telephone calls are feasible and effective at reaching older adults. Future work should focus on improving discharge communication to ensure older adults are aware of their follow-up plan and appointments.

### Outcomes of a citywide campaign to reduce medicaid hospital readmissions with connection to primary care within 7 days of hospital discharge [^114vLosn]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Other research, found that the effectiveness of timely primary care follow-up in reducing readmissions depends on the target population's level of medical and social complexity. A studyof 65 085 North Carolina Medicaid discharges found that people with the highest risk benefited most from primary care follow-up within 7 days of discharge, whereas patients in the lowest risk categories gained little benefit from early follow-up. Studying the intersection of homelessness, mental illness, and health care utilization, researchers found that receiving outpatient services within 7 days of a hospital discharge did not reduce readmissions among homeless people struggling with mental illness, suggesting that postdischarge care may be necessary but not sufficient for reducing readmission risk for the most vulnerable populations.

The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes of a citywide campaign in Camden, New Jersey, to reduce readmissions by increasing access to timely primary care follow-up after a hospitalization. In Camden, where Medicaid covers 57% of residentscompared with 20% nationally, service provision is fragmented and resources are limited. Run by the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers (Camden Coalition), the 7-Day Pledge (7-DP) program leveraged a citywide data infrastructure, 12 primary care practices, and a care team that engaged patients while they were still in the hospital to connect them to a primary care appointment within 7 days of a hospital discharge. The 7-DP program addressed multiple barriers to primary care access. For patients, predischarge engagement to discuss the benefits of primary care follow-up and schedule visits, transportation to and from the primary care office, and a $20 gift card after appointment completion helped reduce barriers. For practices, the program offered an enhanced reimbursement on top of regular reimbursement and value-based payments: $100 for visits within 14 days and $150 for visits within 7 days were given to cover the resources required to prioritize recently discharged patients. Camden Coalition staff met monthly with each practice to review the 7-DP data and discuss strategies for improving program implementation.

### Improving patient follow-up after inpatient stay [^117AySKC]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Timely and appropriate patient follow-up is essential for the future care and safety of our patients following discharge. We have a duty, as doctors, to make sure that these arrangements are made and it is clear from this study that a change is needed in our current system. After discussions with colleagues, there was a consensus that an online system would be most appropriate and given the times at which patients are discharged and that doctors work, there is a need for access to appointments 24-hours a day.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^114Bd4KB]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury education and follow-up — treat TBI as both an acute and chronic condition, and upon discharge from the acute care hospital, ensure that all patients with TBI have the opportunity to follow-up with a clinician experienced in managing TBI. Patients with TBI and their families need targeted education about brain injury, recovery, resources, and follow-up care to enhance safety, coping, follow through, and outcome, and healthcare professionals can benefit from TBI education to improve patient care and outcomes. Only 13%−25% of persons hospitalized acutely with moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI received inpatient rehabilitation, and patients presenting to trauma centers for evaluation and treatment of mild TBI (GCS 13–15) experience symptoms and impairments that persist beyond the acute and subacute phases of recovery. Additionally, nearly 50% of this less severely injured patient population receives no education about their TBI injury at the time of discharge and has no form of postacute follow-up care or education. There is a significant shortage of TBI follow-up care systems in the US and worldwide, and the majority of TBI patients do not receive adequate follow-up care. Many symptoms of TBI need treatment to prevent disability and improve outcomes after TBI, and outcomes are improved with TBI follow-up and treatment by clinicians experienced in managing TBI. While current TBI education platforms and resources can be improved and expanded, numerous resources exist (e.g. CDC, Model Systems, and BrainLine), and trauma centers and community healthcare systems are encouraged to facilitate development of coordinated systems for postacute care for TBI patients with providers experienced in managing TBI.

### Evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults hospitalized for medical care: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^117V7EG1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea in medically hospitalized adults — discharge planning: for medically hospitalized adults at increased risk for or with an established diagnosis of OSA, the AASM suggests a discharge management plan to ensure timely diagnosis and effective management of OSA, rather than no plan. This is a conditional recommendation with very low certainty of evidence, and remarks state to consider ordering post-discharge testing or sleep medicine evaluation prior to discharge; inpatient sleep testing prior to discharge and/or telehealth medicine may be an option to reduce barriers to care; and to consider care coordination to ensure appropriate follow-up and post-discharge care.

### Outcomes of a citywide campaign to reduce medicaid hospital readmissions with connection to primary care within 7 days of hospital discharge [^116ZNoiJ]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Previous research suggests the important role of timely primary care follow-up in reducing hospital readmissions, although effectiveness varies by program design and patients' readmission risk level.

Objective

To evaluate the outcomes of the 7-Day Pledge program to reduce readmissions by increasing access to timely primary care appointments after hospitalization.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study of hospital readmissions among Medicaid patients 18 years or older hospitalized from January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2016, in Camden, New Jersey. To assess each patient's hospital use before and after hospital discharge, all-payer claims data from 4 health care systems were linked to insurers' lists of patients assigned to Camden-based primary care practices. A total of 1531 records were categorized by timing of a primary care appointment after discharge. Discharges followed by a primary care appointment within 7 days (treatment group) were matched by propensity scores to those with less timely or no primary care follow-up (nontreatment pool).

Interventions

Targeted patient enrollment during hospital admission, primary care practice engagement, patient incentives to overcome barriers to keeping an appointment, and reimbursements to practices for prioritizing patients recently discharged from the hospital.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the number of hospital discharges followed by a readmission within 30 days. The secondary outcome was the number of hospital discharges followed by a readmission within 90 days.

Results

There were 2580 hospitalizations of patients 18 years and older included on the patient lists from January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2016. Of these, 1531 records categorized by timing of a primary care appointment after discharge were studied. The treatment group consisted of 450 discharged patients (mean [SD] age, 48.7 [14.7] years; 289 [64.2%] female; 203 [45.1%] black, non-Hispanic). The nontreatment pool consisted of 1081 discharged patients (mean [SD] age, 48.1 [14.9] years; 599 [55.4%] female; 526 [48.7%] black, non-Hispanic). Among this cohort, the number of discharges followed by any readmission was lower for patients with a primary care visit within 7 days of hospital discharge than for their matched referents at 30 days (57 of 450 [12.7%] vs 78.8 of 450 [17.5%]; p = 0.03) and 90 days (126 of 450 [28.0%] vs 174 of 450 [38.7%]; p = 0.002) after discharge.

Conclusions and Relevance

Facilitated receipt of primary care follow-up within 7 days of hospital discharge was associated with fewer Medicaid readmissions. The findings illuminate the importance of reducing barriers that patients and providers face during care transitions.

### Stroke rehabilitation: synopsis of the 2024 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^116fJAcg]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to rehabilitation (community care), DoD/VA 2025 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend for or against transitional care rehabilitation interventions, such as home-based services after hospital discharge, or early supported discharge to improve activities of daily living or functional disability following stroke.
