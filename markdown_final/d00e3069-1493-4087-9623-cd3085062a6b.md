## Question

Can 5-ASA reverse primary sclerosing cholangitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether 5‑ASA (mesalamine) can reverse primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "reverse" means in PSC — typically regression of cholestasis and fibrosis rather than just biochemical improvement. Then, I should examine whether there is any direct evidence that 5‑ASA alters PSC natural history or histology. Next, I need to check if controlling IBD activity with 5‑ASA changes PSC outcomes. After that, I should verify what major guidelines and trials say about medical therapy that modifies PSC progression. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based conclusion and highlight what to do clinically instead of expecting reversal with 5‑ASA [^114Rn5eV].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and terms. PSC is a chronic, fibroinflammatory cholangiopathy with multifocal biliary stricturing that often progresses to cirrhosis and confers elevated risks for cholangiocarcinoma and, in those with IBD, colorectal cancer; crucially, there are no approved disease-modifying medical therapies proven to alter hard outcomes at the time of writing, and "reversal" would imply regression of established fibrosis and restoration of biliary architecture rather than transient biochemical changes [^113cdHoz] [^114Rn5eV].

> I will now examine whether there is direct evidence that 5‑ASA modifies PSC. Wait, let me verify the one study that actually enumerated drug exposures in PSC: the Swedish population-based cohort of 2,914 PSC patients reports that 74.4% received 5‑ASA, but the outcome associations were reported for statins and azathioprine and not for 5‑ASA; there were no data showing that 5‑ASA reduced death, transplant, or fibrosis progression, so there is no signal that 5‑ASA alters PSC outcomes in that analysis [^113Af2v1].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to be sure I am not missing a recommendation. Hold on, I should verify: the ACG 2015 PSC guideline states there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific medical treatment to alter PSC natural history; 5‑ASA is not proposed as disease-modifying therapy in PSC, and UDCA is not recommended routinely by BSG/UK‑PSC because it improves biochemistry without outcome benefit and is harmful at high doses; likewise, contemporary EASL and AASLD documents emphasize that no medical therapy has proven outcome benefit in PSC and they do not list 5‑ASA as a disease-modifying agent [^112wQskt] [^114jHACL] [^113mwR8P] [^114Rn5eV].

> Let me consider whether treating colitis changes PSC. The BSG/UK‑PSC guidance explicitly notes that treatment of active colitis appears to have no impact on PSC progression, which argues against the idea that 5‑ASA could reverse PSC via colonic inflammation control alone; I should confirm that EASL guidance aligns with this by recommending that PSC‑associated IBD be managed per IBD standards for mucosal healing, without any claim that this modifies PSC trajectory [^115q9By2] [^115fLUz2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated a pharmacologic mechanism: since 5‑ASA is systemically active and antifibrotic in the liver, it could reverse PSC — hold on, I should verify and correct that. 5‑ASA is primarily a locally acting anti‑inflammatory agent within the colonic lumen and mucosa for IBD; there is no credible evidence in these sources that 5‑ASA exerts an antifibrotic effect on cholangiopathy or reverses biliary fibrosis in PSC, and guidelines do not cite mesalamine as a disease modifier for PSC [^115fLUz2] [^112wQskt].

> I need to check the broader context of "reversal" versus "biochemical improvement". Multiple interventions in PSC improve ALP without improving hard outcomes: moderate‑dose UDCA improves liver tests but not survival and can be harmful at high doses, and FXR agonism with obeticholic acid lowers ALP yet remains unproven for clinical endpoints; endoscopic therapy of dominant strictures can improve cholestasis and symptoms but is not established to reverse fibrosis; transplant remains the only intervention consistently improving survival in advanced disease, underscoring that biochemical shifts are not equivalent to disease reversal [^114jHACL] [^115McWkt] [^115BYCWJ] [^112SPn1N].

> But wait, what if the question is whether 5‑ASA could at least slow PSC indirectly by improving IBD outcomes or reducing colorectal cancer risk in PSC‑IBD? I should double-check: while treating IBD per standard care is appropriate and important for mucosal healing and colorectal neoplasia prevention strategies, existing guidance still indicates no demonstrable impact of IBD therapy on PSC progression itself, and surveillance for hepatobiliary and colorectal malignancies plus management of strictures and symptoms remains the core PSC care pathway rather than reliance on mesalamine for disease modification [^115fLUz2] [^113uLAo7] [^111KkAbN].

> Bottom line: I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence. There are no randomized trials, meta-analyses, or guideline endorsements supporting 5‑ASA as therapy to reverse or modify PSC; control of colitis with 5‑ASA is appropriate for IBD indications, but it does not reverse PSC, and major guidelines emphasize the absence of proven disease‑modifying medical therapy in PSC at this time [^115q9By2] [^112wQskt] [^114Rn5eV].

5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) **does not reverse** primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [^114Rn5eV]. There is **no evidence** that 5-ASA improves liver biochemistry, halts fibrosis, or prevents progression to cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, or liver transplantation [^113GxxXj]. It is used only for coexisting IBD [^115fLUz2] and has no direct effect on PSC [^115q9By2]; **current guidelines do not recommend** 5-ASA for PSC management [^112wQskt] [^114jHACL].

---

## Mechanism of action of 5-ASA

5-ASA is an **anti-inflammatory agent** used in IBD, inhibiting prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, scavenging free radicals, and modulating immune responses. It **acts locally in the gut**, with minimal systemic absorption, thereby limiting its effect on the liver and biliary tree.

---

## Evidence regarding 5-ASA in PSC

There is **no evidence** that 5-ASA reverses PSC or alters its natural history [^112cviPX]. Available data show no benefit in liver biochemistry, histology, or clinical outcomes. In a Swedish cohort (n = 2,914), 5-ASA use was **not associated** with improved liver outcomes or reduced progression to cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, or transplantation. Moreover, **no randomized controlled trials** demonstrate benefit in PSC [^113GxxXj].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines **do not recommend 5-ASA** for PSC management:

- **ACG 2015**: insufficient evidence to recommend any medical treatment, including 5-ASA, for PSC [^112wQskt].
- **BSG 2019**: do not use UDCA routinely; no recommendation for 5-ASA in PSC [^113mwR8P].
- **EASL 2022**: no recommendation for 5-ASA in PSC.

---

## Clinical outcomes and disease progression

PSC is a **progressive disease** with a median transplant-free survival of 12–18 years [^112cviPX]. 5-ASA does not alter the disease course or reduce the risk of cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, or transplantation.

---

## Safety and tolerability

5-ASA is **generally well tolerated**, but rare adverse effects include nephrotoxicity, hypersensitivity, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Given the lack of benefit in PSC, these risks **do not justify its use** [^112wQskt].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

No medical therapy **reverses PSC**; management is supportive and focused on complications [^114Rn5eV]:

- **UDCA**: improves liver biochemistry but does not alter clinical outcomes; not recommended for routine use [^113mwR8P].
- **Obeticholic acid**: under investigation; no proven benefit yet [^115McWkt].
- **Liver transplantation**: only curative option for advanced PSC [^111AxUi7].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research targets bile acid metabolism [^1111oubQ], immune modulation, and fibrosis, but **no therapy has proven effective in reversing PSC** [^114Rn5eV]. Combination strategies may be needed [^1165PC43].

---

5-ASA **does not reverse PSC** or alter its course; **it is used only for coexisting IBD** [^115fLUz2]. Management remains supportive, with liver transplantation for advanced disease [^114S2GRN].

Abnormal liver biochemistry is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a cohort of 544 patients with IBD, 29% had at least one abnormal liver biochemical test, but only 5.8% had a clinical diagnosis of chronic liver disease (biopsy was not required for diagnosis in this series). When performed in a subset with a suspicion of biliary disease, cholangiographic features of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were present in 4.6% of all patients. In a recent study, 7.5% of patients with longstanding IBD (over 20 years' duration) with normal liver biochemistry had evidence of cholangiopathy (9% of Crohn's disease, 6.8% ulcerative colitis), indicating that PSC may be underdiagnosed within cohorts of patients with IBD.

IBD is present in 62–83% of patients with PSC of Northern European descent, but rates are as low as 21% elsewhere in the world. Patients often have extensive colitis, which may be of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis type. Rectal sparing and backwash ileitis are more common in IBD associated with PSC. PSC may be diagnosed before IBD, but generally IBD is diagnosed some years before the identification of PSC. Despite potential mechanisms linking active colonic inflammation with the aetiology and activity of PSC, this has never been properly demonstrated.

Clinically, the activity of IBD can follow an unpredictable course. Patients with PSC and IBD often describe minimal symptoms even in the presence of endoscopically and biopsy-proven active IBD. Treatment of active colitis appears to have no impact on the progression of PSC. Case series also show that patients can develop…

In a large, but still underpowered study of 219 patients randomized to moderate dose UDCA (17–23 mg/kg) or placebo for 5 years, there was no significant difference in outcomes between the two groups, including symptoms, liver biochemistry, CCA, death, or transplantation. However, there was a trend towards a reduction in mortality or transplantation in the UDCA group (7.2% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.4). Liver biopsy was not included in the protocol.

A further large, multicenter study of high-dose UDCA (28–30 mg/kg) in 150 patients with PSC was terminated early after results showed higher rates of serious adverse events and primary endpoints of death, liver transplantation, and development of varices in the UDCA-treated group. Meta-analyses of published data report no benefit from UDCA in patients with PSC. One uncontrolled study examined the effect of stopping UDCA in patients already established on treatment and demonstrated worsening of liver biochemistry and pruritus after stopping treatment, but the study was not able to assess the effect on longer-term outcomes.

In small duct PSC, small case series suggest that UDCA improves liver biochemistry but has no effect on the development of complications, progression to classic large duct PSC, or risk of death or transplantation.

Overall, it appears that UDCA improves liver biochemistry, but there is no evidence that it improves outcome and may be harmful in high doses.

Recommendation 5: We recommend that UDCA is not used for the routine treatment of newly diagnosed PSC (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: GOOD).

Sclerosing cholangitis can be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to an identifiable cause. Irrespective of cause, sclerosing cholangitis usually progresses to end-stage liver disease and warrants orthotopic liver transplantation. Recent studies provide new insights into the etiopathogenesis, natural history, diagnosis, and management of these different entities.

PSC is a rare and partially understood chronic cholestatic and fibroinflammatory liver disorder that can lead to severe complications, such as cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, and cancer. Recent advances in understanding its pathophysiology have identified new potential molecular targets, offering new treatment possibilities. In view of the complex nature of the disease, it is unlikely that a single pharmacological intervention can address all the treatment needs of PSC patients. Therefore, future therapeutic strategies for PSC are likely to involve a combination of multiple pharmacological agents targeting different molecular and biochemical pathways at various stages of the disease.

### Bile acids for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116HpatQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive chronic cholestatic liver disease that usually leads to the development of cirrhosis. Studies evaluating bile acids in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis have shown a potential benefit of their use. However, no influence on patient survival and disease outcomes has yet been proven.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded generally from inception through to October 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose of bile acids or duration of treatment versus placebo, no intervention, or another intervention were included irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors extracted data independently. We evaluated the risk of bias of the trials using prespecified domains. We performed the meta-analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle and presented outcomes as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: Eight trials evaluated ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention (592 patients). These eight randomised clinical trials have a high risk of bias. Patients were treated for three months to six years (median three years). The dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid used in the trials ranged from low (10 mg/kg body weight).

- **Liver transplantation**: Advanced liver disease secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a well-established indication for liver transplantation. Patients receiving transplants due to PSC have excellent outcomes compared with many other indications. The European Liver Transplant Registry, which includes data from the UK, has recorded 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 86%, 80%, and 77%, respectively, for patients transplanted between 1988 and 2005. Data from the US registries on more recent cases indicate even better survival, although the results for PSC are poorer than for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), even though patients with PSC were younger.

The optimal timing of referral for transplant assessment is challenging because jaundice can be caused by both liver failure and/or biliary obstruction, which may respond to endoscopic therapy. Due to difficulties in predicting outcomes and specific risks of severe recurrent cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), some national allocation schemes give PSC patients exemption points. This balances their risk compared with other causes of cirrhosis when using scoring systems such as the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD). Some experts advocate for early transplantation in PSC due to the risk of CCA. However, the potential for recurrent PSC in the graft and poorer long-term survival data compared to a conservative approach in early disease do not support this opinion.

A large study analyzing the American transplant United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database reported a lower death rate for patients with PSC on the waiting list (13.6%) compared to other indications (20.5%). A variable potentially skewing these data is the higher rate…

These guidelines on the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology liver section. The guideline writing committee included medical representatives from hepatology and gastroenterology groups, as well as patient representatives from PSC Support. The guidelines aim to support general physicians, gastroenterologists, and surgeons in managing adults with PSC or those presenting with similar cholangiopathies that may mimic PSC, such as IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis. It also acts as a reference for patients with PSC to help them understand their own management. The quality of evidence is presented using the AGREE II format. Guidance is meant to be used as a reference rather than for rigid protocol-based care, as we understand that management of patients often requires individual patient-centered considerations.

Research into PSC has predominantly been conducted through small case series and uncontrolled trials in specialist units. Most centers possess an insufficient number of patients to impact their clinical service for audit purposes or to undertake independent clinical trials. A recent consensus on endpoints for future studies was reported by an international PSC working group.

Studies in progress include investigations into the role of norUDCA, farnesoid X receptor agonists, bile salt transporter protein inhibitors, antibiotics, and monoclonal antibody blockade of receptors thought to be activated in the pathogenesis of PSC.

Gastroenterology units should be encouraged to link patient databases to enhance knowledge of the natural history of PSC and response to treatments, as well as to improve future clinical trials. These efforts should be coordinated by UK-PSC, BSG, and/or the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) rare diseases initiative. Studies should include a prospective national repository of clinical samples. Future clinical trials should be registered with the NIHR.

Research and clinical audit questions that may require more clarity include: What constitutes a diagnosis of PSC in UK practice? How should patients with unexplained abnormal liver biochemistry and IBD be evaluated, labeled, and diagnosed, particularly when MRCP is normal? How can we improve stratification for risk of (a) liver disease, (b) disease progression, and (c) cancer? What is the optimal timing and type of intervention for PSC patients?

### Pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis: An attempted network meta-analysis [^113GxxXj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease associated with both hepatobiliary and colorectal malignancies, which can result in liver cirrhosis and its complications. The optimal pharmacological treatment for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis by performing a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. Given that it was not possible to assess whether potential effect modifiers were similar across comparisons, we did not perform the network meta-analysis but instead used standard Cochrane methods. When trials begin to provide an adequate description of potential effect modifiers, we will attempt to conduct a network meta-analysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index - Expanded, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomized controlled trials registers until February 2017 to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in which participants were given a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. We excluded trials that included previously liver-transplanted participants. We considered any of various pharmacological interventions compared.

These guidelines have been commissioned on behalf of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) liver section and UK-PSC with the aim of assisting clinicians in the diagnosis and management of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Members of the writing committee included gastroenterologists, hepatologists, transplant physicians, and patient representatives. Where possible, clear, clinically applicable recommendations are provided. The guidelines were reviewed by the BSG guideline commissioning group and council before circulation for international peer review.

### High lifetime risk of cancer in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1134WT1R]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients are at risk for developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Our aim was to assess the risk of malignancies and their influence on survival.

Data from PSC patients diagnosed between 1980 and 2006 in two university hospitals were retrieved. The Kaplan-Meier method and a time-dependent Cox regression model were used to calculate risks of malignancies and their influence on survival.

Two hundred and eleven patients were included; 143 (68%) were male and 126 (60%) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Median transplantation-free survival was 14 years. The risk of CCA after 10 and 20 years was 9% and 9%, respectively. In patients with concomitant IBD, the 10-year and 20-year risks for CRC were 14% and 31%, which was significantly higher than for patients without IBD (2% and 2%). CCA, cholangitis, and age at entry were independent risk factors for the combined endpoint of death or liver transplantation. Risk factors for the endpoint of death were CCA, CRC, age, and symptomatic presentation.

Patients with PSC and IBD have a high long-term risk of developing CRC and this risk is about threefold higher than the risk for CCA. Both malignancies are associated with decreased survival.

In general, patients with PSC should be referred early for consideration of transplantation if there is cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension associated with any complications or when the UKELD or MELD scores rise towards minimal listing criteria (currently 49 and 15, respectively). The presence of intractable pruritus (uncommon in PSC) and recurrent cholangitis are also accepted indications for orthotopic liver transplant within the UK and should justify earlier referral for consideration of liver transplantation.

Recurrence of PSC in transplanted livers is seen in 10–40% of cases. The main identifiable risk factors for recurrence are male sex, the presence of an intact colon and/or active colitis after transplantation. There is no evidence that post-transplant immunosuppression with single or multiple agents reduces the risk of recurrence, although most units favour a triple immunosuppression regimen. Diagnosis of recurrence is based primarily on clinical findings of typical cholangiopathy (either by radiographic or liver biopsy assessment) after 90 days in the absence of other causes, including hepatic artery ischaemia, ABO incompatibility, and established ductopenic rejection. Recurrence can be difficult to treat and necessitates retransplantation in approximately 50% of cases. Duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis should be undertaken whenever possible as it is associated with a reduced risk of cholangitis. Anastomotic or de novo dominant strictures are usually managed with balloon dilatation and/or biliary stent insertion (plastic or possibly removable full-length stents).

There is little evidence for a beneficial effect of UDCA in reducing the risk of CCA, with no placebo-controlled trials specifically examining this question. Two observational studies reported a lower incidence of CCA in patients taking UDCA in comparison with previously reported incidence rates. The largest of these studies followed up 150 patients for a median of 6.4 years, with CCA developing in five patients (3.3%), which represents about half the expected incidence of CCA in PSC. The large US randomized control trial of UDCA versus placebo was terminated early, but also failed to show a significant difference in the rate of either CCA (2.6% vs. 2.7%) or colonic dysplasia in either the UDCA or placebo arms, respectively, at 5 years.

- **Recommendation 6**: We recommend that UDCA is not used for the prevention of colorectal cancer or cholangiocarcinoma (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH).

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115fdq9U]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic hepatic dysfunction characterized by inflammatory and tissue-degenerative strictures of the biliary tree, leading to cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. The pathophysiological mechanisms involve immune-mediated responses. Numerous treatment modalities targeting the inflammatory aspects have been suggested, but a consensus on the best treatment option is lacking. This study aims to review the most up-to-date treatment options for PSC.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Diagnosis, prognosis, and management [^1168ET55]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the liver with an unclear etiology, characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of bile ducts. It primarily affects middle-aged men and is associated with a four-fold increase in mortality compared to an age- and sex-matched population. Progressive biliary and hepatic damage results in portal hypertension and hepatic failure in a significant majority of patients over a 10- to 15-year period from the initial diagnosis. Additionally, PSC confers a markedly increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, compared to the general population, with cancer being the leading cause of mortality in patients with PSC. It is associated with inflammatory bowel disease in 70% of patients and increases the risk of colorectal cancer almost ten-fold.

Despite significant research efforts in this field, the pathogenic mechanisms of PSC remain incompletely understood, although growing evidence supports the role of genetic and immunologic factors. There are no proven medical therapies that alter the natural course of the disease. Thus, liver transplantation is the only available treatment for patients with advanced PSC, yielding excellent outcomes in this population.

Toxicity of bile on hepatic cholangiocytes, resulting from cholestasis or alterations in bile composition within the bile ducts or colon, as well as impaired protective mechanisms (e.g. "bicarbonate umbrella"), play a key role in the inflammatory and fibrotic processes in the biliary tract. The "toxic bile hypothesis" involves various molecules, chemokines, and nuclear receptors that regulate bile acids, cholestasis, and bile acid metabolism.

Regardless of the sequence of the aforementioned pathophysiological events, a common molecular pathway involving cellular crosstalk leads to the activation of stellate cells and possibly portal myofibroblasts, ultimately resulting in hepatic fibrosis, collagen recruitment, and scar tissue formation causing bile duct strictures. These processes represent potential molecular targets for future antifibrotic treatments. The clinical significance of the molecules and factors involved in the final manifestation of PSC is still largely unknown and may vary among different patient subgroups, depending on the clinical stage of the disease. Early-stage disease may present more treatment opportunities compared to later stages.

Since the exact pathogenic mechanisms of PSC remain unclear, the disease is predominantly considered idiopathic, and the available treatments are limited in their efficacy. Liver transplantation is generally regarded as the gold standard treatment for PSC. However, several research studies suggest that pharmacological agents may also have a beneficial effect on disease progression.

The AASLD 2021 guidelines on medical management for primary biliary cholangitis specifically advise against the use of obeticholic acid in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Advanced cirrhosis is characterized by prior evidence of liver decompensation, such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy, or portal hypertension, such as ascites, gastroesophageal varices, or persistent thrombocytopenia. It is recommended to carefully monitor any patient with cirrhosis, even if it is not advanced, who is receiving obeticholic acid.

- **FISH**: A method for detecting and localizing the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences.

- **Endo-biliary biopsy**: A procedure to obtain tissue samples from the bile duct.

- **Cholangioscopy**: A procedure that allows direct visualization of the bile ducts.

- **EUS-guided biopsy**: A biopsy taken with the aid of endoscopic ultrasound.

The exact role of endoscopic therapy in the management of dominant strictures in PSC remains incompletely understood. Investigations in animals and humans suggest that decompression of biliary obstruction prevents further damage and can reverse fibrotic liver disease. This is supported by data demonstrating that patients with PSC who achieve normalization or near normalization of ALP have improved outcomes compared with those who do not. It is clear that endoscopic treatment of biliary strictures often improves liver biochemistry and pruritus, and may reduce the risk of recurrent cholangitis.

Consensus has been for repeated endoscopic intervention (usually stricture dilatation ± stenting) of dominant biliary strictures in those with symptomatic disease. Evidence from studies comparing jaundice, cholangitis, transplantation, and actuarial survival rates with figures from prognostic models tend to suggest a benefit of endoscopic intervention for dominant biliary strictures. In contrast, a Swedish study comparing liver biochemistry in those with and without dominant strictures suggested that variations in cholestasis and jaundice are a feature of PSC liver disease and are not a direct consequence of endotherapy of dominant strictures.

The optimum method and frequency of dilatation of dominant strictures is unclear. Plastic stent insertion, with or without prior stricture dilatation, has been commonly used. The difficulty with this approach is that further ERCPs are required to remove or replace the stent, and there is a high rate of stenosis.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary sclerosing cholangitis, and more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis and cholangiocarcinoma, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining contrast-enhanced, cross-sectional imaging as the initial diagnostic in patients with suspected cholangiocarcinoma. This may potentially be followed by ERCP with ductal sampling (brush cytology, endo-biliary biopsies) for diagnosis and staging of the suspected cholangiocarcinoma.

Early reports suggested positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be useful for surveillance or investigation of suspected CCA. However, a further study of 36 patients (without PSC) with suspected CCA demonstrated a sensitivity of 85% for mass-forming tumors, 65% for metastases, but only 18% for infiltrating tumors. One small prospective study on the use of PET in transplant assessment (n = 10, four with CCA) reported a sensitivity of 75% and false-positive rates of 20% in the presence of cholangitis. Studies of PET scanning in sporadic CCA demonstrate sensitivities of 61–92% and specificities of 75–93%. The detection rate falls to as low as 36–59% in cases of extrahepatic disease with infiltrating rather than mass-forming disease. Therefore, PET is not routinely recommended for surveillance or diagnosis of CCA in PSC.

Cases of suspected CCA should be referred for review in the regional specialist hepatobiliary and pancreatic MDM or liver transplant center. Decisions on treatment depend on the stage of disease. Chemotherapy remains the main palliative treatment for patients with CCA and will be directed by the specialist MDM. Although resectional surgery may be curative, this is usually not possible in patients with PSC (particularly with hilar/intrahepatic malignancy) because of either advanced stage malignancy at diagnosis, complex biliary structuring, or coexistent parenchymal liver disease precluding a major liver resection. A retrospective multicenter study of 47 patients with liver transplantation for hilar CCA (not PSC specific) reported a high rate of recurrence.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study of obeticholic acid for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115McWkt]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, cholestatic liver disease with no currently approved therapies. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a potent farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. We investigated the efficacy and safety of OCA in patients with PSC.

- **Aims**: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of OCA in patients with PSC.

- **Methods**: AESOP was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. Eligible patients were 18 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of PSC and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 2× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin < 2.5× ULN. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, OCA 1.5–3.0 mg, or OCA 5–10 mg once daily for a 24-week, double-blind phase followed by a 2-year, long-term safety extension (LTSE). Primary endpoints were change in ALP from baseline to week 24, and safety.

- **Results**: The intent-to-treat population comprised 76 patients randomized to placebo (n = 25), OCA 1.5–3.0 mg (n = 25), and OCA 5–10 mg (n = 26). At week 24, serum ALP was significantly reduced with OCA 5–10 mg vs. placebo (least-square [LS] mean difference = -83.4 [SE = 40.3] U/L; 95% CI -164.28 to -2.57; p = 0.043). Serum ALP was not significantly reduced with OCA 1.5–3.0 mg vs. placebo at week 24 (LS mean [SE] difference = -78.29 [41.81] U/L; 95% CI -162.08 to 5.50; p = 0.067). Total bilirubin remained comparable to baseline in all groups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was dose-related pruritus (placebo 46%; OCA 1.5–3.0 mg 60%; OCA 5–10 mg 67%). Reductions in ALP were maintained during the LTSE, and no new safety concerns emerged.

### Bile acids for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^112YuMiM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Bile acids have been used for treating primary sclerosing cholangitis, but their beneficial and harmful effects remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group's Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Chinese Biomedical Database from inception through May 2002.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose or duration of bile acids versus placebo, no intervention, or another intervention were included, irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers extracted the data. The methodological quality of the trials was evaluated with respect to the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow-up. The results were reported by intention-to-treat analysis. Outcomes were presented as relative risks (RR) or weighted mean differences (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: We identified six randomised clinical trials, all with low methodological quality. Patients were treated for three months to six years (median two years). Five trials (183 patients) compared ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo, and one trial (40 patients) compared ursodeoxycholic acid versus no treatment. Ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly reduce the risk of death (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.27 to 2.73); treatment failure, including liver transplantation.

### High dose ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis is safe and effective [^112e4o1o]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown to improve serum liver tests in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); however, controlled trials have exhibited inconsistent effects on liver histology and did not reveal a survival benefit. This pilot, randomized dose-ranging trial attempted to determine whether further enrichment of the bile acid pool with UDCA would lead to an improvement in outcomes for PSC patients.

- **Methods**: Thirty-one patients with PSC were randomized to treatment with either 10 mg/kg (low dose), 20 mg/kg (standard dose), or 30 mg/kg (high dose) daily of UDCA for 2 years. Patients were assessed every 12 weeks and underwent liver biopsy at the beginning and end of the trial.

- **Results**: Serum liver tests improved in all groups taking UDCA. Survival probability at 1–4 years, as evaluated by the Mayo risk score, tended to improve for all patients and significantly improved for the high dose group (p < 0.02). Only 3 (10%) of all patients had a Ludwig score showing histological deterioration over the trial period.

- **Conclusions**: High dose UDCA is well-tolerated and is associated with an improvement in survival probability. A trend towards stability or improvement in histological stage was also observed. This treatment appears to be effective for PSC and deserves further evaluation.

### Targeting the gut microbiome as a treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis: A conceptional framework [^1167cxKm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) involves genetic susceptibility, where specific components of the microbiome or their metabolic products may trigger an exaggerated immune response from cholangiocytes. Alternatively, or in addition, gut dysbiosis could alter the metabolic function of the gut microbiome, leading to changes in the bile acid pool or increased intestinal permeability. Treatment with vancomycin, or potentially with fecal microbiota transplantation, shifts the microbiome toward groups such as Proteobacteria, subsequently affecting the production of secondary bile acids. This, in turn, influences the bile acid pool and has favorable effects on cholangiocyte biology.

### Statin use is associated with improved outcomes of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113Af2v1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

There is increasing evidence that statins can benefit patients with chronic liver diseases, but their effects have not been studied in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We performed a nationwide study in Sweden to determine the effects of exposure to drugs, including statins, in patients with PSC.

- **Methods**: We studied a population-based cohort of patients in Sweden with PSC and concomitant ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease from 2005 through 2014 (n = 2914), followed through 2016. We collected and analyzed data from the patient register, the prescribed drug register, the death certificate register, and the cancer register. We calculated the risk of death, liver transplantation, bleeding of esophageal varices, and cancer in relation to drug exposure.

- **Results**: The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis with PSC was 41.4 years (inter-quartile range [IQR], 25.6–56.1 years). The total follow-up time was 11769 person-years, during which 3.4% of patients received liver transplants and 19.9% died. Proportions of patients exposed to drugs were: ursodeoxycholic acid, 60.2%; 5-aminosalicylic acid, 74.4%; azathioprine or mercaptopurins, 33.7%; and statins, 13.9%. Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.88) and death or liver transplantation (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28–0.66). Use of azathioprine was also associated with reduced mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52–0.84) and risk of death or liver transplantation (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.83). Exposure to ursodeoxycholic acid did not aff.

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113WEuML]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

We suggest that care provision should involve a partnership between patients, primary care, and hospital-led specialty medicine. Care delivery for an individual patient should encompass patient risk assessment, symptom burden, and how local services are configured. All patients should have at least an annual review, which should become more frequent as required if symptoms or complications develop.

The timing of referral to specialist regional HPB units will vary and depend on physicians' experience in caring for patients with PSC and in biliary interventions. In practice, referral will be at the point where a patient's clinical management is beyond both the local expertise and knowledge of their responsible physician and team. As a general rule, all symptomatic patients should be under the care of a specialist clinician or HPB centre with an interest and experience in managing PSC.

In the absence of effective medical treatment and with the unpredictable natural history of PSC, it is important that patients are referred early for consideration of liver transplantation. Patients with jaundice from suspected parenchymal disease, rising liver disease scores (MELD > 11, UKELD > 46), or complicated biliary strictures require discussion with specialist units for consideration of endoscopic, radiological, and/or surgical biliary intervention or liver transplantation.

Other reasons to consider referral include persistently raised ALP levels, transient elastography of > 9.9 kPa, or an enhanced liver fibrosis test result of > 10.6.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115qFtWA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

ASBT plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of conjugated bile acids in the terminal ileum. As mentioned earlier, the FXR exerts its effects, in part, by downregulating ASBT, thereby reducing the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and the bile acid pool. Inhibition of ASBT has been shown to improve hepatic histology in animal models of cholestatic liver disease, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect in patients with PSC.

Maralixibat, an inhibitor of ASBT (LUM001), has been evaluated in a recent open-label phase II trial involving 27 PSC patients. Preliminary results indicate that there were no clinically significant changes in liver biochemical indices observed.

### Advances in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113SYwq9]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic, progressive cholangiopathy that frequently affects men and is associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the cause of the disease is still debated, a genetic association and link to immune-mediated disease triggered by environmental factors are thought to contribute. The disease can present as isolated imaging abnormalities, biochemical changes, cholangiocarcinoma, or end-stage complications such as cirrhosis. Symptoms include fatigue, jaundice, pruritus, or steatorrhea. Differentiation can be challenging because other chronic cholangiopathies can present similarly; however, the distinction is necessary to optimize disease surveillance. Management involves assessment for comorbid inflammatory bowel disease and exclusion of other associated cholangiopathic disorders.

Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis have a poor prognosis; progression to liver cirrhosis is common, and an increased risk of hepatobiliary and colorectal cancers is present in those with inflammatory bowel disease. Although much research involves locating an active therapy that can alter the disease course, the only available treatment is liver transplantation, and risk for disease recurrence remains. The use of ursodeoxycholic acid can improve alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin concentrations but does not alter the disease course. In this review, we summarize aetiological theories, provide an update on hepatobiliary malignancies that require surveillance, and discuss exciting areas [the text appears to be truncated here].

### Characteristics and clinical course of primary sclerosing cholangitis in France: a prospective cohort study [^1146YnbB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare disease, and a large-scale report of PSC in France is lacking. We initiated a prospective multisite observational study.

One hundred and fifty PSC patients (90 with associated inflammatory bowel disease) were included. At entry, 11 patients had a diagnosis of hepatobiliary or colon malignancy: cholangiocarcinoma (n = 5), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 2), gallbladder carcinoma (n = 1), and colorectal cancer (n = 4). One hundred and forty-one patients (94%) were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with a median dose of 13.1 mg/kg/day, including 118 with UDCA started before inclusion.

During follow-up [3.9 (0.1–7.2) years], colorectal cancer was diagnosed in four patients and biliary carcinoma in two, with incidences of 0.76 and 0.38 per 100 patient-years, respectively. Kaplan-Meier transplant-free survival at 4 years was recorded at 79%. The main causes of death (n = 10) were cancer (n = 5, including three colorectal cancers and two cholangiocarcinomas) and liver failure (n = 4). Indications for transplantation (n = 25) included end-stage liver disease (n = 16), known or suspected biliary cancer (n = 5), recurrent acute cholangitis (n = 3), or pruritus (n = 1). Independent predictive factors of death or transplantation included alkaline phosphatase at least 3 times the upper limit of normal values, platelets less than or equal to 150,000/mm³, and bilirubin at least 23 μmol/L. Observed and predicted survivals were similar.

In conclusion, PSC in France shares common features with other series and is almost universally treated with UDCA.

### All you need to know about the overlap between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease [^116MaEwq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

- **Best practice**: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) - Despite animal models and early trials suggesting a benefit from secondary bile acids such as UDCA or obeticholic acid on liver biochemistry, long-term use of UDCA did not impact prognosis beyond biochemical cholestasis, apart from one Japanese study. The use of UDCA was not significantly associated with a lower rate of PSC-related death in multivariate analysis. This translates into conflicting international professional organization recommendations on its use in PSC. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that UDCA at doses of 15–20 mg/kg/day could be tried, and maintained if liver biochemistry or clinical relief is noted, although the effects on long-term prognosis remain unclear. These recommendations are based on evidence suggesting that while high doses of UDCA (28–30 mg/kg/day) are associated with adverse outcomes, moderate doses (15–20 mg/kg/day) may offer biochemical improvement and potential clinical benefits, without the same level of risk. The ACG and AASLD guidelines emphasize that this approach should be considered in the context of individual patient response and clinical judgment.

- **Fenofibrate**: Fibrates confer anticholestatic effects in PSC through their action on peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors. Similarly to UDCA, fenofibrates can improve cholestatic biochemistry and symptoms, especially in combination with UDCA or in UDCA partial responders, but they have not been proven to improve LT-free survival.

### Primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis therapy landscape [^116boVs4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are rare, chronic cholestatic diseases that can progress to liver failure. The goals of treatment are to halt the progression of liver disease to cirrhosis and/or liver failure, and to alleviate symptoms associated with these diseases. Ursodeoxycholic acid has historically been the first-line treatment for PBC, with obeticholic acid and fibrates used as second-line or adjunctive therapies. However, the treatment landscape is rapidly expanding. Recently, two new second-line agents gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of PBC, and several other therapies remain under investigation with promising results.

Although significant progress has been made in the development of therapies for PBC, currently, there are no approved treatments for PSC other than liver transplantation. However, several emerging therapies have shown encouraging results. This review outlines the existing and upcoming treatments for PBC and PSC.

Regarding medical management for primary biliary cholangitis, specifically concerning first-line therapy, the BSG 2018 guidelines recommend considering the addition of obeticholic acid. The initial dose should be 5 mg/day, titrating to 10 mg/day at 6 months, if tolerated, in patients with an inadequate response to UDCA (or UDCA intolerance). This is defined by an ALP level greater than 1.67 times the ULN and/or elevated bilirubin less than 2 times the ULN.

### The nonsteroidal farnesoid X receptor agonist cilofexor (GS-9674) improves markers of cholestasis and liver injury in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1111oubQ]. Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic and progressive liver disease whose pathogenesis remains poorly understood. PSC is characterized histologically by chronic inflammation and fibro-obliterative destruction of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic ducts, resulting in progressive biliary fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. Although various pharmacologic interventions have been studied, no approved medical therapies exist that have reduced rates of clinical outcomes such as hepatic decompensation, cholangiocarcinoma, transplantation, or mortality. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is associated with improvement in biochemical markers of cholestasis, including a reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), in most PSC patients, but the clinical benefits of such responses remain unclear. Recent analyses have identified lower baseline levels and/or improvements in ALP over time as important markers of improved prognosis. However, a study of high-dose UDCA demonstrated worse clinical outcomes compared with placebo, despite reductions in serum ALP. These seemingly contradictory findings illustrate the complexity of identifying surrogate markers of clinical benefit in PSC and also highlight the major unmet need for novel therapies to treat this condition.

A hallmark of PSC is the presence of cholestasis. Thus, one potential therapeutic target may be activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor that is the key regulator of bile acid synthesis, conjugation, and excretion. FXR is highly expressed in the liver and gallbladder.

### British Society of Gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1119yu1u]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

It is difficult to predict the rate of progression or outcome for individual patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Asymptomatic patients are likely to have a better prognosis than those with symptoms. Multivariate analyses in several series demonstrate clinically predictable parameters as markers of poor prognosis.

Some groups have devised prognostic models (summarized in Table 1) using a variety of parameters, including age, blood results, liver biopsy staging, cholangiographic findings, and complications such as a history of variceal bleeding. The most widely used is the revised Mayo natural history model for PSC. Like other models, it features a complex formula reflecting the variability and complexity of the disease's natural history. These models probably have little role in ordinary patient care and are rarely used in clinical practice in the UK. Their main roles are to assist in the timing of liver transplantation and for research studies.

- **Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and UK Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (UKELD) scores**: These may be applied to patients with PSC as with patients suffering from other liver diseases. However, both scores may fluctuate highly and overestimate the stage of liver disease due to the impact of biliary obstruction on the bilirubin component of the scores.

- **Child-Pugh score**: This has been applied specifically to PSC, with 7-year survival rates of 90%, 68%, and 25% for scores A, B, and C, respectively. Prognostic models using clinical and laboratory parameters for established PSC do not vary significantly from data using the simple Child-Pugh score.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113cdHoz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare and progressive hepatic disorder characterized by multifocal inflammatory and fibrotic bile duct strictures. The disease has genetic roots and is linked to autoimmunity. Over time, these strictures lead to fluctuating cholestasis, hepatic cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease. The diagnosis of PSC is made by identifying characteristic bile duct findings via magnetic resonance cholangiography and elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), after ruling out other potential causes.

On biochemical testing, many patients exhibit ALP fluctuations. What is more, the various subgroups of PSC patients should be considered (e.g. small-duct PSC, PSC with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis, etc) because they are likely to represent various forms of the same pathophysiological background and/or clinical picture.

Epidemiologically, the prevalence of PSC is from 1–16 per 100,000 in different societies, and its incidence might range from 1–1.3 cases per 100,000. Additionally, approximately 70% of the patients diagnosed with PSC have underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The prevalence of PSC-IBD has been estimated at 24 per 100,000. Moreover, patients with PSC-IBD are at increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and colorectal carcinoma. It is estimated that 0.5–1.5% of patients with PSC develop CCA annually. For patients with PSC, the lifetime incidence of gallbladder carcinoma ranges from 3–14%, and the lifetime incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma ranges from 0.3–8%.

How should patients with PSC be managed?

- **Drug therapies**: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a hydrophilic bile salt used to treat cholestatic liver diseases, including primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Retrospective observational studies from centers with high UDCA use demonstrated worse actuarial survival compared to predicted survival using PSC prognostic models, suggesting a lack of therapeutic benefit from UDCA. A number of randomized controlled trials have been performed, but these have generally been small (n = 6–110 patients) with a short follow-up of usually 12–24 months (range 12–60 months) and hence underpowered for identification of clinical events. Overall, the early studies using low doses of 10–15 mg/kg demonstrated improvement in liver biochemistry but not of liver histology, and none have shown improvement in outcomes measured by death or transplantation.

Three small pilot trials of higher doses (20–30 mg/kg) have been published. All resulted in improvement of liver biochemistry, and two included liver biopsy in the final clinical evaluation. One of these showed a non-significant improvement in histological score in the high dose (30 mg/kg) group (n = 9), and the other (n = 21) demonstrated improvement in Ishak staging in 3 out of 11 patients (p = 0.05) and cholangiographic findings (p = 0.015) in two patients at 2 years. None showed improved outcome, but these pilot studies were not sufficiently powered to demonstrate a survival benefit.

Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to indicate preferred approaches to medical problems as established by scientifically valid research. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are preferable, but reports and expert review articles are also utilized in a thorough review of the literature conducted through the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE. When only data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available, a recommendation is identified as a consensus of experts.

Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject, without regard to specialty training or interests, and are intended to indicate the preferable but not necessarily the only acceptable approach to a specific problem. Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any healthcare problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision.

Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. Each guideline has been intensely reviewed and revised by the Committee, other experts in the field, physicians who will use them, and specialists in the science of decision analysis. The recommendations of each guideline are therefore considered valid at the time of their production based on the data available. New developments in medical research and practice pertinent to each are not covered by the guidelines once they have been published.

### British Society of Gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116M1sfy]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

There are multiple causes of cholangiopathy. We recommend that cholestatic liver biochemistry with typical cholangiographic features, in the absence of other identifiable causes of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, is usually sufficient for a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

- **Principal imaging modality**: We recommend that MRCP should be the principal imaging modality for the investigation of suspected PSC. ERCP should be reserved for patients with biliary strictures requiring tissue acquisition (e.g. cytological brushings) or where therapeutic intervention is indicated (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: HIGH).

- **Liver biopsy**: We recommend that liver biopsy is normally reserved for possible small duct PSC, assessment of suspected possible overlap variants, or instances where the diagnosis is unclear (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

- **Risk stratification**: We recommend risk stratification based on non-invasive assessment. Clinical scores are an emerging theme, but no single method can be recommended at present to predict individual patient prognosis. Given the unpredictable disease course and the serious nature of the complications of PSC, patients should receive lifelong follow-up (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: VERY LOW).

- **Use of UDCA**: We recommend that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is not used for the routine treatment of newly diagnosed PSC (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: GOOD). For patients already established on UDCA therapy, there may be evidence of harm in patients taking…

### Emerging pharmacologic therapies for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^112cviPX]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The only currently approved treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is liver transplantation, with a median time to transplant of 12–18 years after diagnosis. There are several emerging drugs with the potential to address this urgent need.

- **Recent findings**: Although the cause of PSC is unknown, there are many novel therapeutics under development. These drugs target presumed pathogenic mechanisms largely extrapolated from ex-vivo and in-vivo preclinical models, as well as translational observations.

- **Summary**: Future therapeutic strategies for PSC may include a multitude of complex pathogenic mechanisms encompassing pathways of immunomodulation, the microbiome, and inflammation-related fibrosis.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase ii study of obeticholic acid for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115gV2Ua]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, life-threatening, progressive, cholestatic liver disease in which inflammation and fibrosis lead to the destruction of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, with the eventual onset of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Diagnosis of PSC is based on a combination of biochemical and radiological criteria. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is elevated in most patients, consistent with cholestasis. Compared with ALP levels in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), ALP levels in PSC are highly variable and fluctuate on the individual level. Using data from 1,001 patients with PSC, the UK-PSC consortium reported that serum ALP < 2.4× upper limit of normal (ULN) at 1 year after diagnosis was associated with improved transplant-free survival, and other studies have reported associations between reduction in serum ALP and longer survival.

Currently, there are no approved pharmacological therapies for PSC, and liver transplantation is the only therapeutic alternative demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been used to treat PSC, but the results are mixed: treatment with UDCA has led to improved serum liver biochemistry, and similar results have recently been reported with the side-chain shortened derivative, nor UDCA. However, there is currently no evidence that UDCA alters the clinical course of PSC or prolongs survival. Therefore, effective systemic therapies for PSC represent a substantial unmet medical need.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an essential regulator of bile acid homeostasis;

### Primary biliary cholangitis drug evaluation and regulatory approval: Where do we go from here [^115a4c9v]. Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is now treated using a fully stratified approach, incorporated into routine clinical practice. The goals of life-long therapy are the prevention of disease progression and the amelioration of disease-associated symptoms. The first-line treatment for all patients is with the hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) at a therapeutic dose of 13–15 mg/kg/d. Patients showing an inadequate response are recommended to receive add-on second-line therapy. UDCA is safe but of relatively limited efficacy in people with more aggressive disease.

The challenges that we now face in relation to deriving the key evidence regarding the efficacy of second-line therapies in PBC were, in fact, presaged by exactly the same challenges faced with UDCA. Whereas UDCA was found, from the very outset, to significantly improve liver biochemical tests such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the benefit in terms of death or transplant was much more limited, and nonexistent for how UDCA is currently used in normal practice (i.e. early use to change the long-term disease trajectory), due to a lack of informative data from randomized placebo-controlled trials. This led to a debate, over many years, as to whether UDCA actually "worked" in PBC. Indeed, there are some who suggest that its benefit is still unproven.

Why, in light of this uncertainty, is the use of UDCA in PBC universally recommended? The answer is that real-world clinical experience, collated in the form of extensive real-world evidence (RWE) studies, has shown, beyond reasonable doubt, that it is both safe and effective in the majority of patients.

### Sclerosing cholangitis [^114t8Wa5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by strictures of the biliary tree, complicated by cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. It is immune-mediated, although the precise etiology remains unknown.

- **Recent findings**: Research into the etiopathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, associations with inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune pancreatitis, and medical therapy are discussed.

- **Summary**: Multiple gene polymorphisms associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis have been investigated. Common inflammatory bowel disease-associated polymorphisms do not confer any susceptibility to primary sclerosing cholangitis; the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene polymorphisms and CCR5 mutations remains unclear. Elevated IgG4 has been demonstrated in a subgroup of primary sclerosing cholangitis patients, which may indicate an overlap with autoimmune pancreatitis and possible responsiveness to steroids. Biliary brush cytology may assist in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, although further clinical indicators are required. Animal studies suggest the superiority of 24-norursodeoxycholic acid over ursodeoxycholic acid in reducing histological disease progress; translational studies in humans are now required.

Aetiology

PSC is a progressive biliary disorder strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The genetic associations with disease risk, presence of chronic inflammation in the portal tracts, and the strong association with IBD suggest that PSC is an immune-mediated disease in which the biliary epithelial cell is a key cell targeted. However, no reliable autoantibodies have been identified, and there is no significant response to immunosuppression.

At the time of writing, genome-wide studies have uncovered susceptibility loci for PSC-IBD, the majority of which have been previously reported as risk factors in other immune-mediated disorders. The strongest association resides within the human leucocyte antigen complex and suggests that disease-specific antigens drive pathogenic immune responses. Genetic determinants account for less than 10% of total disease liability in PSC-IBD, clearly emphasizing the predominant role of environmental factors on ultimate disease susceptibility.

### Sclerosing cholangitis [^112dEodH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by strictures of the biliary tree. It is immune-mediated, although the precise cause remains unknown. Recent reports have shown a higher prevalence and burden of disease than was previously suspected.

- **Recent findings**: Research into the etiopathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, medical and surgical therapy, and timing and outcome of liver transplantation is discussed.

- **Summary**: Genetic heterogeneity among patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis is supported, and further gene polymorphisms associated with protection against primary sclerosing cholangitis have been elucidated. Bile duct injury seems to be a multistep process. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a cost-effective and accurate way of diagnosing primary sclerosing cholangitis in comparison with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Ursodeoxycholic acid may have a role as a colorectal and hepatobiliary cancer chemopreventive agent. Liver transplantation remains the only treatment in end-stage disease. The 5-year and 10-year patient and graft survival rates are comparable with those in patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis, but there is a higher rate of retransplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis in most centers. Hepatobiliary malignancy is found in a minority of patients at transplantation, although 5-year survival rates for these patients are still promising.

### The gut-liver axis in cholangiopathies: Focus on bile acid based pharmacological treatment [^115YVQm2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, no therapeutic strategy has been proven successful in arresting the progression of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Options focus on managing symptoms such as pruritus and fatigue, as well as comorbidities like ulcerative colitis, which usually presents with a pancolitis phenotype, autoimmune diseases, metabolic bone diseases, and bacterial cholangitis.

- **Endoscopic and medicinal management**: Clinical endoscopic management of biliary strictures and the use of antibiotics are key strategies in handling most complications. Oral vancomycin, given its immunomodulatory action and ability to increase the production of antimicrobial peptides, has been used particularly to manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated PSC. In a recently completed small clinical trial, oral vancomycin improved liver biochemistry. It was well tolerated, and no patient displayed treatment adverse events. However, despite these promising results, formal recommendations are not yet available, and further clinical trials are ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03710122).

- **Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)**: One of the most extensively studied therapeutic agents for PSC is UDCA, a secondary bile acid with cytoprotective activities due to its high hydrophilicity. UDCA has anticholestatic effects, stimulates bile acids and organic anion secretion, and the secretion of biliary bicarbonate at the hepatocyte and cholangiocyte levels, leading to the stabilization of the biliary umbrella. Additionally, UDCA is believed to benefit the immune system through its anti-inflammatory properties and reduce the severity of cell injury.

### Recent advances in the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114Rn5eV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by fibroinflammatory damage to the biliary tree, typically in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, with an increased risk of liver failure and cholangiocarcinoma. A complex pathophysiology, heterogeneity in clinical features, and the rare nature of the disease have contributed to the lack of effective therapy at the time of writing. However, recent innovations in the characterization and prognostication of patients with PSC, in addition to new tools for medical management and emerging pharmacologic agents, give rise to the potential for meaningful progress in the next several years. This review summarizes concepts in PSC and highlights particular areas in need of further study.

### Update on primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1117hVci]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) remains one of the most challenging conditions in clinical hepatology. There has been a steady growth in research to overcome this challenge, and the present review aims to summarize the most recently published literature. The main emphasis is on linking recent pathogenetic insights to clinical characteristics and patient management.

With regard to pathogenesis, there is no consensus yet on whether immune-mediated injury or factors related to bile acid physiology are most important. It also remains unclear whether PSC is a mixed bag of various secondary etiologies yet to be defined or a disease entity predominantly represented by sclerosing cholangitis in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. Most importantly, there is no available medical therapy with proven influence on clinical endpoints. The timing of liver transplantation and patient follow-up are challenging due to the unpredictable and high risk of cholangiocarcinoma.

### Current diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^117BNi5o]. Liver Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an important liver disease with significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of PSC is confirmed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is performed in patients requiring therapeutic endoscopy. Due to the unknown cause of the disease, medical therapies are unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid should be recommended for the treatment of PSC patients because there is a trend toward increased survival. Dominant bile duct stenoses should be treated endoscopically. However, liver transplantation remains the only therapeutic option for patients with advanced disease.

Estimation of prognosis and timing of liver transplantation should be determined individually for each PSC patient based on all results. The diagnosis and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CC) still remain a challenge in PSC patients. Early diagnosis of CC is essential for successful treatment with surgical resection or innovative strategies such as neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by orthotopic liver transplantation. Therefore, endoscopic techniques such as cholangioscopy and/or intraductal ultrasound may be useful diagnostic tools in patients with stenoses suspicious for malignancy.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^111W861F]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARs) agonists play a critical role in regulating liver transporters involved in bile homeostasis, making them promising targets for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. PPAR agonists have demonstrated anti-cholestatic effects such as enhancing biliary phospholipid secretion, promoting mixed micelle formation through upregulation of MDR3, inhibiting bile acid synthesis, and upregulating bile acid detoxification. These receptors are activated by a variety of lipophilic acids, including essential fatty acids, eicosanoids, phytanic acid, and palmitoylethanolamide. Like the FXR, PPARs have pleiotropic effects and interact with bile acid nuclear receptors, leading to anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects.

There have been an increasing number of studies investigating the clinical efficacy of fibrates in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). However, most of the available evidence comes from observational or retrospective analyses rather than primary studies. Fenofibrate and bezafibrate have shown promise in the treatment of PSC. A recent retrospective study conducted in France and Spain demonstrated a 40% decrease in ALP levels and significant improvement in pruritus after treatment with fenofibrate (200 mg/day) or bezafibrate (400 mg/day) for a median duration of 1.5 years, in 20 PSC patients. However, the study also noted a rebound in ALP levels after discontinuation of the PPAR agonist, which may be attributed to the occurrence of biliary stones, tolerability issues, or worsening of hepatic biochemistry.

### Glucocorticosteroids for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114bGydX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic disease of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, characterized by chronic periductal inflammation and sclerosis of the ducts. This results in segmental stenoses of bile ducts, cholestasis, fibrosis, and ultimately, liver cirrhosis. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis are at a higher risk of cholangiocarcinoma, as well as colonic neoplasia, since primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with inflammatory bowel disease in more than 80% of the patients. Several therapeutic modalities have been proposed for primary sclerosing cholangitis, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, glucocorticosteroids, and immunomodulatory agents. However, none has been successful in reversing the disease process. At the time of writing, liver transplantation is the only definitive therapeutic solution for patients with advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis with liver cirrhosis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of glucocorticosteroids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS from their inception until September 2009, as well as reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose or duration of glucocorticosteroids versus placebo, no intervention, or other immunosuppressive agents. We included trials irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status.

### AASLD practice guidance on primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma [^115VATt6]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of primary sclerosing cholangitis, specifically concerning the management of pruritus, the AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend initiating bile acid sequestrants as initial therapy. This is recommended for patients with PSC who present with pruritus and do not respond to conservative measures, such as heat avoidance, emollients, and antihistamines.
