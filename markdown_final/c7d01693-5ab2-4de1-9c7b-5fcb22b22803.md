## Question

Long qt with premature ventricular contraction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about long QT syndrome with premature ventricular contractions, including how to interpret the combination, what it means for risk, and how to manage it step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of LQTS and why PVCs matter mechanistically. Then, I should verify the prognostic significance of PVCs in LQTS and how to distinguish benign from malignant patterns. Next, I will review guideline-based risk stratification and thresholds that change management. After that, I need to outline immediate and chronic management, including electrolytes, beta-blockers, genotype-specific therapy, and device decisions. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and what to do when PVCs persist despite therapy, making sure I double-check any numerical thresholds before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. Long QT syndrome reflects prolonged ventricular repolarization due to ion-channel dysfunction, creating a substrate for torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death; PVCs are premature ventricular beats that can be benign but in LQTS may signal electrical instability and even trigger malignant arrhythmias, so I need to ensure I don't dismiss them reflexively [^f5e053f2] [^7ac2117b].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic link. In LQTS, repolarization heterogeneity and early afterdepolarizations predispose to triggered activity; PVCs, especially when frequent, multifocal, or short-coupled, can both reflect and propagate this instability, lowering the threshold for torsades and VF, which is why guidelines flag frequent PVCs as worrisome in this setting [^e1cddbe9] [^b3b76636].

> I should confirm the prognostic signal. Frequent PVCs, PVCs landing on the T wave, and runs of NSVT are premonitory for torsades in patients with prolonged QT; observational data in acquired and congenital LQTS show that each ~10 ms increase in QTc adds roughly 5–7% risk of events, and PVCs mark electrical instability even when the absolute QTc is not markedly prolonged, so I need to integrate PVC burden and morphology with QTc and clinical context rather than rely on a single metric [^b3b76636] [^934d8282] [^c6f2199d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should distinguish benign from malignant PVC patterns. Benign features include isolated, sparse, uniform PVCs with a low burden and normal ventricular function, whereas malignant features include frequent PVCs, multifocal morphology, couplets/triplets, NSVT, short-coupled PVCs on the T wave, and PVCs in the setting of prolonged QT; the latter patterns warrant escalation and closer monitoring, and I should double-check for reversible triggers like hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and QT-prolonging drugs before labeling them as primary electrical disease [^e1cddbe9] [^7ac2117b] [^b3b76636].

> Next, I should review risk stratification. High-risk features include QTc > 500 ms, LQT2 or LQT3 genotype, prior syncope or cardiac arrest, female sex with LQT2, and age < 40 years; asymptomatic patients with QTc > 470 ms are generally offered beta-blockers, and those with QTc > 500 ms despite therapy are candidates for intensification; I initially thought the threshold for universal beta-blocker therapy was QTc > 470 ms, but wait, I should correct that — ACC/AHA/HRS recommends beta-blockers when QTc > 470 ms, whereas ESC emphasizes nonselective beta-blockers for documented QT prolongation and supports beta-blockers even in genotype-positive patients with normal QTc, reflecting a more conservative stance in some contexts [^ca8fa37f] [^531f87ae] [^4feb4966] [^796a9fa2].

> I will now examine immediate management when PVCs cluster with prolonged QT. First, I need to ensure electrolyte optimization: replete potassium to 4.5–5.0 mEq/L and magnesium to at least 2.0 mg/dL, because even modest deficits can precipitate torsades; second, I should stop and avoid QT-prolonging drugs using crediblemeds.org; third, if there are frequent PVCs or runs, I should consider continuous telemetry and treat acute torsades with IV magnesium even if the patient is asymptomatic, as magnesium suppresses torsades without necessarily shortening QT [^02956baa] [^b3b76636] [^f66155b0].

> For chronic therapy, I should confirm that nonselective beta-blockers are first-line. Nadolol or propranolol are preferred over metoprolol because of superior efficacy in LQTS, with nadolol often favored for LQT2; beta-blockers reduce events by > 95% in LQT1, > 75% in LQT2, and > 60% in females with LQT3, though I need to monitor for bradycardia and ensure adequate dosing with exercise testing to verify suppression of catecholamine-mediated QT prolongation [^4feb4966] [^e7c7da26] [^f43f2353].

> But wait, what if the patient is LQT3 or has breakthrough events on beta-blockers. I should consider genotype-specific therapy: mexiletine shortens QTc and reduces events in LQT3 and is now guideline-endorsed; in refractory cases or when beta-blockers are contraindicated, left cardiac sympathetic denervation can reduce arrhythmia burden, though recurrence still occurs and complications are not negligible, so shared decision-making is essential [^2465b34a] [^5525f7d3] [^df462e2a].

> I need to check device indications. Secondary prevention with an ICD is indicated after cardiac arrest or sustained VT/VF; for primary prevention, ICD is reasonable in symptomatic patients despite beta-blockers, or in very-high-risk asymptomatic patients with QTc > 500 ms on therapy or multiple high-risk features; importantly, electrophysiology study is not recommended for risk stratification in LQTS, so I should avoid EP testing unless there is a different diagnostic question [^218b6222] [^f92b8e99] [^ef86a3b4].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, beta-blockers are generally safe and should be continued, with heightened vigilance postpartum, especially in LQT2; in children and adolescents, early recognition and beta-blocker therapy are critical, and implantable loop recorders can help distinguish benign symptoms from arrhythmias; in athletes, individualized decisions are needed, but most treated patients can participate in noncompetitive sports with precautions [^e097527f] [^6f79248a] [^f5e053f2].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. Annual ECGs to reassess QTc, periodic exercise testing to ensure adequate beta-blockade, and medication reconciliation at every visit are standard; I should also counsel on trigger avoidance, including swimming supervision for LQT1, noise avoidance for LQT2, and strict avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs; if PVCs persist despite optimized therapy, I should reconsider adherence, electrolytes, and whether escalation to mexiletine, LCSD, or ICD is appropriate based on risk [^e7c7da26] [^9a6e3cbc] [^0d09b9aa].

> In summary, I should confirm that PVCs in LQTS are never entirely benign. They are red flags for electrical instability and mandate prompt correction of modifiable risks, initiation of guideline-directed therapy with nonselective beta-blockers, and consideration of genotype-specific treatments and device therapy in appropriate patients, with the ultimate goal of preventing torsades and sudden death while preserving quality of life [^4feb4966] [^218b6222] [^f5e053f2].

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) signals **high arrhythmic risk** because PVCs can trigger torsades de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) [^e1cddbe9] [^b3b76636]. Management centers on **beta-blockers** (preferably nadolol or propranolol) [^4feb4966] to suppress PVCs and reduce events, with escalation to mexiletine for LQT3 [^2465b34a], left cardiac sympathetic denervation [^2386a942], or ICDs for refractory cases or high-risk features (QTc > 500 ms, syncope, or prior cardiac arrest) [^218b6222] [^f92b8e99]. Avoid QT-prolonging drugs, correct electrolytes, and monitor with serial ECGs and Holter to track PVC burden and QTc response [^10c5b421] [^e7c7da26].

---

## Pathophysiological relationship between LQTS and PVCs

- **Electrical instability**: LQTS prolongs repolarization, creating a substrate for early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and triggered activity, which PVCs can initiate [^4c1abc50].
- **PVCs as triggers**: PVCs can precipitate TdP, especially when they fall on the T wave (R-on-T) or occur during bradycardia/pauses [^e1cddbe9] [^b3b76636].
- **Risk amplification**: Frequent PVCs, multifocal morphology, or short-coupled PVCs increase TdP risk in LQTS [^e1cddbe9] [^b3b76636].

---

## Clinical significance of PVCs in LQTS

PVCs in LQTS are **not benign** and indicate higher risk of TdP and SCD; their presence warrants intensified therapy and monitoring [^e1cddbe9] [^b3b76636]. Frequent PVCs (> 500/24 h), multifocal morphology, or short-coupled PVCs are particularly concerning and correlate with increased arrhythmic events [^e1cddbe9] [^b3b76636].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Measure QTc manually; LQTS is suggested when QTc ≥ 470 ms in males or ≥ 480 ms in females, with higher risk when QTc ≥ 500 ms [^d5811467] [^ed7d5c6a].
- **Holter monitoring**: Quantify PVC burden, morphology, and coupling intervals; frequent, multifocal, or short-coupled PVCs are high-risk features [^e1cddbe9] [^b3b76636].
- **Exercise testing**: Helps unmask LQTS and assess beta-blocker effect; recovery QTc > 460 ms at 7 minutes is sensitive for LQT1/LQT2 [^f43f2353] [^60e5fb36].
- **Genetic testing**: Identifies pathogenic variants in LQTS genes; genotype informs risk and therapy (e.g. mexiletine for LQT3) [^8bed52f8] [^2465b34a].

---

## Management strategies

### Pharmacological management

- **Beta-blockers**: First-line therapy; nonselective agents (nadolol, propranolol) are preferred to suppress PVCs and reduce events [^4feb4966] [^a3ff117f].
- **Mexiletine**: For LQT3 with prolonged QTc, mexiletine shortens QTc and reduces arrhythmic burden [^2465b34a] [^5525f7d3].
- **Avoid QT-prolonging drugs**: Strict avoidance is essential to prevent TdP [^10c5b421] [^02956baa].

---

### Non-pharmacological management

- **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)**: Indicated for secondary prevention after cardiac arrest or for primary prevention in high-risk patients (QTc > 500 ms, syncope despite therapy, or high-risk genotype) [^218b6222] [^f92b8e99].
- **Left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD)**: Consider when beta-blockers are ineffective or contraindicated; reduces arrhythmic events and ICD shocks [^2386a942] [^df462e2a].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Avoid strenuous exercise (especially swimming for LQT1), loud noises (LQT2), and maintain electrolyte balance [^9a6e3cbc] [^10c5b421].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular ECGs are needed to track **QTc and PVC burden**, with **Holter monitoring** to quantify PVC frequency and morphology [^e7c7da26] [^750fd305]. Ongoing **patient education** should reinforce trigger avoidance, medication adherence, and symptom recognition [^9a6e3cbc].

---

## Prognostic implications

PVCs in LQTS indicate **higher risk** of TdP and SCD; their presence should prompt intensified therapy and closer follow-up [^e1cddbe9] [^b3b76636]. Effective suppression of PVCs with beta-blockers and targeted therapies significantly improves outcomes and reduces arrhythmic events [^e7c7da26] [^e653fdb3].

---

Long QT syndrome with PVCs carries **high arrhythmic risk** because PVCs can trigger TdP and SCD. Management prioritizes beta-blockers, genotype-specific therapy (e.g. mexiletine for LQT3), and escalation to LCSD or ICD for refractory or high-risk cases, with strict avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs and close monitoring of QTc and PVC burden [^4feb4966] [^2465b34a] [^218b6222] [^10c5b421].

### The long QT syndrome: a transatlantic clinical approach to diagnosis and therapy [^2443b876]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The mind-boggling progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the long QT syndrome (LQTS) has been the subject of many articles and reviews. Still, when it comes to the management of the patients affected by this life-threatening disorder, too many errors still take place, both in the diagnostic process and in the therapeutic choices. The price of these errors is paid by the patients and their families. This review is not directed to the relatively small number of LQTS experts who know what to do. It does not deal with genetics, with epidemiology, or with the well-known clinical manifestations. We have focused solely on the approach to diagnosis and therapy and we have directed this review to the average clinical cardiologist who, in his/her practice, sees occasionally patients affected or suspected to be affected by LQTS; the cardiologist who may know enough to manage them but not enough to be completely confident on his/her most critical choices. We have provided our personal views without making any attempt to blend differences whenever present. On most issues we agree fully but where we do not, we make it clear to the reader by indicating who is thinking what. The result may be unconventional, but it mirrors the challenges, often severe, that we all face in managing and protecting these patients from sudden death while also helping them live and thrive despite their diagnosis. We trust that this unabashed presentation of our clinical approach will be useful for both cardiologists and patients.

### Management of long QT syndrome [^cdf18186]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and by life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, occurring especially during conditions of increased sympathetic activity. Existing therapies are very effective, but mortality is high among untreated, symptomatic individuals. The identification of several of the genes responsible for LQTS and the realization that they all encode cardiac ion-channels has represented a landmark finding. This advance has fostered novel genotype-phenotype studies that are providing unique insight into how close the relationship can be between molecular biology and clinical cardiology. LQTS represents a paradigm for sudden cardiac death. Indeed, the growing knowledge developed for LQTS is likely to provide the key to understanding the genetic propensity to sudden death in patients with more-common cardiovascular diseases. The data presented here illustrate how the treatment of LQTS is rapidly evolving toward a highly individually tailored approach on the basis of patient-specific genetic information.

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in asymptomatic individuals—clinical significance and alert features: Isolated and sparse PVCs are a normal occurrence in most individuals, and a few to multiple PVCs can be seen on most 24 h Holter monitors, including those from healthy young individuals. PVCs usually originate from different locations in both right and left ventricles and may result from focal activity or, less likely, micro re-entrant mechanisms. In some individuals a higher number of PVCs may be present, and frequent PVCs may be a marker for underlying abnormal cardiac substrate due to electrical, ischaemic, or structural alterations leading to increased automaticity, triggered activity (e.g. in long QT syndrome (LQTS) or by drugs such as digoxin), or re-entrant mechanisms (e.g. in post-infarction patients). Underlying cardiac disease is a prognostically unfavourable marker in asymptomatic patients with PVCs and requires a special approach to address the potential prognostic impact, and PVC characteristics such as a high burden, more complex presentation (e.g. couplets, triplets, or non-sustained runs), multifocal origin, and/or increasing frequency with exercise should alert to potential underlying electrical, ischaemic, or structural disease.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS)—genetic testing provides diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information, with substantial diagnostic yield and selective use in unexplained QTc prolongation. Genetic testing for disease-causing mutations in long QT syndrome offers important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information in addition to the clinical evaluation, and a positive test can facilitate establishing risk for family members; the yield in phenotype-positive patients is 50% to 86.0%. A negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of long QT syndrome, and in asymptomatic patients with otherwise unexplained prolonged QTc ≥480 ms on serial ECGs, genetic testing may help confirm the diagnosis and supplement prognostic information.

and patients make optimal informed decisions about how best to minimize the risk of this serious complication. The QT interval on the electrocardiogram has gained clinical importance, primarily because prolongation of this interval can predispose to a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes. Multiple factors. charged ions by way of an inadequate outflow of potassium ions or excess inflow of sodium ions. This intracellular excess of positively charged ions extends ventricular repolarization and results in QT interval prolongation. 10 In the clinical setting, it is now widely recognized that typical measurement of the QT interval is subject to substantial variability, which can cloud. the QTc should be no more than 440 milliseconds to start dofetilide in the setting of a narrow QRS complex, the QTc should be no more than 500 ms in the setting of ventricular conduction abnormality.

20 This guidance may be used with other QT-prolonging medications until a standard. characterized by lifelong, ambient QT prolongation is rare but does carry a high risk of sudden death. Several forms of congenital LQTS have been reported, and 3 forms have been well characterized in previous studies. 21 These forms have been found to have. using a large international registry of LQTS, it was noted that although the risk of cardiac events was significantly higher among patients with LQT1 and LQT2 than with LQT3, the frequency of lethal cardiac events was significantly higher in the LQT3 group. 6 When exposed to QT-prolonging medications, individuals without lifelong. are required to precipitate torsades de pointes.

Factors that predispose to QT prolongation and higher risk of torsades de pointes include older age, female sex, low left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemia, slow heart rate, and electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. 5, 27-34 Certain. Despite these recommendations, uncertainty remains regarding the specific relationship between the degree of QT prolongation and the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias with each individual drug. A QT interval of at least 500 ms generally has been shown to correlate with a higher risk of torsades de pointes, but there is no established threshold below which prolongation of the QT interval.

Long-QT syndrome—management options and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) indications emphasize arrhythmia control. Because this is a primary electrical disorder, with most patients having no evidence of structural heart disease or left ventricular dysfunction, the long-term prognosis is excellent if arrhythmia is controlled. Long-term treatment with beta blockers, permanent pacing, or left cervicothoracic sympathectomy may be helpful. ICD implantation is recommended for selected patients with recurrent syncope despite drug therapy, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac arrest, and use of the ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death may be considered when there is a strong family history of sudden cardiac death or when compliance or intolerance to drugs is a concern. Risk stratification continues to evolve as genetic analysis becomes increasingly useful for clinical decision making.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome—risk with normal QTc and beta-blocker considerations: Approximately 10% to 36% of genotype-positive patients have QTc intervals ≤440 ms and, although patients with normal QTc have a lower risk of VA and SCD than those with prolonged QTc, they still have increased risk versus genotype-negative, age- and sex-matched patients. Beta blockers reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events substantially; during the periods of highest risk in the first 3 decades of life, treatment with a beta blocker may reduce risk of SCA. Because QTc changes over time, assessment of QTc on ECG annually or with medication changes and assessment of medication efficacy with exercise testing are indicated, and asymptomatic adult (male) patients with normal QTc intervals may choose to decline beta-blocker therapy.

AHA/ACC/HRS 2017—Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) supportive guidance, risk, and monitoring—Beta blockers reduce adverse cardiac events for long QT syndrome type 1 (>95%), long QT syndrome type 2 (>75%), and females with long QT syndrome type 3 by >60%; in selected patients, beta blockers can be protective against sudden cardiac arrest. Patients receiving a beta blocker should undergo ongoing monitoring to assess changes in QTc over time and adequacy of beta blockade with exertion. High‑risk LQTS features include QTc >500 ms, genotypes long QT syndrome type 2 and long QT syndrome type 3, females with genotype long QT syndrome type 2, <40 years of age, and prior cardiac arrest or recurrent syncope. Women with long QT syndrome type 2 are at a higher risk of postpartum cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death and should receive pre‑pregnancy counseling. In LQTS with recurrent syncope while on a beta blocker, escalation of therapy is warranted to prevent sudden cardiac death.

### Diagnosis, management and therapeutic strategies for congenital long QT syndrome [^f71baf62]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterised by heart rate corrected QT interval prolongation and life-threatening arrhythmias, leading to syncope and sudden death. Variations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels, accessory ion channel subunits or proteins modulating the function of the ion channel have been identified as disease-causing mutations in up to 75% of all LQTS cases. Based on the underlying genetic defect, LQTS has been subdivided into different subtypes. Growing insights into the genetic background and pathophysiology of LQTS has led to the identification of genotype–phenotype relationships for the most common genetic subtypes, the recognition of genetic and non-genetic modifiers of phenotype, optimisation of risk stratification algorithms and the discovery of gene-specific therapies in LQTS. Nevertheless, despite these great advancements in the LQTS field, large gaps in knowledge still exist. For example, up to 25% of LQTS cases still remain genotype elusive, which hampers proper identification of family members at risk, and it is still largely unknown what determines the large variability in disease severity, where even within one family an identical mutation causes malignant arrhythmias in some carriers, while in other carriers, the disease is clinically silent. In this review, we summarise the current evidence available on the diagnosis, clinical management and therapeutic strategies in LQTS. We also discuss new scientific developments and areas of research, which are expected to increase our understanding of the complex genetic architecture in genotype-negative patients, lead to improved risk stratification in asymptomatic mutation carriers and more targeted (gene-specific and even mutation-specific) therapies.

### Long QT syndrome: how effective therapy in a single patient favorably influenced the long-term clinical course and genetic understanding of this hereditary disorder [^90244109]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The story of the long QT syndrome involved a chance interaction that took place in 1957 when Dr. Moss was shown a unique series of ECGs with a prolonged QT interval in a young deaf boy whose recurrent syncope culminated in sudden death. Who could have predicted that this clinical experience would lead to innovative and effective new therapy for a patient with the long QT syndrome several years later and the subsequent formation of the International Long QT Registry? This Registry has stimulated interactions among and between patients and physicians and has enhanced collaborations involving clinical, genetic, and basic-science investigators. The net result has been a significant improvement in the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of patients with the long QT syndrome and an overall advancement in the science of medicine - two of the many satisfactions that physicians can experience in the clinical practice of medicine.

Premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs) are relatively common, occurring in 3%-20% of the general population, and are often found during work-up of palpitations or incidentally on routine electrocardiographic testing. They are usually considered benign but can be a sign of underlying cardiac disease and cause significantly impairing symptoms. While often thought of as a problem for the cardiologist, it is not uncommon for PVCs to be identified initially in a primary care or inpatient general medicine setting. This paper will review etiologies, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of PVCs for the internist.

Congenital long QT syndrome—therapeutic management and thresholds: In patients with long QT syndrome with a resting QTc greater than 470 ms, a beta blocker is recommended. In high-risk patients with symptomatic long QT syndrome in whom a beta blocker is ineffective or not tolerated, intensification of therapy with additional medications (guided by consideration of the particular long QT syndrome type), left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and/or an ICD is recommended. In patients with long QT syndrome and recurrent appropriate ICD shocks despite maximum tolerated doses of a beta blocker, intensification of medical therapy with additional medications (guided by consideration of the particular long QT syndrome type) or left cardiac sympathetic denervation), is recommended. In asymptomatic patients with long QT syndrome and a resting QTc less than 470 ms, chronic therapy with a beta blocker is reasonable. In asymptomatic patients with long QT syndrome and a resting QTc greater than 500 ms while receiving a beta blocker, intensification of therapy with medications (guided by consideration of the particular long QT syndrome type), left cardiac sympathetic denervation or an ICD may be considered.

While published guidelines are useful in the care of patients with long-QT syndrome, it can be difficult to decide how to apply the guidelines to individual patients, particularly those with intermediate risk. We explored the diversity of opinion among 24 clinicians with expertise in long-QT syndrome. Experts from various regions and institutions were presented with 4 challenging clinical scenarios and asked to provide commentary emphasizing why they would make their treatment recommendations. All 24 authors were asked to vote on case-specific questions so as to demonstrate the degree of consensus or divergence of opinion. Of 24 authors, 23 voted and 1 abstained. Details of voting results with commentary are presented. There was consensus on several key points, particularly on the importance of the diagnostic evaluation and of β-blocker use. There was diversity of opinion about the appropriate use of other therapeutic measures in intermediate-risk individuals. Significant gaps in knowledge were identified.

### Congenital long QT syndrome [^f5e053f2]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) encompasses a group of heritable conditions that are associated with cardiac repolarization dysfunction. Since its initial description in 1957, our understanding of LQTS has increased dramatically. The prevalence of LQTS is estimated to be ∼1:2,000, with a slight female predominance. The diagnosis of LQTS is based on clinical, electrocardiogram, and genetic factors. Risk stratification of patients with LQTS aims to identify those who are at increased risk of cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death. Factors including age, sex, QTc interval, and genetic background all contribute to current risk stratification paradigms. The management of LQTS involves conservative measures such as the avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs, pharmacologic measures with nonselective β-blockers, and interventional approaches such as device therapy or left cardiac sympathetic denervation. In general, most forms of exercise are considered safe in adequately treated patients, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is reserved for those at the highest risk. This review summarizes our current understanding of LQTS and provides clinicians with a practical approach to diagnosis and management.

Premature ventricular contractions—morphology/location triggers for further work-up and malignant patterns: The demonstration of PVCs of differing morphologies from the right ventricle in patients with normal left ventricular function should prompt investigations to rule out arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with right ventricular dominance or sarcoidosis, and multifocal PVCs of left ventricular origin should trigger investigations for non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Short-coupled PVCs lying on the T wave may indicate polymorphic VT/VF in settings such as ischaemia, electrolyte abnormalities, underlying long QT syndrome, or early repolarization syndrome; when present, this malignant electrical presentation mandates aggressive treatment, possibly ablation, and in some an implantable defibrillator may be indicated.

Women with the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS)—risk patterns and ICD consideration: In women with the congenital LQTS, the risk of cardiac arrest is greater during the postpartum period compared with before or during pregnancy, and the relative tachycardia seen during pregnancy may serve to shorten the QT interval and be protective. Beta blockers can generally be used safely during pregnancy, and use during pregnancy is generally well tolerated by both the mother and the fetus, although a decrease in fetal heart rate can be seen. Multiple observations indicate increased susceptibility in women: the incidence of both congenital and acquired long QT and resultant torsades de pointes is higher in women than in men; in the Long QT Registry, 70% of the subjects and 58% of affected family members are women; and until puberty, males were more likely than females to have cardiac arrest or syncope, with potentially fatal events subsequently predominating in females. Drug-induced torsades de pointes is more common in women than in men. For high-risk patients, ICD therapy should be strongly considered in patients with long-term QT syndromes who are drug resistant and those with marked potential for life-threatening arrhythmias.

In patients with short QT syndrome and recurrent sustained ventricular arrhythmia, treatment with quinidine can be useful. In patients with short QT syndrome and VT/ VF storm, isoproterenol infusion can be effective.

In asymptomatic LQTS with a resting QTc less than 470 ms, chronic beta-blocker therapy is reasonable. In asymptomatic LQTS with a resting QTc greater than 500 ms while receiving a beta blocker, intensification with medications, left cardiac sympathetic denervation, or an ICD may be considered.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) diagnosis—expert consensus criteria include age-stratified exercise/catecholamine-induced arrhythmias and genetic/family findings. CPVT is diagnosed in the presence of a structurally normal heart, normal electrocardiogram (ECG), and unexplained exercise or catecholamine-induced bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) or polymorphic ventricular premature beats or VT in an individual <40 years of age. CPVT is diagnosed in patients (index case or family member) who have a pathogenic mutation, and CPVT is diagnosed in family members of a CPVT index case with a normal heart who manifest exercise-induced premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or bidirectional/ polymorphic VT. CPVT can be diagnosed in the presence of a structurally normal heart and coronary arteries, normal ECG, and unexplained exercise or catecholamine-induced bidirectional VT or polymorphic ventricular premature beats or VT in an individual >40 years of age.

Long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes—electrolyte optimization and medication precautions include that intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes of torsades de pointes without necessarily shortening QT, repeated doses may be needed, and the risk of magnesium toxicity is very small with the doses usually used to treat torsades de pointes, 1 to 2 g intravenously; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 mEq/L and 5 mEq/L shortens QT and may reduce the chance of recurrent torsades de pointes. QT-prolonging medications are not used in patients with congenital or acquired long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative or the benefit greatly exceeds the risk, episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by exposure to a QT-prolonging medication with increased risk when the QT is already prolonged from genetic and clinical risk factors, and implicated medication classes include antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, antibiotics, antifungals, antidepressants, antipsychotics, opiates, and anticancer agents.

### Management of ventricular fibrillation or unstable ventricular tachycardia in patients with congenital long-QT syndrome: a suggested modification to ACLS guidelines [^c302aea9]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

Prolongation of the QT interval is a known risk factor for syncope, seizures and sudden cardiac death. Most patients with QT prolongation have an acquired cause, but congenital forms of QT prolongation are being increasingly recognized. However, existing advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) treatment algorithms for prolonged QT mediated ventricular fibrillation pertains to acquired long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Here, a young patient with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to congenital LQTS illustrates critical exceptions to the current ACLS treatment algorithms for ventricular fibrillation and unstable ventricular tachycardia when QT prolongation is congenital in origin. A clarified ACLS algorithm is proposed.

In this article, we will review various aspects of long QT syndrome (LQTS) necessary for hospitalists who care for children, adolescents, and young adults who have known LQTS and also review presenting features that should make one consider LQTS as a cause of hospitalization. Pediatric hospitalists care for patients who have suffered near-drowning, unexplained motor vehicular accidents, brief resolved unexpected events, sudden infant death syndrome, recurrent miscarriages, syncope, or seizures. These common conditions can be clinical clues in patients harboring 1 of 16 LQTS genetic mutations. LQTS is commonly caused by a channelopathy that can cause sudden cardiac death. Over the years, guidelines on management and recommendations for sports participation have evolved with our understanding of the disease and the burden of arrhythmias manifested in the pediatric age group. This review will include the genetic causes of LQTS, clinical features, and important historical information to obtain when these presentations are encountered. We will review medical and surgical treatments available to patients with LQTS and long-term care recommendations and prognosis for those diagnosed with LQTS.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^934d8282]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Management of QTc Prolongation

When a prolonged QTc interval is detected (>500 ms or an increase of >60 ms longer than baseline), the patient should be evaluated carefully, with discontinuation of all offending drugs immediately (if appropriate). Strategies previously discussed to identify causes of QTc prolongation should be considered. Patients who experience associated syncope or presyncope, palpitations, or QTc >500 ms and/or bradycardia (HR, <60 bpm) should be evaluated immediately in a monitored setting. An ECG should be repeated every 24 hours until resolution of QTc prolongation is confirmed. A prolonged QTc increases the risk of a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia called TdP (Figure 4 A). Most of the data on the risk of TdP in relation to QTc prolongation are from large registries of patients with congenital long QT syndromes. 193, 194 These data show that each 10‐ms increase in QTc contributes approximately a 5% to 7% increase in risk for cardiac events, including syncope, cardiac arrest, and/or death. Other risk factors for TdP beyond QTc have been described in settings outside of cancer therapy (Table 5) and, thus, the extrapolation to the cancer population is less clear. 195 Although some medications are associated with QTc prolongation, not all drugs that prolong the QTc cause TdP. Therefore, the risk assessment of TdP attributable to drugs should not only be based on QTc alone but considered in the context of other predisposing TdP risk factors. 196 Recurrence of TdP is frequent and, hence, the occurrence of a single event mandates urgent clinical evaluation and monitoring.

B, Rhythm strip of a patient with prolonged corrected QT of 580 ms with frequent ventricular complexes of different morphological features (*) and triplets (**) indicating electrical instability and high risk of developing TdP.

Table 5 
Clinical Risk Factors of TdP

Drugs for correcting prolonged QTc should be started if worrisome ECG signs of TdP exist (eg, frequent ventricular premature beats or short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) or if TdP develops (asymptomatic or symptomatic). Premonitory and worrisome signs for TdP are prolonged QTc (>500 ms), severe aberration of the T‐U segment, beat‐to‐beat instability (more marked aberration of the T wave after a long R‐R interval), and/or frequent ventricular premature beats (Figure 4 B). Patients with such abnormalities should be admitted to a cardiac care unit. The first‐line treatment is magnesium sulfate, given intravenously with repeated doses if signs of electric instability persist. Next is the initiation of a β‐adrenergic drug, such as isoproterenol, titrated to obtain an HR of >100 bpm with careful evaluation of the response, because patients with inherited congenital long QT syndrome could experience worsening symptoms. The role of antiarrhythmic therapies is less well established, but in case of refractory TdP, lidocaine infusion can be considered. 197

Temporary ventricular or atrial pacing at 100 to 120 bpm should be considered if the patient is refractory to the previous measures. If the patient has a preexisting pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator system, changes in the lower rates can have the same protective effects. This measure leads to the disappearance of virtually all ventricular arrhythmias. 198

Cardiac channelopathies—family screening and ECG limitations: Clinical screening of first-degree relatives of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes is crucial to identifying affected family members, and targeted screening for the identified family-specific mutation can identify individuals who are at risk for adverse outcomes in genotype positive long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. Screening electrocardiograms (ECGs) may be insufficient because the resting ECG in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is normal, and as many as 25% of genotype-positive long QT syndrome patients have QTc intervals ≤440 ms. Screening infants and young children is particularly important, including avoidance of possible proarrhythmic medications (www.crediblemeds.org). Because up to 15% of mutations previously associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia do not appear to cause disease, caution is advised to avoid unnecessary treatment or sports restriction in phenotype-negative mutation-positive individuals, and some patients may prefer not to undergo genetic testing so genetic counseling should focus on this issue.

### Long QT syndrome and anaesthesia [^4acb75ca]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

The long QT syndrome is a disorder of myocardial electrical conduction that leaves the heart vulnerable to the ventricular tachydysrhythmia torsade de pointes. Clinically, this results in syncope or sudden death. The long QT syndrome may be congenital, if caused by abnormal myocardial potassium or sodium ion channels, or acquired, if due to drugs, electrolyte abnormalities or metabolic conditions. Triggers for the development of torsade de pointes include both anaesthesia and surgery. Some anaesthetic agents prolong the QT interval. The condition is reviewed and suggestions are made for the anaesthetic management of affected patients.

Discussion

This study represents the only study to date investigating the utility of ILRs in pediatric patients across all inherited arrhythmia syndromes. There are several novel findings from this study. First, symptoms in this patient population do not correlate well with arrhythmic events. Additionally, automatic transmissions were important in detecting subclinical arrhythmias. These data influenced clinical decision making regarding medication titration, addition of medication, medication compliance, and titrating activity levels. Lastly, variants of unknown significance need to be interpreted carefully in the context of the clinical picture and clinician index of suspicion, which are important in guiding decision making.

Important implications arise from these findings. The long QT syndrome patient cohort had the largest number of symptoms transmissions (19 symptoms +/− automatic transmissions/34 total transmissions, 56%) with only 1 symptom tracing (5%) leading to titration in medication regimen. The remaining 95% of symptom events in the long QT population were not associated with arrhythmia. Through the entire cohort of patients, 90% of symptomatic transmissions demonstrated normal sinus rhythm/sinus tachycardia (74%) or minimal rhythm abnormalities such as isolated premature ventricular contractions (16%). Given that the majority of symptom‐driven transmissions were not actionable or lethal arrhythmias, symptoms are not reliable markers for escalation of therapy or guidance around activity. Current practices when caring for these children often includes incorporating symptoms into risk stratification algorithms. ILR data demonstrate that symptoms in this population may not be reliable surrogates for arrhythmia.

Long QT syndrome—exercise testing findings and beta-blocker monitoring: Among patients with borderline-to-normal resting QTc intervals, prolongation of the 4-minute recovery QTc ≥445 ms had high sensitivity for correctly identifying long QT syndrome, and in younger patients QTc prolongation >460 ms at 7 minutes of recovery predicted long QT syndrome type 1 or type 2 versus controls. Monitoring adequacy of beta-blocker therapy using exercise testing can be beneficial, and beta-blocker therapy may be associated with a decrease in supine and peak exercise QTc, with the exception of long QT syndrome type 1 patients with C-loop mutations.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) therapy—implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD) indications and programming: ICD therapy is indicated in LQTS patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest, and ICD is often favored in LQTS‑related syncope on beta‑blockers; prophylactic ICD therapy should be considered in very‑high‑risk patients such as symptomatic patients with two or more gene mutations including Jervell and Lange‑Nielsen, whereas LQTS‑related sudden death in a family member is not an indication for ICD in surviving relatives unless they have an individual high‑risk profile. Figure‑based consensus pathways specify: “Prior cardiac arrest? Yes ICD recommended”; “Recurrent syncope while on beta blocker? Yes ICD can be useful”; and “Asymptomatic not treated with beta blockers Yes ICD is not indicated*,” with the footnote stating that except under special circumstances, ICD implantation is not indicated in asymptomatic patients who have not been tried on beta‑blocker therapy. Considering complications, we recommend caution in asymptomatic patients, we suggest that ICD therapy not be used as first‑line therapy in an asymptomatic LQTS patient, an ICD may be considered in those deemed very high risk (especially with a contraindication to beta‑blockers), decisions should weigh risks, benefits, and patient values, and when chosen, programming usually requires a VF‑only zone with a cutoff rate greater than 220–240 bpm.

### Prolonged QTc interval and risks of total and cardiovascular mortality and sudden death in the general population (...) [^c6f2199d]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

The QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram represents the time from onset of ventricular depolarization to completion of repolarization. 1 Since the QT interval varies with heart rate, several methods, most commonly the Bazzett formula, 2 are used to yield a corrected measure. Abnormalities of repolarization are associated with a specific ventricular arrhythmia—torsade de pointes—that may trigger ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. The QTc interval can be prolonged because of genetic abnormalities of the potassium or sodium channels of the cardiac cells, resulting in intrinsic repolarization disturbances associated with fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome present with dizziness, syncopes, or seizures, but cardiac arrest or sudden death may be the first symptom in as many as 13% of untreated patients.
3.

We conducted a literature search from 1990 forward to identify all published prospective cohort studies evaluating the association between prolonged QTc interval and risks of total and cardiovascular mortality as well as sudden death. We reviewed each of the studies individually and then conducted a qualitative overview. In most studies, a prolonged QTc interval was defined as 440 milliseconds or greater. In contrast, the QTc interval of the reference group was not consistent, ranging from 360 to 440 milliseconds. In general, data relate a single measurement of QTc interval based on a single ECG to clinical outcomes observed during succeeding years of follow-up. In the Rotterdam QT project, 7 6693 consecutive patients underwent a 24-hour ambulatory ECG to examine the association between QTc interval and sudden death. Of these, 245 died suddenly.

The QTc interval was determined using a 12-lead ECG in the individuals who died suddenly as well as in a random sample of 467 patients from the study cohort. At 2 years of follow-up, there was a significant, approximately 2-fold increase in risk of sudden death in participants with a QTc interval of 440 milliseconds or greater compared with those with a QTc interval of less than 440 milliseconds. When subgroups with and without evidence of left ventricular dysfunction at baseline were analyzed separately, the observed association was confined to individuals without evidence of left ventricular dysfunction.

### Evaluation and management of premature ventricular complexes [^750fd305]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are extremely common, found in the majority of individuals undergoing long-term ambulatory monitoring. Increasing age, a taller height, a higher blood pressure, a history of heart disease, performance of less physical activity, and smoking each predict a greater PVC frequency. Although the fundamental causes of PVCs remain largely unknown, potential mechanisms for any given PVC include triggered activity, automaticity, and reentry. PVCs are commonly asymptomatic but can also result in palpitations, dyspnea, presyncope, and fatigue. The history, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG are each critical to the diagnosis and evaluation of a PVC. An echocardiogram is indicated in the presence of symptoms or particularly frequent PVCs, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is helpful when the evaluation suggests the presence of associated structural heart disease. Ambulatory monitoring is required to assess PVC frequency. The prognosis of those with PVCs is variable, with ongoing uncertainty regarding the most informative predictors of adverse outcomes. An increased PVC frequency may be a risk factor for heart failure and death, and the resolution of systolic dysfunction after successful catheter ablation of PVCs demonstrates that a causal relationship can be present. Patients with no or mild symptoms, a low PVC burden, and normal ventricular function may be best served with simple reassurance. Either medical treatment or catheter ablation are considered first-line therapies in most patients with PVCs associated with symptoms or a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and patient preference plays a role in determining which to try first. If medical treatment is selected, either β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reasonable drugs in patients with normal ventricular systolic function. Other antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered if those initial drugs fail and ablation has been declined, has been unsuccessful, or has been deemed inappropriate. Catheter ablation is the most efficacious approach to eradicate PVCs but may confer increased upfront risks. Original research remains necessary to identify individuals at risk for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and to identify preventative and therapeutic approaches targeting the root causes of PVCs to maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk.

### QTc: how long is too long? [^e3f00cde]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) affects an estimated 1 in 2500 people and typically presents with syncope, seizures or sudden death. Whereas someone exhibiting marked prolongation of the QT interval with QTc exceeding 500 ms who was just externally defibrillated from torsades de pointes while swimming poses negligible diagnostic challenge as to the unequivocal probability of LQTS, the certainty is considerably less for the otherwise asymptomatic person who happens to host a QTc value coined "borderline" (QTc > or = 440 ms). Although a normal QT interval imparts a much lower risk of life-threatening events, it does not preclude a patient from nevertheless harbouring a potentially lethal LQTS-causing genetic mutation. Indeed, genetic testing exerts significant diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. However, the 12-lead ECG remains the universal initial diagnostic test in the evaluation of LQTS and is subject to miscalculation, misinterpretation and mishandling. This review discusses the components of accurate QTc measurement and diagnosis, re-examines what is known about factors affecting QT interval measurement, and clarifies current recommendations regarding diagnosis of so-called "borderline" QT interval prolongation. The current guideline recommendations for the athlete with LQTS are also summarised.

Long QT syndrome—left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) and ICD outcomes and considerations are summarized as follows: “In high-risk patients, observational studies support effectiveness of the ICD in preventing SCD, with consideration of left cardiac sympathetic denervation to reduce the frequency of ICD shocks.” LCSD “can reduce VA burden, but up to 27% of high-risk patients experience at least 1 recurrence,” and “may be more effective in patients with long QT syndrome type 1 and long QT syndrome type 3.” Procedural “complications related to left cardiac sympathetic denervation occur in 8% to 20% of patients.” The page notes “recurrent syncope or cardiac arrest reported in 7% to 24% of patients,” that syncope may reflect “vasovagal syncope, noncompliance with medications, or proarrhythmia from concurrent medications,” and emphasizes that a “clinical evaluation that incorporates consideration of genotype, QTc interval, medication compliance, and shared decision-making regarding the need to change or escalate therapy is important,” with “use of additional medications” guided by LQTS type.

Attention to the triggers and presence of palpitations preceding syncope onset have been helpful in diagnosing an arrhythmic etiology, and patients with LQTS and syncope should adhere to the lifestyle changes previously published, including avoidance of strenuous activity in LQTS1, and drugs known to prolong QT interval in all patients with LQTS.

Clinical Case

A 66-year-old female with a past medical history significant for acute myeloid leukemia, prior transient ischemic attack, hypertension, and hypothyroidism presented to the hospital with dizziness and falls. At the time of presentation, she was noted to have slurred speech and gait instability. She denied any loss of consciousness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Her initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions and a QT interval, corrected for heart rate (QTc) of 487 ms. An ECG 2 months earlier showed a QTc of 455 ms.

How do we diagnose QT prolongation?

The QTc represents the time between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. On a standard 12-lead ECG, this measurement is usually taken from limb lead II and precordial lead V 5 measuring from the beginning of the Q wave to the termination of the T-wave. The QT interval adjusts to heart rate and different formulas have been used to correct the QT interval. The Bazett (QTcB = QT/RR 1/2) formula assumes an exponential relationship between the QT interval and the R to R interval. Bazett’s correction is most useful for heart rates between 60 and 100 beats/min with inaccuracies at slower (with overcorrection) and faster (with undercorrection) heart rates. The Fridericia formula (QTcF = QT/RR 1/3) is similar, but has greater accuracy at faster heart rates. Linear formulas such as the Framingham (QTcFra = QT + 0.154 [1 − RR]) and Hodges (QTcH = QT + 0.00175 [(60 / RR) − 60]) have more uniform correction for heart rates above 90 beats/min, but are less commonly used.

### HRS / EHRA / APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes: document endorsed by HRS, EHRA, and APHRS in may 2013 and by ACCF, AHA, PACES, and AEPC in June 2013 [^ed7d5c6a]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) risk stratification identifies high risk whenever QTc > 500 ms and extremely high when QTc > 600 ms; patients with two unequivocally pathogenic variants and a QTc > 500 ms are also at high risk, particularly if symptomatic. Overt T-wave alternans despite proper therapy is a direct sign of electrical instability and calls for preventive measures. Patients who have syncope or cardiac arrest before age 7 have a higher probability of recurrence while on beta-blockers, and those with events in the first year of life are at high risk for lethal events and may not be fully protected by traditional therapies; patients with first arrhythmic events despite full medical therapy are at higher risk. Low-risk identification includes concealed mutation-positive patients who are at low, but not zero, risk, with an estimated arrhythmic event risk around 10% between birth and age 40 in the absence of therapy; in asymptomatic genetically diagnosed LQTS, a major risk factor is exposure to drugs that block the IKr current and conditions that lower plasma potassium level.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^fd84b742]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Long-QT syndrome—diagnosis and syncope considerations state that “LQTS is diagnosed in the presence of QTc ≥500 ms or LQTS risk score ≥3.5 when secondary causes have been excluded or in the presence of a pathogenic mutation in 1 of the LQTS genes,” and “It can also be diagnosed when the QTc is 480 to 499 ms in a patient presenting with syncope.” The text adds that “Given that syncope is often the result of an arrhythmic event in patients with LQTS, early recognition and treatment are needed to avoid recurrences, which could present as cardiac arrest or SCD,” highlighting pediatrics: “This is particularly true in the pediatric population, where significant overlap exists in the clinical presentation of patients with VVS and arrhythmic syncope,” and lifestyle guidance: “Patients with LQTS and syncope should adhere to the lifestyle changes previously published, including avoidance of strenuous activity in LQTS1, and drugs known to prolong QT interval in all patients with LQTS.”

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF)—Class of Recommendation (COR) I, Level of Evidence (LOE) B-NR actions state: In young patients (<40 years of age) with unexplained sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), unexplained near drowning, or recurrent exertional syncope without ischemic or other structural heart disease, further evaluation for genetic arrhythmia syndromes is recommended (COR I, LOE B-NR); in patients resuscitated from SCA due to idiopathic polymorphic VT or VF, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected (COR I, LOE B-NR); and for patients with recurrent episodes of idiopathic VF initiated by premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with a consistent QRS morphology, catheter ablation is useful (COR I, LOE B-NR).
