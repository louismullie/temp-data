## Question

There is specifically controversy about the use of hemicraniectomy for dominant hemisphere CVA can you show me an research to support this

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the controversy surrounding the use of decompressive hemicraniectomy for dominant-hemisphere malignant MCA infarction, specifically seeking research evidence to support or clarify this issue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and why dominant-hemisphere strokes are different. Then, I should verify the core evidence from randomized trials and pooled analyses. Next, I will examine the specific controversy about aphasia, quality of life, and acceptable disability. After that, I should review guideline statements and real-world practice patterns. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced clinical approach and highlight knowledge gaps that still need research.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why dominant-hemisphere strokes raise unique concerns. Malignant MCA infarction carries mortality up to roughly 80% without surgery, and decompressive hemicraniectomy clearly reduces mortality and increases survival across ages, but survivors often face substantial disability, which is where the controversy intensifies in dominant-hemisphere disease due to the high likelihood of persistent aphasia and its impact on quality of life and autonomy [^114nJVdD] [^113hEx2H] [^114TMVCU].

> I need to check the highest-quality evidence base next. The pooled randomized data, including DECIMAL, DESTINY, and HAMLET, show that early hemicraniectomy within 48 hours reduces death and increases the chance of favorable functional outcomes, with a number needed to treat of about 2 for survival and about 4 for avoiding poor outcomes, and importantly, the benefit appears consistent across subgroups including dominant versus non-dominant hemispheres, although the proportion achieving independence remains limited in older adults [^113hEx2H] [^112Bn3Ne] [^116yMQmA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about equivalence of outcomes by hemisphere. While pooled analyses suggest benefit irrespective of side, the dominant-hemisphere controversy is less about mortality and more about the acceptability of surviving with moderate-to-severe disability plus aphasia, which the mRS does not capture well and which many patients and clinicians rate as a state comparable to or worse than death, especially when communication and self-care are profoundly impaired [^113e7niz] [^112dcBjT].

> Let me consider the aphasia-specific data. Small series and retrospective cohorts suggest that meaningful recovery of language function can occur after dominant-hemisphere hemicraniectomy, particularly in younger patients and with earlier surgery, but these are uncontrolled and selection-biased. Conversely, neuropsychological follow-up from HAMLET shows very high rates of global cognitive impairment among survivors, with aphasia further limiting assessment and likely worsening perceived quality of life, reinforcing the concern that survival may come at the cost of unacceptable disability for some patients [^114MLsjf] [^112jEdPp] [^114RxhoR].

> I should double-check how guidelines frame this. Contemporary European and U.S. guidelines recommend decompressive hemicraniectomy for adults up to 60 years within 48 hours and allow consideration in older patients, but they also emphasize shared decision-making because many survivors, especially older adults, have substantial dependency. Notably, there is no recommendation to withhold surgery solely due to dominant-hemisphere involvement, though the quality of evidence for dominance-specific outcomes is low and the ethical trade-offs are explicitly highlighted [^116sxS3a] [^114Z2GzS] [^113s4A1W] [^111ia6mC].

> Next, I should review real-world attitudes and practice patterns that shape decisions. Surveys of physicians and nurses show marked divergence in what constitutes acceptable disability, with hemisphere dominance influencing treatment preferences; many clinicians are less inclined to offer hemicraniectomy for dominant-hemisphere strokes because of anticipated aphasia, even though this inclination is not fully supported by trial subgroup data, underscoring a disconnect between evidence and values-based decision-making [^115kbeqX] [^112hTX7m] [^113sEYim].

> Let me synthesize the controversy clinically. The core tension is that hemicraniectomy reliably saves lives across hemispheres, but dominant-hemisphere survivors are disproportionately likely to live with moderate-to-severe disability and aphasia, a state many patients prospectively deem unacceptable. Retrospective quality-of-life studies and patient surveys suggest many survivors still value life and do not regret surgery, but selection and response biases complicate interpretation, and the mRS inadequately captures communication deficits central to this debate [^113e7niz] [^1148xFpv] [^112dcBjT].

> I need to ensure the decision framework is explicit. For patients 60 years or younger, strong evidence supports offering hemicraniectomy within 48 hours after discussing the high likelihood of survival with disability and the particular risk of persistent aphasia. For patients older than 60, evidence supports improved survival but with very high rates of severe dependency, so decisions should hinge on patient and family values, ideally using structured tools and early goals-of-care conversations to align treatment with acceptable outcome states [^116sxS3a] [^114Z2GzS] [^113s4A1W] [^114JxzQw].

> But wait, what about timing and infarct volume, which can modify expectations even in dominant-hemisphere cases. Earlier decompression, ideally before herniation signs, is associated with better outcomes, and larger preoperative infarct volumes independently predict unfavorable outcomes; these factors should be integrated into counseling, recognizing that very large infarcts in the dominant hemisphere may yield a higher probability of severe disability even with timely surgery [^112HyDMw] [^114MxH33] [^1141UC6S].

> I should confirm practical steps that mitigate bias in counseling. Use plain language to explain that survival is likely but independence is uncommon in older survivors, explicitly address aphasia and its implications for autonomy, and document preferences using POLST or similar frameworks when appropriate. Involve speech-language pathology early to help families anticipate communication rehabilitation needs and to structure realistic expectations about recovery trajectories [^114JxzQw] [^113e7niz].

> Finally, let me reconsider the research gaps so we do not overstate certainty. We lack high-quality, prospective data on long-term aphasia recovery, quality of life, and caregiver burden specific to dominant-hemisphere survivors. Existing cognitive studies are small, heterogeneous, and often exclude aphasic patients, and current outcome measures are insensitive to communication disability, highlighting the need for dominance-specific longitudinal cohorts and patient-centered outcome instruments that better reflect what survivors value most [^114RxhoR] [^1123gVjZ] [^112dcBjT].

The controversy over hemicraniectomy in dominant-hemisphere stroke centers on **aphasia and cognitive disability** [^114MLsjf] in survivors, even though surgery reduces mortality [^113hEx2H]. Early surgery within 48 hours [^116sxS3a] improves survival and functional outcomes [^116sxS3a], but many survivors have moderate-to-severe disability [^114TMVCU], especially with dominant-hemisphere infarcts [^115VQmGh]. Guidelines support hemicraniectomy in selected patients [^116sxS3a], but decisions should weigh aphasia risk, patient preferences, and timing [^112dcBjT]. Evidence does not show a clear difference in benefit by hemisphere [^113hEx2H], but aphasia significantly impairs quality of life, fueling ethical debates and the need for shared decision-making [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting hemicraniectomy in dominant-hemisphere stroke

- **Mortality benefit**: Randomized trials and meta-analyses show hemicraniectomy reduces mortality in large hemispheric infarctions, including dominant-hemisphere strokes [^113hEx2H] [^112Bn3Ne].

- **Functional outcomes**: Early surgery (within 48 hours) [^112HyDMw] improves functional outcomes, but many survivors have moderate-to-severe disability, particularly with dominant-hemisphere infarcts [^114TMVCU].

- **Aphasia recovery**: Some studies report meaningful aphasia recovery after dominant-hemisphere hemicraniectomy, especially in younger patients and with early surgery [^114MLsjf] [^112jEdPp].

---

## Controversies and ethical considerations

- **Quality of life**: Survivors of dominant-hemisphere strokes often face significant communication deficits, cognitive impairment, and reduced independence, raising questions about quality of life and the value of survival with severe disability [^113e7niz] [^1148xFpv].

- **Patient preferences**: Many patients and families prioritize survival, even with disability, but others consider severe aphasia or cognitive impairment unacceptable, underscoring the need for shared decision-making [^113e7niz] [^112dcBjT].

- **Timing of surgery**: Early intervention (within 48 hours) [^116sxS3a] is critical for optimal outcomes, but rapid decision-making can limit informed consent and complicate ethical deliberations [^113e7niz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and the European Stroke Organisation recommend hemicraniectomy for **selected patients** with large hemispheric infarctions, including dominant-hemisphere strokes, within 48 hours of onset [^116yMQmA] [^116sxS3a]. They emphasize **individualized decision-making** that considers patient age, infarct size, neurological status, and patient/family preferences [^116QeJ34] [^1141daBS] [^113sEYim] [^112dcBjT].

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Evidence supporting hemicraniectomy** | **Controversies/limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Mortality | Significant reduction in mortality (absolute risk reduction ~50%) [^114Z2GzS] | None significant |
| Functional outcome | Improved functional outcomes, but many survivors have moderate-to-severe disability [^112Bn3Ne] | High rate of disability, especially in dominant-hemisphere strokes [^115VQmGh] |
| Aphasia recovery | Some recovery reported, especially in younger patients and with early surgery [^114MLsjf] | Many survivors have persistent aphasia, impacting quality of life [^notfound] |
| Ethical considerations | Survival benefit is clear [^113hEx2H] | Quality of life with severe disability (especially aphasia) is a major concern [^117Sv2qH] |

Hemicraniectomy in dominant-hemisphere stroke reduces mortality and can improve functional outcomes, but many survivors have **moderate-to-severe disability**, particularly with aphasia. The decision to operate should be individualized, incorporating patient preferences, timing, and ethical considerations [^112Bn3Ne].

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy: predictors of functional outcome in patients with ischemic stroke [^115VQmGh]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECT Patients presenting with large-territory ischemic strokes may develop intractable cerebral edema that puts them at risk of death unless intervention is performed. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of outcome for decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) in ischemic stroke. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective electronic medical record review of 1624 patients from 2006 to 2014. Subjects were screened for DH secondary to ischemic stroke involving the middle cerebral artery, internal carotid artery, or both. Ninety-five individuals were identified. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for an array of clinical variables in relationship to functional outcome according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Clinical outcome was assessed at 90 days and at the latest follow-up (mean duration 16.5 months). RESULTS The mean mRS score at 90 days and at the latest follow-up post-DH was 4. Good functional outcome was observed in 40% of patients at 90 days and in 48% of patient at the latest follow-up. The mortality rate at 90 days was 18% and at the last follow-up 20%. Univariate analysis identified a greater likelihood of poor functional outcome (mRS scores of 4–6) in patients with a history of stroke (OR 6.54 [95% CI1.39–30.66]; p = 0.017), peak midline shift (MLS) > 10 mm (OR 3.35 [95% CI 1.33–8.47]; p = 0.011), or a history of myocardial infarction (OR 8.95 [95% CI1.10–72.76]; p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis demonstrated elevated odds of poor functional outcome associated with a history of stroke (OR 9.14 [95% CI 1.78–47.05]; p = 0.008), MLS > 10 mm (OR 5.15 [95% CI 1.58–16.79; p = 0.007), a history of diabetes (OR 5.63 [95% CI 1.52–20.88]; p = 0.01), delayed time from onset of stroke to DH (OR 1.32 [95% CI 1.02–1.72]; p = 0.037), and evidence of pupillary dilation prior to DH (OR 4.19 [95% CI 1.06–16.51]; p = 0.04). Patients with infarction involving the dominant hemisphere had higher odds of unfavorable functional outcome at 90 days (OR 4.73 [95% CI 1.36–16.44]; p = 0.014), but at the latest follow-up, cerebral dominance was not significantly related to outcome (OR 1.63 [95% CI 0.61–4.34]; p = 0.328). CONCLUSIONS History of stroke, diabetes, myocardial infarction, peak MLS > 10 mm, increasing duration from onset of stroke to DH, and presence of pupillary dilation prior to intervention are associated with a worse functional outcome.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the management of large hemispheric infarction: a statement for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the German society for neuro-intensive care and emergency medicine [^111ia6mC]. Neurocritical Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Large hemispheric infarction — DHC timing, surgical parameters, dominance, and adjunct procedures are specified: There is currently insufficient data to recommend against DHC in LHI patients based on hemispheric dominance (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). To achieve the best neurological outcome, we recommend performing DHC within 24–48 h hours of symptom onset and prior to any herniation symptoms (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend a size of 12 cm as an absolute minimum for DHC. Larger sizes of 14–16 cm seem to be associated with better outcomes (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that lobectomy or duraplasty should only be considered as an individualized treatment option (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence), and we suggest that the resection of the temporal muscle should only be considered as an individualized treatment option (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^114hyd2e]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the absence of previous relevant studies focusing on post‐DH cognitive impairment, our results are not easily comparable to previous evidence. One study involving a sample as small as 20 patients undergoing DH for stroke on the nondominant hemisphere showed that almost all tested individuals had some degree of cognitive impairment. In a small study derived from the HAMLET trial involving 20 patients with large hemispheric strokes, half of patients who were able to undergo testing had impaired MMSE scores. The rate of cognitive impairment in our cohort, as assessed by MMSE, was substantial, with 46% of patients exhibiting impairment at least once during the 3‐year follow‐up, and approximately 1 in 3 patients showing impaired MMSE scores at each timepoint. This proportion seems in line with the estimated rate of 34% for incident dementia 1 year following severe (NIHSS > 10) stroke, as reported in a broad population study. However, it is equally noteworthy that more than 1 in 2 patients demonstrated preserved MMSE cognitive screening despite experiencing extensive hemispheric lesions; although our findings suggest some level of cognitive resilience in a portion of patients, it is important to note that the use of MMSE as a screening tool likely underestimated the prevalence of cognitive impairment. Therefore, more comprehensive cognitive assessments are recommended for a clearer understanding of long‐term outcomes.

Regarding long‐term temporal trends, we observed that approximately 1 in 3 patients experienced cognitive impairment at each follow‐up point, spanning up to 3 years after the index event. In our study, among the 51 of 95 patients who underwent cognitive screening at all three timepoints, there was only minimal transition between cognitive states during the extended follow‐up period (Figure 3). Although this slight variability could be attributed to fluctuating symptoms, the rate of cognitive impairment remained consistent across the three timepoints (Figure 2). Although cognitive outcomes have frequently been overlooked in prior studies on DH for large MCA ischemic strokes, our findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive evaluation — inclusive of cognitive testing — during long‐term follow‐up. Identifying cognitive symptoms could aid in establishing a personalized care and rehabilitation plan, thereby improving the quality of life for both patients and caregivers.

### Prior thrombectomy does not affect the surgical complication rate of decompressive hemicraniectomy in patients with malignant ischemic stroke [^111zbRzP]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Even though mechanical recanalization techniques have dramatically improved acute stroke care since the pivotal trials of decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant courses of ischemic stroke, decompressive hemicraniectomy remains a mainstay of malignant stroke treatment. However, it is still unclear whether prior thrombectomy, which in most cases is associated with application of antiplatelets and/or anticoagulants, affects the surgical complication rate of decompressive hemicraniectomy and whether conclusions derived from prior trials of decompressive hemicraniectomy are still valid in times of modern stroke care.

Methods

A total of 103 consecutive patients who received a decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction were evaluated in this retrospective cohort study. Surgical and functional outcomes of patients who had received mechanical recanalization before surgery (thrombectomy group, n = 49) and of patients who had not received mechanical recanalization (medical group, n = 54) were compared.

Results

The baseline characteristics of the two groups did significantly differ regarding preoperative systemic thrombolysis (63.3% in the thrombectomy group vs. 18.5% in the medical group, p < 0.001), the rate of hemorrhagic transformation (44.9% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.04) and the preoperative Glasgow Coma Score (median of 7 in the thrombectomy group vs. 12 in the medical group, p = 0.04) were similar to those of prior randomized controlled trials of decompressive hemicraniectomy. There was no significant difference in the rates of surgical complications (10.2% in the thrombectomy group vs. 11.1% in the medical group), revision surgery within the first 30 days after surgery (4.1% vs. 5.6%, respectively), and functional outcome (median modified Rankin Score of 4 at 5 and 14 months in both groups) between the two groups.

Conclusions

A prior mechanical recanalization with possibly associated systemic thrombolysis does not affect the early surgical complication rate and the functional outcome after decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant ischemic stroke. Patient characteristics have not changed significantly since the introduction of mechanical recanalization; therefore, the results from former large randomized controlled trials are still valid in the modern era of stroke care.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the management of large hemispheric infarction: a statement for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the German society for neuro-intensive care and emergency medicine [^114hUBWi]. Neurocritical Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Large hemispheric infarction — decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) efficacy is characterized by a phase 2 feasibility study showing a non-significant mortality reduction from 46% with medical therapy to 27% with surgery, and a pooled analysis of randomized trials in severe strokes with NIHSS > 16 randomized within 48 h showing survival rising from 29 to 78%, yielding an absolute risk reduction of 49% with a number needed to treat of 2; however, no significant functional improvement was observed when dichotomized to modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0–3 versus 4–6, and in some cases mortality reduction was offset by increased disability.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^1141daBS]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, cognitive screening is feasible and valuable for patients undergoing DH for right‐hemisphere large MCA ischemic strokes. The notable rate of cognitive impairment — with consistent temporal trends over 3‐year follow‐up — highlights the importance of cognitive assessment to enhance long‐term patient management.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the management of large hemispheric infarction: a statement for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the German society for neuro-intensive care and emergency medicine [^116QeJ34]. Neurocritical Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Large hemispheric infarction — decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) overall use and age considerations are addressed as follows: We recommend DHC as a potential therapy to improve survival after LHI regardless of patient age (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). In patients older than 60 years, we recommend taking in consideration patients and family wishes, since in this age group, DHC can reduce mortality rate but with a higher likelihood of being severely disabled (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and in those older than 60 years, most survivors had a substantial disability.

### Hemicraniectomy for large middle cerebral artery territory infarction: outcome in 19 patients [^112jEdPp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Large space-occupying middle cerebral artery infarction accounts for 10–15% of all supratentorial infarctions and carries a mortality of 50% to 80%. Hemicraniectomy may be useful when optimal medical management has failed.

Methods

Between June 1997 and June 2000, 19 patients who fulfilled the clinical and imaging criteria for large middle cerebral artery infarction underwent hemicraniectomy because of impending herniation despite best medical therapy. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) assessed neurological status on admission and at one week after surgery. At 3 month follow up, The Barthel Index (BI) and Rankin Scale (RS) were used to assess the functional outcome among survivors.

Results

There were 15 males and 4 females with a mean age of 46.5 years (range 27–76 years). Ten patients (53%) had dominant hemisphere stroke. The mean interval between stroke onset and surgery was 60.3 hours (range 20–103 hours). The mean NIHSS score before surgery was 20.5 (range 17–26) and 10.5 (range 6–22) after surgery. One patient (5.2%) died due to post-operative meningitis. At follow up, mean BI was 56.4 (range 25–90) and RS revealed severe handicap in 4 patients (21%). Patients under 50 years of age had a significantly better outcome with mean BI of 60.7 as compared to only 41.3 (p = < 0.048) in older patients. Speech function, especially comprehension improved in all patients with dominant hemisphere infarction.

Conclusion

These findings add to previous studies suggesting hemicraniectomy may be a useful procedure in patients with large middle cerebral artery territory infarction. The functional outcome is good in younger patients. A randomised controlled trial is required to substantiate these findings.

### Haemorrhage and hemicraniectomy: refining surgery for stroke [^11332vRC]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Intracerebral haemorrhage is a devastating cerebrovascular disease with no established treatment. Its course is often complicated by secondary haematoma expansion and perihemorrhagic oedema. Decompressive hemicraniectomy is effective in the treatment of space-occupying hemispheric ischaemic stroke. The purpose of this review is to assess the role of decompressive hemicraniectomy in intracerebral haemorrhage.

Recent Findings

After few small previous studies had suggested advantages by the combination of decompressive hemicraniectomy with haematoma removal, decompression on its own has been investigated within the last 5 years. Two case series and one case-control study in altogether 40 patients with severe spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage have shown mortality rates ranging from 13 to 25% and favourable outcome from 40 to 65%.

Summary

Decompressive hemicraniectomy appears to be a feasible and relatively well tolerated individual treatment option for selected patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. Data are insufficient to judge potential benefits in outcome. A randomized trial is justified and mandatory.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^116mjUkK]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite a slight trend toward older age and lower rates of deep MCA territory involvement in patients with cognitive impairment, we did not observe statistically significant differences in baseline clinical and radiological characteristics. The homogeneity of our patient population in terms of age, previous medical history, acute stroke characteristics, and treatment standards (a consequence of the recommendations for performing DH) makes it challenging to identify robust predictors for cognitive impairment. To date, current knowledge does not allow the identification of patients at high risk for cognitive decline during acute ischemic stroke phase; further research may yield additional insights into the complex nature of cognitive outcomes following DH for large MCA ischemic stroke.

At each follow‐up, cognitive impairment was associated with neurological severity and worse functional outcome. Given that all enrolled patients shared similar characteristics regarding stroke severity, we might hypothesize that cognitive function plays a pivotal role in shaping the functional status and long‐term outcomes of survivors. This hypothesis suggests that, upon discharge from rehabilitation, cognitive rehabilitation should be encouraged for individuals who have experienced large hemispheric strokes.

### Refractory intracranial hypertension: the role of decompressive craniectomy [^117HxCj8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is associated with worse outcomes after acute brain injury, and clinical guidelines advocate early treatment of intracranial hypertension. ICP-lowering therapies are usually administered in a stepwise manner, starting with safer first-line interventions, while reserving higher-risk options for patients with intractable intracranial hypertension. Decompressive craniectomy is a surgical procedure in which part of the skull is removed and the underlying dura opened to reduce brain swelling-related raised ICP; it can be performed as a primary or secondary procedure. After traumatic brain injury, secondary decompressive craniectomy is most commonly undertaken as a last-tier intervention in a patient with severe intracranial hypertension refractory to tiered escalation of ICP-lowering therapies. Although decompressive craniectomy has been used in a number of conditions, it has only been evaluated in randomized controlled trials after traumatic brain injury and acute ischemic stroke. After traumatic brain injury, decompressive craniectomy is associated with lower mortality compared to medical management but with higher rates of vegetative state or severe disability. In patients with stroke-related malignant hemispheric infarction, hemicraniectomy significantly decreases mortality and improves functional outcome in adults < 60 years of age. Surgery also reduces mortality in those > 60 years, but results in a higher proportion of severely disabled survivors compared to medical therapy in this age group. Decisions to recommend decompressive craniectomy must always be made not only in the context of its clinical indications but also after consideration of an individual patient's preferences and quality of life expectations. This narrative review discusses the management of intractable intracranial hypertension in adults, focusing on the role of decompressive craniectomy in patients with traumatic brain injury and acute ischemic stroke.

Abstract

Background and Purpose

Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) improves survival and functional outcome in large middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarcts. However, long‐term cognitive outcomes after DH remain underexplored. In a cohort of patients with large right‐hemisphere MCA infarction undergoing DH, we assessed the rates of long‐term cognitive impairment over 3‐year follow‐up.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated consecutive patients included in the Lille Decompressive Surgery Database (May 2005–April 2022) undergoing DH according to existing guidelines for large hemisphere MCA infarction. We included patients with right‐sided stroke and screened with the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) in at least one of the prespecified follow‐ups (3‐month, 1‐year, 3‐year). Cognitive impairment was defined as an MMSE score < 24. We included only right‐hemisphere strokes to avoid testing biases related to severe aphasia. We compared clinical and neuroimaging data in patients with and without cognitive impairment.

Results

Three hundred four patients underwent DH during the study period. Among 3‐month survivors, 95 had a right‐hemisphere stroke and underwent at least one cognitive screening (median age = 51 years, 56.8% men). Forty‐four patients (46.3%) exhibited cognitive impairment at least once during the 3‐year follow‐up. Baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between patients with and without cognitive impairment. Regarding long‐term temporal trends, cognitive impairment was observed in 23 of 76 (30.3%), 25 of 80 (31.3%), and 19 of 66 (28.8%) patients at 3‐month, 1‐year, and 3‐year follow‐up, respectively, and it was associated with higher rates of functional disability (all p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The persistently high rates of cognitive impairment after DH highlight the importance of cognitive monitoring to improve the long‐term management of survivors.

### Factors predicting prognosis after decompressive hemicraniectomy for hemispheric infarction [^115f8Kph]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The authors reviewed 42 consecutive cases of decompressive hemicraniectomy after hemispheric ischemic stroke to assess predictors of outcome. On univariate analysis, advanced age and history of hypertension were significantly associated with unfavorable outcome, whereas thrombolysis was protective. Side of infarction, pupillary nonreactivity, degree of preoperative midline shift, and timing of surgery did not predict outcome. On multivariate analysis, older age independently predicted poor recovery (odds ratio 2.9 per 10-year increase in age).

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on the management of space-occupying brain infarction [^116sxS3a]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Space-occupying brain oedema is a potentially life-threatening complication in the first days after large hemispheric or cerebellar infarction. Several treatment strategies for this complication are available, but the size and quality of the scientific evidence on which these strategies are based vary considerably. The aim of this Guideline document is to assist physicians in their management decisions when treating patients with space-occupying hemispheric or cerebellar infarction. These Guidelines were developed based on the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. A working group identified 13 relevant questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote evidence-based recommendations. An expert consensus statement was provided if not enough evidence was available to provide recommendations based on the GRADE approach. We found high-quality evidence to recommend surgical decompression to reduce the risk of death and to increase the chance of a favourable outcome in adult patients aged up to and including 60years with space-occupying hemispheric infarction who can be treated within 48hours of stroke onset, and low-quality evidence to support this treatment in older patients. There is continued uncertainty about the benefit and risks of surgical decompression in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction if this is done after the first 48hours. There is also continued uncertainty about the selection of patients with space-occupying cerebellar infarction for surgical decompression or drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. These Guidelines further provide details on the management of specific subgroups of patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction, on the value of monitoring of intracranial pressure, and on the benefits and risks of medical treatment options. We encourage new high-quality studies assessing the risks and benefits of different treatment strategies for patients with space-occupying brain infarction.

Large hemispheric infarction — temperature control recommendations include selective use of hypothermia with defined targets and durations. We suggest considering hypothermia as a treatment option in patients who are not eligible for surgical intervention (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). If hypothermia is considered, we suggest a target temperature of 33–36 °C for duration of 24–72 h (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest maintaining normal core body temperature (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Supporting context notes that hypothermia was found to significantly reduce ICP in patients with LHI but is not as effective as hemicraniectomy, evidence quality is low, and potential side effects include pneumonia and coagulopathy.

Background and Purpose

Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) improves survival and functional outcome in large middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarcts. However, long-term cognitive outcomes after DH remain underexplored. In a cohort of patients with large right-hemisphere MCA infarction undergoing DH, we assessed the rates of long-term cognitive impairment over 3-year follow-up.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated consecutive patients included in the Lille Decompressive Surgery Database (May 2005-April 2022) undergoing DH according to existing guidelines for large hemisphere MCA infarction. We included patients with right-sided stroke and screened with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in at least one of the prespecified follow-ups (3-month, 1-year, 3-year). Cognitive impairment was defined as an MMSE score < 24. We included only right-hemisphere strokes to avoid testing biases related to severe aphasia. We compared clinical and neuroimaging data in patients with and without cognitive impairment.

Results

Three hundred four patients underwent DH during the study period. Among 3-month survivors, 95 had a right-hemisphere stroke and underwent at least one cognitive screening (median age = 51years, 56.8% men). Forty-four patients (46.3%) exhibited cognitive impairment at least once during the 3-year follow-up. Baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between patients with and without cognitive impairment. Regarding long-term temporal trends, cognitive impairment was observed in 23 of 76 (30.3%), 25 of 80 (31.3%), and 19 of 66 (28.8%) patients at 3-month, 1-year, and 3-year follow-up, respectively, and it was associated with higher rates of functional disability (all p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The persistently high rates of cognitive impairment after DH highlight the importance of cognitive monitoring to improve the long-term management of survivors.

### Prophylaxis of venous thrombosis in neurocritical care patients: an evidence-based guideline: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^111cWTPq]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients with ischemic stroke — risk and efficacy data indicate that PE occurs in up to 2.5% of all ischemic stroke patients, and in the first 3 months after stroke, DVT and PE occur with an incidence of 2.5 and 1.2%, respectively. In the CLOTS 3 trial, there was an absolute risk reduction of VTE of 3.6% (95% CI 1.4–5.8%) with the use of IPC beginning 0–3 days post-stroke. In the PREVAIL study, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) reduced the risk of VTE by 43% compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.44–0.76, p = 0.0001). In general, the risk of serious bleeding complications is low in hospitalized ischemic stroke patients treated with LMWH and UFH, and in procedural contexts involving rTPA or hemicraniectomy, waiting 24 hours after the administration of rTPA or hemicraniectomy may be warranted although specific recommendations are not supported by strong clinical evidence.

### Risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with large hemispheric infarction undergoing decompressive hemicraniectomy [^1179NJnJ]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Deep-venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This study is the first to examine the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with large hemispheric infarction undergoing decompressive hemicraniectomy.

Methods

The study population included 95 consecutive patients with a large hemispheric infarction who underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy between 2006 and 2014 at our institution. All patients received prophylactic unfractionated heparin and intermittent compression devices (SCD). Patients were systematically screened for DVT at 5-day interval using Duplex ultrasound. PE was diagnosed on chest CT angiography.

Results

Mean age was 57 ± 12 years; mean BMI was 28.3 ± 7.4 kg/m(2). 30.5% of patients had infarction in the dominant hemisphere and 69.5% in the non-dominant hemisphere. The mean NIHSS score was 16.0 ± 5 at admission. The mean length of stay was 22 ± 17 days. 35% of patients developed a DVT including 27% who developed above-knee DVT and required placement of an inferior vena cava filter. In multivariable analysis, predictors of DVT were an NIHSS ≥ 17 (p = 0.007), seizures (p = 0.003), hypertension (p = 0.03), and increasing length of stay (p = 0.01). The proportion of patients who developed PE was 13%. In multivariate analysis, BMI ≥ 30 predicted PE (p = 0.05).

Conclusions

The rate of DVT and PE is remarkably high in patients with large hemispheric infarction undergoing decompressive hemicraniectomy despite prophylactic measures. We recommend routine screening for DVT in this population. Interventions beyond the standard prophylactic measures may be necessary in this high-risk group.

### Recovery from aphasia after hemicraniectomy for infarction of the speech-dominant hemisphere [^114MLsjf]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The space-occupying effect of cerebral edema limits survival chances of patients with severe ischemic stroke. Besides conventional therapies to reduce intracranial pressure, hemicraniectomy can be considered as a therapeutic option after space-occupying cerebral infarction. There is controversy regarding the use of this method in patients with infarction of the speech-dominant hemisphere.

Methods

In 14 patients with infarction of the dominant hemisphere and subsequent treatment with hemicraniectomy, recovery from aphasic symptoms was evaluated retrospectively. A group of patients who were treated between 1994 and 2003 in our aphasia ward was selected for the study. In all patients, a psychometric quantification was accomplished applying the Aachen Aphasia Test at least twice within a mean observation period of 470 days.

Results

A significant improvement of the statistical parameters representing different aspects of aphasia was observed in 13 of 14 patients. Also, an increase of the ability to communicate was evident in 13 patients. Young age at the time of stroke and early poststroke decompressive surgery were identified as main predictors for recovery from aphasia.

Conclusions

A significant improvement of aphasic symptoms can be observed in a preselected group of patients after a massive stroke of the speech-dominant hemisphere treated by consecutive hemicraniectomy. Therefore, decompressive surgery can be considered for the treatment of this kind of stroke.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — supratentorial unilateral MCA infarction, age > 60 years: In patients > 60 years of age who deteriorate neurologically within 48 hours from brain swelling associated with unilateral MCA infarctions despite medical therapy, decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion may be considered; evidence indicates a reduction in mortality of ≈50% (76% in the nonsurgical group versus 42% in the surgical group) when surgery is performed within 48 hours, and at 12 months independence (mRS score ≤ 2) was not achieved by any survivors in either group.

### Early prophylactic decompressive hemicraniectomy… [^112CKoyp]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

DESTINY II confirmed benefit in patients > 60, improving functional outcomes. Guidelines endorse DHC for large infarcts with deterioration. However, significant challenges persist: DHC is Underutilized: Despite evidence, clinical adoption remains low. Rescue DHC Fails to Improve Outcomes in Post-EVT MCE: Studies report poor functional outcomes and high mortality with standard medical therapy plus rescue DHC after MCE develops. Retrospective data confirms worse outcomes in these patients compared to those without MCE. Crucially, rescue DHC itself fails to improve prognosis once MCE is established. Mitigate secondary injury. Potentially break the ischemic-edema-herniation cycle sooner.

Rationale for the Study: While DHC is effective for established MCE in non-EVT contexts and rescue DHC post-EVT is ineffective, high-quality evidence for early prophylactic DHC in high-risk large-core patients after successful EVT is lacking. Current guidelines do not address this specific, high-risk population where MCE incidence is ~50% and outcomes are dismal despite recanalization. Study Aim: This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of early prophylactic decompressive hemicraniectomy compared to standard medical treatment in AIS-LVO patients at high risk of MCE following successful EVT. The goal is to determine if proactive intervention can improve functional outcomes and reduce mortality in this critically ill population where current strategies fail. Procedure: Early prophylactic decompressive hemicraniectomy

- Evidence of other brain diseases such as cerebral trauma, intracranial tumor, cerebral aneurysm, etc.
- Evidence of acute ischemic infarction in bilateral anterior circulation territory or involvement of posterior circulation territories;

### Strokectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction: experience and meta-analysis of current evidence [^111L9u6X]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Complications

In the strokectomy group, 1 patient (25%) developed pneumocephalus and then recovered with outcome mRS = 4. In the hemicraniectomy group, four patients (20%) developed seizures (2 shortly after the surgery and two following cranioplasty). All 4 had poor neurological status on admission and poor outcomes. A further four patients (20%) in this group developed pneumonia which was treated successfully with antibiotics. One patient developed hydrocephalus and another patient developed atrial fibrillation.

Six patients out of the 13 who survived in the hemicraniectomy group underwent cranioplasty where two developed seizures. The remaining seven patients required nursing home care and were fully dependent; they were considered unsuitable for cranioplasty.

Systematic review and meta-analysis

Among 122 retrieved studies, 114 were excluded because of duplicates or because titles and abstracts did not meet the inclusion criteria (Fig. 2). In the remaining eight, full texts were assessed for eligibility and 5 were excluded because they did not include strokectomy as a primary procedure for the treatment of malignant MCA infarction. We included three studies with a total of 37 patients. Overall, the SC dataset comprised four studies (including ours) for outcome analysis (pooled N = 41). For the HC analysis, we pooled data from DECIMAL, DESTINY and HAMLET " studies with our data (pooled N = 71 patients). Both in our data and in the pooled data, there was a trend for better outcomes for strokectomy than for hemicraniectomy (for mRS ≤ 3, our data: OR 7.0, 95% CI 0.6 — 81, pooled data: OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.99–4.7; Fig. 3 a and b).

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^1123gVjZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study lie in the systematic cognitive screening in a substantial number of patients treated with DH, the standardization of surgical treatment aligning with indications from major trials, a long follow‐up, and comprehensive clinical and radiological patient characterization. However, our study has limitations. It is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data conducted at a single center, potentially raising questions about the generalizability of our results. The lack of information on prestroke cognitive status might have, to some extent, influenced the interpretation of the results; nevertheless, in accordance with existing guidelines for performing DH, the patients included were typically young and very unlikely to have prestroke cognitive impairment. The inclusion of patients for this study spanned approximately 20 years; although new effective reperfusion treatments for the acute stroke phase have been approved during this period, the indications for performing DH as well as the surgical techniques did not change substantially. We acknowledge that cognitive impairment was defined based on a cutoff value on MMSE, a screening tool rather than a comprehensive battery. Consequently, it is likely that higher rates of cognitive impairment might have been found if comprehensive testing had been administered. We recognize that the exclusion of a subset of patients who were not assessed at any timepoint may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence of cognitive impairment. However, MMSE is easily employed in clinical practice and serves to identify patients who may benefit from a more in‐depth evaluation. The consistent rate of cognitive impairment across multiple timepoints reassures regarding the validity of our findings. The reliance of MMSE on verbal skills has limited the feasibility of cognitive screening in patients with left‐hemisphere stroke, where severe language impairment is extremely common; therefore, our results are applicable mainly to right‐hemisphere strokes. As cognitive screening in aphasic patients with stroke remains an unresolved challenge, the use of less verbally reliant batteries might enhance the feasibility of cognitive screening in this population. We acknowledge that also in patients with large right hemisphere stroke the risk of bias remains, mainly due to symptoms such as neglect, which might impair the cognitive assessment. We also acknowledge that the exclusion of a minority of patients with right‐hemisphere stroke who did not undergo cognitive screening may have limited the interpretability of our results. Due to our relatively small cohort size, we did not perform multivariate analysis, and therefore results were not adjusted on several baseline characteristics when assessing the association between cognitive impairment and functional status. Although MMSE was used in this study, future research could benefit from employing more comprehensive tools like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Oxford Cognitive Screen to better capture cognitive impairment across a broader range of domains.

### DESTINY-S: attitudes of physicians toward disability and treatment in malignant MCA infarction [^115kbeqX]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) reduces mortality and improves outcome after malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction but leaves a high number of survivors severely disabled. Attitudes among physicians toward the degree of disability that is considered acceptable and the impact of aphasia may play a major role in treatment decisions.

Methods

DESTINY-S is a multicenter, international, cross-sectional survey among 1,860 physicians potentially involved in the treatment of malignant MCA infarction. Questions concerned the grade of disability, the hemisphere of the stroke, and the preferred treatment for malignant MCA infarction.

Results

mRS scores of 3 or better were considered acceptable by the majority of respondents (79.3%). Only few considered a mRS score of 5 still acceptable (5.8%). A mRS score of 4 was considered acceptable by 38.0%. Involved hemisphere (dominant vs. non-dominant) was considered a major clinical symptom influencing treatment decisions in 47.7% of respondents, also reflected by significantly different rates for DHC as preferred treatment in dominant versus non-dominant hemispheric infarction (46.9 vs. 72.9%). Significant differences in acceptable disability and treatment decisions were found among geographic regions, medical specialties, and respondents with different work experiences.

Conclusion

Little consensus exists among physicians regarding acceptable outcome and therapeutic management after malignant MCA infarction, and physician's recommendations do not correlate with available evidence. We advocate for a decision-making process that balances scientific evidence, patient preference, and clinical expertise.

### Crucial trials in neurosurgery: a must-know for every neurosurgeon [^112cfrJa]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

DESTINY

The Decompressive Surgery for the Treatment of Malignant Infarction of the Middle Cerebral Artery (DESTINY) Trial of 2007 focused on the treatment of malignant middle cerebral artery infarction through decompressive surgery (hemicraniectomy). This randomized controlled trial involved 32 patients and aimed to assess the impact of hemicraniectomy on 30-day mortality and 6- and 12-month functional outcomes. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality for the surgical group compared to conservative therapy, with 88% of patients in the surgical arm surviving at 30 days compared to 47% in the conservative treatment group. However, the primary endpoint, which was functional outcome at 6 months measured by the modified Rankin Scale score dichotomized to 0 to 3 versus 4 to 6, did not show statistical superiority of hemicraniectomy. Despite this, the trial provided valuable insights into the potential benefits of decompressive surgery in reducing mortality in cases of large hemispheric stroke.

HAMLET

The HAMLET Trial (Hemicraniectomy After Middle Cerebral Artery infarction with Life-threatening Edema Trial) of 2009 was a multicenter, randomized trial focusing on the effects of surgical decompression in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarctions. The trial included 64 patients who were randomly assigned to either surgical decompression or best medical treatment within 4 days of stroke onset. The primary outcome was functional outcome at 1 year, measured by the modified Rankin scale. The results showed that surgical decompression did not significantly affect the primary outcome measure, but it did reduce case fatality. The trial provided insights into the timing and effectiveness of surgical intervention in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction, highlighting the importance of early intervention within 48 h of stroke onset for improving outcomes.

DESTINY II

The DESTINY II Trial of 2014 extended the investigation of decompressive surgery in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. This trial focused on older patients (ages 61 and above) and compared early hemicraniectomy to conservative treatment. It involved 112 patients, with findings showing that hemicraniectomy significantly increased survival without severe disability. The survival rate without severe disability was 38% in the hemicraniectomy group compared to 18% in the control group. However, most survivors required assistance with most bodily needs, with a significant portion experiencing severe disability. The trial's results highlight the complex decision-making required in treating older patients with malignant MCA infarction, balancing survival against potential disability.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy in malignant middle cerebral artery infarct: a randomized controlled trial enrolling patients up to 80 years old [^114UoHe2]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) has proven efficacious for the treatment of malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (mMCAI) only in patients less than 60 years. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of DHC in patients up to 80.

Methods

This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trail comparing the outcomes with or without DHC in patients aged 18–80 with mMCAI (ChiCTR-TRC-11001757). The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 6 months. The secondary outcome measures included the 6- and 12-month mortality and the mRS scores after 1 year. The prognosis of patients was evaluated independently by two blinded investigators. In addition, subgroup analyses were done for those above 60 years of age. All analyses were by intention-to-treat.

Results

A significant reduction in the poor outcome (mRS > 4) following DHC was reached after 36 patients had completed the follow-up period of 6 months. The trial was then terminated when 47 participants (24 in the surgical group vs. 23 in the medical group) had been recruited. The final analysis, based on the outcome data of the 47 patients, showed that DHC significantly reduced mortality at 6 and 12 months (12.5 vs. 60.9%, P = 0.001 and 16.7 vs. 69.6%, P < 0.001, respectively), and significantly fewer patients had a mRS score > 4 after surgery (33.3 vs. 82.6%, P = 0.001 and 25.0 vs. 87.0%, P < 0.001, respectively). Similar results were present in the subgroup analyses of elderly participants

Conclusions

For patients up to 80 years who suffered mMCAI, DHC within 48 h of stroke onset not only is a life-saving treatment, but also increases the possibility of surviving without severe disability (mRS = 5).

### Health state preferences and decision-making after malignant middle cerebral artery infarctions [^115eh5Zz]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite recent trials demonstrating improved functional outcomes in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery ischemic strokes treated with hemicraniectomy, survivors still experience significant stroke-related disability. The value assigned to health states with significant disability varies widely and may influence decisions regarding hemicraniectomy.

Methods

A medical decision analysis was used to evaluate the results of recent hemicraniectomy trials in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. Survival data and probability of various functional outcome states (modified Rankin score 2–3 or 4–5) at 1 year were abstracted from clinical trial data. Utility scores for modified Rankin states were abstracted from literature sources. Sensitivity analyses were performed to study results over a wide range of utility values. All modeling was performed on TreeAge Pro software.

Results

The hemicraniectomy treatment pathway was associated with more quality-adjusted life-years over the first year than the medical management pathway (0.414 vs 0.145). Hemicraniectomy remained the preferred option except when the utility associated with the possible outcome states dropped considerably (0.72 to 0.40 for Rankin 2–3, and 0.41 to 0.04 for Rankin 4–5), or when 1-week surgical mortality increased considerably (5% to 67%).

Conclusions

Over a 1-year time horizon, treating patients with malignant middle cerebral artery strokes with hemicraniectomy is associated with more quality-adjusted life-years than medical management alone, except under conditions where patients value possible resultant health states very poorly or surgical mortality is excessively high.

### Scalp incision technique for decompressive hemicraniectomy: comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of the reverse question mark versus alternative retroauricular and kempe incision techniques [^1156sVwc]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

We acknowledge several limitations to the present study. First, though the studies featured in the present analysis did not report DC flap size in a consistent manner, this is a related and highly relevant factor that has been debated extensively. Although the neurosurgical community has accepted the 12 × 15 cm 2 hemicraniectomy size as a procedural consensus, this topic is still widely debated. In fact, it is logical to question whether DHC size variation could have played a role in the heterogeneity of SSI and wound complication results reported across studies. Unfortunately, there is no definitive way to determine whether flap size may have been a confounding factor or effect modifier.

Moreover, it is likely that the most important effect on ultimate surgical outcome would have been the relationship between incision type and DHC bone flap size. As the quality and orientation of the surgical incision directly correlate with the maximum DHC size that can be performed, it would be important to understand the effect of incision type on the range of the craniectomy size that can be performed. Furthermore, it would be important to know whether any of the incision types impose limitations upon temporal lobe decompression, including the ability to remove additional temporal bone if needed intraoperatively. Many surgeons would likely opt for the incision type that provides maximum calvarium exposure and thereby enables optimal removal of the hemicranium. This is paramount to achieving adequate decompression and may help ensure that the surgeon can successfully decompress the temporal lobe (arguably the most important component of the procedure).

In the fourth edition of their severe TBI guidelines, the Brain Trauma Foundation recommended that DHCs be no smaller than 12 × 15 cm 2 as a level 2A recommendation intended to optimize decompression and minimize the risk for severe herniation at the edge of the bone flap. Interestingly, the quantity of medical literature investigating the role of bone flap size in DHC is underwhelming. Although the 12 × 15 cm 2 DHC is widely regarded as standard of care, this is based on the assertion that a more limited craniectomy is suboptimal. The 12 × 15 cm 2 DHC is therefore not based upon precise, clearly delineated and quantifiable metrics. There is still no certainty as to whether bone flap surface area is truly an independent predictor of clinical outcomes. Because this is the case, this adds an extra layer of difficulty to identifying the optimal scalp incision technique.

### Cognitive outcome of survivors of space-occupying hemispheric infarction [^114RxhoR]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

In patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction, surgical decompression within 48 h after stroke onset increases the chance of a good functional outcome, but also the chance of survival with severe disability. Until now, cognitive outcome in these patients has not been reported in a consecutive series. Participants of the hemicraniectomy after middle cerebral artery infarction with life-threatening edema trial (HAMLET; ISRCTN94237756) underwent detailed neuropsychological examination at a median of 14.5 months after stroke onset. 'Global cognitive impairment' was defined as a score on the Cambridge cognitive examination (CAMCOG) ≤ 83. Impairment on an individual neuropsychological task was defined as a score below the 2.5th percentile or more than two standard deviations below standard norms. The association between cognitive and functional outcome was analysed with linear regression. Twenty patients were tested. Fifteen (75%) had global cognitive impairment or such poor performance that assessment of global cognitive performance by the CAMCOG was not feasible. Five had only focal cognitive deficits. Still, detailed neuropsychological examination was feasible in 18 patients. Patients with aphasia performed worse than those without on both verbal and non-verbal tasks. Poorer cognitive performance was associated with worse functional outcome as assessed with the modified Rankin scale (β -0.4, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.1). No differences were observed between operated and non-operated patients. The majority of survivors of space-occupying hemispheric infarction suffered from long-term global cognitive impairment. Isolated focal neuropsychological deficits were found in only a quarter. Impaired cognitive outcome was associated with worse functional outcome.

### Hemicraniectomy and durotomy upon deterioration from infarction-related swelling trial: randomized pilot clinical trial [^111TGHPZ]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Hemicraniectomy and Durotomy Upon Deterioration From Infarction-Related Swelling Trial (HeADDFIRST) was a randomized pilot study to obtain information necessary to design a Phase III trial to evaluate the benefit of surgical decompression for brain swelling from large supratentorial cerebral hemispheric infarction.

Methods

All patients with stroke were screened for eligibility (age 18–75 years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥ 18 with Item 1a < 2 [responsive to minor stimulation], and CT demonstrating unilateral, complete middle cerebral artery territory infarction by specific imaging criteria). All enrolled patients were treated using a standardized medical treatment protocol. Those with both ≥ 4 mm of pineal shift and deterioration in level of arousal or ≥ 7.5 mm of anteroseptal shift within 96 hours of stroke onset were randomized to continued medical treatment only or medical treatment plus surgery. Death at 21 days was the primary outcome measure.

Results

Among 4909 screened patients, only 66 (1.3%) patients were eligible for HeADDFIRST. Forty patients were enrolled, and 26 patients developed the requisite brain swelling for randomization. All who failed to meet randomization criteria were alive at 21 days. Mortality at 21 and 180 days was 40% (4/10) in the medical treatment only and 21% (3/14) and 36% (5/14) in the medical treatment plus surgery arms, respectively.

Conclusions

HeADDFIRST randomization criteria effectively distinguished low from high risk of death from large supratentorial cerebral hemispheric infarction. Lower mortality in the medical treatment only group than in other published trials suggests a possible benefit to standardizing medical management. These results can inform the interpretation of recently completed European trials concerning patient selection and medical management.

Clinical Trial Registration

This trial was not registered because enrollment began before July 1, 2005.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^113KNTph]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Three hundred four patients were treated with DH for large MCA ischemic stroke consecutively between May 2005 and April 2022. Among them, 56 patients died before the 3‐month follow‐up. Of 248 three‐month survivors, 136 patients had left‐hemisphere strokes or contralateral territory involvement and were therefore not included in this study. Among the 112 patients with right‐hemisphere stroke without contralateral territory involvement, 17 did not undergo MMSE testing at any of the three prespecified timepoints (eight patients did not attend the outpatient follow‐up, six had severe impairment or behavioral manifestations preventing the administration of the questionnaire, three had missing data; see Table S1). Ninety‐five patients received at least one cognitive screening during the 3‐year follow‐up time and were therefore included in the study (Figure 1). Figure S1 displays the number of eligible patients (i.e. survivors who had reached the 3‐month outpatient evaluation) for each timepoint and who underwent cognitive screening during the long‐term follow‐up.

FIGURE 1
Flowchart of patient inclusion.

Median age of participants was 51 years (IQR = 42–56); 54 (56.8%) were male. Compared to patients with cognitive testing, those who did not undergo cognitive screening were older, more often had diabetes, and had more severe stroke symptoms (i.e. NIHSS score) at onset and before DH (see Table S1).

Median MMSE score was 26 (IQR = 22–28) at 3‐month follow‐up, 26 (IQR = 23–29) at 1‐year follow‐up, and 27 (IQR = 23–29) at 3‐year follow‐up. Forty‐four patients (46.3%, 95% CI = 36.2–56.4) had an MMSE score < 24 at at least one of the three timepoints and were defined as cognitively impaired. Seventy‐six, 80, and 66 patients underwent cognitive screening at 3‐month, 1‐year, and 3‐year follow‐up, respectively. Twenty‐three patients (30.3%, 95% CI = 19.9–40.6) showed cognitive impairment at 3‐month, 25 (31.3%, 95% CI = 21.1–41.5) at 1‐year, and 19 (28.8%, 95% CI = 17.8–39.7) at 3‐year follow‐up (Figure 2).

### Prior thrombectomy does not affect the surgical complication rate of decompressive hemicraniectomy in patients with malignant ischemic stroke [^111vnSiF]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient Characteristics Have Not Changed Significantly Since the Introduction of Thrombectomy

The baseline patient characteristics of the thrombectomy group in our study were similar to those of the patients in the pivotal randomized controlled trials of decompressive hemicraniectomy as a treatment for malignant courses of ischemic stroke regarding sex (predominantly male patients), age (mean age of around 55 years), clinical (mean preoperative NIHSS score of 25) as well as radiological (more than one vascular territory affected in about one third of the patients) features, and time from the onset of symptoms to decompression (around 30 h). Also, early (after 3–6 months) and long-term functional outcomes (after 12 months) were similar; therefore, the conclusions drawn from the large randomized controlled trials on decompressive hemicraniectomy in malignant stroke, which were conducted before mechanical recanalization became part of the routine stroke treatment, still seem relevant and valid in times of modern stroke care. This observation is also well in line with other studies evaluating the role of decompressive hemicraniectomy in times of mechanical recanalization that share similar patient characteristics, functional outcome data, and conclusions with our study. Göttsche et al. found a decrease the rate of decompressive hemicraniectomies between 2009 and 2017, but patient characteristics remained unchanged and similar to those in our study regarding age (54 years in both studies), sex (39% vs. 41% female), initial NIHSS score (18 vs. 20), and time to decompression (around 30 h in both studies). However, only 32 patients had received mechanical thrombectomy prior to decompressive hemicraniectomy in this study, and rates of surgical complications and revision rates were not reported. In contrast to the study by Göttsche et al. Alzayiani et al. focused on the effect of prior mechanical recanalization or systemic thrombolysis on surgical complications of decompressive hemicraniectomy. The study population was comparable to our cohort regarding demographics (age of 51 vs. 54 years, 44% vs. 41% female patients) and preoperative neurological status (e.g. GCS score of 10 in both studies). Although the rate of revision surgery was significantly higher compared with that in our study, no association between either prior systemic thrombolysis or mechanical recanalization and surgical complications could be detected. However, the conclusions need to be interpreted cautiously because more than 100 of the initially screened 152 patients were excluded prior to data analysis.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy and durotomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction [^115ojg4z]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The high early case fatality among patients with massive hemispheric strokes calls for effective treatments. Release of the restriction created by the dura mater and bony skull to allow the infarcted brain tissue to swell has been successfully adopted by some while considered controversial by others. A recent pooled analysis provides estimates for the efficacy of decompressive surgery. Further analyses of current trial data suggest that in particular patient age and timing of surgery determine outcome. Nonetheless, in order to guide the management of individual patients, carefully adjusted medical care, ongoing futility analysis, and simultaneous caregiver meetings should be conducted to reach a joint decision addressing any ethical concerns. In conclusion, decompressive surgery increases the probability of survival but produces patients with moderate or moderately severe disability (albeit not severe disability). Currently, the decision to perform decompressive surgery should remain an individual one in each and every patient.

### Large diameter hemicraniectomy does not improve long-term outcome in malignant infarction [^116MxZkZ]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the strengths of a prospective multicenter registry, our study is not without limitations: it is a non-randomized study and the decision of timing, diameter, and technique of the hemicraniectomy was left at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon. Hemicraniectomy with duraplasty as a procedure was not standardized, neither were pre- and postoperative treatment algorithms, intensive care monitoring, extubation strategies, or the additional use of intracranial pressure lowering treatments including therapeutic hypothermia. Although this approach bears the risk of confounding, we did not observe differences in any of the clinical or radiological parameters used to determine the indication for hemicraniectomy such as midline shift, time since symptom onset, loss of consciousness, or stroke severity. Furthermore, because this is assumed to be standard neurosurgical practice, we did not evaluate an appropriate decompression of the temporal bone in the registry. However, uncal herniation after surgery was less frequent in both treatment groups, suggesting a comparable temporal bone decompression. Most importantly, hemicraniectomy diameter was also not associated with infarct volume which refutes the assumption that larger infarcts were treated by larger hemicraniectomies. In addition, through the inclusion of a wide range of university and community hospitals, treatment of malignant infarction was carried out by physicians with different clinical and surgical experience. Alternatively, the surface area could be calculated by automated segmentation tools; however, we decided to calculate the bone flap by manual approximation as an ellipse by manual approximation in order to obtain a visual control of the results. The surface area could then be calculated from the semi-major axis. The differences result from an easily determined parameter (diameter) that the treating neurosurgeon has at hand intraoperatively, whereas the determination of the surface area is a parameter which is difficult to reproduce intraoperatively. Finally, we did not assess the rate of application of advanced directives resulting in care limitations despite hemicraniectomy which may impact outcome.

In conclusion, our results do not provide evidence that large hemicraniectomy is beneficial regarding functional outcome or mortality as compared to standard hemicraniectomy in unselected patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction treated by hemicraniectomy. Although our results indicate that standard hemicraniectomy may be associated with less complications and is sufficient in most cases, selected patients may still benefit from a larger diameter hemicraniectomy to achieve the best possible outcome. This relevant question should be addressed in a randomized controlled trial.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy in severe cerebral venous thrombosis: a prospective case series [^113CFKmC]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

The currently available evidence suggests that decompressive craniectomy often results in good functional outcome in CVT patients with impending transtentorial herniation. Obviously, additional prospective data on its efficacy are needed. However, we believe that a randomized controlled trial faces insurmountable ethical objections since most of these patients will die if left untreated. Instead, an international prospective registry of consecutive cases would be preferable. Currently, efforts are being undertaken to initiate such a project. Until that time, however, we believe that decompressive craniectomy should be strongly considered in CVT patients who have both clinical and radiological sign of impending herniation.

### Strokectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction: experience and meta-analysis of current evidence [^114t3KD8]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction is a life-threatening medical emergency that carries a poor prognosis with mortality of up to 80% in untreated patients. In malignant MCA syndrome expanding oedema causes mass effect, a substantial rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) and reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Malignant MCA syndrome can cause further infarction in other vascular territories especially the anterior cerebral artery. Medical treatment alone to reduce the raised intracranial pressure is not effective.

Decompressive hemicraniectomy (hemicraniectomy) significantly reduces mortality and improves functional outcome following malignant MCA infarction. The initial three randomised controlled trials (DECIMAL, HAMLET and DESTINY) considered individually or with pooled patient data analysis demonstrated that hemicraniectomy was superior to medical management alone in both survival and functional outcome measured using the modified Rankin score (mRS) where good outcome was defined as mRS ≤ 3. The objective with hemicraniectomy is to avoid secondary brain damage from elevated ICP and herniation. Hemicraniectomy survivors must undergo a second surgical procedure to close the skull defect (cranioplasty). This procedure carries risks from evolving brain injury while awaiting cranioplasty and also from potential complications of the procedure itself, which include infection and air embolism. Hemicraniectomy can also cause a syndrome of the trephined or hydrocephalus. Therefore, hemicraniectomy while improving survival and outcome also comes with significant risk and additional cost.

Partial resection of infarcted frontal and/or temporal lobe with preservation of skull integrity, termed "strokectomy", has been suggested either as an adjuvant or surgical alternative to hemicraniectomy to effect decompression. Surgical decompression (including strokectomy) for cerebellar infarction is well established and associated with improved outcome. Whether supratentorial or infratentorial, the rationale of strokectomy is to resect just enough infarcted brain tissue to alleviate the deleterious effects of progressive cerebral oedema, allowing the bone flap to be replaced immediately. This precludes the need for cranioplasty and its associated complications. In addition, removal of the anterior temporal lobe may rapidly relieve brainstem compression. The main risk is that resection of infarcted brain may not be sufficient to contain the oedema, and the decompression could be overwhelmed by further swelling.

### Association of infarct volume before hemicraniectomy and outcome after malignant infarction [^114MxH33]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the impact of infarct volume before hemicraniectomy in malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (MMI) as an independent predictor for patient selection and outcome prediction, we retrospectively analyzed data of 140 patients from a prospective multicenter study.

Methods

Patients from the Decompressive Surgery for the Treatment of Malignant Infarction of the Middle Cerebral Artery (DESTINY) Registry who underwent hemicraniectomy after ischemic infarction of > 50% of the middle cerebral artery territory were included. Functional outcome according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was assessed at 12 months. Unfavorable outcome was defined as mRS score of 4 to 6. Infarct size was quantified semiautomatically from CT or MRI before hemicraniectomy. Subgroup analyses in patients fulfilling inclusion criteria of randomized trials in younger patients (age ≤ 60 years) were predefined.

Results

Among 140 patients with complete datasets (34% female, mean [SD] age 54 [11] years), 105 (75%) had an unfavorable outcome (mRS score > 3). Mean (SD) infarct volume was 238 (63) mL. Multivariable logistic regression identified age (odds ratio [OR] 1.08 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.13, p = 0.004), infarct size (OR 1.27 per 10-mL increase, 95% CI 1.12–1.44, p < 0.001), and NIH Stroke Scale score (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.20, p = 0.030) before hemicraniectomy as independent predictors of unfavorable outcome. Findings were reproduced in patients fulfilling inclusion criteria of randomized trials in younger patients. Infarct volume thresholds for prediction of unfavorable outcome with high specificity (94% in overall cohort and 92% in younger patients) were > 258 mL before hemicraniectomy.

Conclusion

Outcome in MMI depends strongly on age and infarct size before hemicraniectomy. Standardized volumetry may be helpful in the process of decision-making concerning hemicraniectomy.

Large hemispheric infarction — decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) size parameters indicate that suboptimal DHC with a size smaller than 12 cm has been linked to increased break-through complications and decreased survival rate; most studies recommend a diameter of DHC of at least 12 cm, and some describe a size larger than 13–14 cm in diameter or even including the superior sagittal sinus.

### Strokectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction: experience and meta-analysis of current evidence [^111aA2Ze]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Strokectomy means surgical excision of infarcted brain tissue post-stroke with preservation of skull integrity, distinguishing it from decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both can mitigate malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome but evidence regarding strokectomy is sparse. Here, we report our data and meta-analysis of strokectomy compared to hemicraniectomy for malignant MCA infarction. All malignant MCA stroke cases requiring surgical intervention in a large tertiary centre (January 2012–December 2017, N = 24) were analysed for craniotomy diameter, complications, length of follow-up and outcome measured using the modified Rankin score (mRS). Good outcome was defined as mRS 0–3 at 12 months. In a meta-analysis, outcome from strokectomy (pooled from our cohort and published strokectomy studies) was compared with hemicraniectomy (our cohort pooled with published DECIMAL, DESTINY and HAMLET clinical trial data). In our series (N = 24, 12/12 F/M; mean age: 45.83 ± 8.91, range 29–63 years), 4 patients underwent strokectomy (SC) and 20 hemicraniectomy (HC). Among SC patients, craniotomy diameter was smaller, relative to HC patients (86 ± 13.10 mm, 120 ± 4.10 mm, respectively; p = 0.003), complications were less common (25%, 55%) and poor outcomes were less common (25%, 70%). In the pooled data (N = 41 SC, 71 HC), strokectomy tended towards good outcome more than hemicraniectomy (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.99–4.7; p = 0.051). In conclusion, strokectomy may be non-inferior, lower risk and cost saving relative to hemicraniectomy sufficiently to be worthy of further investigation and maybe a randomised trial.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116vAscG]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Craniectomy for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) synopsis — Large supratentorial ICH is often associated with clinical deterioration and elevated ICP that is refractory to medical management. This guideline is based primarily on data from small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective series, a systematic review, and a meta-analysis. As a primary recommendation, decompressive hemicraniectomy may be considered to reduce mortality in patients with supratentorial ICH who are in a coma, have large hematomas with midline shift, or have elevated ICP refractory to medical management. No clear differences have been demonstrated between decompressive hemicraniectomy with and without clot evacuation, and the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy for improving functional outcomes is uncertain.

(Strong recommendation and high-quality evidence) Due to insufficient evidence, the panel could not issue a recommendation regarding the use of CS for VTE prophylaxis although their use does not appear to be harmful. In stroke patients undergoing hemicraniectomy or endovascular procedures, we suggest the use of UFH, LMWH, and/or IPC for VTE prophylaxis in the immediate postsurgical or endovascular epoch.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy after malignant middle cerebral artery infarction: rationale and controversies [^113EWsW6]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Malignant middle cerebral artery stroke carries a very poor prognosis. Significant retrospective data support the hypothesis that decompressive hemicraniectomy decreases mortality rates due to this disease entity. Recently, 3 randomized controlled studies have been published and shed light on these issues and enhance the quality of evidence revolving around this procedure. In this review, the rationale, risks, benefits, and unanswered questions related to hemicraniectomy for acute ischemic stroke are reviewed with an emphasis on how 3 randomized trials have influenced knowledge on this life-saving yet controversial procedure. Further randomized studies are needed to clarify lingering questions regarding age indications and impact on quality of life.

Patient management

Trial inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years and subtotal (≥ 2/3) or total infarction of MCA territory with or without infarction of the ipsilateral anterior (ACA) or posterior (PCA) cerebral artery (= 'malignant' MCA infarction; MHS) and the clinical need for DHC. The indication for DHC was based on the uniform inclusion criteria of the four randomized controlled trials on hemicraniectomy, DECIMAL, DESTINY I, DESTINY II and HAMLET. Trial exclusion criteria were pregnancy, MRI incompatible medical device implants, coagulation abnormalities (thrombocytes < 60/nl, Quick value < 60%, activated partial thromboplastin time > 45 s), bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils, and/or other evidence of severe, intractable brain injury. Decompressive hemicraniectomy was performed as previously described.

Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) in acute stroke — scope and applicability. Unlike advance directives, POLST are medical orders created by physicians, often signed by the patient or a legally recognized decision-maker, and generally address life-prolonging treatments such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, IV antibiotics, and artificial nutrition and hydration. In acute stroke, reperfusion therapies aim to preserve functional independence rather than prolong life, so POLST options do not directly apply to decisions about these interventions; however, for decisions regarding hemicraniectomy for malignant hemispheric stroke, a POLST order such as "Attempt to sustain life by any medical intervention" may be relevant.

Neuroimaging prognostication by CT and MRI in large hemispheric infarction — A hypodensity covering > 50% of the MCA territory had an 85% positive predictive value for fatal clinical outcome, with a sensitivity and specificity of 61 and 94%, respectively; infarct volume > 220 mL and midline shift > 3.9 mm were also predictive of malignant infarction. For MRI, an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of < 80% and volume of > 82 mL within 6 h of symptoms onset was predictive with a sensitivity and specificity of 87 and 91%, respectively; reported DWI thresholds included > 82 ml, 145 ml, and > 177 ml, with volumes greater than 145 mL more likely to require hemicraniectomy. We recommend using early changes on CT and MRI to predict malignant edema after LHI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Large diameter hemicraniectomy does not improve long-term outcome in malignant infarction [^117Eww2Q]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In malignant cerebral infarction decompressive hemicraniectomy has demonstrated beneficial effects, but the optimum size of hemicraniectomy is still a matter of debate. Some surgeons prefer a large-sized hemicraniectomy with a diameter of more than 14 cm (HC > 14). We investigated whether this approach is associated with reduced mortality and an improved long-term functional outcome compared to a standard hemicraniectomy with a diameter of less than 14 cm (HC ≤ 14).

Methods

Patients from the DESTINY (DEcompressive Surgery for the Treatment of malignant INfarction of the middle cerebral arterY) registry who received hemicraniectomy were dichotomized according to the hemicraniectomy diameter (HC ≤ 14 cm vs. HC > 14 cm). The primary outcome was modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ≤ 4 after 12 months. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, mRS ≤ 3 and mortality after 12 months, and the rate of hemicraniectomy-related complications. The diameter of the hemicraniectomy was examined as an independent predictor of functional outcome in multivariable analyses.

Results

Among 130 patients (32.3% female, mean (SD) age 55 (11) years), the mean hemicraniectomy diameter was 13.6 cm. 42 patients (32.3%) had HC > 14. There were no significant differences in the primary outcome and mortality by size of hemicraniectomy. Rate of complications did not differ (HC ≤ 14 27.6% vs. HC > 14 36.6%, p = 0.302). Age and infarct volume but not hemicraniectomy diameter were associated with outcome in multivariable analyses.

Conclusion

In this post-hoc analysis, large hemicraniectomy was not associated with an improved outcome or lower mortality in unselected patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction. Randomized trials should further examine whether individual patients could benefit from a large-sized hemicraniectomy.

### Decompressive surgery for the treatment of malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery (DESTINY): a randomized, controlled trial [^1174Dg2o]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Decompressive surgery (hemicraniectomy) for life-threatening massive cerebral infarction represents a controversial issue in neurocritical care medicine. We report here the 30-day mortality and 6- and 12-month functional outcomes from the DESTINY trial.

Methods

DESTINY (ISRCTN01258591) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial based on a sequential design that used mortality after 30 days as the first end point. When this end point was reached, patient enrollment was interrupted as per protocol until recalculation of the projected sample size was performed on the basis of the 6-month outcome (primary end point = modified Rankin Scale score, dichotomized to 0 to 3 versus 4 to 6). All analyses were based on intention to treat.

Results

A statistically significant reduction in mortality was reached after 32 patients had been included: 15 of 17 (88%) patients randomized to hemicraniectomy versus 7 of 15 (47%) patients randomized to conservative therapy survived after 30 days (P = 0.02). After 6 and 12 months, 47% of patients in the surgical arm versus 27% of patients in the conservative treatment arm had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 (P = 0.23).

Conclusions

DESTINY showed that hemicraniectomy reduces mortality in large hemispheric stroke. With 32 patients included, the primary end point failed to demonstrate statistical superiority of hemicraniectomy, and the projected sample size was calculated to 188 patients. Despite this failure to meet the primary end point, the steering committee decided to terminate the trial in light of the results of the joint analysis of the 3 European hemicraniectomy trials.

### Crucial trials in neurosurgery: a must-know for every neurosurgeon [^1142MFG9]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

The pivotal clinical trials we've explored hold substantial implications for neurosurgical practice, impacting treatment protocols, patient management strategies, and the incorporation of new surgical techniques and technologies. These studies have been instrumental in shaping contemporary treatment protocols, as evidenced by the shift towards endovascular coiling in cerebral aneurysms management following the ISAT and BRAT trials.

This shift is not just a change in technique but represents a broader move towards less invasive procedures in neurosurgery, emphasizing patient safety and recovery. For instance, a study by Gupta et al. in 2018 discusses the recent introduction of new devices after those trials, such as flow diverter stents, microstents, bifurcation devices, double-lumen balloon catheters, and microcoils, which have proved effective in overcoming the limitations of traditional aneurysm coiling. Also, a study by Eboli et al. indicates a treatment paradigm shift in MCA aneurysm treatment from surgical treatment to endovascular treatment over the past decade. Also, a study by Alawi et al. found that endovascular coiling was associated with fewer deaths and shorter hospital stays than clip placement, and the trend of hospitals' use of coiling operations has increased in recent years. The trials also highlight the importance of personalized patient management, with trials like SUAVe emphasizing the need for individualized approaches based on specific factors such as aneurysm size and patient age.

Moreover, advancements in surgical techniques and technologies are vividly illustrated in these trials, with studies like MISTIE III highlighting the potential of minimally invasive surgery in intracerebral hemorrhage. The emphasis on timely intervention, particularly in acute conditions as shown in the DECIMAL and DESTINY trials, has influenced urgent decision-making in neurosurgery. For instance, after DECIMAL and DESTINY trials, Heiss W et al. published a study on the importance of early severe neurological symptoms in predicting the course of malignant MCA infarction and it emphasizes that early diagnosis with neuroimaging can predict the condition with high sensitivity, highlighting the need for timely intervention. Additionally, a recent study in 2023 titled "It is all about timing: decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant middle-cerebral-artery infarction" by Macha K et al. includes large analysis of randomized patients shows that decompressive surgery leads to higher rates of survival and functional outcomes in patients with malignant MCA infarction, highlighting the critical role of timing in surgical intervention and emphasizing the findings of those trials.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy in elderly patients with space-occupying infarction (DECAP): a prospective observational study [^1124UGdj]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Decompressive hemicraniectomy improves survival rates and functional outcome in patients with space-occupying middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. We sought to determine clinical outcomes in elderly patients with MCA infarction treated with hemicraniectomy and to identify factors associated with functional outcome.

Methods

We performed a prospective, single-center observational study aiming to include patients aged ≥ 61 years with large MCA infarction treated with hemicraniectomy. The primary endpoint was the functional outcome according to modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 6 months after hemicraniectomy. Secondary endpoints included outcome measures at 12 months. A pooled analysis of individual patient data from the single-center cohort and a DESTINY 2 trial subgroup was performed to identify factors associated with functional status at 12 months.

Results

We included 40 MCA infarction patients who underwent hemicraniectomy between 2012 and 2017 at our university hospital (median [IQR] patient age 64 [62–67] years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 17 [16–21]). The dominant hemisphere was affected in 22/40 patients. Hemicraniectomy was performed within 31 [23–53] h of symptom onset. At 6 months after hemicraniectomy, 6/40 patients (15%) were moderately or moderately severely disabled (mRS score 3 or 4), 19 (47.5%) severely disabled (mRS score 5), and 15 (37.5%) had died. Compared to surgically treated DESTINY 2 patients, the single-center patients less likely exhibited favorable functional outcome at 6 months (mRS scores 0–4; odds ratio 0.239 [95% CI 0.082–0.696]). Case-fatality rate at 12 months was 43%. In a pooled analysis including 79 patients from DECAP and DESTINY 2, no significant associations of baseline and treatment factors with the clinical status at 12 months were observed.

Conclusions

In this single-center cohort of elderly patients with space-occupying MCA infarction and decompressive hemicraniectomy, the probability for survival without severe disability was low. Lethality at 6 and 12 months was comparable to previously reported data from a randomized trial.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^1126RanH]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cerebral Edema

Large infarcts of the MCA or ICA are associated with high morbidity rates of up to 80%. Patients with large hemispheric infarcts (LHIs) are at increased risk of cerebral edema and fast neurologic deterioration that led to the term "malignant MCA infarction"(MMI). Hypodensity seen in more than 50% of the MCA territory (Fig. 2 B) or an infarct volume of greater than 145 cc within 14 hours of ictus are the most reliable predictors for a malignant course with increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and need for decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC). The ultimate intervention to alleviate increased intracranial pressure and avoid herniation in LHI with significant edema is surgical decompression with DHC. Three European clinical trials assessed the benefit of DHC in patients 60 years and younger. A pooled analysis of these trials showed that DHC does not only reduce mortality by 50% but also improve long-term functional outcome. The NNT to avoid a death is 2 (mRS = 6), whereas the NNT to avoid death and the most severe to moderately severe disability is 4 (mRS = 4–6). The proportion of patients alive with minimal-to-moderate disability (mRS = 0–3) was increased from 21% to 43%. Viewed another way, DHC resulted in a 49% absolute risk reduction in death, and an absolute increase in the proportion of patients rated as mRS = 2 of 12%, mRS = 3 of 10%, and mRS = 4 of 29%.

The DEcompressive Surgery for the Treatment of malignant INfarction of the middle cerebral arterY (DESTINY-II) clinical trial assessed the outcome of DHC in patients older than 60. It demonstrated that DHC increases the probability of survival, but most survivors had significant disabilities (mRS = 4–5). In all these trials, DHC was performed within 48 hours, and currently, there is no indication for a "wait and see strategy" (e.g. waiting for neurologic deterioration or radiographic midline shift). However, the ideal timing of DHC is still unclear and more data including standardized medical management are necessary. Furthermore, it remains debatable what the definition of a favorable functional outcome is and what degree of disability is regarded as acceptable. Additional surgical interventions that may be entertained in critically ill AIS patients are external ventricular drainage for the management of hydrocephalous and suboccipital craniectomy for posterior fossa/cerebellar infarcts with life-threatening cerebral edema.

### Consent issues in the management of acute ischemic stroke: AAN position statement [^113e7niz]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Hemicraniectomy for malignant cerebral hemispheric edema — tradeoffs and outcome thresholds are detailed, including modified Rankin Scale (mRS) acceptability. In a pooled analysis of 3 trials in patients age 60 and below, hemicraniectomy was considered to be beneficial on the assumption that survival with an mRS score of 4 was a favorable outcome, whereas in a trial of patients over age 60, no surviving patients had an mRS score of 2 or less and only 7% had an mRS score of 3. Prospectively, many people rate severe disability as undesirable as or worse than death, and most people consider an mRS score of 3 to be the maximum acceptable outcome score, although retrospectively, long-term survivors of hemicraniectomy, including older patients, reported acceptable quality of life and agreed with their treatment.

### Prior thrombectomy does not affect the surgical complication rate of decompressive hemicraniectomy in patients with malignant ischemic stroke [^112K5giw]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations need to be considered when interpreting the presented data. First of all, the study was conducted in a retrospective manner; therefore, there was no randomization of study participants to either treatment group, and baseline parameters were not exactly balanced, which limits generalizability of the study results. Furthermore, even though we report on the largest cohort of patients with prior mechanical recanalization before decompressive hemicraniectomy for ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, patient numbers are still limited because of the monocentric nature of the study. This is especially true for the data on functional outcome at the second follow-up (as data on functional status were only available for 40% of the patients initially enrolled in the study) and the relatively small number of observed outcomes (surgical complications and revision surgery) in the binomial regression analysis. Therefore, cautious interpretation of these data is indicated, and pooling of retrospective data from different centers, as well as prospective multicenter approaches, such as the initiation of a prospective multicenter registry, is desirable to provide more detailed insight into the topic in the future.

### What drives the increasing utilisation of hemicraniectomy in acute ischaemic stroke? [^11526SBc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Survival after malignant middle cerebral artery infarcts is dismal. In 2007, a pooled analysis of randomised trials in Europe demonstrated a substantial survival benefit from decompressive hemicraniectomy, with a number needed to treat of 2 for survival. Our objective was to review factors driving the nationwide utilisation of this potentially lifesaving procedure in the USA.

Methods

Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 2001–2009 were reviewed. Hospitalisations with a discharge diagnosis of an acute ischaemic stroke were included. Hemicraniectomy utilisation was determined within this subset. Nationwide estimates of utilisation were calculated for each year. Trends across the years were estimated for various subgroups.

Results

From 2001 to 2009, there were an estimated 4 909 519 acute ischaemic stroke discharges. The estimated frequency of hemicraniectomy increased from 118 (0.02% of stroke discharges in 2001) to 804 (0.15% of stroke discharges in 2009) (trend p < 0.001). The increased utilisation was greatest for younger subjects (age < 45 years; trend p < 0.001) and men (trend p < 0.001). Urban teaching hospitals were responsible for the greatest increase in hemicraniectomy utilisation: from 0.05% of stroke discharges in 2001 to 0.28% in 2009. The increase was steady and sustained over the decade. In comparison, rural and urban non-teaching hospitals showed a much smaller improvement in utilisation.

Conclusion

Utilisation of hemicraniectomy in the USA has increased significantly, in line with compelling results from European clinical trials. Early transfer of patients with malignant infarctions to urban teaching centres could potentially extend the survival benefit to a larger population.

Large hemispheric infarction — selection considerations emphasize that the optimal timing and selection criteria for DHC remain uncertain; to identify candidates, clinical predictors such as NIH Stroke Scale score, radiographic criteria including CT or MRI appearance and thrombus location, and laboratory tests like serum S100B have been used; practice patterns vary with "prophylactic" DHC linked to overutilization and unnecessary procedures, while waiting for deterioration may compromise recovery, and patients with dominant-hemisphere LHI are often not offered DHC because severe residual aphasia is considered unacceptable.

Follow‐up

According to our in‐house protocol, patients were followed up at 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years. At each follow‐up, we evaluated the functional status with mRS and neurological deficit with NIHSS, and we performed a cognitive screening using MMSE. MMSE was administered by an experienced stroke specialist to all patients who attended the in‐site follow‐up appointment. Being one of the most widely used screening tests for cognitive functions, MMSE is composed of 11 questions, encompassing orientation, attention, memory, visuospatial, and language skills, with scores ranging from 0 to 30. When patients were not able to attend the outpatient clinic, they were interviewed by telephone to record vital status, and the mRS was assessed with the help of their caregivers, attending physician, or both.

Cognitive outcome definition

We set a cutoff of MMSE < 24 to define cognitive impairment. For the purpose of this study, we analyzed data from patients alive 3 months after DH who underwent at least one cognitive screening using MMSE over the 3‐year follow‐up. Because only a minority of patients with left‐side strokes (15%) were able to undergo cognitive screening, we only included patients with right‐sided strokes, to avoid biases attributable to severe aphasia. For the same reason, we also excluded patients undergoing DH for a right‐hemisphere MCA infarction who also had contralateral territory ischemic involvement.

### Appreciation of the informed consent procedure in a randomised trial of decompressive surgery for space occupying hemispheric infarction [^113mRrAU]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

As non-randomised studies have suggested that surgical decompression may reduce mortality in patients with space occupying hemispheric infarction, randomisation may be considered unethical in controlled trials testing this treatment strategy. We studied differences in recall of information and in appreciation of the informed consent procedure between representatives included in the Hemicraniectomy After Middle cerebral artery infarction with Life-threatening Edema Trial (HAMLET) and representatives of patients participating in the randomised trial of Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) In Stroke (PAIS).

Methods

1 year after study inclusion, we contacted 30 consecutive representatives who had given informed consent for participation of their relative in HAMLET, and 30 for PAIS. Recall of trial details and appreciation of the informed consent procedure were investigated using standardised questionnaires and compared between the two groups.

Results

All 30 PAIS representatives and 28 HAMLET representatives were interviewed. Participation of their relative in a clinical trial was remembered by 86% of HAMLET and 40% of PAIS representatives (p < 0.001). HAMLET representatives remembered more trial details (effect of the treatment under study (61% vs 3%, p < 0.001); randomised treatment allocation (71% vs 0%, p < 0.001)). With respect to appreciation of the informed consent procedure, we found no differences between the groups: in each trial, four representatives (14% vs 13%) had considered the question of randomisation unacceptable.

Conclusions

Participation of patients in a randomised controlled trial of surgical decompression for space occupying infarction is generally considered acceptable by their representatives, and recall of trial details is better than in a trial in which less vital issues are at stake.

### Large diameter hemicraniectomy does not improve long-term outcome in malignant infarction [^116Ho17j]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Between January 2010 and July 2016 patients with large ischemic infarction were prospectively included into the DEcompressive Surgery for the Treatment of malignant INfarction of the middle cerebral arterY — Registry (DESTINY-R) study in 30 neurological and neurosurgical departments in Germany and Austria.

A detailed description of the study design has been published previously. The trial was registered in the German Registry for Clinical Studies (DRKS00000624). The ethics committee of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin (EA4/108/09) and the local ethics committees of all participating centers approved this registry. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or legal representatives.

For this analysis patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were selected from the complete study cohort: (1) ischemic infarction of at least 50% of the middle cerebral artery territory confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with corresponding clinical signs of a severe hemispheric syndrome, with or without additional infarction of the ipsilateral anterior or posterior cerebral artery territory, (2) hemicraniectomy performed according to the decision of the treating physician independent of study participation, (3) available postoperative imaging data measuring hemicraniectomy diameter, and (4) completed follow-up assessment of functional outcome conducted after 12 months. Patients with concomitant acute contralateral and/or infratentorial infarction or additional acute traumatic brain injury were excluded. The timing of hemicraniectomy and choice of the surgical technique (including the diameter of the bone flap, type of duraplasty) were left to the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon with a reference to the current guidelines.

After study inclusion, sociodemographic factors, clinical parameters (stroke severity on admission, level of consciousness on admission and before neurosurgery), pre-morbid functional status, vascular risk factors as well as surgical and medical treatment data were documented in a case report form. Additionally, relevant parameters of hemicraniectomy as well as complications of neurosurgery and during intensive care treatment were documented. Follow-up assessment was performed via a structured telephone interview 12 months after stroke onset.

Supratentorial malignant ischemic stroke in adults

Best available evidence: randomized controlled trials

Until today, to the best of our knowledge, the results of eight RCTs investigating the role of DC in malignant MCA stroke are available for analysis, which are summarized in Table 1. Between 2007 and 2009, the results from the first three RCT (DESTINY, DECIMAL, and HAMLET) were published and a pooled analysis of patients aged between 18 and 60 years undergoing DC within 48 h after stroke onset was performed. This pooled analysis revealed a significant benefit in all predefined subgroups (e.g. age above and below 50 years, time to randomization above and below 24 h, and dominant versus non-dominant hemisphere) with a number needed to treat of 4 for the prevention of poor outcome (i.e. mRS 4 to 6) and of 2 for survival. In the surgical arm, the probability of survival increased from 30 to 80%, albeit with a tenfold increase in the probability of surviving with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 4, meaning moderately severe disability requiring assistance from caregivers. However, the probability of surviving with a mRS of ≤ 3 (i.e. slight or moderate disability) doubled and the risk of surviving with a mRS of 5 (i.e. severe disability) remained stable compared to conservative treatment. The pooled analysis of all RCTs providing information on mortality at 12 months follow-up shows a consistent and significant benefit of DC (Fig. 7), with a risk reduction of almost 50%.

### Clinical review: therapy for refractory intracranial hypertension in ischaemic stroke [^111xGpZh]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with large hemispheric ischaemic stroke accompanied by massive space-occupying oedema represents one of the major unsolved problems in neurocritical care medicine. Despite maximum intensive care, the prognosis of these patients is poor, with case fatality rates as high as 80%. Therefore, the term 'malignant brain infarction' was coined. Because conservative treatment strategies to limit brain tissue shift almost consistently fail, these massive infarctions often are regarded as an untreatable disease. The introduction of decompressive surgery (hemicraniectomy) has completely changed this point of view, suggesting that mortality rates may be reduced to approximately 20%. However, critics have always argued that the reduction in mortality may be outweighed by an accompanying increase in severe disability. Due to the lack of conclusive evidence of efficacy from randomised trials, controversy over the benefit of these treatment strategies remained, leading to large regional differences in the application of this procedure. Meanwhile, data from randomised trials confirm the results of former observational studies, demonstrating that hemicraniectomy not only significantly reduces mortality but also significantly improves clinical outcome without increasing the number of completely dependent patients. Hypothermia is another promising treatment option but still needs evidence of efficacy from randomised controlled trials before it may be recommended for clinical routine use. This review gives the reader an integrated view of the current status of treatment options in massive hemispheric brain infarction, based on the available data of clinical trials, including the most recent data from randomised trials published in 2007.

### Large diameter hemicraniectomy does not improve long-term outcome in malignant infarction [^116jdGJT]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Among 168 patients with hemicraniectomy, functional outcome data after 12 months and postsurgical imaging were available from 130 patients who were included in our analysis. Of these patients, 42 (32.3%) were female, mean age (SD) was 54.5 (11.0) years, and 94 (72.3%) patients were younger than 60 years at study inclusion. One year after hemicraniectomy 27 (20.8%) patients had a mRS of 0–3 and 79 (60.8%) patients had a mRS of 0–4. 29 (22.3%) patients had died before the 12 months follow-up. Causes of death during hospital stay (N = 15, 11.5%) were transtentorial herniation (N = 9), cardiac arrest (N = 2), pneumonia (N = 1), pulmonary embolism (N = 1), and unknown (N = 2). Causes of death during the follow-up period after discharge were not assessed. Depending on the decision of the operating neurosurgeon 88 (67.7%) patients underwent standard hemicraniectomy (≤ 14 cm) and 42 (32.3%) patients were treated by large hemicraniectomy (> 14 cm). Large hemicraniectomy was performed at 10 out of 30 study centers and 30 out of 42 (72%) cases were performed at 3 study centers. No significant differences in baseline demographic or clinical characteristics were found between the two hemicraniectomy groups (Table 1). Timing of neurosurgery after symptom-onset did not vary between treatment groups [HC ≤ 14: 29 (21–54) hours vs. HC > 14: 31 (21–50) hours, p = 0.799]. Furthermore, there was no difference in the median time interval between imaging and hemicraniectomy (HC ≤ 14: 6 (3–12) hours vs. HC > 14: 4 (2–15) hours, p = 0.372). Volume of infarction before neurosurgery (HC ≤ 14: 244 ± 63 mL vs. HC > 14: 241 ± 52 ml, p = 0.909), left hemispheric infarction (HC ≤ 14: 43.2% vs. HC > 14: 45.0%, p = 0.982) and concomitant involvement of the anterior cerebral artery (HC ≤ 14: 17.2% vs. HC > 14: 14.3%, p = 0.670) or posterior cerebral artery (HC ≤ 14: 4.6% vs. HC > 14: 4.8%, p = 0.967) territory was similar in both groups. Furthermore, there were no differences in the amount of midline shift (HC ≤ 14: 2.9 ± 3.9 mm vs. HC > 14: 2.3 ± 3.1 mm, p = 0.494) or frequency of uncal herniation (HC ≤ 14: 7.1% vs. HC > 14: 10.0%, p = 0.585) before neurosurgery. Medical treatment of elevated intracranial pressure differed regarding osmotic therapy (HC ≤ 14: 44.8% vs. HC > 14: 28.6%, p = 0.077) and muscle relaxation (HC ≤ 14: 26.4% vs. HC > 14: 9.5%, p = 0.027). In the HC > 14 group the diameter of the craniotomy (HC ≤ 14: 12.8 cm vs. HC > 14: 15.8 cm, p < 0.001) and the area of the craniotomy (HC ≤ 14: 94.7 cm 2 vs. HC > 14: 119.4cm 2, p < 0.001) were larger than in the HC ≤ 14 group (Table 2).

### Outcome after decompressive craniectomy for middle cerebral artery infarction: timing of the intervention [^117Kt1Mn]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Decompressive craniectomy (DC) in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarct has been proposed as a way to accommodate the shift of brain tissue and to normalize intracranial pressure, thereby preserving the cerebral blood flow and preventing life-threatening transtentorial herniation and secondary damage. Current international clinical guidelines for the treatment of space-occupying hemispheric infarct are based on 4 European randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DC to conventional therapy and employ both age (≤ 60 yr) and time elapsed since stroke onset (≤ 48 hr) as decisive criteria in the decision whether to perform DC. However, only few patients in these RCTs underwent DC after 48 h: 11 out of 32 patients in the hemicraniectomy after middle cerebral artery infarction with life-threatening edema trial (HAMLET) underwent DC > 48 h after stroke onset, whereas all 20 patients in the decompressive craniectomy in malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (DECIMAL) trial underwent DC within 36 h of stroke onset and all 66 patients in the decompressive surgery for the treatment of malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery (DESTINY)/DESTINY II trials underwent DC within 48 h of onset. Remarkably, favorable outcome rates did not differ between the 11 HAMLET patients who underwent DC after 48 h and the 21 HAMLET patients who underwent DC within 48 h (27% vs 24%, respectively). Additionally, several cohort studies comparing subgroups dichotomized by a time point of 48 h elapsed since stroke onset found no difference in outcome. Thus far, no meta-analysis comparing DC < 48 h vs > 48 h after stroke onset has been performed. One could, therefore, question whether the time elapsed since stroke onset should indeed be applied as a decisive criterion in the guidelines. Strict application of exclusion criteria employed by the abovementioned RCTs may withhold a neurosurgeon from offering a potentially life-saving treatment to a patient suffering from space-occupying hemispheric infarct who is otherwise fit to undergo surgery.

To address this dilemma, we studied the issue of timing of DC in a cohort of patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct undergoing DC during the "post-HAMLET" years 2007 to 2017. Additionally, we performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies reporting on the timing of DC and other predictors of outcome in patients undergoing DC for space-occupying hemispheric infarct.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^111Xketn]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Large middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarcts represent a critical subset of ischemic strokes characterized by extensive hemispheric brain damage, often leading to a rapid progression of brain edema. Large MCA infarcts — if untreated — result in death in up to 80% of cases, often in the first week after onset. The European guidelines recommend decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) in patients aged ≤ 60 years with large MCA infarcts who can be treated within 48 h of stroke onset. Surgical decompression improves poststroke outcomes by decreasing intracranial hypertension and preventing brain herniation. Although aggregate data from several clinical trials carried out in the past 2 decades showed that DH decreases the chance of death and reduces the degree of disability, approximately 40% of survivors experience severe long‐term disability. Although cognitive impairment might contribute to poststroke functional decline, there is a scarcity of data regarding the long‐term cognitive trajectories of patients undergoing DH for large MCA ischemic strokes. A retrospective study from 2011 with limited sample size found that 18 of the 20 included DH survivors, followed‐up at least 1 year after stroke, showed some degree of cognitive impairment. In a substudy on 20 patients (13 of them undergoing surgical decompression) with large hemispheric infarction enrolled in the HAMLET trial, cognitive testing with Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) was found to be feasible in 12, with half of them exhibiting impaired MMSE scores. Neurological long‐term follow‐up and regular cognitive screening of DH survivors is challenging, due to severe functional impairment and high rates of aphasia, especially in left‐hemisphere strokes.

In a cohort of consecutive patients with large right‐hemisphere MCA ischemic stroke treated with DH, we aimed to assess the rates of long‐term cognitive impairment, clinical–radiological associated factors, and temporal trends over 3‐year follow‐up.

### How often are patients with ischemic stroke eligible for decompressive hemicraniectomy? [^113Zxnvt]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction is estimated to occur in 10% of ischemic strokes, but few patients undergo decompressive hemicraniectomy, a proven therapy. We determined the proportion of patients with ischemic stroke without significant baseline disability with large middle cerebral artery infarction who would have been potentially eligible for hemicraniectomy in an era before publication of recent hemicraniectomy trials.

Methods

Ischemic stroke cases that occurred in 2005 among residents of the 5-county Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area were ascertained. Two study physicians reviewed all clinical and neuroimaging data for patients with baseline modified Rankin Scale score < 2, age ≥ 18 years with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥ 10. Large middle cerebral artery infarction was defined as > 50% of the middle cerebral artery territory or > 145 mL on diffusion-weighted MRI. Other eligibility criteria for hemicraniectomy, based on the pooled analysis of recent clinical trials, were age 18 to 60 years and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score > 15.

Results

Of 2227 ischemic strokes, 39 (1.8%) with baseline modified Rankin Scale score < 2 had large middle cerebral artery infarction. None underwent hemicraniectomy, and 16 (41.0%) died within 30 days. Six patients (0.3% of all ischemic strokes) were potentially eligible for hemicraniectomy; 1 died within 30 days.

Conclusions

Based on criteria from clinical trials, only 0.3% of cases were eligible for hemicraniectomy. Given the survival and functional outcome benefit in treated patients, future studies should determine whether additional subgroups of patients with ischemic stroke may benefit from hemicraniectomy.

### Decompressive craniectomy with clot evacuation in large hemispheric hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage [^112BWcSJ]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Decompressive hemicraniectomy in large hemispheric infarctions has been reported to lower mortality and improve the unfavorable outcomes. Hematoma volume is a powerful predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Hematoma volume adds to intracranial volume and may lead to life-threatening elevation of intracranial pressure.

Methods

Records of 12 consecutive patients with hypertensive ICH treated with decompressive hemicraniectomy were reviewed. The data collected included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at admission and before surgery, ICH volume, ICH score, and a clinical grading scale for ICH that accurately risk-stratifies patients regarding 30-day mortality. Outcome was assessed as immediate mortality and modified Rankin Score (mRS) at the last follow-up.

Results

Of the 12 patients with decompressive hemicraniectomy, 11 (92%) survived to discharge; of those 11, 6 (54.5%) had good functional outcome, defined as a mRS of 0 to 3 (mean follow-up: 17.13 months; range: 2–39 months). The mean age was 49.8 years (range: 19–76 years). Three of the 7 patients with pupillary abnormalities made a good recovery; of the 11 patients with intraventricular extensions (IVEs), 7 made a good recovery. The clinical finding (which was present in all 3 patients with mRS equal to 5 and which was not present in patients with mRS less than 5) was abnormal occulocephalic reflex. Of the 10 patients with an ICH score of 3, 9 (90%) survived to discharge, 4 (44%) had good functional outcome (mRS: 1–3). Hematoma volume was 60 cm3 or greater in eight patients, four (50%) of whom had good functional outcome (mRS: 0–3).

Conclusion

Decompressive hemicraniectomy with hematoma evacuation is life-saving and improves unfavorable outcomes in a select group of young patients with large right hemispherical ICH.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^117HbUiG]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Among 95 consecutive patients with large right‐hemisphere MCA infarcts treated with DH, 46% exhibited cognitive impairment (i.e. MMSE < 24) at least once during the 3 years following the index stroke. We further assessed the rate of cognitive impairment at 3‐month, 1‐year, and 3‐year timepoints, revealing a stable rate of 1 in 3 patients across the 3‐years follow‐up. Patients with and without cognitive impairment had comparable baseline clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, but cognitive impairment was associated with neurological severity and worse functional outcome during follow‐up.

The current study reports the first systematic evaluation of cognitive function in a large prospective cohort of consecutive patients treated with DH for large MCA infarcts. Cognitive impairment assessment in severe ischemic strokes poses challenges, particularly in cases of left‐hemisphere infarcts, where cognitive screening is limited by aphasia and often infeasible. This challenge is exacerbated by the reliance on verbally oriented tests in clinical settings, contributing to the well‐established link between lower cognitive scores and left‐hemisphere lesions, an association that may be — at least partly — attributed to the confounding factor of language impairment rather than dementia. Given these considerations, in our study involving individuals with extensive anterior‐circulation ischemic strokes, we decided to focus solely on right‐hemisphere infarcts to mitigate potential biases.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy in intracerebral hemorrhage (SWITCH) [^111nXGyD]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Decompressive Hemicraniectomy in Intracerebral Hemorrhage ClinicalTrials. gov ID. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether decompressive surgery and best medical treatment in patients with spontaneous ICH will improve outcome compared to best medical treatment only. Secondary objectives are to analyze mortality, dependency and quality of life. Safety endpoints are to determine cause of any mortality and the rate of medical and surgical complications after DC compared with best medical treatment alone. Nevertheless, surgical treatment in ICH remains a matter of debate and attempts to improve outcome using surgical therapy are still ongoing. Many efforts are made to minimize the invasiveness of operative procedures such as clot evacuation. However, direct surgical interventions aiming at the removal of the hematoma have failed to improve neurological outcome for most subtypes of ICH, especially deep-seated hematomas.

The trauma of open craniotomy and especially trauma to the brain parenchyma for hematoma evacuation are considered to outweigh the benefits of surgery. Decompressive craniectomy, which is beneficial in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction, may indirectly relieve the mass effect, decrease perihematomal tissue pressure, improve blood flow, reduce secondary brain damage and improve outcome without further damage to the brain due to surgery. Consequently, DC has been established as a standard surgical therapy for patients with malignant MCA infarction with a level of evidence grade 2. The limitations of the feasibility trial are its retrospective design, the small sample size and the inhomogeneity of the patient cohort with respect to the origin of ICH. Furthermore, in the feasibility trial the decision for DC was taken on an individual basis rather than according to a strict protocol, introducing a potential selection bias.

Nevertheless, the preliminary results are encouraging. Recently, three human trials, one animal study, one meta-analysis, and one original contribution have been published on this topic. However, no prospective randomized trial has ever assessed whether DC without hematoma evacuation in patients with acute ICH improves outcome. All recent studies showed promising results and all call for the initiation of a randomized controlled trial. Objective The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether decompressive surgery and best medical treatment in patients with spontaneous ICH will improve outcome compared to best medical treatment only. Secondary objectives are to analyze mortality, dependency and quality of life. Safety endpoints are to determine cause of any mortality and the rate of medical and surgical complications after DC compared with best medical treatment alone.

### Craniectomy for acute ischemic stroke: how to apply the data to the bedside [^1112bsYw]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Malignant hemispheric infarction is associated with a high mortality rate, approximately 80%, as a result of the development of intracranial pressure gradients, brain tissue shift, and herniation. By allowing the brain to swell outwards and equalizing pressure gradients, decompressive craniectomy appears to significantly reduce the mortality to approximately 20%. This review takes a comprehensive look at the evidence highlighting the benefits and limits of decompressive craniectomy in malignant cerebral infarction.

Recent Findings

Three recent European randomized trials have provided compelling evidence that decompressive hemicraniectomy for large hemispheric infarction is not only lifesaving, but also leads to improved functional outcome in patients 60 years of age or less when treated within 48 h of stroke onset.

Summary

Early decompressive hemicraniectomy (≤ 48 h) should be strongly considered in any patient 60 years old or less presenting with malignant hemispheric infarction. Further studies are needed to establish objective neuroimaging criteria for aggressive intervention, and to clarify the role of decompressive surgery in older patients (> 60 years old) and perhaps, when delayed beyond 48 h.

### Contemporary review on craniectomy and cranioplasty; part 1: decompressive craniectomy [^116yGfsK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This paper aims to review clinical benefits of decompressive craniectomy (DC) in both adult and paediatric populations; its indications and factors contributing to its postoperative success. The Glasgow Outcome Scale and the Modified Rankin Scale are the most commonly used scales to assess the long-term outcome in patients post DC. In adult traumatic brain injury patients, 2 randomized clinical trials were carried out; DECRA (Decompressive Craniectomy in Diffuse Traumatic Brain Injury) and RESCUEicp (Randomised Evaluation of Surgery with Craniectomy for Uncontrollable Elevation of inter cranial pressure) employing collectively 555 patients. Despite the differences in these trials, their initial results affirm DC can lead to reduced mortality and more favorable outcomes. In ischemic stroke adult patients, different clinical trials of HAMLET (Dutch trial of Hemicraniectomy after middle cerebral artery infarction with life-threatening Edema), DESTINY (German trial of Decompressive Surgery for the treatment of Malignant Infarct of the Middle Cerebral Artery), and DECIMAL (French trial of Decompressive Craniectomy in Malignant Middle Cerebral Artery Infarcts) suggested that DC improves survival compared with best medical management, but with an increased proportion of treated individuals surviving with moderate or severe disability. With regard to the size of bone to be removed, the larger the defect the better the results with a minimum diameter of 11 to 12cm of bone flap. Cranioplasty timing varies and ranges from 6weeks to more than 12months post DC, depending on completion of medical treatment, clinical recovery, resolution of any infection, and an evaluation of soft tissues at the defect site.

Acute ischemic stroke — supratentorial unilateral MCA infarction, age ≤ 60 years: In patients ≤ 60 years of age who deteriorate neurologically within 48 hours from brain swelling associated with unilateral MCA infarctions despite medical therapy, decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion is reasonable; pooled randomized trials report an absolute risk reduction in mortality of 50% (95% CI, 34–66) at 12 months when surgery is performed within 48 hours.

### Surgical decompression for space-occupying cerebral infarction: outcomes at 3 years in the randomized HAMLET trial [^112fBHQ9]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We assessed whether the effects of surgical decompression for space-occupying hemispheric infarction, observed at 1 year, are sustained at 3 years.

Methods

Patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction, who were enrolled in the Hemicraniectomy After Middle cerebral artery infarction with Life-threatening Edema Trial within 4 days after stroke onset, were followed up at 3 years. Outcome measures included functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale), death, quality of life, and place of residence. Poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale > 3.

Results

Of 64 included patients, 32 were randomized to decompressive surgery and 32 to best medical treatment. Just as at 1 year, surgery had no effect on the risk of poor functional outcome at 3 years (absolute risk reduction, 1%; 95% confidence interval, -21 to 22), but it reduced case fatality (absolute risk reduction, 37%; 95% confidence interval, 14–60). Sixteen surgically treated patients and 8 controls lived at home (absolute risk reduction, 27%; 95% confidence interval, 4–50). Quality of life improved between 1 and 3 years in patients treated with surgery.

Conclusions

In patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction, the effects of decompressive surgery on case fatality and functional outcome observed at 1 year are sustained at 3 years.

### Surgical hematoma evacuation vs conservative treatment and functional outcome in cerebellar intracerebral hemorrhage… [^114fHD6i]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

A volume range of 12 to 15 cm3 was identified; below this level, surgical hematoma evacuation was associated with lower likelihood of favorable functional outcome across the identified 13 studies. None of these studies fulfilled eligibility criteria for IPD pooling. Statistical heterogeneity, with respect to interstudy variance of treatment associations with clinical outcomes, was not significant, and inconsistency of results across participating studies was determined low to moderate. Risk of bias, evaluated using Cochrane Collaboration domains, was judged as low, as well as ROBINS-I evaluation, which showed overall moderate risk across all 4 studies.

Exploratory subgroup analyses showed a decreased odds to achieve favorable functional outcome at 3 months in patients with cerebellar ICH volumes of less than 14. 1 cm3 who had undergone surgical hematoma evacuation vs those who received conservative treatment, which were validated using observed data estimates (11/36 patients vs.

### Cost-effectiveness of surgical decompression for space-occupying hemispheric infarction [^114pM2JT]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Surgical decompression reduces mortality and increases the probability of a favorable functional outcome after space-occupying hemispheric infarction. Its cost-effectiveness is uncertain.

Methods

We assessed clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness for the first 3 years in patients who were randomized to surgical decompression or best medical treatment within 48 hours after symptom onset in the Hemicraniectomy After Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction With Life-Threatening Edema Trial (HAMLET). Data on medical consumption were derived from case record files, hospital charts, and general practitioners. We calculated costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Uncertainty was assessed with bootstrapping. A Markov model was constructed to estimate costs and health outcomes after 3 years.

Results

Of 39 patients enrolled within 48 hours, 21 were randomized to surgical decompression. After 3 years, 5 surgical (24%) and 14 medical patients (78%) had died. In the first 3 years after enrollment, operated patients had more QALYs than medically treated patients (mean difference, 1.0 QALY [95% confidence interval, 0.6–1.4]), but at higher costs (mean difference, €127,000 [95% confidence interval, 73,100–181,000]), indicating incremental costs of €127,000 per QALY gained. Ninety-eight percent of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios replicated by bootstrapping were > €80,000 per QALY gained. Markov modeling suggested costs of ≈€60,000 per QALY gained for a patient's lifetime.

Conclusions

Surgical decompression for space-occupying infarction results in an increase in QALYs, but at very high costs.

### Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction: clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, and future perspectives [^114nJVdD]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Space-occupying, malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarctions are still one of the most devastating forms of ischaemic stroke, with a mortality of up to 80% in untreated patients. An early diagnosis is essential and depends on CT and MRI to aid the prediction of a malignant course. Several pharmacological strategies have been proposed but the efficacy of these approaches has not been supported by adequate evidence from clinical trials and, until recently, treatment of malignant MCA infarctions has been a major unmet need. Over the past 3 years, results from randomised controlled trials and their pooled analyses have provided evidence that an early hemicraniectomy leads to a substantial decrease in mortality at 6 and 12 months and is likely to improve functional outcome. Hemicraniectomy is now in routine use for the clinical management of malignant MCA infarction in patients younger than 60 years of age. However, there are still important questions about the individual indication for decompressive surgery, particularly with regard to the ideal timing of hemicraniectomy, a potential cut-off age for the procedure, the hemisphere affected, and ethical considerations about functional outcome in surviving patients.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery territory infarction: is life worth living? [^1148xFpv]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Object

Although decompressive hemicraniectomy has been shown to reduce death and improve functional outcome following malignant middle cerebral artery territory infarction, there is ongoing debate as to whether surgery should be routinely performed, considering the very high rates of disability and functional dependence in survivors. Through a systematic review of the literature, the authors sought to determine the outcome from a patient's perspective.

Methods

In September 2010, a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature was performed using various combinations of 12 key words. A total of 16 papers were reviewed and individual study data were extracted.

Results

There was significant variability in study design, patient eligibility criteria, timing of surgery, and methods of outcome assessment. There were 382 patients (59% male, 41% female) with a mean age of 50 years, 25% with dominant-hemisphere infarction. The mortality rate was 24% and the mean follow-up in survivors was 19 months (range 3–114 months). Of 156 survivors with available modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, 41% had favorable functional outcome (mRS Score ≤ 3), whereas 47% had moderately severe disability (mRS Score 4). Among 157 survivors with quality of life assessment, the mean overall reduction was 45%: 67% for physical aspect and 37% for psychosocial aspect. Of 114 screened survivors, depression affected 56% and was moderate or severe in 25%. Most patients and/or caregivers (77% of the 209 interviewed) were satisfied and would give consent again for the procedure.

Conclusions

Despite high rates of physical disability and depression, the vast majority of patients are satisfied with life and do not regret having undergone surgery.

### Decompressive craniectomy for acute ischemic stroke [^117Sv2qH]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A long-term complication after DC is the syndrome of the trephined or sunken skin flap syndrome, which occurs weeks to months after DC and is often characterized by neurological deterioration after initial rehabilitative improvements. An obvious finding on clinical and radiological examinations of affected patients is the severely sunken sink flap overlying the craniectomy defect (Fig. 9), which is even more obvious in the vertical position and can be exacerbated by CSF diversion or significant atrophy of the infarcted territory. The pathophysiology of this syndrome appears to be a mismatch between atmospheric pressure and intracranial pressure, leading to the impairment of cerebral perfusion, venous drainage, and CSF dynamics. The vast majority of cases will significantly improve after cranioplasty.

Quality of life after DC

While the RCTs mentioned above were primarily looking at mortality and functional outcome (i.e. mRS within the first year), data on long-term outcome, quality of life, participation in activities of daily living and work, patient-reported outcomes, opinion of family and caregivers, and depression and anxiety is limited. For DESTINY II, the rates of retrospective consent obtained from survivors, assessment of quality of life (EQ-5D and SF-36 questionnaires), and frequency of major depression were published. Additionally, Rahme and co-workers as well as Woertgen and co-workers provide similar information. In summary, 60–80% of survivors and/or caregivers gave retrospective consent to DC, which indicates an at least acceptable outcome. Quality of life was impaired (mean overall reduction of almost 50%) and major depression occurred frequently (almost 60%), but both to an extent known from survivors of other significant cerebral insults. In a small series published by Vahedi and co-workers, no patient (mean age 41 years) returned to prior employment. Quality of life after DC for supratentorial malignant stroke appears to be acceptable for the majority of patients, and most do not regret having undergone DC despite relevant rates of impairment and depression. However, although Woertgen and co-workers indicate that no difference in quality of life was observed when comparing dominant and non-dominant hemisphere stroke patients, those with aphasia might be underrepresented especially in patient-reported outcomes and could be at higher risk of psychosocial impairment.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy for ischemic stroke in the pediatric population [^111Wk4d1]. Neurosurgical Review (2013). Low credibility.

Adult patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarctions have a poor prognosis, with an associated fatality rate of 80%. Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) has been studied as a treatment option for patients with malignant cerebral infarction refractory to maximal medical therapy, with reasonable outcomes demonstrated in the adult population if the patient is decompressed within 48 h. However, there are no randomized controlled trials in the pediatric literature to make the same claims. In this study, we evaluated the current literature in regards to DH following malignant stroke in the pediatric population. We found that excellent recovery, with an acceptable quality of life, is possible, particularly in the pediatric patient. Our cohort suggests that pediatric intervention beyond the 48-h time interval may still lead to positive outcomes, unlike adult patients. Regardless, randomized controlled trials are needed to determine optimal timing of intervention following symptom onset, as well as to identify predictors for positive outcome in the pediatric population.

### Attitudes of nurses toward disability and treatment in space-occupying middle cerebral artery stroke [^112hTX7m]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Attitudes toward the degree of acceptable disability and the importance of aphasia are critical in deciding on decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) in space-occupying middle cerebral artery stroke (SOS). The attitudes of nurses deserve strong attention, because of their close interaction with patients during acute stroke treatment.

Methods

This is a multicenter survey among 627 nurses from 132 hospitals in Germany. Questions address the acceptance of disability, importance of aphasia, and the preferred treatment in the hypothetical case of SOS.

Results

Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 1 and 2 were considered acceptable by the majority of all respondents (89.7%). A mRS of 3, 4, and 5 was considered acceptable by 60.0, 15.5, and 1.6%, respectively. DHC was indicated as the treatment of choice in 31.4%. Every third participant considered the presence of aphasia important for treatment decision (33.3%). Older respondents more often refrained from DHC, irrespective of the presence of aphasia (dominant hemisphere p = 0.001, non-dominant hemisphere p = 0.004). Differences regarding acceptable disability and treatment decision were dependent on age, sex, and having relatives with stroke.

Conclusion

Most German nurses indicate moderately severe disability after SOS not to be acceptable, without emphasizing the presence of aphasia. The results call for greater scientific efforts in order to find reliable predictors for outcome after SOS.

### Hemicraniectomy and moderate hypothermia in patients with severe ischemic stroke [^116s9SUM]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We compared the clinical course of 36 consecutive patients with severe acute ischemic stroke (more than two thirds of the middle cerebral artery territory) treated with hemicraniectomy (CE; n = 17) or moderate hypothermia (MH; n = 19) in terms of intracranial pressure control, mortality, and specific treatment parameters.

Methods

Over a period of 18 months, patients with severe ischemic stroke were treated with CE when the nondominant hemisphere was affected and with MH when the dominant hemisphere was affected. MH (33 degrees C) was induced with either cold blankets and fans (n = 11) or endovascular cooling (n = 8). Intracranial pressure was monitored invasively in all cases.

Results

Age, sex, cranial CT findings, level of consciousness, and time to treatment were similar between the 2 groups; significant differences were noted in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (20 [range, 18 to 22] and 17 [range, 16 to 18] for MH and CE, respectively) but were not present when NIHSS score was corrected for aphasia (17 [range, 15 to 19] and 17 [range, 16 to 18] for MH and CE, respectively). Mortality was 12% for CE and 47% for MH; 1 patient treated with MH died as a result of treatment complications (sepsis) and 3 of intracranial pressure crises that occurred during rewarming. Duration of mechanical ventilation and of neurological intensive care unit stay did not significantly differ, but duration of catecholamine application and maximal catecholamine dosage were significantly higher in the MH group.

Conclusions

In patients with severe ischemic stroke, CE results in lower mortality and lower complication rates compared with MH. Both treatment modalities, however, are associated with intensive medical treatment and a prolonged stay in the neurological intensive care unit.

Illustrative Case of Man Aged 41 Years With Dominant Hemisphere Insular Glioma That Underwent Awake Craniotomy Surgery, Demonstrating the Multidisciplinary Approach Established in Study Program.

Awake craniotomy represents a promising strategy that not only can reduce LOS but also may be a cost-effective treatment option. In fact, for appropriately selected patients, it has significant advantages over general anesthesia as it allows intraoperative stimulation for mapping of cortical function, dynamic functional monitoring of neurological status, and decreased hemodynamic fluctuation. 15–19 However, limited literature exists on the overall impact and benefit to hospitals in investing in these subspecialized and resource-intensive programs. In addition to the primary cost-utility assessment involving all patients, a subset cost-utility analysis was also conducted restricted to only patients with glioma. Propensity score matching was performed using SPSS Statistics, version 22, which sought to balance age, sex, World Health Organization grade, and isocitrate dehydrogenase variation status between the intervention and control patients.

Categorical variables were described using absolute and relative frequencies, while continuous variables were described using means and SDs or medians and IQRs. Patients undergoing surgery before and after standardization were compared in premorbid indicators, perioperative outcomes, and postoperative outcomes. Costs associated with both cohorts were compared via simple t test. Importantly, perioperative and postoperative outcomes, including extent of resection, new reported deficits, new seizures, 30-day readmission rates, and death, were not significantly increased with shorter LOS. The bypass of ICU for some patients freed up ICU beds for additional surgical procedures or patients in the ICU with higher overall acuity, which benefits the institution and these patients but was not accounted for in this analysis.

### Decompressive hemicraniectomy for large hemispheric strokes [^116UNxeF]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Large hemispheric infarcts occur in up to 10% of all ischemic strokes and can cause devastating disability. Significant research and clinical efforts have been made in hopes of mitigating the morbidity and mortality of this disease. Areas of interest include identifying predictors of malignant edema, optimizing medical and surgical techniques, selecting the patient population that would benefit most from decompressive hemicraniectomy, and studying the impact on quality of life of those who survive. Decompressive surgery can be a life-saving measure, and here we discuss the most up-to-date literature and provide a review on the surgical management of large hemispheric ischemic strokes.

### Hemicraniectomy in older patients with extensive middle-cerebral-artery stroke [^114TMVCU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Early decompressive hemicraniectomy reduces mortality without increasing the risk of very severe disability among patients 60 years of age or younger with complete or subtotal space-occupying middle-cerebral-artery infarction. Its benefit in older patients is uncertain.

Methods

We randomly assigned 112 patients 61 years of age or older (median, 70 years; range, 61 to 82) with malignant middle-cerebral-artery infarction to either conservative treatment in the intensive care unit (the control group) or hemicraniectomy (the hemicraniectomy group); assignments were made within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. The primary end point was survival without severe disability (defined by a score of 0 to 4 on the modified Rankin scale, which ranges from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) 6 months after randomization.

Results

Hemicraniectomy improved the primary outcome; the proportion of patients who survived without severe disability was 38% in the hemicraniectomy group, as compared with 18% in the control group (odds ratio, 2.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 7.49; P = 0.04). This difference resulted from lower mortality in the surgery group (33% vs. 70%). No patients had a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 2 (survival with no disability or slight disability); 7% of patients in the surgery group and 3% of patients in the control group had a score of 3 (moderate disability); 32% and 15%, respectively, had a score of 4 (moderately severe disability [requirement for assistance with most bodily needs]); and 28% and 13%, respectively, had a score of 5 (severe disability). Infections were more frequent in the hemicraniectomy group, and herniation was more frequent in the control group.

Conclusions

Hemicraniectomy increased survival without severe disability among patients 61 years of age or older with a malignant middle-cerebral-artery infarction. The majority of survivors required assistance with most bodily needs. (Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DESTINY II Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN21702227.).

### Strokectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction: experience and meta-analysis of current evidence [^1157Rsf3]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

For our cohort data analysis: continuous numeric variables are summarised as mean and standard error of the mean. The differences in the numeric variables of the two groups were evaluated with a Mann–Whitney U test for non-parametric statistical analysis. Chi-square with Fisher's exact test was employed to compare categorical data between the groups. Statistical significance was considered if p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.02 for Windows 10, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA.

For the systematic review, strokectomy data were analysed using patient outcomes from our data pooled with data from three strokectomy studies and compared to pooled hemicraniectomy data taken from our data and the hemicraniectomy studies "DECIMAL, DESTINY and HAMLET". In total, the pooled dataset consisted of 41 patients in the strokectomy group and 71 patients in the hemicraniectomy group. A good outcome was defined as mRS 0–3 with poor outcome separated into mRS 4 and 5 or death (mRS 6) at 12 months. Absolute risk reduction (ARR), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for our data and pooled data where possible. Chi-squared was used for the pooled dataset and Fisher's Exact test for our dataset to compare the two interventions.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^112MRgop]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Patient selection

We retrospectively analyzed a prospective cohort of consecutive patients undergoing DH for large MCA infarcts from May 2005 to April 2022, included in the Lille Decompressive Surgery Database. The Lille University Hospital serves as the only tertiary care center for a population of 4 million residents.

As part of our in‐house protocol, adults older than 18 years (an upper age limit of 60 years was upheld until the publication of the DESTINY II [Decompressive Surgery for the Treatment of Malignant Infarction of the Middle Cerebral Artery] trial in 2014), with ischemic stroke in MCA territory, with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 15 or higher, within the initial 48 h of stroke onset, and who had an infarct volume larger than 145 mL on diffusion‐weighted images (or an infarct involving at least two thirds of the MCA territory on computed tomography [CT] scan in patients with contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) underwent DH. Patients with life expectancy of less than a few years due to unrelated diseases, and those with signs of irreversible brainstem dysfunction do not undergo DH.

### Large diameter hemicraniectomy does not improve long-term outcome in malignant infarction [^1165LXxr]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite early prophylactic hemicraniectomy almost 20% of patients who suffer a malignant middle cerebral artery infarction still die. Most deaths occur early and are due to herniation which raises the question if some patients might benefit from a larger hemicraniectomy or if a larger hemicraniectomy in general could be beneficial. None of the hemicraniectomy RCTs provided data on the size of craniectomy or subgroup analyses concerning this issue. Only few data from observational studies are available comparing different sizes of craniectomy. Current guidelines recommend a diameter of the bone flap of at least 12 cm. The results of the current post-hoc analysis from a prospective, multicenter registry could not demonstrate a benefit from a large hemicraniectomy regarding mortality or long-term functional outcome compared to a standard hemicraniectomy in unselected patients with malignant infarction. Furthermore, the data analyses could not determine a certain hemicraniectomy diameter that was meaningfully associated with any of the prespecified outcomes. However, these observations need to be interpreted with caution due to the low percentage of patients treated with large hemicraniectomy at only a few of the participating centers, and due to the post-hoc approach of this analysis.

### Hemicraniectomy for massive middle cerebral artery territory infarction: a systematic review [^114crf2D]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Hemicraniectomy and durotomy have been proposed in many small series to relieve intracranial hypertension and tissue shifts in patients with large hemispheric infarcts, thereby preventing death from herniation. Our objective was to review the literature to identify patients most likely to benefit from hemicraniectomy.

Methods

All available individual cases from the English literature were reviewed and analyzed to determine whether age, vascular territory of infarction, side of infarction, reported time to surgery, and signs of herniation predict outcome in patients after hemicraniectomy. All studies included were retrospective and uncontrolled; there were no randomized controlled trials.

Results

Of 15 studies screened, 12 studies describing 129 patients met the criteria for analysis; 9 patients treated at our institution were added, for a total of 138 patients. After a minimum follow-up of 4 months, 10 patients (7%) were functionally independent, 48 (35%) were mildly to moderately disabled, and 80 (58%) died or were severely disabled. Of 75 patients who were > 50 years of age, 80% were dead or severely disabled compared with 32% of 63 patients ≤ 50 years of age (P < 0.00001). The timing of surgery, hemisphere infarcted, presence of signs of herniation before surgery, and involvement of other vascular territories did not significantly affect outcome.

Conclusions

Age may be a crucial factor in predicting functional outcome after hemicraniectomy in patients with large middle cerebral artery territory infarction.

Study appraisal and quality assessment

Following establishment of these criteria, search results were screened against title and abstract by two reviewers. If the reviewers disagreed on the inclusion/exclusion of a given study, resolution was pursued through the consultation of a third author who served as arbitrator until consensus decision was reached. Upon completion of the title and abstract screen, full texts for each study were scrutinized to determine the potential suitability of each study for inclusion in the final review. Furthermore, the references of all included studies were examined to identify any additional studies bearing relevance to our analysis that may have been missed during initial screening steps.

Next, every study meeting criteria for inclusion in the present study was assigned a risk of bias rating using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) scoring guidelines. The NOS criteria allow for a maximum of four points in selection, two points in comparability, and three points in outcome: the total range was 0–9. The results of this assessment along with a Level of Evidence designation for each study are listed in Table 1. A Levels of Evidence categorization system developed by the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine was utilized; this system assigns quality scores on a scale ranging from I (highest) to V (lowest). Level I studies consist of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of the highest caliber. Level II studies include RCTs with systematic or methodologic limitations, while Level III is assigned to most quality retrospective cohort studies. Most case series meet the criteria for Level IV evidence, while case reports and expert opinions are assigned Level V, the lowest quality evidentiary category.

### Management of stroke in neonates and children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1134aPrv]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Hemicraniectomy in pediatric arterial ischemic stroke — indications, outcomes, and timing: Although hemicraniectomy is rarely performed in childhood AIS (1%), it can be lifesaving in large supratentorial stroke, with 95% (39 of 41) surviving in the largest series; among survivors, 41% had no to moderate deficits and 59% had severe deficits, and 45% had a modified Rankin Scale score of 4/5. Adult randomized data show survival improvement with surgery from 29% to 78%. In children with large-volume infarcts (more than half of the MCA territory), teams should consider either early prophylactic hemicraniectomy within the first 24 hours or serial imaging within the first 72 hours to monitor swelling; outcomes are better when decompression is performed before herniation.

### Surgical decompression for space-occupying cerebral infarction (the hemicraniectomy after middle cerebral artery infarction with life-threatening edema trial [HAMLET]): a multicentre, open, randomised trial [^115zNa83]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarctions have a poor prognosis, with case fatality rates of up to 80%. In a pooled analysis of randomised trials, surgical decompression within 48 h of stroke onset reduced case fatality and improved functional outcome; however, the effect of surgery after longer intervals is unknown. The aim of HAMLET was to assess the effect of decompressive surgery within 4 days of the onset of symptoms in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction.

Methods

Patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction were randomly assigned within 4 days of stroke onset to surgical decompression or best medical treatment. The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 1 year, which was dichotomised between good (0–3) and poor (4–6) outcome. Other outcome measures were the dichotomy of mRS score between 4 and 5, case fatality, quality of life, and symptoms of depression. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN94237756.

Findings

Between November, 2002, and October, 2007, 64 patients were included; 32 were randomly assigned to surgical decompression and 32 to best medical treatment. Surgical decompression had no effect on the primary outcome measure (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 0%, 95% CI -21 to 21) but did reduce case fatality (ARR 38%, 15 to 60). In a meta-analysis of patients in DECIMAL (DEcompressive Craniectomy In MALignant middle cerebral artery infarction), DESTINY (DEcompressive Surgery for the Treatment of malignant INfarction of the middle cerebral arterY), and HAMLET who were randomised within 48 h of stroke onset, surgical decompression reduced poor outcome (ARR 16%, -0.1 to 33) and case fatality (ARR 50%, 34 to 66).

Interpretation

Surgical decompression reduces case fatality and poor outcome in patients with space-occupying infarctions who are treated within 48 h of stroke onset. There is no evidence that this operation improves functional outcome when it is delayed for up to 96 h after stroke onset. The decision to perform the operation should depend on the emphasis patients and relatives attribute to survival and dependency.

### Surgical decompression for space-occupying hemispheric infarction: a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113hEx2H]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

In patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction, surgical decompression reduces the risk of death and increases the chance of a favorable outcome. Uncertainties, however, still remain about the benefit of this treatment for specific patient groups.

Objective

To assess whether surgical decompression for space-occupying hemispheric infarction is associated with a reduced risk of death and an increased chance of favorable outcomes, as well as whether this association is modified by patient characteristics.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Stroke Trials Registry were searched from database inception to October 9, 2019, for English-language articles that reported on the results of randomized clinical trials of surgical decompression vs conservative treatment in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarction.

Study Selection

Published and unpublished randomized clinical trials comparing surgical decompression with medical treatment alone were selected.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Patient-level data were extracted from the trial databases according to a predefined protocol and statistical analysis plan. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias were used. One-stage, mixed-effect logistic regression modeling was used for all analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≤ 3) at 1 year after stroke. Secondary outcomes included death, reasonable (mRS score ≤ 4) and excellent (mRS score ≤ 2) outcomes at 6 months and 1 year, and an ordinal shift analysis across all levels of the mRS. Variables for subgroup analyses were age, sex, presence of aphasia, stroke severity, time to randomization, and involved vascular territories.

Results

Data from 488 patients from 7 trials from 6 countries were available for analysis. The risk of bias was considered low to moderate for 6 studies. Surgical decompression was associated with a decreased chance of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10–0.24) and increased chance of a favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.55–5.60), without evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across any of the prespecified subgroups. Too few patients were treated later than 48 hours after stroke onset to allow reliable conclusions in this subgroup, and the reported proportions of elderly patients reaching a favorable outcome differed considerably among studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results suggest that the benefit of surgical decompression for space-occupying hemispheric infarction is consistent across a wide range of patients. The benefit of surgery after day 2 and in elderly patients remains uncertain.
