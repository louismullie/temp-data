## Question

Mounjaro and hypoglycemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk of hypoglycemia with Mounjaro (tirzepatide) and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and whether tirzepatide's insulin secretion is glucose-dependent. Then, I should verify what the FDA label says about hypoglycemia risk and drug interactions. Next, I will review pivotal trial data to quantify risk in different scenarios, including monotherapy, combination with sulfonylureas, and combination with insulin. After that, I should consider special populations and real-world evidence. Finally, I will synthesize practical management steps and counseling points, making sure I double-check any conflicting numbers before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because that drives hypoglycemia risk. Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and suppresses glucagon, which should intrinsically limit hypoglycemia risk when used alone, unlike agents that stimulate insulin release regardless of glucose level [^111N4usc] [^111CWCvJ].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory guidance before drawing conclusions. The FDA labeling explicitly warns that the risk of hypoglycemia increases when tirzepatide is combined with insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas or with insulin, and it advises reducing the dose of the secretagogue or insulin to mitigate that risk, which aligns with the mechanistic expectation of additive effects [^1123JSJF] [^112Xvjd5].

> Next, I should review the pivotal trial data to quantify risk in real-world combinations. In SURPASS-4, when tirzepatide was added to background therapy that included sulfonylureas, clinically significant hypoglycemia occurred in roughly 10–14% of participants, whereas in those not on sulfonylureas it was about 1–3%, confirming a marked interaction signal with secretagogues [^11268c9n] [^115txyUF]. Hold on, I should double-check the insulin data too; in SURPASS-5, which added tirzepatide to basal insulin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was similar to placebo, suggesting careful titration can keep risk low, though vigilance remains essential [^115txyUF].

> I will now examine monotherapy and non-secretagogue combinations to ensure I'm not overstating baseline risk. In SURPASS-1 (monotherapy), SURPASS-2 (with metformin), and SURPASS-3 (with metformin ± SGLT2 inhibitor), hypoglycemia rates were very low, typically around 1–2% for glucose less than 54 mg/dL, consistent with the glucose-dependent mechanism and the absence of secretagogue co-therapy [^115txyUF] [^1162jnPT] [^111RqRWN]. Let me reconsider the exact numbers; yes, across these trials the rates remained in the low single digits when tirzepatide was not paired with sulfonylureas or insulin, reinforcing a low intrinsic hypoglycemia risk profile [^115txyUF].

> But wait, what about head-to-head comparisons with insulin to anchor clinical significance. In SURPASS-3 versus insulin degludec, hypoglycemia less than 54 mg/dL occurred in about 1–2% with tirzepatide versus 7% with degludec, and in SURPASS-4 versus insulin glargine, it was about 6–9% with tirzepatide versus 19% with glargine, again with the caveat that background sulfonylurea use inflated risk in some tirzepatide arms, which is why dose reduction of secretagogues is advised [^1162jnPT] [^116tx1Rw] [^1123JSJF].

> I need to check special populations and real-world signals. In older adults and those with lower BMI, post hoc analyses show hypoglycemia incidence remains low and consistent with the overall cohort when secretagogues are avoided, supporting use with appropriate caution and monitoring in these groups [^113TtX6Z] [^112NvYy9]. Real-world switching data also report no severe hypoglycemia events after switching from dulaglutide to tirzepatide, although many patients remained on insulin or sulfonylureas, so proactive dose adjustments are prudent [^115VT5pi].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact hypoglycemia thresholds used across studies to avoid misclassification. Most analyses define clinically significant hypoglycemia as glucose less than 54 mg/dL and severe as requiring assistance; these are the same definitions reflected in the FDA materials and pivotal publications, which facilitates cross-trial comparisons and aligns with guideline conventions [^1163Ni6L] [^115txyUF].

> Next, I should review practical management steps. When initiating or escalating tirzepatide in patients on sulfonylureas or insulin, I need to ensure preemptive dose reduction of the secretagogue or insulin to mitigate additive hypoglycemia risk, then titrate based on glucose monitoring and symptoms, consistent with label guidance and endocrine practice recommendations [^1123JSJF] [^112Xvjd5] [^1179Vyeg]. Let me double-check that CGM is not mandated; it is not required, but in patients at higher hypoglycemia risk or with hypoglycemia unawareness, CGM can be a valuable tool to guide safe titration and detect nocturnal lows [^1178XRQN].

> I should confirm patient counseling elements. Patients should be educated to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia, carry fast-acting carbohydrates, and understand that risk rises with sulfonylureas or insulin, which is emphasized in FDA patient counseling sections and aligns with standard diabetes education practices [^115ECy8a] [^1123JSJF]. If they experience recurrent or severe episodes, I need to reassess concomitant medications and consider further dose reductions or regimen simplification to reduce risk [^1123JSJF].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line, and I will double-check for internal consistency. Tirzepatide has a low intrinsic risk of hypoglycemia due to glucose-dependent insulin secretion, with rates around 1–2% in the absence of sulfonylureas or insulin, and substantially higher, roughly 10–14%, when combined with sulfonylureas; insulin combinations can also increase risk, but careful titration and dose reduction of the secretagogue or insulin mitigate this, as shown in SURPASS-5 and reflected in labeling [^115txyUF] [^11268c9n] [^1123JSJF] [^1163Ni6L]. Clinically, I should proactively adjust sulfonylurea or insulin doses when starting tirzepatide, monitor for symptoms, and consider CGM in higher-risk patients to safely capture the glycemic and weight benefits without excess hypoglycemia [^112Xvjd5].

Mounjaro (tirzepatide) has a **low inherent risk of hypoglycemia** [^111N4usc] because its insulin secretion is glucose-dependent [^111N4usc]. Hypoglycemia risk rises when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^1123JSJF]; in such cases, **reduce the dose of insulin or sulfonylurea** [^112Xvjd5] to lower risk [^1123JSJF]. Clinically significant hypoglycemia occurred in 0.6–1.7% with tirzepatide alone [^111RqRWN] versus 13.8–15.3% with sulfonylureas and 14–19% with insulin in trials [^1163Ni6L] [^111o9vAN] [^115txyUF]. Educate patients on hypoglycemia recognition and management [^115ECy8a], and monitor glucose closely when combining with insulin secretagogues [^111idjKJ].

---

## Mechanism of action and hypoglycemia risk

Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist [^111N4usc] that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon, thereby limiting hypoglycemia risk when used alone [^1159HT6X]. This glucose-dependent effect means insulin release diminishes as glucose levels fall, reducing the likelihood of hypoglycemia [^111N4usc].

---

## Clinical trial evidence on hypoglycemia

Across the SURPASS program, tirzepatide demonstrated **low inherent hypoglycemia risk** [^115txyUF] when used alone or with metformin, with higher rates when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^1123JSJF]:

| **Trial** | **Regimen** | **Hypoglycemia incidence (< 54 mg/dl or severe)** |
|-|-|-|
| SURPASS-1 | Monotherapy | 0.6% (5 mg), 0.2% (10 mg), 1.7% (15 mg) [^notfound] |
| SURPASS-2 | vs semaglutide 1 mg | 0.6% (5 mg), 0.2% (10 mg), 1.7% (15 mg) [^111RqRWN] |
| SURPASS-3 | vs insulin degludec | 1% (5 mg), 1% (10 mg), 2% (15 mg) vs 7% (degludec) [^1162jnPT] |
| SURPASS-4 | vs insulin glargine | 6–9% (tirzepatide) vs 19% (glargine) [^116tx1Rw] |
| SURPASS-5 | With basal insulin | 14–19% (tirzepatide) vs 13% (placebo) [^115txyUF] |

---

With sulfonylureas, **hypoglycemia incidence** was 13.8% (5 mg), 9.9% (10 mg), and 12.8% (15 mg) [^1163Ni6L], with severe events in 0.5–0.6% [^1163Ni6L]. With insulin, **SURPASS-5** showed 14–19% hypoglycemia with tirzepatide versus 13% with placebo, consistent with additive risk when combined with insulin [^115txyUF].

---

## Factors influencing hypoglycemia risk

Several factors influence **hypoglycemia risk** with tirzepatide:

- **Concomitant medications**: Insulin and sulfonylureas significantly increase risk [^1123JSJF]; dose reduction is recommended [^112Xvjd5].
- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is required, but monitor closely in advanced CKD [^1179Vyeg].
- **Age and comorbidities**: Older adults and those with comorbidities may have higher risk; monitor closely [^113q7zP1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce insulin or sulfonylurea dose when starting tirzepatide to mitigate hypoglycemia risk [^1123JSJF] [^112Xvjd5].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients on hypoglycemia recognition and management [^115ECy8a].
- **Monitoring**: Regular glucose monitoring is recommended, especially when combined with insulin secretagogues [^111idjKJ].

---

## Comparison with other antihyperglycemic agents

Tirzepatide has a **lower inherent hypoglycemia risk** than insulin and sulfonylureas, which carry higher hypoglycemia risk due to non–glucose-dependent insulin secretion [^117DKbij]. Compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists, tirzepatide has similar or lower hypoglycemia risk, likely due to its dual incretin action and glucose-dependent insulin secretion [^111RqRWN].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain populations require **heightened vigilance**:

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk due to reduced counterregulatory responses and comorbidities [^113q7zP1].
- **Patients with renal impairment**: Monitor closely in advanced CKD [^1179Vyeg].
- **Patients with cardiovascular disease**: Monitor closely due to potential cardiovascular implications of hypoglycemia [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management strategies

To manage hypoglycemia risk with tirzepatide:

- **Dose titration**: Start low and titrate gradually to minimize gastrointestinal side effects and hypoglycemia risk [^115yHGJT].
- **Medication adjustment**: Reduce insulin or sulfonylurea dose when initiating tirzepatide [^1123JSJF] [^112Xvjd5].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients on hypoglycemia symptoms and management [^115ECy8a].
- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor glucose levels closely, especially during dose adjustments or when adding new medications [^111idjKJ].

---

## Long-term safety considerations

Long-term data indicate sustained glycemic control and weight loss with **low hypoglycemia risk** when tirzepatide is used appropriately [^112q6WAU]. Continued vigilance is warranted, particularly in patients on insulin or sulfonylureas [^1123JSJF].

---

Mounjaro (tirzepatide) has a **low inherent hypoglycemia risk** due to glucose-dependent insulin secretion [^111N4usc], but risk increases with insulin or sulfonylureas [^1123JSJF]. Dose adjustment, patient education, and regular monitoring are key to minimizing hypoglycemia risk [^111idjKJ].

5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

Patients receiving MOUNJARO in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported in patients treated with MOUNJARO. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of MOUNJARO; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Do not use in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in MOUNJARO [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with MOUNJARO.

5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, or MOUNJARO [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal adverse reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to MOUNJARO that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of MOUNJARO.

5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Use of MOUNJARO has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO (5 mg 1.3%, 10 mg 0.4%, 15 mg 1.2%) than placebo (0.9%).

MOUNJARO is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis.

### Weight loss in people with type 1 diabetes over 12 months: real-world data comparing tirzepatide, semaglutide and liraglutide [^1179wQyZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study aimed to compare the effects of tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide on body weight and metabolic risk markers over 12months in people with body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m² and type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Methods

This real-world study included 250 people with obesity and T1D (female = 54.8%), treated with either tirzepatide (n = 35), semaglutide (n = 36), liraglutide (n = 97) or usual care (n = 82). Secondary outcomes included changes in lipid profile, renal and liver markers, blood pressure, and HbA1c.

Results

All three agents led to significant weight loss. Tirzepatide showed the greatest reduction of weight loss (10.9%; p < 0.001), followed by semaglutide (9.9%; p < 0.001) and liraglutide (7.1%; p < 0.001). Dose-dependent reductions were observed for tirzepatide and semaglutide. Tirzepatide, semaglutide and liraglutide modestly reduced HbA1c by 0.65% (p = 0.004), 0.33% (p = 0.034) and 0.23% (p = 0.017), respectively. LDL-cholesterol was reduced by semaglutide (p = 0.05) and liraglutide (p = 0.02), and liraglutide also lowered the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (p = 0.007). There was no change in body weight and HbA1c in the usual care group. No severe hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events were reported in any group.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide reduced bodyweight and improved in selected metabolic risk markers over 12months without increasing the risk for hypoglycaemia or DKA. Weight loss appeared less compared with patients without diabetes. Tirzepatide, semaglutide and liraglutide modestly improved glycaemic control in adults with T1D and obesity. These findings support the potential adjunctive role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with obesity and T1D and underscore the need for further validation through randomized controlled trials.

Composite Endpoint Achievement

Graphical plots of the percentage of participants in each treatment arm achieving the composite endpoint (defined as HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, weight reduction ≥ 10%, and no hypoglycemia [blood glucose < 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia]) stratified by subgroup (duration of T2D, baseline HbA1c, baseline BMI, age, and sex) are depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Baseline HbA1c and weight for each trial–subgroup combination are presented in Table 2. In all five SURPASS trials, across all three tirzepatide doses (5, 10, 15 mg) and within each respective participant subgroup, the percentage of participants achieving the composite endpoint was greater among participants treated with tirzepatide than among those who received placebo or an active comparator and was evident even in trials that included concomitant antihyperglycemic medications that are associated with weight gain and increased risk of hypoglycemia. As depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, there was generally a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of tirzepatide-treated participants who achieved the composite endpoint regardless of subgroup. In the subgroup analysis of SURPASS-1 duration of diabetes, > 10 years, SURPASS-5 duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years, SURPASS-1 BMI 30 to < 35 kg/m² and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², SURPASS-5 age ≥ 65 years, SURPASS-1 and -5 male participants, and SURPASS-4 female participants, a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of participants who achieved the composite endpoint was not observed; however, the number of participants in each of the dose groups within these subgroups also tended to be smaller.

### Incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes in adults living with obesity treated with tirzepatide or semaglutide: real world evidence from an international retrospective cohort study [^113YE5RA]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide, a novel dual agonist of glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), has demonstrated greater magnitude of weight loss compared to semaglutide in a phase 3 clinical trial. However, the effect of tirzepatide on incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in individuals with overweight and obesity, and the effect on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with pre-existing T2D, remains unknown.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of anonymised electronic medical records using the TriNetX network (TriNetX LLC, Cambridge, MA, USA) a global federated database. The data used in this study was collected on 5th June 2024. Two cohorts of individuals were generated: 1) without pre-existing T2D and, 2) with T2D. We adopted an active comparator new user design on new initiations of either tirzepatide or semaglutide therapy. Analysis began from the index event which was defined as individuals on respective therapy for 6 months only. Analysis of outcomes was conducted off-drug, in individuals without a pre-existing history of the disease of interest. Individuals were followed up for 12 months post the index event. Primary outcome for cohort 1 was incidence of T2D, and for cohort 2 was composite: all-cause mortality, cerebral infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure. Secondary outcomes for cohort 1 were change in HbA1c and body weight and for cohort 2: incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, suicidal ideation and/or attempt, and all-cause mortality. We propensity score matched (1:1) for potential confounders: baseline demographics, socioeconomic circumstances, HbA1c, weight, relevant co-morbidities, and anti-obesity, hypoglycaemic and cardioprotective agents.

Findings

The study population without T2D consisted of 13,846 individuals, equally split between tirzepatide and semaglutide users. Tirzepatide was associated with both lower risk for incident T2D (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58–0.92, p < 0.001) and greater weight loss (-7.7 kg, [95% CI -6.8, -8.5 kg], p < 0.001), compared to semaglutide (-4.8 kg, [95% CI -3.9, -5.6 kg], p < 0.001). In individuals with pre-existing T2D (n = 8446), tirzepatide was associated with lower risk of the composite outcome (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38–0.76, p < 0.001), cerebral infarction (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24–0.84, p = 0.010) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.73, p = 0.004) compared to semaglutide.

Interpretation

Tirzepatide is associated with significantly reduced risk of developing T2D and major adverse cardiovascular events in individuals living with obesity and T2D respectively. Randomised controlled trials investigating the utility of dual incretin agonists in the primary prevention of T2D and cardiovascular disease in higher risk populations are now required.

### Meta-analysis of head-to-head clinical trials comparing incretin-based glucose-lowering medications and basal insulin: an update including recently developed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide [^117DKbij]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess comparative efficacy, safety and tolerability of injectable incretin-based glucose-lowering medications (IBGLMs) versus basal insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of head-to-head comparisons of IBGLMs (short- and long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide) versus basal insulin using a PubMed database search (April 2022). The primary endpoint was difference in reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA₁c) versus baseline between pooled IBGLMs (fixed-effects meta-analysis) and their subgroups (random-effects meta-analysis) versus basal insulin treatment (mean differences). Secondary endpoints were fasting plasma glucose, body weight, HbA₁c target achievement, hypoglycaemia, blood pressure and lipids. Risk of bias assessment was performed using Jadad scores and the Risk of Bias tool 2.0.

Results

In all, 20 studies, representing 47 study arms and 11843 patients, were eligible. Compared with basal insulin, IGBLMs lowered HbA₁c by 0.48 (0.45–0.52)% more than did basal insulin treatment. This effect was driven by pooled long-acting GLP-1RAs (ΔHbA₁c -0.25 [-0.38; -0.11]%) and the only GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, tirzepatide (pooled doses; ΔHbA₁c -0.90 [-1.06; -0.75]%), while short-acting GLP-1RAs were equally effective compared with basal insulin (P = 0.90). All IBGLM subgroups achieved significantly lower body weight versus insulin treatment (-4.6 [-4.7; -4.4] kg), in particular tirzepatide (-12.0 [-13.8; -10.1] kg). IBGLMs significantly reduced hypoglycaemia and blood pressure and improved lipid variables. Risk of bias was low. IBGLM treatment was associated with more nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and study medication discontinuation.

Conclusions

Recently introduced, highly effective IBGLMs were superior to basal insulin treatment, reinforcing the recommendation that IBGLMs should be considered as the first injectable treatment for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

### The new dual gastric inhibitory peptide / glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes: is the future bright? [^112X3TUk]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a dual gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GIP/GLP-1) receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic linear peptide, based on the native GIP sequence. It has a prolonged half-life of 5 days, which enables once-weekly dosing. Studies have hitherto demonstrated its superiority in achieving optimal glycaemic control and body weight management, as compared with various agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including GLP-1 receptor agonists. Thus, it is expected to enrich our therapeutic armamentarium in T2DM. However, further experience, notably longer follow-up data and information on cardiovascular effects, is still needed.

### Tirzepatide after intensive lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity: the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 trial [^1147vAtJ]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-3 was published by Thomas A Wadden and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in adult patients with overweight or obesity who underwent intensive lifestyle intervention? In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the population was: 579 patients (364 female, 215 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m² and at least one obesity-related complication, who achieved ≥ 5.0% weight reduction after a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM, T2DM, ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar state/coma; self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg within 3 months before screening; previous planned surgical treatment for obesity; history of chronic or acute pancreatitis. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the interventions were: n = 287 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maximum tolerated dose of 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 72 weeks) n = 292 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (18.4% vs. -2.5%; ARD 20.8, 95% CI 18.5 to 23.2). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (87.5% vs. 16.5%; OR 34.6, 95% CI 19.2 to 62.6) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (76.7% vs. 8.9%; OR 34.7, 95% CI 17.6 to 68.3) Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference (14.6 cm vs. -0.2 cm; AD 14.8 cm, 95% CI 12.5 to 17.2). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with a BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m² and at least one obesity-related complication, who achieved ≥ 5.0% weight reduction after a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity [^1128YgBB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) was published by Ania M Jastreboff and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of high-dose tirzepatide in people with obesity? In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the population was: 1273 patients (861 female, 412 male). The inclusion criteria were adults with a BMI > 30 kg/m², or > 27 kg/m² and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; a change in body weight > 5 kg within 90 days before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with a medication that promotes weight loss within 90 days before screening. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 630 high-dose tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 15 mg once weekly for a total of 72 weeks) n = 643 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (20.9% vs. 3.1%; AD 17.8%, 95% CI 16.3 to 19.3). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (90.9% vs. 34.5%; AD 56.4%, 95% CI 22.93 to 89.87) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (83.5% vs. 18.8%; AD 64.7%, 95% CI 26.31 to 103.09) Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference (18.5 cm vs. 4 cm; AD 14.5 cm, 95% CI 5.9 to 23.1). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adults with a BMI > 30 kg/m², or > 27 kg/m² and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes, high-dose tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^114hCMpb]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

AACE 2022 diabetes — tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes: Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is recently approved by the FDA for improvement in glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes. A systematic analysis of several completed trials with a total of 6609 participants confirmed dose-dependent superiority on glycemic efficacy at 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly subcutaneous administration, with reduction in body weight versus placebo, GLP-1 RAs, and basal insulin. Tirzepatide was associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events but no increase in risk of hypoglycemia, appears useful for those already on metformin therapy, and based on early data and ongoing trials (including a cardiovascular outcomes trial) additional clinical indications for weight loss and/or cardiovascular risk reduction may be sought.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^113rxBvM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and participants

This post‐hoc analysis is based on data from the SURPASS‐4 study (NCT03730662), a multicenter, randomised, open‐label, parallel‐group, Phase III trial in which participants were randomised to add tirzepatide or insulin glargine to 1–3 OADs. The SURPASS‐4 study design has been previously published.SURPASS‐4 study included participants with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control while on metformin, sulfonylurea, or sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy and increased cardiovascular risk.

2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

In this post‐hoc analysis, participants were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol) to ≤ 10.5% (≤ 91 mmol/mol) at Visit 1, used metformin and/or sulfonylurea, body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m² or more, and stable weight for the previous 3 months with increased cardiovascular risk, defined as a history of cardiovascular events or the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Exclusion criteria were the same as the SURPASS‐4 study, that is, the presence of type 1 diabetes, active liver disease, and history of pancreatitis. In addition, we excluded participants receiving SGLT2 inhibitor.

2.3 Randomisation and masking

In SURPASS‐4, participants were randomised to receive either tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) once weekly or insulin glargine once daily (1:1:1:3). Tirzepatide was initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg, followed by dose escalation by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to improve tolerability. Glargine (100 U/mL) was titrated to reach FBG of less than 100 mg/dL as previously described. The dose adjustment in insulin glargine is presented in the SURPASS‐4 study. This analysis included participants who had received metformin, sulfonylurea, or a combination of metformin and sulfonylurea. The treatment period lasted for 104 weeks.

### Tirzepatide (Zepbound) [^113BSCrE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tirzepatide SC (also known as Mounjaro, Zepbound):
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Discontinue tirzepatide if acute pancreatitis is suspected.
- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: use caution in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Exacerbation of diabetic retinopathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Monitor for progression of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Exacerbation of gastrointestinal disorders**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Avoid using tirzepatide in patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders, including severe gastroparesis.
- **Gallbladder disease**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other chronic weight management products. Monitor for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and/or changes in mood or behavior. Avoid using tirzepatide in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation. Discontinue tirzepatide if suicidal thoughts or behaviors occur.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^112NTJGe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety data at 104weeks in tirzepatide-treated participants with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and/or sulfonylurea.

Materials and Methods

This post-hoc analysis was based on the SURPASS-4 data (NCT03730662), a multicenter, Phase III trial. Participants were randomised to receive tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15mg) or insulin glargine. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 104weeks. Key secondary endpoints were changes in body weight and the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c < 7.0%. Safety endpoints included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemia.

Results

This post-hoc analysis included 1,500 participants. At Week 104, participants in the tirzepatide groups had significantly greater mean reduction in HbA1c (5mg: -2.3%, 10mg: -2.5%, 15mg: -2.6%) compared with the insulin glargine group (-1.0%) (p < 0.001). Participants in the tirzepatide groups had significantly greater reduction in body weight (5mg: -7.6kg, 10mg: -10.0kg, 15mg: -11.4kg) compared with the insulin glargine group (2.1kg) (p < 0.001). Significantly more participants in the tirzepatide group achieved HbA1c < 7.0% compared with the insulin glargine group (p < 0.001). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the tirzepatide groups, and gastrointestinal AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide significantly improved glycaemic control and body weight reduction compared to insulin glargine over 104weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and/or sulfonylurea. The safety profile of tirzepatide was acceptable, with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than insulin glargine.

Hypoglycaemia

The incidence of hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 3 mmol/L) or severe hypoglycaemia (requiring assistance for treatment) with tirzepatide was generally low across SURPASS-1–5. Risk increased with concomitant sulfonylurea or insulin use; for example among tirzepatide-treated participants in SURPASS-4, hypoglycaemia was reported by 10–14% of those using SU at baseline compared with 1–3% of those not using an SU.

Cardiovascular Safety

There was no increased CV risk with tirzepatide compared with insulin glargine in the SURPASS-4 study, which enrolled participants with high CV risk. Additionally, tirzepatide did not increase the risk of CV events versus controls (active comparator or placebo) in a prespecified CV safety meta-analysis of 7215 clinical trial participants: hazard ratio for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-4; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalisation for unstable angina) 0.80 (95% CI 0.57–1.11) (Fig. S4, Supplementary Appendix). The median duration of follow-up for this analysis was 55 weeks; longer follow-up may have been needed to demonstrate benefit.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced with tirzepatide in all SURPASS trials in a dose-dependent manner. As seen with GLP-1RA clinical trials, small increases in pulse rate occurred in the SURPASS studies; mean pulse rates did not differ significantly between the tirzepatide- and semaglutide-treated groups in SURPASS-2.

The ongoing CV outcomes trial, SURPASS-CVOT, will compare tirzepatide with dulaglutide (a GLP-1RA with established cardiovascular protection) in approximately 12,500 participants with T2D and atherosclerotic CV disease. The study started recruiting in May 2020 and completion is anticipated in October 2024 (maximum treatment duration approximately 54 months).

Adverse Events of Special Interest

Adverse events of special interest with incretin-based therapies include medullary thyroid carcinoma, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and diabetic retinopathy.

No cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma were reported during SURPASS-1–5, and pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and diabetic retinopathy were reported in fewer than 1% of participants receiving any dose of tirzepatide or control (Table S3, Supplementary Appendix).

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^113TtX6Z]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2021, over 20% of individuals aged 65–95 years globally were living with diabetes, with type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounting for 96% of all cases. This high prevalence reflects a 60% increase in age-standardized T2D prevalence worldwide. The affected demographic spans individuals who remain employed to those requiring supportive care with complex health needs. The demographics of this population vary and include both those who are still in employment and those requiring supportive care with complex health care needs. In addition to enhanced safety, improved cardiovascular outcomes, and improved quality of life, treatment considerations for adults over 65 living with T2D should also include factors such as changes in functional status, comorbidities, and estimated life expectancy. Additionally, clinical profiles and treatment considerations for adults over 65 are unique with considerations for changes in body composition, insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissues, increasing frailty, and polypharmacy.

Tirzepatide is a once-weekly GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for treating T2D and obesity. Among incretin-based therapies, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) exert both insulinotropic and glucagonostatic actions with additional cardiovascular benefits. Because GLP-1 acts in a glucose-dependent manner, GLP-1 RAs are not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia unless they are combined with insulin secretagogues or insulin therapies. Of note, the use of tirzepatide, which exerts additional action at the pancreas to lower fasting and postprandial glucagon levels in adults with T2D, was not associated with differences in the mean change in glucagon during an induced hypoglycemia compared to placebo. Additionally, GLP-1 RAs exhibit weight reduction effects proportional to baseline weight. Furthermore, in participants with obesity without diabetes, tirzepatide was not associated with an excess risk of hypoglycemia.

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^112NvYy9]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide has been shown to reduce both elevated glucose levels and body weight in East Asian participants with T2D who had an average BMI of 28 kg/m² without increasing the rate of underweight and while maintaining an adverse event (AE) profile consistent with that of the global study population. A better understanding of the weight loss effects, hypoglycemic risk, and safety considerations for tirzepatide is necessary among participants who may require a more conservative treatment approach. Such participants may have greater age, lower BMI, and other treatment-related considerations.

While the World Health Organization suggests that a healthy BMI for adults ranges from 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m² on the basis of relative risk of some diseases related to overweight or obesity, this may not be suitable for older adults due to multiple factors including age-related physiological changes and chronic disease. A higher BMI range of 25–35 kg/m 2 has been proposed based on reduced mortality risk in older adults. A prior publication assessing the effect of baseline subgroups on the efficacy of tirzepatide in adults with T2D found that neither baseline age (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years) nor BMI (< 30, 30 to < 35, ≥ 35 kg/m 2) had a significant effect on the ability of participants to achieve HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, attain a weight reduction of ≥ 10%, or increase the risk of hypoglycemia. The present post hoc analysis of the SURPASS 1–5 phase 3 clinical trial program evaluated the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in a pooled population of older participants (aged 65 years or older) without obesity (BMI of < 30 kg/m²), compared to that of the overall participant population.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity in people with type 2 diabetes (SURMOUNT-2): a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^111XbLk3]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) was published by W Timothy Garvey and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of once-weekly tirzepatide in patients with obesity and T2DM? In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the population was: 627 patients (317 female, 310 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and HbA1c 7–10%. The key exclusion criteria were change in bodyweight > 5 kg within 3 months before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with anti-obesity medications, DPP4 inhibitors, oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, or any injectable therapy for T2DM within 3 months before screening. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 312 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 10 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 72 weeks) n = 315 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in body weight at week 72 (12.8% vs. 3.2%; ETD 9.6, 95% CI 8.1 to 11.1). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (79% vs. 32%; OR 8.3, 95% CI 5.6 to 12.3) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (61% vs. 9%; OR 16.1, 95% CI 9.9 to 26.1) Significant increase in reduction in HbA1c at week 72 (2.07% vs. 0.51%; ETD 1.55, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.74). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse events or serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and HbA1c 7–10%, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to a least-squares mean reduction in body weight at week 72.

### Effects of the switch from dulaglutide to tirzepatide on glycemic control, body weight, and fatty liver: a retrospective study [^115VT5pi]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the strong blood glucose-lowering effect of tirzepatide, no patient experienced severe hypoglycemia during the observational period in this study. Although glycemic control is beneficial in patients with diabetes, severe hypoglycemia can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, progression of dementia, and fractures. Among the patients in our study, 55% of patients had agents that can induce hypoglycemia, such as insulin, sulfonylureas, and glinide. As tirzepatide has a strong blood glucose-lowering effect, appropriately evaluating the risk of hypoglycemia and considering a reduction of the dose of antidiabetic agents may be necessary.

In our study, a mean BW reduction of 3.6 kg was observed after switching from dulaglutide to tirzepatide. Excessive BW is also associated with cardiovascular complications and all-cause mortality. Therefore, switching from dulaglutide to tirzepatide may be beneficial for obese patients. The SURPASS J-mono study revealed a mean BW reduction of 5.8 kg after 52 weeks in patients receiving tirzepatide 5 mg/week. Among the 3.6 kg reduction of BW, approximately 80% of BW reduction was observed in the first 3 months after the switching, and another 20% was observed in the next 3 months. Although we cannot give a clear reason for the reduced weight loss effect in the second half of our study, there are several possibilities. First, In the SURPASS J-mono trial, two-thirds of the total BW reduction in patients receiving tirzepatide 5 mg/week was observed in the first 12 weeks. However, in the tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg/week groups, BW reduction was observed for a longer duration. Thus, the small BW reduction in the last 3 months of our study may be attributed to the doses of tirzepatide. Second, the impact of tirzepatide on muscle mass should be considered. Previous reports showed that the blockade of glucagon action in mice increases skeletal muscle. Clinical report showed that tirzepatide increases muscle mass through the suppression of postprandial glucagon secretion. The attenuated weight loss effect in the second half of treatment may have been masked by an increase in muscle mass. However, we did not evaluate body composition in this study.

Hypoglycemia

As noted in the primary trials, tirzepatide treatment was generally associated with low rates of hypoglycemia < 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia (0–0.03 aggregated rate per year) when used on its own. However, when tirzepatide was used in combination with agents known to increase the risk of hypoglycemia (SURPASS-4 [add-on to any combination of metformin, sulfonylurea, and/or SGLT2i] and SURPASS-5 [add-on to insulin glargine ± metformin]), the aggregated rate of hypoglycemia per year ranged from 0.14 to 0.16 and from 0.43 to 0.64, respectively. Within each trial, the incidence of hypoglycemic events (consistent with presentation of the composite endpoint) was similar among participant subgroups stratified by baseline HbA1c, baseline duration of T2D, baseline age, sex, or baseline BMI (Table 6).

Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode of hypoglycemia requiring assistance to administer therapy. Safety evaluation included all available data from the entire trial period for each trial: 40-week treatment + 4-week safety follow-up period for SURPASS-1, -2, and -5; 52-week treatment + 4-week safety follow-up period for SURPASS-3; and 52-week treatment (primary) + variable treatment period (to 104 weeks) + 4-week safety follow-up for SURPASS-4

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to-5: efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^1169DPUx]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

To guide clinicians in the management of diabetes and its complications and comorbidities, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus report and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) practice guideline both emphasize engaging a multidisciplinary team in a comprehensive, holistic, person-centered approach that allows participants to achieve goals related to glycemic targets, weight reduction, and cardiovascular/chronic kidney disease mitigation, while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions and hypoglycemia. The AACE recommends an HbA1c target of ≤ 6.5% for most nonpregnant adults, if it can be achieved safely, to diminish long-term microvascular disease. The ADA standards of care and the ADA/EASD consensus statement emphasize that > 10% weight loss has a disease-modifying effect beyond the improved glycemic control and cardiometabolic effects seen with lower weight loss goals. The ADA standards of care further recommend that the effect of therapy on weight should be a consideration when choosing diabetes therapy. Diabetes treatment guidelines increasingly emphasize achieving HbA1c goals and weight reduction without increased risk of hypoglycemia, and a composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5% with body weight reduction ≥ 10% without hypoglycemia represents a clinically meaningful endpoint to inform clinical decision-making. In contrast to the currently available data for the composite endpoint of HbA1c < 7% without weight gain or hypoglycemia, there is a paucity of data demonstrating the ability of a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 RA to help participants achieve a composite endpoint that addresses the current standard of care recommendations.

Tirzepatide, a long-acting GIP/GLP-1 RA, has been approved in the USA for the treatment of T2D and obesity. In five phase 3 registration clinical trials (SURPASS-1 through -5), treatment with tirzepatide resulted in robust and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and body weight and normalization of blood glucose in up to 62% of trial participants. Composite outcomes of various HbA1c reduction and weight loss thresholds without hypoglycemia have previously been assessed for the participant populations of each of these studies. The current post hoc analysis assesses a composite according to baseline characteristics to provide clinicians with information on how to manage various subpopulations reflecting differences in baseline glycemic control and weight, differences in severity/duration of disease, and biological characteristics that may affect response to therapy, consistent with comparable studies completed for GLP-1 RAs.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes: analysis of SURPASS-AP-combo by different subgroups [^113HscHB]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tirzepatide is a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. In the SURPASS-AP-Combo trial, once-weekly tirzepatide was associated with improved glycemic control and weight loss versus insulin glargine and was generally well tolerated in an Asia-Pacific, predominately Chinese, population with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This post hoc subgroup analysis of SURPASS-AP-Combo assessed the potential influence of patient baseline characteristics on the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide.

Methods

Changes from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c, body weight, fasting serum glucose (FSG), and daily glucose average from self-measured blood glucose profiles were analyzed by potential influential factors including age (< 65, ≥ 65 years), sex, baseline HbA1c (≤ 8.5, > 8.5%), body mass index (BMI) (< 25, ≥ 25 kg/m 2), body weight (< 75, ≥ 75 kg), duration of diabetes (< 10, ≥ 10 years), and concomitant oral antihyperglycemic medications (metformin, metformin plus sulphonylurea). Gastrointestinal adverse events and hypoglycemia were also evaluated.

Results

At week 40, all tirzepatide doses were associated with reduced HbA1c, body weight, FSG, and daily glucose average from baseline in all subgroups. Greater HbA1c reductions were achieved in patients with higher baseline HbA1c across all tirzepatide doses, higher body weight with 10 mg and younger age with 15 mg tirzepatide. Greater reductions in body weight were observed in patients with higher body weight across all tirzepatide doses, lower baseline HbA1c with 5 mg and higher BMI with 5 mg tirzepatide.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, tirzepatide was associated with reduced blood glucose and body weight in a predominantly Chinese population with T2D across different subgroups, consistent with previous reports for tirzepatide.

### Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) [^112Xvjd5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. (7.2)

7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin

When initiating MOUNJARO, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.2 Oral Medications

MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with MOUNJARO.

Monitor patients on oral medications dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy and those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin) when concomitantly administered with MOUNJARO.

Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO. Hormonal contraceptives that are not administered orally should not be affected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

### Tirzepatide cardiovascular event risk assessment: a pre-specified meta-analysis [^114SEjot]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Despite favorable effects of tirzepatide on a range of cardiovascular risk factors, to date its cardiovascular safety has been reported from results of only a single trial, SURPASS-4. This trial, which compared tirzepatide treatment to insulin glargine 100 U mL −1 treatment in people with T2D at increased cardiovascular risk, suggested no significant difference in the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

As required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) –, and to extend the safety evaluation in a broader population with T2D, the tirzepatide clinical development program for treatment of T2D (SURPASS) was also designed to evaluate the drug's cardiovascular safety in people with T2D at low, medium and high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, a cardiovascular safety meta-analysis of data, from all phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials with planned treatment duration of at least 26 weeks and at least one randomized comparator arm among adults with T2D, was conducted to assess the safety of tirzepatide with regard to major cardiovascular events relative to various randomized comparators.

Here we present the results of these pre-specified cardiovascular safety meta-analyses and selected post hoc exploratory analyses of interest, based on prospectively collected and centrally adjudicated MACE events.

### Achieving normoglycemia with tirzepatide: analysis of SURPASS 1–4 trials [^111iqBD1]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tirzepatide is a novel single-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, which demonstrated unprecedented improvements in glycemic control and body weight reduction, in the SURPASS phase 3 program. In this exploratory analysis, we aimed to characterize tirzepatide-treated participants who achieved HbA1c < 5.7% and evaluate changes in clinical markers associated with long-term cardiometabolic health.

Research Design and Methods

Baseline characteristics and change from baseline to week 40 for several efficacy and safety parameters were analyzed according to HbA1c attainment category (< 5.7%, 5.7–6.5%, and > 6.5%) using descriptive statistics in participants taking ≥ 75% of treatment doses, without rescue medication, in the SURPASS 1–4 trials (N = 3,229). Logistic regression models with tirzepatide doses adjusted as a covariate were used to obtain odds ratios and assess the impact of patient characteristics achieving an HbA1c < 5.7%.

Results

Tirzepatide-treated participants who achieved HbA1c < 5.7% were slightly younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower HbA1c value at baseline compared with those who did not achieve HbA1c < 5.7%. In addition, they showed greater improvements in HbA1c, body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, liver enzymes, and lipid parameters without increasing hypoglycemia risk.

Conclusions

Normoglycemia was unprecedently achieved in a significant proportion of participants in the SURPASS clinical program, without increasing hypoglycemia risk, and was associated with an overall improvement in metabolic health.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to-5: efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^1143xxqx]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The ADVANCE clinical trial set a primary outcome target of HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, an endpoint associated with significant reduction in microvascular and major adverse cardiovascular events primarily driven by the reduction in microvascular outcomes. Furthermore, significant reduction in the risk of new or worsening albuminuria was associated with attainment of a median HbA1c of 6.3% versus 7.0%. This is a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS-1 through -5 trials to assess the percentage of participants randomized to tirzepatide or comparator who achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5% and weight reduction ≥ 10% without hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia, defined as an episode of hypoglycemia requiring assistance to administer therapy) in alignment with current guidelines. This composite endpoint was assessed for five subgroups of participant characteristics at baseline that are clinically relevant when setting treatment goals: duration of T2D (≤ 5, > 5–10, or > 10 years), sex, HbA1c (≤ 8.5% or > 8.5%), age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), and BMI (< 30, 30 to < 35, and ≥ 35 kg/m 2).

In SURPASS‐2, a composite endpoint assessing the proportion of participants who achieved HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) without clinically significant (< 54 mg/dl) or severe hypoglycaemia and with ≥ 10% weight loss was met by 32%‐60% of participants who received tirzepatide compared with 22% who received semaglutide 1 mg.

Fasting serum glucose (FSG) was significantly reduced by all tirzepatide doses in SURPASS‐1, ‐2 and ‐5 at either 40 or 52 weeks compared with placebo, semaglutide 1 mg and placebo with background insulin, respectively.FSG levels at endpoint did not differ from insulin degludec in the 10‐ and 15‐mg groups in SURPASS‐3 and in SURPASS‐4 did not differ from insulin glargine 100 U/ml in the 5‐ and 10‐mg groups but were significantly lower in the 15‐mg group (Figure S1). In SURPASS‐3 and ‐4, significant reductions in FSG compared with baseline were apparent as early as 2 weeks (the earliest measurement) after treatment initiation when all participants received 2.5 mg. Across the two studies and three dose groups, the magnitude of this change at 2 weeks was −30.3 to −34.0 mg/dl (−18% to −20%). In a small Phase 1 study, 24 h following treatment with a 2.5 mg initiating dose of tirzepatide, there was a non‐statistically significant (vs. placebo) decrease from baseline of –19 mg/dl in FSG. However, on Day 8 (pre‐dose) a statistically significant (vs. placebo) reduction of −39 mg/dl occurred, indicating early glucose‐lowering potential following tirzepatide initiation.

Discussion

The present analysis compared the clinical benefit and economic value of once-weekly tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) vs once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg among patients with T2D who were inadequately controlled with metformin, had a HbA1c of 7.0–10.5%, and a BMI of at least 25 kg/m 2 in terms of achieving glycemic control, weight loss, and composite treatment endpoints using the outcomes data from the pivotal SURPASS-2 clinical trial. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, ADA, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes have recognized that achieving HbA1c targets of ≤ 6.5 or < 7.0% (if achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects) and larger, sustained weight losses (> 10% of baseline weight) can potentially improve long-term outcomes; thus, results for composite treatment endpoints with different thresholds for HbA1c reduction and ≥ 10% weight loss with no risk of hypoglycemia provide important insights relevant to the management of diabetes. This analysis showed that despite having a higher annual pharmacy cost, the cost of achieving the triple composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5%/ ≥ 10% weight loss/no hypoglycemia was 26%, 53%, and 60% lower for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively, compared with that of semaglutide 1 mg ($53,099). The results also revealed that tirzepatide had a lower cost per responder than semaglutide 1 mg for more stringent treatment goals of HbA1c and weight reduction. At a HbA1c goal of < 7.0%, cost per responder was not statistically different between tirzepatide ($14,734 to $15,489) and semaglutide 1 mg ($14,720). At HbA1c goals of ≤ 6.5% and < 5.7%, cost per responder for tirzepatide ranged from 10% less (10-mg dose at HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) to 55% less (15-mg dose at HbA1c < 5.7%) than for semaglutide 1 mg. For weight loss goals, cost per responder ranged from 23% lower (tirzepatide 10 mg at weight loss ≥ 5%) to 76% lower (tirzepatide 15 mg at weight loss ≥ 15%) than for semaglutide 1 mg.

WARNING: RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS

In both male and female rats, tirzepatide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
MOUNJARO is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2) [see Contraindications (4)]. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of MOUNJARO and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with MOUNJARO [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Statistical Analyses

Post hoc analyses for attainment of the composite endpoint (defined as HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, weight reduction ≥ 10%, and no hypoglycemia [blood glucose < 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia, defined as an episode of hypoglycemia requiring assistance to administer therapy]) at the primary endpoint (week 40 for SURPASS-1, -2, and -5 and week 52 for SURPASS-3 and -4) were performed on the following subgroups of selected baseline characteristics for each of the five SURPASS trials separately because of differences in trial design: duration of T2D (≤ 5 years, > 5 to 10 years, or > 10 years), sex, HbA1c (≤ 8.5% or > 8.5%), age (< 65 years or ≥ 65 years), and BMI (< 30, 30 to < 35, or ≥ 35 kg/m²). To evaluate each component of the composite endpoint concurrently, events of hypoglycemia were counted up to the respective primary endpoints and did not include the protocol-specified 4-week safety follow-up period. The analysis population included all randomized participants who took at least one dose of study drug and excluded those who discontinued study drug as a result of inadvertent enrollment. Data collected after initiation of rescue medication or permanent discontinuation of study drug were excluded (efficacy analysis set). The baseline is defined as the last measurement (including unscheduled visits) collected prior to or on the first dose day. A post hoc analysis for attainment of individual endpoints (HbA1c ≤ 6.5% and weight reduction ≥ 10%) stratified by baseline subgroup across the SURPASS trials was also included.

Risk Summary

Available data with MOUNJARO use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-related risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to tirzepatide during pregnancy. MOUNJARO should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

In pregnant rats administered tirzepatide during organogenesis, fetal growth reductions and fetal abnormalities occurred at clinical exposure in maternal rats based on AUC. In rabbits administered tirzepatide during organogenesis, fetal growth reductions were observed at clinically relevant exposures based on AUC. These adverse embryo/fetal effects in animals coincided with pharmacological effects on maternal weight and food consumption (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6–10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c > 7% and has been reported to be as high as 20–25% in women with an HbA1c > 10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO than placebo (placebo 20.4%, MOUNJARO 5 mg 37.1%, MOUNJARO 10 mg 39.6%, MOUNJARO 15 mg 43.6%). More patients receiving MOUNJARO 5 mg (3.0%), MOUNJARO 10 mg (5.4%), and MOUNJARO 15 mg (6.6%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (0.4%). The majority of reports of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation and decreased over time.

The following gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently in MOUNJARO-treated patients than placebo-treated patients (frequencies listed, respectively, as: placebo; 5 mg; 10 mg; 15 mg): eructation (0.4%, 3.0%, 2.5%, 3.3%), flatulence (0%, 1.3%, 2.5%, 2.9%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (0.4%, 1.7%, 2.5%, 1.7%), abdominal distension (0.4%, 0.4%, 2.9%, 0.8%).

Hypoglycemia

Table 2 summarizes the incidence of hypoglycemic events in the placebo-controlled trials.

Hypoglycemia was more frequent when MOUNJARO was used in combination with a sulfonylurea [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In a clinical trial up to 104 weeks of treatment, when administered with a sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia (glucose level < 54 mg/dL) occurred in 13.8%, 9.9%, and 12.8%, and severe hypoglycemia occurred in 0.5%, 0%, and 0.6% of patients treated with MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively.

Acute Pancreatitis

In clinical studies, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 MOUNJARO-treated patients (0.23 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 comparator-treated patients (0.11 patients per 100 years of exposure).

### Evaluation and comparison of efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, liraglutide and SGLT2i in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a network meta-analysis [^116yyZji]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, among the 28 trials analyzed, tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg demonstrated the most significant HbA1c reduction and weight loss, aligning with the findings by Ding et al. As the first dual agonist of GIP and GLP-1 receptors, tirzepatide employs a dual-target mechanism that enables stronger hypoglycemic and weight-reducing effects than other existing hypoglycemic agents, with high tolerability and safety. These qualities underscore its value in comprehensive diabetes management.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes share a fundamental pathophysiological mechanism. Research indicates that a weight reduction of 15% or greater can markedly enhance blood sugar regulation in individuals with diabetes, with some attaining a state of "remission" that is not achievable through alternative hypoglycemic treatments. The incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) regulate blood sugar levels, and tirzepatide targets both GIP and GLP-1 receptors. This dual action helps regulate insulin secretion through GLP-1, delays gastric emptying to reduce appetite, and inhibits gastric acid secretion and motility via GIP, offering an appetite-suppressing effect while potentially preserving islet function.

This study indicates that tirzepatide, particularly at doses of 15 mg and 10 mg, shows a higher likelihood of adverse events (AEs) compared to other medications. Tirzepatide 5 mg, however, is associated with a higher probability of serious adverse events (SAEs). Gastrointestinal reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are the main AEs of tirzepatide and align with those observed with GLP-1 receptor agonists. In our analysis, liraglutide 1.8 mg has the highest probability of AEs, underscoring a consideration for clinicians when choosing hypoglycemic agents, as hypoglycemia risk is a significant concern. For instance, although insulin effectively lowers blood glucose, its hypoglycemic risk limits its use. In contrast, tirzepatide has a remarkably low hypoglycemia risk when used alone, as indicated by its action mechanism and existing research. This low risk enhances confidence in tirzepatide's use for blood sugar control, contributing to high compliance with HbA1c targets in the tirzepatide group.

Pool of Seven Controlled Clinical Trials

Adverse reactions were also evaluated in a larger pool of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participating in seven controlled clinical trials which included two placebo-controlled trials (SURPASS-1 and -5), three trials of MOUNJARO in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, and/or SGLT2 Inhibitors (SURPASS-2, -3, -4) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] and two additional trials conducted in Japan. In this pool, a total of 5119 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with MOUNJARO for a mean duration of 48.1 weeks. The mean age of patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 58% were male. The population was 65% White, 24% Asian, 7% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 3% Black or African American; 38% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus for an average of 9.1 years with a mean HbA1c of 8.3%. As assessed by baseline fundoscopic examination, 15% of the population had retinopathy. At baseline, eGFR was ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2in 52%, 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2in 40%, 45 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2in 6%, and 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2in 1% of patients.

Common Adverse Reactions

Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, not including hypoglycemia, associated with the use of MOUNJARO in the pool of placebo-controlled trials. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on MOUNJARO than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with MOUNJARO.

In the pool of seven clinical trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, not including hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to-5: efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^114DNQz5]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To minimize complications and improve overall health, ADA/EASD and AACE have identified both HbA1c reduction and weight loss as important treatment objectives for people with T2D. Many therapies target single goals and necessitate polypharmacy, but comprehensive disease management commonly requires that multiple treatment goals be addressed simultaneously. More participants randomized to tirzepatide than the respective comparator achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5% and weight reduction ≥ 10% without hypoglycemia, a key holistic outcome conceptually identified by ADA/EASD and AACE guidelines, as well as the ADA standards of care. This analysis stratified selected baseline characteristics and demonstrated the ability of tirzepatide-treated participants to consistently achieve the composite endpoint more frequently than those who received the comparator in a generally dose-dependent manner in all subgroups across all SURPASS trials. Importantly, achieving near-normal glycemic levels while minimizing the occurrence of hypoglycemia was shown to be possible with tirzepatide. Even in SURPASS-4 and SURPASS-5, which included concomitant use of antihyperglycemic medications known to cause weight gain and associated with higher risk of hypoglycemia, many participants treated with tirzepatide were able to achieve the composite outcome of this analysis.

Across subgroups, the composite endpoint was achieved by a median of approximately 30%, 45%, and 54% of participants receiving 5-, 10-, and 15-mg doses of tirzepatide, respectively. In comparison, treatment with long-acting insulin and placebo rarely (e.g. ≤ 3.9%) resulted in achievement of the composite endpoint, while treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in achievement of the composite endpoint in a median of 22% of participants across all subgroups. Outlier results in some tirzepatide subgroups appeared to be largely related to small sample sizes in individual groups. It is generally accepted that more stringent therapeutic goals can be attempted for younger people with a shorter duration of T2D, but this analysis suggests that similar composite outcome achievement may be safely possible regardless of diabetes duration or age. This is especially relevant for older adults with T2D, who often have other comorbidities, to be able to improve glycemic outcomes without increased risk of hypoglycemia. In addition, similar achievement of the composite endpoint was also seen in participants across a range of BMI values and baseline HbA1c.

3.8 Safety

The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher in the tirzepatide groups compared to the insulin glargine groups (Table 2). Diarrhoea was reported in 14.7% to 22.6% of participants in the tirzepatide group versus 4.7% in the insulin glargine group. Nausea was reported in 13.1% to 21.4% of participants in the tirzepatide group versus 2.6% in the insulin glargine group. Vomiting was reported in 5.6% to 7.9% of those on tirzepatide versus 1.7% of those on insulin glargine.

TABLE 2
Incidence of adverse events in the study population, safety analysis set.

The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower among the participants in the tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg groups on metformin alone (2.0%, 0.9%, and 3.6%; p < 0.01), those on sulfonylureas alone (18.8%, 0.0%, and 6.3%), and those on metformin + sulfonylureas (14%, p = 0.02; 7.6%, p < 0.001, and 15.3%, p = 0.08) compared with the insulin glargine groups on metformin alone (16.8%), sulfonylureas alone (20.6%), and metformin + sulfonylureas group (22.7%) (Table S2).

3.9 Major adverse cardiovascular events

MACE occurred in 48 participants (6.4%) in the tirzepatide pooled group and in 62 participants (8.3%) in the glargine group. There was no increased risk of MACE events in the pooled tirzepatide group compared to the glargine group; hazard ratio (HR) 0.75 (95% CI 0.51, 1.1; p = 0.127; Table S3). Twenty deaths (2.7%) in the tirzepatide pooled group and 25 deaths (3.4%) in the glargine group were observed (HR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.43, 1.39], p = 0.39). None of the deaths were related to the study drug.

CURRENT GUIDANCE FOR INCRETIN THERAPIES IN TYPE 2 DIABETES AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended as part of GDMT by guideline forming organizations to improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and reduce ASCVD-related risks in patients with T2D. Indeed, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends GLP-1 receptor agonists with evidence of ASCVD benefit as a first-line treatment option in patients with T2D at high risk or with established ASCVD. Use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist is further recommended in patients with T2D and CKD unable to use metformin or an SGLT2 inhibitor. Streamlining for ease of use in patients with T2D and CKD, several GLP-1 receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide do not require dose adjustment by eGFR level for glycemic control or weight loss (Table 1).

Table 1
Key administration and dosing information for currently available GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists

The most common dose-limiting side effect with GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea which typically resolve over time with continued use. To minimize gastrointestinal side effects it is recommended to start medications at low dose, with gradual increase every 2–4 weeks as tolerated. In the AWARD-7 trial which enrolled participants with moderate-to-severe CKD, these gastrointestinal side effects were reported in approximately 15–20% of patients. Use of long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide is not recommended in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2. Caution is additionally recommended in patients with history or risk factors for pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and/or gallbladder disease. While GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are not associated with hypoglycemia when used alone or as add-on to metformin, dose reduction or discontinuation of background sulfonylurea and/or insulin therapy may be needed to avoid hypoglycemia (Table 2).

In conclusion, this is the first report of a prospective, two-arm study of the efficacy of tirzepatide in subjects with T2D and CKD. As well as improving glycemic control, it might be beneficial in preventing the progression of nephropathy; however, attention should be paid to the risk of sarcopenia and hypoglycemia in insulin users. Tirzepatide might be an effective alternative for patients who have not achieved sufficient glycemic control with conventional GLP-1RAs.

Introduction

Newer incretin-based therapies for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have the potential to substantially reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight with a low associated risk of hypoglycemia. This study aimed to assess the percentage of participants randomized to tirzepatide or comparator who achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5% and weight reduction ≥ 10% without hypoglycemia across prespecified baseline characteristics: T2D duration (≤ 5, > 5–10, or > 10 years), sex, HbA1c (≤ 8.5% or > 8.5%), age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), and body mass index (< 30, 30 to < 35, or ≥ 35 kg/m²).

Methods

This post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 through -5 evaluated adult study participants with T2D treated with tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg versus placebo or active comparator. Missing HbA1c and weight values were imputed from mixed models for repeated measures. Logistic regression was used to compare tirzepatide versus comparators for the percentage of participants reaching the composite endpoint.

Results

Across subgroups, the composite endpoint was achieved by a median of approximately 30%, 45%, and 54% of participants who received tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively; this was consistent across baseline subgroups, except that a greater percentage of women than men achieved the composite endpoint. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, tirzepatide achieved the composite outcome of glycemic control and weight loss with no hypoglycemia, irrespective of baseline characteristics. This may help clinicians as they select suitable treatment in diverse populations.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology obesity consensus — tirzepatide dosing, efficacy, and cardiometabolic findings: tirzepatide is "formulated as a once-weekly SC injection (t1/2 116.7 hours) titrated up monthly from a starting dose of 2.5 mg weekly to a maximum dose of 15 mg weekly" and was "approved by the FDA at doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg per week for the treatment of both obesity in 2023 and T2D in 2022". In SURMOUNT-1, the 15 mg dose yielded "an average weight reduction of 22.5% at 72 weeks, with nearly 40% of participants losing ≥ 25% of their body weight", while SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 showed weight reduction "up to 26.6% and 26%, respectively… at 88 weeks". In T2D, SURMOUNT-2 reported average weight loss of "12.8% and 14.7% on 10- and 15-mg doses, respectively", with "a 2.2% reduction in A1C" and "nearly half of participants achieving normal A1C values (< 5.7%)" with "only uncommon episodes of level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia". A prespecified analysis found tirzepatide "did not increase the risk of MACE…; the CVOT… is ongoing (SURPASS CVOT, NCT02545533)", and "SURMOUNT-MMO is an ongoing CVOT" in obesity without diabetes (NCT05501512). "In December 2024, the FDA approved tirzepatide as the first prescription medicine for the treatment of moderate- to severe-OSA in adults with obesity".

### Tirzepatide: a double agonist for various people living with type 2 diabetes [^111fxwxB]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is the first ever once-weekly, injectable gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GIP/GLP-1) dual agonist approved by the European Medicines Agency for type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide have been evaluated in five global, randomized, double-blind or open-label, phase 3 studies which enrolled over 7000 people living with type 2 diabetes, across various stages of disease and with different characteristics at baseline. In this short commentary we report the salient data of the most recent trials on tirzepatide and GLP-1 receptor agonists from a clinical point of view, with the aim of highlighting similarities and mutual differences.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^113Y5LL1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Treatment with glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) addresses multiple pathophysiological abnormalities of type 2 diabetes, providing an important therapeutic option for patients with this disease. GLP‐1 RAs improve glucose‐dependent insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion, and decrease the rate of gastric emptying. 1, 2, 3 They are also associated with a reduction in appetite with consequent weight loss. 1, 2, 3 These agents are associated with dose‐limiting side effects of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, 4, 5 and efforts have been made to improve efficacy and tolerability by investigating dose‐escalation regimens that allow attainment of higher doses, which are associated with greater efficacy, while limiting side effects. It has been reported that a slow escalation in dose can limit side effects while increasing the therapeutic utility of GLP‐1 RAs. 6, 7, 8, 9 In addition to the need to improve the tolerability of GLP‐1RAs, further improvement in their efficacy is of importance because not all patients treated with GLP‐1 RAs reach their glycaemic target and/or body weight reduction goals with currently available agents. 10

5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) in patients treated with tirzepatide. In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical studies for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), 0.1% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients had severe hypersensitivity reactions compared to no placebo-treated patients. Similar rates of severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction and in ZEPBOUND trials for OSA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, advise patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue use of ZEPBOUND. Do not use in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in ZEPBOUND [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with ZEPBOUND.

5.7 Hypoglycemia

ZEPBOUND lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia.

In a trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2(Study 2), hypoglycemia (plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL) was reported in 4.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients versus 1.3% of placebo-treated patients. In this trial, patients taking ZEPBOUND in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) had increased risk of hypoglycemia (10.3%) compared to ZEPBOUND-treated patients not taking a sulfonylurea (2.1%). There is also increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients treated with tirzepatide in combination with insulin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hypoglycemia has also been associated with ZEPBOUND and GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In patients with diabetes mellitus, monitor blood glucose prior to starting ZEPBOUND and during ZEPBOUND treatment. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of insulin or sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue).

### Achievement of glycaemic targets with weight loss and without hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes with the once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS-1 to-5 studies [^111zySeg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess composite endpoints combining glycaemic control (HbA1c < 7.0%, ≤ 6.5% or < 5.7%) with weight loss (≥ 5%, ≥ 10% or ≥ 15%) and without hypoglycaemia with tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Materials and Methods

Data from the phase 3 SURPASS programme were evaluated post hoc by trial. Participants with T2D were randomized to tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15mg), placebo (SURPASS-1,5), semaglutide 1mg (SURPASS-2) or titrated basal insulin (SURPASS-3,4). The proportions of participants achieving the composite endpoints were compared between tirzepatide and the respective comparator groups at week 40/52.

Results

The proportions of participants achieving an HbA1c value of less than 7.0% with 5% or more weight loss and without hypoglycaemia ranged from 43% to 82% with tirzepatide across the SURPASS-1 to -5 trials versus 4%-5% with placebo, 51% with semaglutide 1mg and 5% with basal insulin (P < .001 vs. all comparators). The proportions of participants achieving an HbA1c value of less than 7.0% with 10% or more, or 15% or more weight loss and without hypoglycaemia were significantly higher with all tirzepatide doses versus comparators across trials (P < .001 or P < .05). Similar results were observed for all other combinations of endpoints with an HbA1c value of 6.5% or less, or less than 5.7%, with more tirzepatide-treated participants achieving these endpoints versus those in the comparator groups, including semaglutide.

Conclusions

Across the SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials, more tirzepatide-treated participants with T2D achieved clinically meaningful composite endpoints, which included reaching glycaemic targets with various degrees of weight loss and without hypoglycaemia, than those in the comparator groups.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide once weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112gL1iv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) was published by Juan P Frías and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in patients with T2DM? In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the population was: 939 patients (509 female, 430 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; history of pancreatitis; history of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy warranting urgent treatment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic maculopathy. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 470 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 5 mg once weekly, continued for a total of 40 weeks) n = 469 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly, titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 1 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 40 weeks). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 40 (2.01% vs. 1.86%; ARD 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in body weight at week 40 (7.6 kg vs. 5.7 kg; ARD 1.9, 95% CI 1 to 2.8) Borderline significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level < 7.0% (82% vs. 79%; AD 3%, 95% CI -0.01 to 6.01) Significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level < 5.7% (27% vs. 19%; AD 8%, 95% CI 3.25 to 12.75). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypoglycemia, ≥ 1 adverse event. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM, tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide with respect to mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 40.

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^117VYii8]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering that participants in the subgroup population assigned to each maintenance dose of tirzepatide had similar changes from baseline in HbA1c regardless of maintenance dose with a dose-proportionate degree of weight loss consistent with that observed in the overall population, an individualized treatment approach can be assessed considering a balance of risk of AEs with the degree of weight loss that would be most beneficial considering the individual participant.

Importantly, for a population that may be more at risk of cognitive decline, the incidence of hypoglycemia is low for participants not taking either SU or insulin, regardless of baseline BMI or age. The occurrence of hypoglycemia was consistent across a variety of populations and study considerations. These participants were further broken down into those who were or were not taking SU at baseline. Moreover, the hypoglycemic events were also assessed amongst those who were taking insulin at baseline, in the case of the SURPASS-5 population, or in the pooled SURPASS-1 to -3 population, groups that were not taking insulin or insulin secretagogue. In these populations, the incidence of hypoglycemic events was consistent between the subgroup of participants over the age of 65 years with a BMI < 30 kg/m² and the overall population, regardless of the concomitant use of hypoglycemic medication.

### Tirzepatide (mounjaro) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^114sqLaq]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

|Titration: increase dosage by 2. 5 mg every four weeks to a maximum dosage of 15 mg once weekly if additional glycemic control is needed| Tirzepatide is labeled for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications. It is the first agonist that targets both glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors. 1 This dual effect is hypothesized to impact glycemic control and weight loss more than GLP-1 receptor agonism alone due in part to the prevalence of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors in adipose tissue and the brain. 2 There is also a small increased risk of gallbladder or biliary diseases that may be associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists; this risk could be dose, duration, or indication dependent. 3 Tirzepatide may have a moderately higher risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse events compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

4 Dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Tolerability Adverse effects are similar to those of other GLP-1 receptor agonists. In a pool of placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse effects occurred in more than 5% of patients taking tirzepatide. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are more common during dose increases and generally improve over time. Tirzepatide does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. Effectiveness Tirzepatide was studied in five trials at 5-, 10-, and 15-mg doses: as monotherapy, as an add-on to metformin, sulfonylureas, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors; and as an add-on to basal insulin. Tirzepatide produced significant reductions in A1C levels compared with placebo at all three doses.

7 In a 52-week study of 1, 995 patients with type 2 diabetes taking up to three oral hypoglycemic agents and at an increased risk of cardiovascular events, tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine at all three doses. 8 Based on limited research, tirzepatide has not been shown to affect cardiovascular outcomes or reduce overall mortality compared with usual care. 4.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to-5: efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^114GPyAp]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide was generally well tolerated in all five SURPASS trials. The most common TEAEs within the gastrointestinal system organ class were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. No pattern of elevated hypoglycemia risk was observed with respect to body weight subgroups or tirzepatide dose even in participants with longer duration of diabetes > 10 years, or BMI < 30 kg/m² who may have less insulin resistance. However, a tendency toward hypoglycemia < 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia was observed among participants enrolled in SURPASS-4 among whom concomitant sulfonylurea use was permitted or among participants taking insulin in SURPASS-5. Otherwise, tirzepatide treatment was generally associated with low rates of hypoglycemia.

This analysis should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. The SURPASS trials were neither designed nor powered to assess the differential efficacy of tirzepatide between these subgroups of participants. This was a post hoc analysis of five different SURPASS trials and the analysis used unpooled data with several differences in trial characteristics and assessed a composite that was not controlled for multiplicity. Moreover, in some cases, the numbers in the subgroups were small. The analysis also does not account for social determinants of health, which may impact the glycemic and weight outcomes in this population. However, the large percentage of participants from SURPASS-1 through -5 included in the current analysis and in previously published studies provides reassurance that the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide are consistent regardless of T2D duration, sex, HbA1c, age, or BMI at baseline. Additionally, both ADA/EASD and AACE guidelines stress the importance of treating cardiovascular risk factors; the composite in this analysis did not focus on cardiovascular risk factors or endpoints because the completed SURPASS program was not designed to assess cardiovascular outcomes. The potential clinical relevance of reaching and maintaining near normoglycemia with accompanying clinically relevant weight loss in the context of T2D management and the effect of tirzepatide on cardiovascular outcomes remain to be elucidated.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^114d8dnh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 3
By‐week combined incidence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea

The incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes (documented, symptomatic, probable and asymptomatic events) was low across all the tirzepatide treatment groups during the study. There were 12 patients who experienced at least one hypoglycaemic episode (plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]). It cannot be ruled out that one patient in the 15 mg‐2 group had a plasma glucose of < 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) because that patient reported a hypoglycaemia episode but did not report a plasma glucose value (Table 2). There were no reports of severe hypoglycaemia. There were no cases of investigator‐suspected pancreatitis or cholecystitis. No cardiovascular events that required adjudication occurred during the trial. There were no reports of thyroid tumours, neoplasms or C‐cell hyperplasia events. Pulse rate increased for the tirzepatide treatment groups (0.9 to 5.7 beats/min) and decreased in the placebo group (−2.3 beats/min) during the treatment period of the study.

Approximately 26% of patients treated with tirzepatide developed treatment‐emergent antidrug antibodies (TE‐ADAs). Overall titres were low and there were no effects because of the presence of TE‐ADAs on reduction of HbA1c, body weight or drug clearance. There were no hypersensitivity reactions or any other relevant AEs associated with the presence of TE‐ADAs.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide once weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111RqRWN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of once-weekly tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide, a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, are unknown.

Methods

In an open-label, 40-week, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1879 patients, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, to receive tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. At baseline, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.28%, the mean age 56.6 years, and the mean weight 93.7 kg. The primary end point was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks.

Results

The estimated mean change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level was -2.01 percentage points, -2.24 percentage points, and -2.30 percentage points with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and -1.86 percentage points with semaglutide; the estimated differences between the 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide groups and the semaglutide group were -0.15 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.28 to -0.03; P = 0.02), -0.39 percentage points (95% CI, -0.51 to -0.26; P < 0.001), and -0.45 percentage points (95% CI, -0.57 to -0.32; P < 0.001), respectively. Tirzepatide at all doses was noninferior and superior to semaglutide. Reductions in body weight were greater with tirzepatide than with semaglutide (least-squares mean estimated treatment difference, -1.9 kg, -3.6 kg, and -5.5 kg, respectively; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal and were primarily mild to moderate in severity in the tirzepatide and semaglutide groups (nausea, 17 to 22% and 18%; diarrhea, 13 to 16% and 12%; and vomiting, 6 to 10% and 8%, respectively). Of the patients who received tirzepatide, hypoglycemia (blood glucose level, < 54 mg per deciliter) was reported in 0.6% (5-mg group), 0.2% (10-mg group), and 1.7% (15-mg group); hypoglycemia was reported in 0.4% of those who received semaglutide. Serious adverse events were reported in 5 to 7% of the patients who received tirzepatide and in 3% of those who received semaglutide.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was noninferior and superior to semaglutide with respect to the mean change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks. (Funded by Eli Lilly; SURPASS-2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03987919.).

Patients with T2DM Seeking Normoglycemia

In the SURPASS program, up to 23–62% of participants achieved normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%), vs. participants treated with semaglutide 1 mg (20%), insulin degludec (5%), and insulin glargine (3%). Normoglycemia was achieved without clinically significant hypoglycemia in 93.6–100% patients when tirzepatide was not combined with insulin (SURPASS 1–4) and in 85.9% patients when tirzepatide was added to insulin (SURPASS-5). Tirzepatide-treated participants who achieved normoglycemia were slightly younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower HbA1c value at baseline.

In addition, tirzepatide enabled participants to maintain a significantly lower blood glucose level throughout the day across all five studies, with a higher proportion of 24-h period spent within a tight target glucose range and a smaller within-day glucose coefficient of variation vs. insulin degludec, indicating lower glycemic variability. Data from a cohort study in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, showed that stringent glycemic control (HbA1c levels < 6.5%) were associated with better outcomes vs. patients with HbA1c between 6.5% to < 7%. Thus, this study is consistent with literature recommending early and intensive treatment to avoid long-term risk of diabetic complications and related mortality.

Patients with T2DM with Very Poor Glycemic Control who are far from Reaching HbA1c Therapeutic Goals

A subgroup analysis involving patients with a HbA1c level > 8.5% showed significant and clinically significant mean reductions in the HbA1c level of − 3.18 up to – 3.46% for tirzepatide at a dose of 15 mg as compared with − 2.58% for semaglutide 1 mg, – 2.07% for insulin degludec, – 1.96% for insulin glargine, – 0.82% for placebo in monotherapy, and – 1.27% for placebo added to insulin glargine. In a post hoc analysis of SURPASS 2, 3, and 4 assessing tirzepatide in participants whose baseline HbA1c was > 9%, between 65 and 86% of patients randomized to tirzepatide achieved HbA1c < 7%. Consistent with these data, the ADA-EASD 2022 consensus has categorized the glycemic effect of tirzepatide as very high.

### Once-weekly tirzepatide versus once-daily insulin degludec as add-on to metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS-3): a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 trial [^1162jnPT]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus titrated insulin degludec in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

In this open-label, parallel-group, multicentre (122 sites), multinational (13 countries), phase 3 study, eligible participants (aged ≥ 18 years) had a baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA₁c) of 7.0–10.5%, body-mass index of at least 25 kg/m², stable weight, and were insulin-naive and treated with metformin alone or in combination with an SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), using an interactive web-response system, to once-weekly subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or once-daily subcutaneous injection of titrated insulin degludec, and were stratified by country, HbA 1c, and concomitant use of oral antihyperglycaemic medications. Tirzepatide was initially given at 2.5 mg and the dose was escalated by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. Insulin degludec was initially given at 10 U per day and was titrated once weekly to a fasting self-monitored blood glucose of less than 5.0 mmol/L (< 90 mg/dL), following a treat-to-target algorithm, for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was non-inferiority of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA₁c at week 52. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were non-inferiority of tirzepatide 5 mg versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 52, superiority of all doses of tirzepatide versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c and bodyweight, and the proportion of participants achieving HbA 1c of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) at week 52. We used a boundary of 0.3% to establish non-inferiority in HbA₁c difference between treatments. Efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all participants who received at least one dose of study drug). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03882970, and is complete.

Findings

Between April 1 and Nov 15, 2019, we assessed 1947 participants for eligibility, 1444 of whom were randomly assigned to treatment. The modified intention-to-treat population was 1437 participants from the tirzepatide 5 mg (n = 358), tirzepatide 10 mg (n = 360), tirzepatide 15 mg (n = 359), and insulin degludec (n = 360) groups. From a mean baseline HbA 1c of 8.17% (SD 0.91), the reductions in HbA 1c at week 52 were 1.93% (SE 0.05) for tirzepatide 5 mg, 2.20% (0.05) for tirzepatide 10 mg, and 2.37% (0.05) for tirzepatide 15 mg, and 1.34% (0.05) for insulin degludec. The non-inferiority margin of 0.3% was met. The estimated treatment difference (ETD) versus insulin degludec ranged from -0.59% to -1.04% for tirzepatide (p < 0.0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The proportion of participants achieving a HbA 1c of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) at week 52 was greater (p < 0.0001) in all three tirzepatide groups (82%-93%) versus insulin degludec (61%). At week 52, from a baseline of 94.3 kg (SD 20.1), all three tirzepatide doses decreased bodyweight (-7.5 kg to -12.9 kg), whereas insulin degludec increased bodyweight by 2.3 kg. The ETD versus insulin degludec ranged from -9.8 kg to -15.2 kg for tirzepatide (p < 0.0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The most common adverse events in tirzepatide-treated participants were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events that decreased over time. A higher incidence of nausea (12–24%), diarrhoea (15–17%), decreased appetite (6–12%), and vomiting (6–10%) was reported in participants treated with tirzepatide than in those treated with insulin degludec (2%, 4%, 1%, and 1%, respectively). Hypoglycaemia (< 54 mg/dL or severe) was reported in five (1%), four (1%), and eight (2%) participants on tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively, versus 26 (7%) on insulin degludec. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event was more common in the tirzepatide groups than in the insulin degludec group. Five participants died during the study; none of the deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to the study treatment.

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) was superior to titrated insulin degludec, with greater reductions in HbA 1c and bodyweight at week 52 and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Tirzepatide showed a similar safety profile to that of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Tirzepatide versus insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk (SURPASS-4): a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 3 trial [^116tx1Rw]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

We aimed to assess efficacy and safety, with a special focus on cardiovascular safety, of the novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide versus insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk inadequately controlled on oral glucose-lowering medications.

Methods

This open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 study was done in 187 sites in 14 countries on five continents. Eligible participants, aged 18 years or older, had type 2 diabetes treated with any combination of metformin, sulfonylurea, or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, a baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA₁c) of 7.5–10.5% (58–91 mmol/mol), body-mass index of 25 kg/m² or greater, and established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of cardiovascular events. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:3) via an interactive web-response system to subcutaneous injection of either once-per-week tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or glargine (100 U/mL), titrated to reach fasting blood glucose of less than 100 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority (0.3% non-inferiority boundary) of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus glargine in HbA₁c change from baseline to 52 weeks. All participants were treated for at least 52 weeks, with treatment continued for a maximum of 104 weeks or until study completion to collect and adjudicate major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Safety measures were assessed over the full study period. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03730662.

Findings

Patients were recruited between Nov 20, 2018, and Dec 30, 2019. 3045 participants were screened, with 2002 participants randomly assigned to tirzepatide or glargine. 1995 received at least one dose of tirzepatide 5 mg (n = 329, 17%), 10 mg (n = 328, 16%), or 15 mg (n = 338, 17%), or glargine (n = 1000, 50%), and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. At 52 weeks, mean HbA 1c changes with tirzepatide were -2.43% (SD 0.05) with 10 mg and -2.58% (0.05) with 15 mg, versus -1.44% (0.03) with glargine. The estimated treatment difference versus glargine was -0.99% (multiplicity adjusted 97.5% CI -1.13 to -0.86) for tirzepatide 10 mg and -1.14% (-1.28 to -1.00) for 15 mg, and the non-inferiority margin of 0.3% was met for both doses. Nausea (12–23%), diarrhoea (13–22%), decreased appetite (9–11%), and vomiting (5–9%) were more frequent with tirzepatide than glargine (nausea 2%, diarrhoea 4%, decreased appetite < 1%, and vomiting 2%, respectively); most cases were mild to moderate and occurred during the dose-escalation phase. The percentage of participants with hypoglycaemia (glucose < 54 mg/dL or severe) was lower with tirzepatide (6–9%) versus glargine (19%), particularly in participants not on sulfonylureas (tirzepatide 1–3% vs glargine 16%). Adjudicated MACE-4 events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalisation for unstable angina) occurred in 109 participants and were not increased on tirzepatide compared with glargine (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.51–1.08). 60 deaths (n = 25 [3%] tirzepatide; n = 35 [4%] glargine) occurred during the study.

Interpretation

In people with type 2 diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide, compared with glargine, demonstrated greater and clinically meaningful HbA 1c reduction with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia at week 52. Tirzepatide treatment was not associated with excess cardiovascular risk.

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^117K1aN3]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this post hoc analysis suggest that tirzepatide may offer glycemic and weight management benefits in older adults without obesity, with a safety profile supporting individualized treatment. Dose adjustments may help optimize the balance between efficacy and tolerability, particularly in patients at higher risk of adverse events. For a population at increased risk of cognitive decline and comorbidities, the low hypoglycemia risk associated with tirzepatide may be particularly noteworthy.

Further research is warranted to explore the physiological differences influencing glycemic responses across subgroups and to assess outcomes in older, frail populations.

### Tirzepatide in hispanic / latino patients with type 2 diabetes: a subgroup analysis of the SURPASS program [^112eU9L3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, have been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes in the global phase 3 SURPASS program.

Objective

This work aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino patients in SURPASS-1 to -4 clinical trials.

Methods

A total of 5679 patients were included, 2895 of self-reported Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, in this exploratory analysis of SURPASS-1 to -4 trial data. Interventions included tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg, placebo, or active comparator (semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine). Change in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight from baseline to week 40 (SURPASS-1 and -2) and to week 52 (SURPASS-3 and -4), and other efficacy and safety outcomes were evaluated within Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino subgroups.

Results

Among Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino patients treated with tirzepatide, respectively, HbA1c decreased significantly from baseline, ranging from 1.9% to 2.7% and 1.7% to 2.5%, and body weight decreased significantly from baseline, ranging from 5.3 kg to 12.4 and 6.5 kg to 17.1 kg (both P < .05) vs comparators across all trials. Subgroup trends were consistent with the overall trial populations. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in similar proportions across the subgroups and were primarily gastrointestinal disorders. The incidence of hypoglycemia was low.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide significatively reduced HbA1c and body weight in Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino patients. Tirzepatide was generally well tolerated in both subgroups. Efficacy and safety trends were comparable between subgroups and within the overall trial populations.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity in people with type 2 diabetes (SURMOUNT-2): a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^11198zw8]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) was published by W Timothy Garvey and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of once-weekly tirzepatide in patients with obesity and T2DM? In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the population was: 626 patients (318 female, 308 male). The inclusion criteria were adults with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and HbA1c 7–10%. The key exclusion criteria were change in bodyweight > 5 kg within 3 months before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with anti-obesity medications, DPP4 inhibitors, oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, or any injectable therapy for T2DM within 3 months before screening. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 311 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 15 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 72 weeks) n = 315 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in body weight at week 72 (14.7% vs. 3.2%; ETD 11.6, 95% CI 10.1 to 13). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (83% vs. 32%; OR 10.5, 95% CI 6.8 to 16.1) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (65% vs. 9%; OR 19.4, 95% CI 11.9 to 31.7) Significant increase in reduction in HbA1c at week 72 (2.08% vs. 0.51%; ETD 1.57, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.76). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse events or serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 15 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adults with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and HbA1c 7–10%, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to a least-squares mean reduction in body weight at week 72.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tirzepatide is a GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is an amino-acid sequence including a C20 fatty diacid that enables albumin binding and prolongs the half-life. Tirzepatide selectively binds to and activates both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, the targets for native GIP and GLP-1.

Tirzepatide enhances first- and second-phase insulin secretion, and reduces glucagon levels, both in a glucose-dependent manner.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Tirzepatide lowers fasting and postprandial glucose concentration, decreases food intake, and reduces body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

First and Second-Phase Insulin Secretion

Tirzepatide enhances the first- and second-phase insulin secretion. (Figure 1)

Figure 1: Mean insulin concentration at 0–120 minutes during hyperglycemic clamp at baseline and Week 28

Insulin Sensitivity

Tirzepatide increases insulin sensitivity, as demonstrated in a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp study after 28 weeks of treatment.

Glucagon Secretion

Tirzepatide reduces fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. Tirzepatide 15 mg reduced fasting glucagon concentration by 28% and glucagon AUC after a mixed meal by 43%, compared with no change for placebo after 28 weeks of treatment.

Gastric Emptying

Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying. The delay is largest after the first dose and this effect diminishes over time. Tirzepatide slows post-meal glucose absorption, reducing postprandial glucose.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide is similar between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Steady-state plasma tirzepatide concentrations were achieved following 4 weeks of once weekly administration. Tirzepatide exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner.

Absorption

Following subcutaneous administration, the time to maximum plasma concentration of tirzepatide ranges from 8 to 72 hours. The mean absolute bioavailability of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration is 80%. Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

Distribution

The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is approximately 10.3 L. Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin (99%).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Pool of Two Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials

The data in Table 1 are derived from 2 placebo-controlled trials [1 monotherapy trial (SURPASS-1) and 1 trial in combination with basal insulin with or without metformin (SURPASS-5)] in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.4)]. These data reflect exposure of 718 patients to MOUNJARO and a mean duration of exposure to MOUNJARO of 36.6 weeks. The mean age of patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 57% White, 27% Asian, 13% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 3% Black or African American; 25% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus for an average of 9.1 years with a mean HbA1c of 8.1%. As assessed by baseline fundoscopic examination, 13% of the population had retinopathy. At baseline, eGFR was ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2in 53%, 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2in 39%, 45 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2in 7%, and 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2in 1% of patients.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^116wqHS2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The study's strengths include its large sample size and the long duration of 104 weeks. In the SURPASS‐4 trial, a significant proportion of participants were on metformin and/or sulfonylurea, which is relatively common in clinical practice. This study may provide evidence of long‐term efficacy and safety, which may assist physicians in the comprehensive management of type 2 diabetes. The real world data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database reported that tirzepatide could increase the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events. The specific potential contributions of GIP agonism to these events need further investigation. However, the gastrointestinal events were dose‐dependent in a Phase 1, randomised, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind study. While tirzepatide has demonstrated efficacy in improving glycaemic control and reducing body weight in participants with type 2 diabetes, its use may be limited by cost. This study has certain limitations. The variable treatment period beyond 52 weeks was intended to gather longer‐term safety data and to reach a predefined number of MACE‐4 events. As a result, not all participants were treated for the full 104 weeks. Only 150 participants (10.0%) completed the 104‐week follow‐up; hence the long‐term effectiveness should be interpreted with caution. Participants who completed the 104‐week follow‐up would have tolerated tirzepatide well and might have experienced high effectiveness, while those who discontinued the study earlier might have experienced lower effectiveness over time. As this study was a post‐hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial, statistical and clinical significance should be interpreted with caution. This study exclusively compared tirzepatide with insulin glargine; no direct comparisons were made between different tirzepatide doses. Consequently, we could not determine whether a dose–response relationship exists. Notably, the LS mean changes in FSG and waist circumference were slightly smaller in the 15 mg tirzepatide group compared to the 10 mg group. Hence, these findings should therefore be interpreted with caution.

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^115pw3qA]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist approved in the US for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, has demonstrated significant improvements in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and clinically meaningful weight loss in the SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials. This post hoc analysis examined the safety and efficacy results for tirzepatide in older participants with T2D who do not have obesity.

Methods

A post hoc analysis was conducted on a subgroup of participants aged ≥ 65 years with a body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m B2 amongst the pooled SURPASS-1 through -5 clinical trial populations. Primary efficacy endpoints and safety were assessed for both this subgroup and overall pooled populations.

Results

Participants aged ≥ 65 years with BMI < 30 kg/m 2 treated with tirzepatide experienced clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction (− 1.97 to − 2.10%) regardless of the assigned randomized maintenance dose. In contrast, a dose-proportional HbA1c decrease was observed in the overall population. Weight reduction in this subgroup was dose-proportional but numerically lower than in the overall population. Older participants without obesity were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events (AEs), although the overall incidence of AEs was low in this subgroup. The incidence of hypoglycemia in this group was consistent with that of the overall cohort, regardless of concurrent insulin or sulfonylurea use.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide may be an effective treatment for older adults without obesity, and in this post hoc analysis, it was associated with clinically relevant HbA1c reduction and dose-proportional weight loss without increasing hypoglycemic risk.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^1159HT6X]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved in the United States as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and under investigation for use in chronic weight management, major adverse cardiovascular events and the management of other conditions, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity and non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The Phase 3 SURPASS 1–5 clinical trial programme was designed to assess efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneously injected tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15mg), as monotherapy or combination therapy, across a broad spectrum of people with type 2 diabetes. Use of tirzepatide in clinical studies was associated with marked reductions of glycated haemoglobin (-1.87 to -2.59%, -20 to -28mmol/mol) and body weight (-6.2 to -12.9 kg), as well as reductions in parameters commonly associated with heightened cardiometabolic risk such as blood pressure, visceral adiposity and circulating triglycerides. In SUPRASS-2, these reductions were greater than with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 1 mg. Tirzepatide was well tolerated, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia when used without insulin or insulin secretagogues and showed a generally similar safety profile to the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Accordingly, evidence from these clinical trials suggests that tirzepatide offers a new opportunity for the effective lowering of glycated haemoglobin and body weight in adults with type 2 diabetes.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^115yHGJT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide treatment using three different dose-escalation regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide dose groups and dose-escalation regimens were: 12mg (4mgweeks 0–3; 8mgweeks 4–7; 12mgweeks 8–11), 15mg-1 (2.5mgweeks 0–1; 5mgweeks 2–3; 10mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11) and 15mg-2 (2.5mgweeks 0–3; 7.5mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11). The primary objective was to compare tirzepatide with placebo in HbA1c change from baseline at 12weeks.

Results

Overall, 111 patients were randomized: placebo, 26; tirzepatide 12mg, 29; tirzepatide 15mg-1, 28; tirzepatide 15mg-2, 28. The mean age was 57.4years, HbA1c 8.4% and body mass index 31.9 kg/m B2. At week 12, absolute HbA1c change from baseline (SE) was greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo (placebo, +0.2% [0.21]; 12mg, -1.7% [0.19]; 15mg-1, -2.0% [0.20]; 15mg-2, -1.8% [0.19]). The incidence of nausea was: placebo, 7.7%; 12mg group, 24.1%; 15mg-1 group, 39.3%; 15mg-2 group, 35.7%. Three patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, one from each of the placebo, 12mg and 15mg-1 groups.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide treatment for 12weeks resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c. This suggests that lower starting doses and smaller dose increments are associated with a more favourable side effect profile.

### Time spent in glycaemic control with sustained body weight reduction with tirzepatide: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trial programme [^114diRcC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In the SURPASS‐3 and SURPASS‐4 trials, participants randomized to insulin were titrated to a target fasting blood glucose (< 90 mg/dL [5 mmol/L] and < 100 mg/dL [6 mmol/L], respectively) following a treat‐to‐target algorithm. Similarly, in SURPASS‐5, background insulin glargine treatment was titrated to a target fasting blood glucose of < 100 mg/dL (6 mmol/L) following a treat‐to‐target algorithm. Therefore, it is unsurprising that a large proportion of participants randomized to insulin and placebo in these studies were able to achieve and maintain a FSG ≤ 125 mg/dL (7 mmol/L). Nonetheless, an approximately equal or higher proportion of participants randomized to tirzepatide were able to achieve and maintain this target for the same or longer period in these studies. Notably, this was achieved with a significantly lower incidence of hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 54 mg/dL or severe) compared with participants randomized to insulin, ranging from 1% to 2% with tirzepatide versus 7% for insulin degludec in SURPASS‐3 and 6%–9% with tirzepatide versus 19% for insulin glargine in SURPASS‐4.

Limitations of this study include the post hoc analyses that are exploratory in nature. There was a relatively short duration of follow‐up in these studies (40 or 52 weeks). The visit intervals for HbA1c and weight measurements ranged from 4 to 16 weeks, which do not allow for a complete assessment of continuous achievement of these endpoints. Therefore, caution must be exercised during interpretation.

In conclusion, in this participant‐level exploratory analysis of the SURPASS clinical trial programme, treatment with tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg was associated with a substantially longer continuous time in glycaemic control with HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and sustained body weight reduction of ≥ 5% compared with placebo and active comparators in participants with T2D. Furthermore, treatment with tirzepatide was associated with longer continuous time spent with FSG ≤ 125 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) compared with placebo and semaglutide. The long‐term benefits of simultaneously achieving these targets should be further examined.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^112qd6R9]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

7 Conclusion

Both tirzepatide and semaglutide demonstrated considerable efficacy in reducing body weight with minimal to moderate severity AEs. However, tirzepatide consistently produced greater weight loss compared to semaglutide but with higher rates of AEs. The limited number of direct comparative studies and relatively short follow‐up periods prevent a definitive conclusion of tirzepatide's superiority over semaglutide. Future research should focus on larger, long‐term, head‐to‐head trials to confirm these findings and provide more robust data on the comparative effectiveness of these medications.

### Use of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: scientific evidence and practical aspects [^112dpbX2]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a novel antidiabetic medication a single-molecule, agonist to the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors. It is approved in the USA and EU for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Due to the potential novelty represented by incorporating tirzepatide to clinical practice, we aim to review practical aspects of tirzepatide use in T2DM and the supporting scientific evidence. A group of ten endocrinologists involved as investigators in the phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial program followed a nominal group technique, a qualitative research methodology designed as a semi-structured group discussion to reach a consensus on the selection of a set of practical aspects. The scientific evidence for tirzepatide has been reviewed with respect to a number of patients' clinical profiles and care goals. Information of interest related to adverse events, special warnings and precautions, and other considerations for tirzepatide use has been included. Finally, information provided to the patients has been summarized. The practical aspects reported herein may be helpful in guiding physicians in the use of tirzepatide and contribute to optimizing the management of T2DM.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^112q6WAU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To evaluate the long‐term efficacy and safety data at 104 weeks in tirzepatide‐treated participants with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and/or sulfonylurea.

Materials and Methods

This post‐hoc analysis was based on the SURPASS‐4 data (NCT03730662), a multicenter, Phase III trial. Participants were randomised to receive tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or insulin glargine. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 104 weeks. Key secondary endpoints were changes in body weight and the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c < 7.0%. Safety endpoints included the incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemia.

Results

This post‐hoc analysis included 1,500 participants. At Week 104, participants in the tirzepatide groups had significantly greater mean reduction in HbA1c (5 mg: −2.3%, 10 mg: −2.5%, 15 mg: −2.6%) compared with the insulin glargine group (−1.0%) (p < 0.001). Participants in the tirzepatide groups had significantly greater reduction in body weight (5 mg: −7.6 kg, 10 mg: −10.0 kg, 15 mg: −11.4 kg) compared with the insulin glargine group (2.1 kg) (p < 0.001). Significantly more participants in the tirzepatide group achieved HbA1c < 7.0% compared with the insulin glargine group (p < 0.001). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the tirzepatide groups, and gastrointestinal AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide significantly improved glycaemic control and body weight reduction compared to insulin glargine over 104 weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and/or sulfonylurea. The safety profile of tirzepatide was acceptable, with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than insulin glargine.

### GLP-1-based therapies for type 2 diabetes: from single, dual and triple agonists to endogenous GLP-1 production and L-cell differentiation [^112FoQjE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

The SURPASS-1 trial demonstrated significant improvements in glycemic control and substantial reductions in body weight with all three doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) compared to placebo over a 40-week period. These results were observed in patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and who had no prior experience with injectable diabetes therapy. In the second trial, SURPASS-2, tirzepatide administered at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg showed superior efficacy compared to semaglutide (1 mg) in reducing body weight and HbA1c levels over 40 weeks in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin.

Following this, the SURPASS-3 trial evaluated tirzepatide in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by metformin, with or without SGLT2 inhibitors. In this study, once-weekly subcutaneous injections of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) were compared to once-daily subcutaneous injections of titrated insulin degludec. Tirzepatide showed greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight at week 52, along with a lower risk of hypoglycemia.

In the SURPASS-4 trial, adults with T2DM at heightened cardiovascular risk, who were inadequately managed with oral glucose-lowering agents, once-weekly tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) were compared to insulin glargine (100 U/mL). The findings were compelling, tirzepatide not only achieved greater reductions in HbA1c but also delivered significant body weight loss, all while showing a lower incidence of hypoglycemia at the 52-week mark. More importantly, the hazard ratio for major adverse cardiovascular events (including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina) for the pooled tirzepatide groups versus glargine was 0.74 (95% CI 0.51–1.08), suggesting no increased cardiovascular risk with tirzepatide compared to insulin glargine. These findings highlight tirzepatide's potential to revolutionize treatment for high-risk T2DM patients, offering not only improved metabolic control but also a favorable cardiovascular safety profile.

Adding GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonists:
A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide against placebo or active comparator in people with T2D included six RCT (data from 6579 subjects; 4410 in the tirzepatide group and 2054 in the control group). Tirzepatide treatment reduced HbA1c, the primary endpoint (WMD – 1.07%, 95% CI – 1.44 to – 0.56, I 2 98%). Secondary efficacy endpoints also improved with tirzepatide. Fasting serum glucose (WMD – 21.50 mg/dL, 95% CI – 34.44 to – 8.56), body weight (WMD – 7.99 kg, 95% CI – 11.36 to – 4.62, I 2 99%), blood pressure, and fasting lipid profiles, without increasing hypoglycemia, either as monotherapy or add-on therapy. Tirzepatide increased the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (risk ratio 3.32, 95% IC 1.3 to 8.5, I 2 95%) as add-on therapy, but not in terms of pancreatitis or cholelithiasis. Furthermore, tirzepatide presented a dose-response effect (1 mg to 15 mg) on decreased HbA1c and body weight.

In treatment-naïve asymptomatic adults with T2D, in whom HbA1c is 7.5% to 9%, triple therapy, including metformin and two AD1 or AD, MAY BE CONSIDERED to improve glycemic control.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^115oh8ff]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the USA, Europe, and the UAE. Tirzepatide is an acylated peptide engineered to activate the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, key mediators of insulin secretion that are also expressed in regions of the brain that regulate food intake. Five clinical trials in type 2-diabetic subjects (SURPASS 1–5) have shown that tirzepatide at 5–15 mg per week reduces both HbA 1c (1.24 to 2.58%) and body weight (5.4–11.7 kg) by amounts unprecedented for a single agent. A sizable proportion of patients (23.0 to 62.4%) reached an HbA 1c of < 5.7% (which is the upper limit of the normal range indicating normoglycaemia), and 20.7 to 68.4% lost more than 10% of their baseline body weight. Tirzepatide was significantly more effective in reducing HbA 1c and body weight than the selective GLP-1 RA semaglutide (1.0 mg per week), and titrated basal insulin. Adverse events related to tirzepatide were similar to what has been reported for selective GLP-1RA, mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation, that were more common at higher doses. Cardiovascular events have been adjudicated across the whole study program, and MACE-4 (nonfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death and hospital admission for angina) events tended to be reduced over up to a 2 year-period, albeit with low numbers of events. For none of the cardiovascular events analysed (MACE-4, or its components) was a hazard ratio > 1.0 vs. pooled comparators found in a meta-analysis covering the whole clinical trial program, and the upper bounds of the confidence intervals for MACE were < 1.3, fulfilling conventional definitions of cardiovascular safety. Tirzepatide was found to improve insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory responses to a greater extent than semaglutide, and this was associated with lower prandial insulin and glucagon concentrations. Both drugs caused similar reductions in appetite, although tirzepatide caused greater weight loss. While the clinical effects of tirzepatide have been very encouraging, important questions remain as to the mechanism of action. While GIP reduces food intake and body weight in rodents, these effects have not been demonstrated in humans. Moreover, it remains to be shown that GIPR agonism can improve insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients who have been noted in previous studies to be unresponsive to GIP. Certainly, the apparent advantage of tirzepatide, a dual incretin agonist, over GLP-1RA will spark renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of GIP in type 2 diabetes, obesity and related co-morbidities.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to-5: efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^115UfzEz]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of composite outcome measures in addition to individual treatment targets to assess overall disease control has become common practice, particularly for T2D. Previous studies of GLP-1 RAs in the LEAD, AWARD, and SUSTAIN clinical trial programs including liraglutide, dulaglutide and semaglutide, respectively, have analyzed the composite outcomes of HbA1c < 7.0% without weight gain or hypoglycemia versus active comparators. In each program, the GLP-1 RA was able to help participants achieve the composite outcome more frequently than other non-GLP-1 RA comparators. The present analysis uses a stricter composite outcome definition (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, weight reduction ≥ 10%, and no hypoglycemia) to assess tirzepatide, a novel GIP/GLP-1 RA, which has not been reported previously, to our knowledge. Although stricter HbA1c criteria have been proposed previously because of potential benefit to long-term outcomes, implementation has been limited because of hypoglycemia risk and the inability of those medications to attain this level of glycemic control. Additionally, few non-surgical therapies have been able to consistently result in ≥ 10% weight reduction. The ability of participants randomized to tirzepatide to achieve this stricter composite definition consistently across various participant subgroups highlights several intriguing questions that require additional research. For example, what would be the relationship between this stricter composite endpoint and long-term outcomes such as mortality or cardiovascular events when the hypoglycemia risk is low? How does this composite relate to adherence or participant-reported outcomes? How does the risk/benefit calculation for considering stricter targets in various participant subgroups change? This composite endpoint approach may help clinicians as they strive to make comprehensive decisions with their patients with T2D with various clinical characteristics consistent with the updated guideline recommendations.

### Tirzepatide in hispanic / latino patients with type 2 diabetes: a subgroup analysis of the SURPASS program [^111zp1Xt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety

Across tirzepatide and comparator arms, the incidence of TEAEs was similar for Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino patients in SURPASS-1, SURPASS-3, and SURPASS-4 (Table 2); the percentage of patients with 1 or more TEAEs ranged from 66% to 74% among Hispanic/Latino patients and from 64% to 70% among non-Hispanic/Latino patients. In SURPASS-2, 59% of Hispanic/Latino patients and 83% of non-Hispanic/Latino patients reported 1 or more TEAEs. The most common TEAEs across SURPASS-1 to -4 were related to gastrointestinal disorders both for Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino patients.

Table 2.
Treatment-emergent adverse events (occurring in ≥ 5% of Hispanic/Latino or non-Hispanic/Latino patients and the overall population across tirzepatide and comparator arms) and the incidence of level 2 (glucose < 54 mg/dL) or level 3 hypoglycemia in the SURPASS-1 to -4 trials

In the overall patient population, across the trials, the incidence of documented level 2 (glucose < 54 mg/dL) or level 3 hypoglycemia was low among patients in the tirzepatide treatment arms, ranging from no episodes in SURPASS-1 (tirzepatide monotherapy) to 9% in SURPASS-4, where approximately 55% of patients were treated with sulfonylurea therapy at baseline. In the comparator arms, the incidence ranged from 1% in the placebo arm of SURPASS-1 to 19% in the insulin glargine arm of SURPASS-4. When tirzepatide was added to metformin in SURPASS-2 and to metformin with or without an SGLT2i in SURPASS-3, the incidence of clinically significant hypoglycemia was also very low. Across the trials, incidence of level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia for Hispanic/Latino patients and non-Hispanic/Latino patients was comparable to the overall population. In each of the studies, there was no relationship between the tirzepatide dose and the incidence of hypoglycemia.

### Cost per patient achieving treatment targets and number needed to treat with tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States [^1171zCNs]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide, a novel GIP/GLP-1 RA, was associated with a lower cost per responder than semaglutide 1 mg for patients with T2D, while also offering greater potential to achieve stringent glycemic, weight loss, and composite treatment targets. While tirzepatide and semaglutide 1 mg have a similar cost per responder to achieve a HbA1c goal of < 7.0%, tirzepatide provides improved efficacy and better value than semaglutide 1 mg in helping patients achieve lower HbA1c thresholds and weight loss goals without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. The results of this short-term cost-effectiveness analysis may be helpful to US third-party payers when evaluating new treatment options for patients with T2D who require additional control.

3.3 Hypoglycaemia

Despite the magnitude of the observed effect of tirzepatide on glycaemia, the incidence of hypoglycaemia, defined as clinically significant [blood glucose < 54 mg/dl (< 3 mmol/L)] or severe, was low across the SURPASS studies. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower for insulin‐naïve participants assigned to tirzepatide (1%‐2%) compared with insulin degludec (7%) and for tirzepatide (6%‐9%) compared with insulin glargine 100 U/ml (19%). In the high cardiovascular risk population of SURPASS‐4, 145 hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the tirzepatide arms and 492 in the insulin glargine 100 U/ml arm. The incidence appeared to be dependent on concomitant medication use; hypoglycaemia occurred in 10%‐14% of tirzepatide‐treated participants using a sulphonylurea at baseline and 1%‐3% of those who did not use a sulphonylurea. In SURPASS‐5 (in which participants used background insulin) tirzepatide did not increase hypoglycaemia compared with placebo (14%‐19% vs. 13%, respectively). These results suggest that the risk of hypoglycaemia attributable to tirzepatide is low when not combined with an insulin secretagogue or insulin.

3.3 Adverse Events

Adverse events (AEs) were reported in four studies, with the most common being gastrointestinal (GI) AEs. Across two studies, the total number of people who experienced at least one AE was 1354 (67.8%), with 988 (68.0%) people in the tirzepatide group and 344 (67.1%) people in the semaglutide group. 966 (48.4%) people experienced GI AEs, with 771 (53.0%) in the tirzepatide group and 267 (52.0%) in the semaglutide group. Frias et al. reported that 66.3% of the patients experienced 1 or more events, with 5.2% experiencing one or more serious AEs. 13 deaths were noted in the study, with investigators ruling that none of the deaths were related to the tirzepatide or semaglutide interventions. It was noted that the AEs were more common with 10 and 15 mg tirzepatide compared to the 5 mg tirzepatide and semaglutide groups. Rodriguez et al. reported GI AEs rate per 1000 person‐years, with no significant differences in AEs noted between the two groups. For the non‐T2DM cohort, Anson et al. reported no statistically significant difference between the tirzepatide and semaglutide groups in clinically significant hypoglycaemia or acute pancreatitis rates. As for the T2DM cohort, compared to semaglutide, tirzepatide was associated with a significant decrease in all‐cause mortality over 12 months as well as cerebral infarction rates. The tirzepatide group also had a significant increase in diabetic neuropathy rates. No significant difference in rates was found for heart failure, ischemic heart disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, or suicidal attempt or ideation. A summary of AEs is provided in Table 3.

### The dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide: a novel cardiometabolic therapeutic prospect [^111CWCvJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

A dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist

An ideal antidiabetic medication should present proven efficacy in lowering elevated glucose levels, promote weight loss, have low risk of hypoglycemia and offer cardiovascular benefits. The idea of simultaneously activating both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors seems appealing for treatment of T2DM since it may significantly boost insulin secretion and improve insulin sensitivity. The main physiological actions of such compound are depicted in Fig. 1; the rationale is based on the fact that improved glycemia restores sensitivity to GIP and peptide engineering enables the design of hybrid ligands exhibiting dual agonism, as proved in experimental studies.

Fig. 1
Main physiological actions of the dual GIP and GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide. GIP — glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; GLP-1 — glucagon-like peptide-1. Despite the similarities between the two incretins, it should be pinpointed that while GIP activity is mainly pancreatic, GLP-1 activity is systemic

Tirzepatide, the first dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is in keeping with these conceptions. Its chemical formula is based on the GIP amino acid sequence and its half-life of approximately 5 days is compatible with a once-weekly subcutaneous administration. Chemically, tirzepatide is a synthetic linear peptide containing 39 aminoacids based on the native GIP sequence. This basic structure is accompanied by a 20-carbon fatty diacid moiety that prolongs its half-life. The mechanism of action is very imbalanced, since while it has a comparable GIP receptor binding affinity to native GIP, the affinity to the native GLP-1 receptor is five times lower. So, it is a bireceptor agonist, product of the above mentioned peptide engineering, created as a single agent possessing activity at more than one pharmacological target.

The study SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) was published by Hiddo J L Heerspink and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the trial question was: is tirzepatide superior to insulin glargine in patients with T2DM with regard to renal outcomes? In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the population was: 1995 patients. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM mellitus, chronic or acute pancreatitis, acute or chronic hepatitis, diabetic retinopathy requiring urgent treatment, heart attack or stroke in the past 2 months. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 995 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the randomly assigned maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly was reached, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1000 insulin glargine (titrated to 100 U/mL SC once daily). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in estimated glomerular filtration decline (1.4 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m²; AD -2.2 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -1.6 to -2.8). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in urine albumin-creatinine ratio reduction (6.8% vs. -36.9%; AD 31.9%, 95% CI 25.7 to 37.7). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine with respect to estimated glomerular filtration decline.

### Tirzepatide vs insulin lispro added to basal insulin in type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS-6 randomized clinical trial [^111khTsH]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SURPASS-6 was published by Julio Rosenstock and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin? In the SURPASS-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-6 study, the population was: 1425 patients (822 female, 603 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin. The key exclusion criteria were diagnosis of T1DM; history of pancreatitis; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; diabetic macular edema; non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring immediate treatment; severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness. In the SURPASS-6 study, the interventions were: n = 717 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the randomly assigned maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly was reached, and continued for a total of 52 weeks) n = 708 insulin lispro (prandial dose of 100 IU/mL TID for 52 weeks). In the SURPASS-6 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in HbA1c at week 52 (2.11% vs. 1.13%; AD 0.98%, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.17). In the SURPASS-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving HbA1c target < 7.0% at week 52 (68% vs. 36%; OR 4.2, 95% CI 3.2 to 5.5) Significant increase in reduction in body weight at week 52 (9 kg vs. -3.2 kg; AD 12.2 kg, 95% CI 10.9 to 13.4). In the SURPASS-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in ≥ 1 serious adverse event, death. significant difference in severe hypoglycemia (0.4% vs. 4.2%). In the SURPASS-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin, tirzepatide was superior to insulin lispro with respect to reduction in HbA1c at week 52.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^116zcfey]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, 25% of participants who were receiving SGLT2 inhibitors were excluded from our analysis. In the SURPASS‐3 and SURPASS‐4 trials, 32% and 25% of participants, respectively, were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors with or without metformin, while the majority were managed with metformin and/or sulfonylureas. Consequently, the findings of our study provide evidence supporting the efficacy of tirzepatide specifically in participants not receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, thereby addressing a clinically relevant subgroup that may benefit from tirzepatide add‐on therapy. The safety events reported in this post‐hoc analysis were consistent with those observed in the SURPASS‐4 and SURPASS‐AP‐Combo studies. The lower incidence of hypoglycaemia and mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse events reported with tirzepatide compared with insulin glargine is particularly noteworthy factors in favour of the long‐term tirzepatide treatment, considering that hypoglycaemia and weight gain are major limiting factors in the use of insulin therapy. The MACE events and all‐cause death were consistent with those observed in the SURPASS‐4 study with no increased risk for MACE in participants treated with tirzepatide compared to insulin glargine. Cardiovascular risk is an important parameter as cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes.

### Cost per patient achieving treatment targets and number needed to treat with tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States [^115zmXKx]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

In this analysis, all tirzepatide doses had numerically lower NNTs to achieve treatment outcomes than semaglutide 1 mg. All doses of tirzepatide across composite endpoints (HbA1c < 7.0%, ≤ 6.5%, or < 5.7%/weight loss ≥ 10%/no hypoglycemia) had a statistically significantly lower NNT than semaglutide 1 mg, demonstrating that tirzepatide provides greater efficacy to achieve lower HbA1c thresholds and weight loss goals without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

The differences observed between treatments were more pronounced at more stringent endpoints. At a glycemic goal of HbA1c < 5.7%, the NNTs for tirzepatide 10 mg (2.5) and 15 mg (2.2) were less than half that of semaglutide 1 mg (5.3), meaning that twice as many patients would achieve this endpoint on tirzepatide as on semaglutide 1 mg. The greatest differences between the two agents were observed for the weight loss endpoint of ≥ 15%, where the NNTs for tirzepatide 10 mg (4.2) and 15 mg (2.8) were one-third and one-quarter that of semaglutide 1 mg (12.5), respectively.

### Cost per patient achieving treatment targets and number needed to treat with tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States [^115EK6Ua]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

This analysis is intended to provide healthcare decision makers with a simple comparison of all doses of tirzepatide and semaglutide 1 mg in terms of achieving different T2D treatment targets and more stringent HbA1c and weight endpoints that may provide additional long-term benefits. The outcomes assessed in this analysis align with current guideline recommendations, recognizing the value of lower glycemic targets and weight loss in a patient-centered approach to T2D management. The findings complement those reported by Zhang and McAdam Marx, who concluded that, based on the short-term cost offsets of improved glycemic control and weight loss and the associated downstream benefits, payers may view tirzepatide as a cost-effective treatment in addition to metformin in patients with inadequately controlled T2D who are overweight or obese.

Results of epidemiologic analyses of landmark clinical trials in patients with diabetes suggest that, at a population level, the greatest number of complications will be averted by taking patients from very poor to fair or good glycemic control. The findings indicate that there is no need to deintensify therapy for patients with HbA1c values between 6 and 7% who have a low hypoglycemia risk and long life expectancy. Newer agents such as tirzepatide that have a low incidence of hypoglycemia and positive effects on weight make it possible to maintain glycemic control safely while potentially avoiding microvascular and macrovascular complications and their associated costs in patients with T2D.

### Tirzepatide: a novel, first-in-class, dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonist [^112E6rv2]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide and discuss its potential role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide is a novel once-weekly dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist which has been studied in the SURPASS clinical trials in doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg. Tirzepatide phase III clinical trials, SURPASS-1 through SURPASS-5, demonstrate that this medication is safe and effective in treating type 2 diabetes both with and without a variety of background medications versus placebo, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine in different patient populations. Most adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature, with a relatively low withdrawal rate in the active treatment arms. It seems likely that tirzepatide will be recommended as a preferred option in the American Diabetes Association treatment algorithm for high glucose lowering effects in patients with a compelling need for low hypoglycemia risk and weight loss. However, the positioning of tirzepatide in the treatment algorithm will ultimately be dependent on the results of the cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) or other outcome-based trials. Tirzepatide is effective for treating type 2 diabetes by lowering glycated hemoglobin and contributing to significant weight loss.

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^113q7zP1]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The older adult population living with T2D represents a heterogenous group with varying clinical characteristics, including diabetes duration, complications, polypharmacy and concerns such as heightened hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, older adults with T2D have accelerated muscle loss as well as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and macrovascular complications. These factors must be considered in treatment decisions, particularly as this population is projected to increase considerably by 2050. Understanding the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in managing T2D in this demographic is thus clinically relevant.

In previous studies, treatment with tirzepatide in adults with T2D was found to be dose-dependently effective in achieving a composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 6.5% and weight reduction ≥ 10% without hypoglycemia in participants above/below 65 years old, and with BMI < 30 kg/m 2, between 30–35 kg/m 2 and over 35 kg/m 2. Additionally, in a predominantly East Asian participant population, a population that tends to have lower BMI, participants receiving tirzepatide had reductions in BMI that brought them into the healthy range for BMI with few participants achieving an 'underweight' BMI.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity [^115qC5gV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) was published by Ania M Jastreboff and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose tirzepatide in people with obesity? In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the population was: 1273 patients (862 female, 411 male). The inclusion criteria were adults with a BMI > 30 kg/m², or > 27 kg/m² and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; a change in body weight > 5 kg within 90 days before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with a medication that promotes weight loss within 90 days before screening. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 630 low-dose tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 5 mg once weekly for a total of 72 weeks) n = 643 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (15% vs. 3.1%; AD 11.9%, 95% CI 10.4 to 13.4). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (85.1% vs. 34.5%; AD 50.6%, 95% CI 20.58 to 80.62) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (68.5% vs. 18.8%; AD 49.7%, 95% CI 20.21 to 79.19) Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference (14 cm vs. 4 cm; AD 10.1 cm, 95% CI 4.11 to 16.09). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adults with a BMI > 30 kg/m², or > 27 kg/m² and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes, low-dose tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### Tirzepatide outcompetes long-acting insulin in managing type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of three phase 3 randomized controlled trials [^113FTjJB]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide with those of long-acting or ultra-long-acting insulin for type 2 diabetes. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from the inception to August 20, 2023. All clinical trials or randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of tirzepatide with long-acting or ultra-long-acting insulin for treating type 2 diabetes were included. Three randomized clinical trials, namely SURPASS-3, SURPASS-4, and SURPASS-AP-Combo, with 4339 patients were included. Compared with daily insulin glargine and degludec, once-weekly tirzepatide significantly decreased HbA1c (WMD -1.08%, 95% CI (-1.37, -0.78)), 2h-posprandial blood sugar (BS) (WMD -28.19mg/dL, 95% CI (-44.98, -11.41)), pre-meal BS (WMD -11.86mg/dL, 95% CI (-22.83, -0.9)), body weight (WMD -10.61kg, 95% CI (-13.24, -7.97)), systolic blood pressure (WMD -6.47mmHg, 95% CI (-8.32, -4.61)), diastolic blood pressure (WMD -2.30mmHg, 95% CI (-3.05, -1.55)), total cholesterol (WMD -4.78%, 95% CI (-7.05, -2.50)), triglyceride (WMD -14.49%, 95% CI (-19.55, -9.43)), LDL cholesterol (WMD -5.98%, 95% CI (-9.83, -2.13)), and VLDL cholesterol (WMD -14.18%, 95% CI (-19.03, -9.33)) and increased HDL cholesterol (WMD 7.13%, 95% CI (-9.83, -2.13)), with a lower risk of hypoglycemia defined as BS ≤ 70mg/dL (RR 0.46, 95% CI (0.28, 0.75)). All doses of once-weekly tirzepatide (5mg, 10mg, and 15mg) were superior or non-inferior to insulin. Once-weekly tirzepatide can be a substitution for long-acting insulin in type 2 diabetes with a greater efficacy.
