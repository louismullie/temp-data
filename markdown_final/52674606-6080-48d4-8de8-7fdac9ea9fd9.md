## Question

what is the time frame to repeat imaging on a patient with a PE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate time frame to repeat imaging in a patient with a pulmonary embolism, including when routine follow-up imaging is indicated, how to approach suspected recurrence, and considerations for special populations, with attention to timing and imaging modality choices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-backed routine follow-up window and whether routine re-imaging is indicated. Then, I should verify the evidence on thrombus resolution and how that informs the timing of any optional baseline imaging. Next, I will examine indications for repeat imaging driven by symptoms or suspected recurrence and the role of comparing to prior studies. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnancy, pediatrics, and COVID-19. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and summarize the key time frames and modality choices with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the routine follow-up recommendation. The 2019 ESC/ERS guideline advises routine clinical re-evaluation at 3–6 months after acute PE, but it does not recommend routine repeat imaging for asymptomatic patients, which aligns with contemporary position papers emphasizing symptom-guided assessment rather than scheduled scans [^112esCg3] [^113ZzFLZ].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for avoiding routine re-imaging. Thrombus resolution is often incomplete at 3–6 months, with studies showing residual defects persisting in roughly half of patients at 6–11 months. Therefore, routine re-imaging risks detecting clinically insignificant residual thrombus and may prompt unnecessary interventions, so imaging should be symptom-driven rather than routine [^115om9dn] [^115yJWNs].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing if a baseline is desired for future comparisons. If a baseline is needed, repeating imaging around 3 months is reasonable because it captures the typical trajectory of partial resolution and can serve as a comparator if recurrence is suspected later. Some nuclear medicine guidance also supports a 1–3 month follow-up perfusion scan in selected contexts, though this is not a universal mandate and should be individualized [^113gzZF2] [^115om9dn].

> Next, I should review when to image for suspected recurrence. I need to ensure we do not jump to conclusions based on residual defects alone. Comparison with prior imaging is essential to distinguish new thrombus from residual clot, and new segmental or more proximal filling defects on CTPA or new perfusion defects on V/Q scanning, in the right clinical context, support recurrence, whereas isolated subsegmental findings are less specific and should be interpreted cautiously [^113xQUCg] [^111xzdPY].

> Let me consider the role of D-dimer in suspected recurrence. I initially thought a negative D-dimer could reliably exclude recurrence, but wait, I should double-check that assumption. D-dimer has limited utility in patients already on anticoagulation and in certain populations, so a negative D-dimer does not reliably exclude recurrence in these settings, and imaging decisions should remain clinical and, when indicated, anchored to prior studies for comparison [^111xzdPY] [^113xQUCg].

> I will now examine modality selection for repeat imaging. CTPA is generally preferred when available due to speed and anatomical detail, but V/Q scanning is valuable when contrast is contraindicated, in renal impairment, or to limit radiation; importantly, if the initial study was suboptimal or nondiagnostic, repeating with an optimized modality or alternative test is appropriate, and in pregnancy or contrast allergy, V/Q is often prioritized to minimize fetal radiation or nephrotoxicity [^115yzD9T] [^112TtaPm] [^111LNRsG].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or a child. In pregnancy, I should confirm that V/Q is preferred when the chest radiograph is normal and CTPA when the chest radiograph is abnormal or V/Q is nondiagnostic, with careful attention to technique to avoid repeat nondiagnostic studies; in pediatrics, data are limited, so imaging should be minimized and decisions individualized, ideally within pediatric protocols that weigh radiation and diagnostic yield [^112TtaPm] [^111LNRsG] [^1169pGr9].

> Let me think about COVID-19 and other contexts where imaging may be repeated. In COVID-19, repeat imaging is reasonable when clinical deterioration occurs to assess for progression or superimposed PE, and in patients with sickle cell disease, V/Q may be favored to reduce radiation when chest radiography is normal. These are scenario-specific and should be framed within broader diagnostic stewardship to avoid unnecessary CTs [^112DXhDY] [^116DkyMw].

> I should confirm the approach to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Persistent or new dyspnea after 3 months of adequate anticoagulation warrants evaluation for CTEPH, typically beginning with echocardiography and, if pulmonary hypertension is suspected, proceeding to V/Q scanning to detect chronic thromboembolic disease. Earlier assessment is justified in highly symptomatic or deteriorating patients, and structured follow-up programs can improve detection and outcomes [^113QMMYp] [^113c3R32] [^113Cqjiq].

> Next, I should review the evidence on post-PE impairment and why structured follow-up matters. The FOCUS study showed that post-PE impairment is common and strongly associated with CTEPH, supporting systematic follow-up with functional assessment and targeted imaging when indicated. This reinforces the principle that imaging should be driven by symptoms, risk factors, and functional status rather than a fixed calendar [^114J3imv] [^113pogri].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. No routine repeat imaging is needed for asymptomatic patients after PE. If a baseline is desired for future comparisons, consider imaging around 3 months. If symptoms suggest recurrence, compare new imaging with prior studies to distinguish new thrombus from residual clot. Choose CTPA or V/Q based on availability, contraindications, and prior test quality. And escalate evaluation for CTEPH if dyspnea persists beyond 3 months despite adequate anticoagulation, using echocardiography and V/Q as first-line tools [^112esCg3] [^113ZzFLZ] [^115yzD9T] [^113QMMYp].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key time frames are explicit. Routine clinical follow-up at 3–6 months is recommended, but routine repeat imaging is not advised for asymptomatic patients. Optional baseline imaging, if needed, is reasonable around 3 months. Suspected recurrence warrants imaging with comparison to prior studies. Persistent or new dyspnea after 3 months should trigger evaluation for CTEPH, with modality selection tailored to clinical context and patient factors [^113pogri] [^113gzZF2] [^113QMMYp] [^115yzD9T].

Routine repeat imaging after acute PE is **not recommended** for asymptomatic patients after completing standard anticoagulation [^112esCg3] [^113NHxNB]. Imaging is indicated only for **persistent or recurrent symptoms** (dyspnea, chest pain, or signs of right heart strain) [^113QMMYp] or when complications such as CTEPH are suspected [^113c3R32]. If needed, repeat imaging is typically performed at **3–6 months** [^112esCg3] to assess thrombus resolution or residual obstruction, and at **6–12 months** if symptoms persist or CTEPH is a concern [^113QMMYp]. CTPA is preferred for detailed vascular assessment, while V/Q scanning is used when CTPA is contraindicated or to evaluate chronic thromboembolic disease [^115yzD9T] [^113XLkej]. Routine imaging is not recommended to guide anticoagulation duration or detect recurrence in asymptomatic patients [^111A4Z7B] [^113ZzFLZ].

---

## Indications for repeat imaging

Repeat imaging is **indicated** in the following scenarios:

- **Persistent or recurrent symptoms**: Dyspnea, chest pain, or signs of right heart strain after completing standard anticoagulation [^113QMMYp].

- **Suspected complications**: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or residual pulmonary vascular obstruction (RPVO) [^113QMMYp] [^115yJWNs].

- **Clinical deterioration**: New or worsening symptoms suggestive of recurrent PE or complications [^112J6JMA].

---

## Recommended time frames for repeat imaging

The timing of repeat imaging **depends on clinical context** and the presence of symptoms:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended time frame for repeat imaging** |
|-|-|
| Persistent or recurrent symptoms after standard anticoagulation | 3–6 months [^113QMMYp] |
| Suspected CTEPH or RPVO | 6–12 months after acute PE [^notfound] |
| Routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients | Not recommended [^113ZzFLZ] |

---

## Imaging modalities for repeat imaging

The choice of imaging modality **depends on clinical context**, patient factors, and availability:

- **Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)**: Preferred for detailed assessment of pulmonary arteries and thrombus resolution [^115yzD9T].

- **Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan**: Useful for evaluating chronic thromboembolic disease, especially when CTPA is contraindicated (e.g. contrast allergy, renal impairment) [^113XLkej].

- **Echocardiography**: Recommended for initial assessment of suspected CTEPH or right heart dysfunction [^113ZzFLZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** and symptom-guided imaging:

- **ESC 2019 guidelines**: Recommend routine clinical follow-up at 3–6 months [^112esCg3], with imaging reserved for symptomatic patients or suspected complications [^113ZzFLZ].

- **ASH 2020 guidelines**: Advise against routine use of prognostic scores, D-dimer testing, or ultrasound to guide anticoagulation duration or detect recurrence in asymptomatic patients [^111A4Z7B].

- **ACR Appropriateness Criteria**: Provide evidence-based recommendations for imaging in suspected recurrent PE or complications, emphasizing clinical correlation and prior imaging comparison [^115yzD9T] [^112J6JMA].

---

## Risks and benefits of repeat imaging

Repeat imaging has both potential benefits and risks. Benefits include detection of complications such as **CTEPH** or RPVO, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes [^113QMMYp] [^114J3imv], and provision of reassurance and confirmation of thrombus resolution in symptomatic patients. Risks include **radiation exposure** — particularly with repeated CT scans [^1139stMQ] — **contrast-related complications** (e.g. nephropathy, allergic reactions), and false positives that may lead to unnecessary interventions or anxiety [^115xQJ3G].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine repeat imaging**: Not recommended for asymptomatic patients after standard anticoagulation [^113pogri].

- **Symptomatic patients**: Imaging at 3–6 months if symptoms persist or recur [^113QMMYp].

- **Suspected CTEPH or RPVO**: Imaging at 6–12 months after acute PE [^notfound].

- **Imaging modality**: CTPA preferred; V/Q scan or echocardiography as alternatives based on clinical context [^115yzD9T] [^111m2sux].

---

Routine repeat imaging after acute PE is **not recommended** for asymptomatic patients. Imaging is reserved for symptomatic patients or when complications are suspected, with timing and modality individualized based on clinical context and patient factors.

### Clinical and imaging aspects of pulmonary embolism: a primer for radiologists [^115hukBv]. Clinical Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many advancements have been made in imaging modalities that can be used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is still the preferred gold standard for promptly diagnosing pulmonary embolism by looking for filling defects caused by the embolus lodged within the main pulmonary artery or its respective branches. The diagnosis is made by the radiologists in emergency settings where quick detection of a PE on CTPA helps the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) in quick management. Thus, utmost care is needed to follow standard image acquisition protocols and optimal contrast administration techniques to achieve a contrast opacification of at least 210 Hounsfield units for the radiologists to easily pinpoint an embolus within the pulmonary arteries. Even following proper CTPA scan acquisition guidelines, a CTPA image is prone to several artifacts that can be mistaken for a PE, resulting in a false positive read. In addition to this, many incidental findings, that can be the etiology of chest pain in a PE-suspected patient, are often overlooked by emergency radiologists who try to be as quick as possible in their read so that timely management of PE can be ensued. Taking this into account, our review paper provides the audience with a comprehensive understanding of the clinical aspects of pulmonary embolism and the imaging modalities used for PE detection. The main focus is on CTPA, its acquisition protocols, and the various incidental findings and artifacts to look for while interpreting a CTPA scan. PRéCIS: Beyond the filling defects, a CTPA scan should also be assessed by the radiologists for any incidental findings while keeping in mind several associated pitfalls and artifacts of CTPA.

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^112kKbjQ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial, but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging; however, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians. 13 international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This Review summarises key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

Study limitations

The present study has several limitations, including its retrospective study design. A standard protocol to follow-up PE patients at regular intervals is needed. Regular screening for RPVO is not supported by the current guidelines, and only patients with long-term symptoms presented for follow-up imaging, which could have led to a self-selected patient population. Patients who are asymptomatic or have less severe symptoms and residual thromboembolic disease could have been missed. A larger sample size would also be required to demonstrate a clear relationship between RPVO and CTEPH, which could be addressed through the creation of post-PE clinics that could identify early cases of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease and CTEPH. Finally, because a standard definition for RPVO has yet to be established, the field must work toward creating universally accepted diagnostic criteria that account for the imaging modality, percentage of occlusion, and time to follow-up.

### Return emergency department visits for recurrent pulmonary embolism symptoms in children and adolescents [^116eeCNv]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Rates of pulmonary embolism (PE) in children have steadily increased over the past 2 decades. Patient outcomes after hospital discharge are poorly understood, and many patients experience recurrent or persistent chest pain or dyspnea, prompting a return to care. This retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with PE at a large children's hospital over a 9.5-year period was performed to evaluate rates of return to the emergency department (ED) for PE-related symptoms, and to determine the utility of repeat computed tomography angiography (CTA) in this population. Ninety-six patients were diagnosed with PE during the study period. Forty-two percent of patients (n = 40) returned to the ED for PE-related symptoms and a total of 74 repeat CTAs were performed. Among those who had return visits, the mean number of return visits was 3 and the mean number of repeat CTAs was 1.8. The median time to return to the ED was 34 days. Logistic regression analysis identified increased age and female sex as risk factors for return ED visits. Eight percent of the cohort experienced PE recurrence. Recurrent PE was observed only in those with persistent or new thrombotic risk factors and was uncommon in those who remained on appropriate anticoagulation. Future work should focus on the development of a risk stratification system to identify patients at low risk of recurrence in order to minimize repeat CTA imaging.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

### Radionuclide imaging of acute pulmonary embolism [^112GgJJK]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

From the prospective and outcome-based studies that have been carried out in the past few years, the following conclusions regarding the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected PE can be made: 1. A normal V/Q scan interpretation excludes the diagnosis of clinically significant PE. 2. Patients with a very-low- or low-probability V/Q scan interpretation and a low clinical likelihood of PE do not require angiography or anticoagulation. 3. Patients with a very-low- or low-probability V/Q scan interpretation, an intermediate or high clinical likelihood of PE, and negative serial noninvasive venous studies of the lower extremities do not require anticoagulation or angiography. If serial noninvasive venous studies of the lower extremities are positive, patients should be treated. 4. Clinically stable patients with an intermediate-probability V/Q scan interpretation require noninvasive venous studies of the legs and, if negative, require CT angiography or pulmonary angiography for a definite diagnosis. 5. Clinically stable patients with a high-probability V/Q scan interpretation and a high clinical likelihood of PE require treatment and need no further diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis. 6. Clinically stable patients with a high-probability V/Q scan interpretation and a low or intermediate clinical likelihood of PE require noninvasive venous studies of the legs and, if negative, often require CT angiography or pulmonary CT for a definitive diagnosis.

Acute pulmonary embolism — talking points for clinicians to use with patients during PE evaluation: Imaging has risks. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria exclude PE in patients with low pretest probability. D-dimer testing excludes PE in patients at low pretest probability who do not meet the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria or patients at intermediate pretest probability. Alternative diagnostic strategies exist for patients who cannot have CT.

### An official American Thoracic Society / Society of Thoracic Radiology clinical practice guideline: evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy [^112TtaPm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy — imaging test sequencing includes the following guidance: In pregnant women with suspected PE and a normal CXR, we recommend lung scintigraphy as the next imaging test rather than CTPA (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In pregnant women with suspected PE and a nondiagnostic V/Q scan, we suggest further diagnostic testing rather than clinical management alone (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with a nondiagnostic V/Q scan in whom a decision is made to further investigate, we recommend CTPA rather than DSA (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). In pregnant women with suspected PE and an abnormal CXR, we suggest CTPA as the next imaging test rather than lung scintigraphy (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^114RhEYv]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — high pretest probability (≥ 50%) — the ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy starting with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for assessing patients suspected of having PE in a population with high prevalence/PTP (≥ 50%). The strategy assumes optimal test conditions; suboptimal CTPA results may require repeat testing. If CTPA is not feasible (eg, contrast allergy, renal impairment, unavailability), VQ scan may be acceptable if nondiagnostic scans are followed by additional testing, and when clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative initial CTPA, additional testing with VQ scan or proximal ultrasound of the lower extremities may be considered. The panel recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose PE, and against using D-dimer as a subsequent test following a negative CTPA scan in a population with high prevalence/PTP (≥ 50%).

### What's next after the clot? Residual pulmonary vascular obstruction after pulmonary embolism: from imaging finding to clinical consequences [^115yJWNs]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Surviving an embolism exposes patients to potential long-term complications, such as altered quality of life, persistent dyspnea, impaired exercise capacity or pulmonary hypertension. The common objective factor in most of these situations is the presence of residual pulmonary vascular obstruction (RPVO). Planar ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy (V/Q lung scan) is the gold standard for assessing RPVO, which occurs in 46 to 66% of patients at 3 months and persists in 25 to 29% of patients a year after acute PE. Assessed early (i.e. before discharge), RPVO could predict acute PE development with a high negative predictive value. Evaluated after anticoagulation therapy, RPVO could help to manage anticoagulation treatment and predict the risk of PE recurrence and patients identified at risk of developing chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. In this comprehensive review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of RPVO after PE from imaging diagnosis to clinical consequences. In the first part, we mainly focus on the imaging modalities capable of detecting and quantifying RPVO. We then focus on the symptoms and syndromes linked with this residual obstruction after PE. Although the occurrence of RPVO and long-term complications varies greatly from one patient to another, we finally aim to identify the patients and diseases at risk of developing residual obstruction.

Recurrent venous thromboembolism — diagnostic challenges and imaging criteria — notes that 30% to 50% of patients with prior VTE have residual abnormalities after treatment, studies did not clearly separate those receiving or not receiving anticoagulation and for D-dimer the effect of anticoagulation is uncertain, and the panel judged extrapolating first-episode test characteristics to recurrence would be inaccurate; diagnostic recurrence criteria include, for suspected recurrent DVT, thrombus in a previously unaffected venous segment or an increase in venous diameter during compression of > 4 mm, and for suspected recurrent PE, a new ventilation-perfusion defect on VQ scan or new thrombus in the pulmonary arteries not previously noted on CTPA, though prior imaging is required for comparison.

Pulmonary embolism therapy monitoring — transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) role and serial reassessment: Although "not diagnostic of pulmonary embolism", initial TTE can aid evaluation by detecting right ventricular dilation with "RVIDD/LVIDD ratio > 0.9" and can assist in ruling out other causes; once established, "hypotensive patients and those with elevated cardiac biomarkers or echocardiographic indices of RV strain are at an increased risk, and thrombolysis is considered a class II indication". For follow-up, "Patients with massive pulmonary embolism can have serial assessments of RV size and FAC (Figure 5), assessments of RV systolic pressures, and IVC assessments using ASE RV guidelines for normal ranges", and "The writing group recommends that considerable attention be given to maintaining the same identical imaging plane of the right ventricle when serially examining RV size and FAC".

Post-PE early detection of chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) — timing and non-invasive evaluation: "Current PE guidelines recommend assessment after 3 months follow-up", and "The optimal timing for assessing symptoms to aid early detection of CTEPH may be 3–6 months after acute PE, coinciding with the routine evaluation of anticoagulant treatment, but earlier assessment may be necessary in highly symptomatic or deteriorating patients". For patients with ongoing symptoms, "In patients with persistent or new-onset dyspnoea after PE, non-invasive approaches use echocardiography to assess for PH and cross-sectional imaging to assess for persistent perfusion defects". Adjunctive tools are noted: "Scoring systems, including the Leiden CTEPH rule-out criteria can be used to inform diagnostic strategies", "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing may identify characteristic features of exercise limitation due to PVD, or suggest an alternative diagnosis", and "Limited data exist on strategies using DECT, CT lung subtraction iodine mapping, or 3D MR perfusion imaging".

If the initial imaging exam yielded a nondiagnostic result, the model patient followed a pathway dependent on the initial scan type. Specifically, a nondiagnostic CTPA prompted either further evaluation with V/Q planar scan (50%) or with empiric clinical management (50%). Practical considerations led us to assume that these secondary scan results would always be diagnostic. In the empirically managed patients, a repeat scan was not performed, and management was modeled as if treatment decisions were made using clinical parameters. Specifically, 75% of these patients were treated empirically with anticoagulation. For modeling purposes, it was assumed that all of the empirically treated patients who had PE were included in the subgroup that received empiric treatment. The remaining 25% would be discharged with no anticoagulation treatment. This empiric treatment scheme was informed by the clinical experience of the authors. For those patients receiving an indeterminate initial V/Q scan (of any type), a clinical decision was made with the same 75%:25% empiric treatment allocation.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115771Z4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — diagnostic test performance and thresholds: CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 95% to 100% in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability and a sensitivity of 85% to 95% in patients with high pretest probability. The sensitivity of V/Q scan for PE is 50% to 98%, and specificity is 20% to 60%. Pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that should only be reserved in patients where the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT angiography or V/Q scan. Age-adjusted (age × 10 ng/mL) d-dimer cutoffs can be used to exclude PE in non–high clinical probability patients who are > 50 years of age, with a sensitivity of > 97% and higher specificities than the conventional cutoff of 500 ng/mL.

Pulmonary embolism — intermediate pretest probability (~20%) — the ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding PE in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~20%), followed by VQ scan or CTPA for patients requiring additional testing; if D-dimer or VQ scan are not available or testing would delay treatment in high suspicion, proceeding directly to VQ scan or CTPA alone is acceptable, and patients likely to have a nondiagnostic VQ scan should undergo CTPA. The panel also recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose PE, and against additional testing following negative CTPA or normal VQ scan in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~20%). Remarks note that a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required; D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized and certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnant) due to frequent positive results; in outpatients older than 50 years an age-adjusted D-dimer can be used (age [years] × 10 μg/L with assays having a cutoff of 500 μg/L); VQ scan is preferred over CTPA as the subsequent test to limit radiation exposure when expertise and timely interpretation are available, with CTPA preferred when VQ is not feasible; results should be obtained under optimal conditions, with suboptimal D-dimer or CTPA possibly requiring repeat testing, and nondiagnostic VQ scans followed by CTPA.

### Beyond the clot: perfusion imaging of the pulmonary vasculature after COVID-19 [^114ztZ3K]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

A compelling body of evidence points to pulmonary thrombosis and thromboembolism as a key feature of COVID-19. As the pandemic spread across the globe over the past few months, a timely call to arms was issued by a team of clinicians to consider the prospect of long-lasting pulmonary fibrotic damage and plan for structured follow-up. However, the component of post-thrombotic sequelae has been less widely considered. Although the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 are not known, should pulmonary vascular sequelae prove to be clinically significant, these have the potential to become a public health problem. In this Personal View, we propose a proactive follow-up strategy to evaluate residual clot burden, small vessel injury, and potential haemodynamic sequelae. A nuanced and physiological approach to follow-up imaging that looks beyond the clot, at the state of perfusion of lung tissue, is proposed as a key triage tool, with the potential to inform therapeutic strategies.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Resolution of thromboemboli in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review [^115om9dn]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Much attention has been paid in recent years to optimizing the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). However, little is known about the changes in clot burden that occur at the level of the pulmonary arteries after documented PE. It is often problematic to distinguish between a new or residual defect on lung scintigraphy or helical CT. This may lead to falsely labeling patients with residual PE as having recurrent PE and consequent unnecessary treatment changes.

Design

We performed a systematic analysis of studies of imaging tests (radionuclide and CT) evaluating resolution rate of PE with independent assessment of predefined methodologic criteria by two investigators.

Results

We identified 29 clinical studies. Of these, 25 studies were excluded and 4 studies were included in our review. Because studies differed largely in patient selection, duration of anticoagulation, and timing of follow-up, the studies were not pooled but briefly described. The percentage of patients with residual pulmonary thrombi was 87% at 8 days after diagnosis, 68% after 6 weeks, 65% after 3 months, 57% after 6 months, and 52% after 11 months.

Discussion

This review shows that complete resolution of PE is not routinely achieved between 8 days and 11 months after diagnosis. More than 50% of patients with PE still have defects 6 months after diagnosis, after which resolution of thrombi appears to reach a plateau phase. Physicians should be aware of the high percentage of incomplete resolution of pulmonary emboli. Routine re-imaging after cessation of anticoagulant therapy in patients with PE to obtain a new baseline could be considered.

Post-pulmonary embolism syndrome

The PPES is defined as new or progressive dyspnoea, exercise intolerance, and/or impaired functional or mental status after at least 3 months of adequate anticoagulation following acute PE, which cannot be explained by other (pre-existing) comorbidities. It is reported in up to 40–60% of PE survivors. Incomplete thrombus resolution occurs in 25–50% of patients after acute PE despite adequate anticoagulation, but bears no clinical significance in most cases. Notably, follow-up studies have shown that ∼40% of PE survivors have persistent perfusion defects, although only a very small proportion of these patients are ultimately diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), the most severe clinical presentation of PPES. The prevalence of CTEPH in PE survivors is 2–3%, and 5–8% in PE survivors with persistent dyspnoea, but it is unclear whether CTEPH develops from acute PE, or presents as acute PE. Therefore, current guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up of asymptomatic PE patients by imaging methods, but suggest to evaluate the index imaging test used to diagnose acute PE for signs of CTEPH.

Evaluation of suspected acute PE — factors promoting overuse of imaging include that "pregnancy itself does not confer a greater risk for PE", physicians may feel compelled to "rule out the condition even if its likelihood is extremely low" and may prefer dichotomous tests "such as CT", while "the fear of litigation" may drive imaging; patient preferences and limited communication can increase testing, whereas such communication "has also been found to be associated with less use of diagnostic testing"; system factors include the growth in availability and use of CT in emergency departments and after-hours remote radiology, and "supply-sensitive care" whereby technology availability is linked to use and "may also promote overuse"; practice gaps include that many low- or intermediate-risk patients "either have no plasma D- dimer value obtained or go on to have CT despite normal D- dimer levels", and some with elevated d-dimer do not have follow-up CT, "contrary to evidence-based guidelines".

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^113hwLNJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is important to assess recovery, consider the need for on-going anticoagulation and identify chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare but serious complication of PE. 16 dilemmas in the follow-up of acute PE were identified by a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist with interest in PE and/or CTEPH. Current literature was reviewed and a practical approach suggested based on expert consensus. Dilemmas discussed included: (1) how to manage a breathless patient; (2) what to do if CTEPH is suspected; (3) the difference between CTEPH and post-PE syndrome, (4) testing for thrombophilia, (5) when to investigate for cancer, (6) anticoagulation duration and dose, (7) approaches to discussions and decision-making with respect to anticoagulation, (8) use of aspirin and whether antiplatelet therapy should be stopped during anticoagulation and (9) advice for patients on discharge from hospital at 3 months and information for first-degree relatives. Given the occurrence of complications that may require assessment, follow-up of patients post-PE should be systematic and consider the individual needs of the patient.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113d8vmd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing, Risk Factors, and Extrapulmonary Factors

The committee agreed that the current time frame for the diagnosis of ARDS should be retained: acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as occurring within 1 week of the onset of the predisposing risk factor or within 1 week of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Prolonging the time to onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure was considered, as protracted symptoms may precede progression to frank respiratory failure, as in the case of COVID-19; however, expanding the definition to include HFNO (detailed below) should allow earlier diagnosis, so the time frame of 1 week for acute onset of respiratory failure was maintained. The acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema should not be exclusively or primarily attributable to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload, atelectasis or lung collapse, pleural effusion, or pulmonary embolism. ARDS can be diagnosed in the presence of these conditions if a predisposing risk factor for ARDS is also present, and the clinician believes that these other conditions (e.g. fluid overload, atelectasis) are unlikely to be the primary causes of the hypoxemia. ARDS also can be diagnosed in the presence of chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hypertension, providing that acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not primarily attributable to these underlying conditions. Further rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E2 and Tables E1 and E2.

Chest Imaging

The committee agreed that chest imaging criteria should include bilateral radiologic (chest radiography or computed tomography) or ultrasound findings suggestive of loss of lung aeration that are not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses. Although the identification of bilateral opacities by chest radiography has poor interrater reliability, chest radiography is the most common imaging modality in critically ill patients, which contributed to the recommendation to retain it in the definition despite its limitations. In addition, the committee recommended that ultrasound be accepted as a modality for identifying signs of loss of lung aeration consistent with (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema or lung consolidation, especially when chest radiography or computed tomography is not available. There is evidence that ultrasound can be reliable if the operator is trained to detect bilateral consolidations and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, an approach that should have value, especially in resource-limited areas. Further discussion of the rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E3.

### Echocardiography in the management of pulmonary embolism [^111DzNFV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Echocardiography is not recommended as a routine imaging test to diagnose suspected pulmonary embolism. However, it is useful for identifying patients with pulmonary embolism who may have a poor prognosis. It can be used for rapid and accurate risk assessment. Moderate or severe right ventricular hypokinesis, persistent pulmonary hypertension, a patent foramen ovale, and free-floating right-heart thrombus are echocardiographic markers that identify patients at risk for death or recurrent thromboembolism. Such patients warrant consideration for thrombolysis or embolectomy. Serial imaging of right ventricular function can help physicians monitor the effect of treatment and judge whether the selected management strategy is successful. Further research will clarify and define more precisely the utility and limitations of echocardiography in the management of pulmonary embolism.

### Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions [^111VUmNJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2–3. This initial period of 3 months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit-risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.

Pulmonary embolism imaging — good practice statements indicate that in suspected PE requiring diagnostic imaging, a baseline chest radiograph may identify an alternative diagnosis, help select appropriate imaging, and gauge the likelihood of a diagnostic VQ scan; with an abnormal chest radiograph a nondiagnostic VQ scan is more likely, in which case CTPA is preferred assuming no contraindications. The guideline also notes that a follow‑up ultrasound at the time of anticoagulant discontinuation can document residual thrombus and provide a baseline for comparison if recurrence is suspected and repeat ultrasound is performed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging for pulmonary embolism, known clot [^112J6JMA]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common medical problem associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Often, survivors of acute PE present with recurring symptoms and can have long-term functional sequela. Imaging plays a crucial role in initial evaluation of patients with suspected recurrent or residual PE with V/Q scan and CT angiography often used as the initial test of choice. In patients with known chronic thromboembolic disease, imaging is often used to map the disease burden, for surveillance and treatment planning; CT angiography is often used as the preliminary test for this purpose. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

When VQ scan pathways are nondiagnostic, proximal ultrasound is used, with serial proximal US if clinical PTP > 50%. The panel felt that the rate of FN scans for clinically significant PE was low and that additional testing was unlikely to be of value, although additional testing following a negative CTPA may be considered based on clinical judgment. Non-high clinical PTP is referred to other algorithms.

Management and treatment recommendations in currently available guidelines vary according to patient risk and haemodynamic profile. A clot-in-transit (CiT) in the right heart chambers may be occasionally identified and is, therefore, an under-recognised but challenging condition, often preceding an abrupt clinical deterioration, and associated with increased mortality. Data on the detection of a CiT are sparse but consistent in attributing negative prognostic relevance, and therefore the presence of CiT should be systematically investigated and recorded in the setting of PE. In this review, the challenges related to the identification of a CiT are highlighted. Here, we propose an algorithm where the role of the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) is reinforced. The PERT should convene once the CiT is suspected, to define the timeline for the diagnostic steps and subsequent management on a case-by-case basis. A patient with PE and CiT requires close bedside monitoring and rapid escalation therapy in case of clinical deterioration. Beyond anticoagulation alone, more aggressive strategies can be considered, including systemic thrombolysis, surgical pulmonary embolectomy and the currently emerging catheter-directed therapies.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^113Cqjiq]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

What should I do if I suspect CTEPH?

CTEPH is an uncommon, but serious, complication of PE. Two recent, large prospective multicentre studies, the FOCUS (FOllow-up after aCUte pulmonary emboliSm) studyand the OSIRIS (feasibilty of a screening algorithm for CTEPH) study, noted a cumulative 2-year incidence of CTEPH of 2.3% and 2.49%, respectively. Untreated CTEPH has a survival rate worse than many common cancers; however, mechanical interventions such as pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) and balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) improved 3-year survival to ≥ 88%. Additionally, PEA, BPA and PH medical therapy have also been shown to improve symptoms and pulmonary haemodynamics.

Recent studies in the UK and mainland Europe support a structured approach to PE follow-up, with one study showing this approach can achieve CTEPH diagnostic rates of 2% in addition to identifying patients earlier and with less severe haemodynamic disease. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines for PE management proposed a follow-up strategy that involved referring all patients with persistent dyspnoea at the 3-month to 6-month follow-up and/or CTEPH risk factors for an echocardiogram. However, this is not seen as feasible for most practices and several prediction scores/algorithms have been developed to identify patients at high risk of CTEPH and reduce the need for echocardiograms. Klok et al developed a clinical prediction score to identify patients at high risk of CTEPH following acute PE, and a non-invasive diagnostic algorithm for ruling out CTEPH. These two approaches were integrated into a stepwise screening algorithm, InShape II. Incorporation of a dedicated CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) reading of the index PE to the InShape II algorithm resulted in the InShape IV algorithm. This algorithm starts with CTPA reading of the index PE for six signs of CTEPH, followed by ECG and NT-proBNP measurement to determine if echocardiographic investigation for CTEPH is necessary. Application of this algorithm to the InShape II cohort (N = 341) and part of the German FOCUS cohort (N = 171) resulted in a need for echocardiography in 20% and 24% of patients, respectively, and no CTEPH cases were missed. These results support the 2019 ESC/ERS guideline recommendation to screen for CTEPH based on symptoms combined with the estimation of pretest probability in all PE survivors.

Scenario 2: Moderate-to-severe features of COVID-19 — imaging is advised for patients with any pretest probability when there are no substantial critical resource constraints, and this applies regardless of the results or availability of COVID-19 testing; in COVID-19-positive patients imaging establishes baseline pulmonary status and, if clinical worsening occurs, imaging is again advised to assess for COVID-19 progression or secondary cardiopulmonary abnormalities such as pulmonary embolism, superimposed bacterial pneumonia, or heart failure; for COVID-19-negative or untested patients, imaging may reveal an alternative diagnosis, and because falsely negative testing is more prevalent in high pretest probability circumstances, repeat COVID-19 testing is therefore advised if available.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — high pretest probability: For patients with high pretest probability of PE according to either clinician gestalt or a clinical prediction tool, imaging studies should be performed. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method of diagnosis when it is available and there is no contraindication to radiographic contrast dye. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning should be used when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. Of note, a D-dimer assay should not be obtained in patients with a high pretest probability of PE because a negative value will not obviate the need for imaging.

### Optimal follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function, in collaboration with the European Society of Cardiology working group on atherosclerosis and vascular biology, endorsed by the European Respiratory Society [^113NHxNB]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

This position paper provides a comprehensive guide for optimal follow-up of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), covering multiple relevant aspects of patient counselling. It serves as a practical guide to treating patients with acute PE complementary to the formal 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines developed with the European Respiratory Society. We propose a holistic approach considering the whole spectrum of serious adverse events that patients with acute PE may encounter on the short and long run. We underline the relevance of assessment of modifiable risk factors for bleeding, of acquired thrombophilia and limited cancer screening (unprovoked PE) as well as a dedicated surveillance for the potential development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as part of routine practice; routine testing for genetic thrombophilia should be avoided. We advocate the use of outcome measures for functional outcome and quality of life to quantify the impact of the PE diagnosis and identify patients with the post-PE syndrome early. Counselling patients on maintaining a healthy lifestyle mitigates the risk of the post-PE syndrome and improves cardiovascular prognosis. Therefore, we consider it important to discuss when and how to resume sporting activities soon after diagnosing PE. Additional patient-relevant topics that require Focused counselling are travel and birth control.

### Monitoring for pulmonary hypertension following pulmonary embolism: the INFORM study [^113XLkej]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension may develop after a pulmonary embolism event. A ventilation-perfusion scan is recommended as a first-line modality for suspected chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. In this study, we determined the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension following incident pulmonary embolism and the disease-monitoring patterns in this population.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective claims database analysis of incident pulmonary embolism cases (July 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011) and extracted data for 1 year prior to and 2 years after the incident pulmonary embolism event. Data were analyzed for diagnoses and symptoms related to pulmonary hypertension, claims consistent with other heart or lung diseases, diagnostic imaging tests, and time to first diagnostic imaging test post pulmonary embolism.

Results

Of the 7068 incident pulmonary embolism patients that met eligibility criteria, 87% had a claim for a pulmonary hypertension-related symptom and 7.6% had a claim for pulmonary hypertension during follow-up. Only 55% of all pulmonary embolism patients had diagnostic procedural claim(s) post pulmonary embolism: echocardiogram, 47%; computed tomographic angiography, 20%; ventilation-perfusion scan, 6%; and right heart catheterization or pulmonary angiography, < 1%. The mean time from pulmonary embolism diagnosis to first screening test was 131 days.

Conclusions

Despite exhibiting pulmonary hypertension-related symptoms, many pulmonary embolism patients did not undergo imaging tests that could diagnose pulmonary hypertension or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. This study suggests that physician education about the risk of pulmonary hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary embolism may need to be improved.

### Resolution of pulmonary FDG-embolus on same-day delayed imaging [^111hhXGT]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old woman presented for an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan for a lung nodule, which demonstrated background uptake. Incidentally, there was a focus of moderate-to-intense uptake in the right lung with no CT correlate. Repeat imaging 55 minutes later demonstrated resolution of this uptake, confirming a diagnosis of iatrogenic FDG-embolus, or "hot-clot" artifact. Most reported cases perform repeat radiotracer injection and imaging in the following days to confirm this artifact. This case illustrates that FDG-emboli can resolve on delayed imaging within an hour, and if so, repeat acquisition with a separate injection may be avoided, lowering radiation exposure for the patient.

Methods

Study population

We conducted a retrospective review of all hospitalized patients between January 2017 and June 2021 at our institution who underwent evaluation by the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT). The PERT consists of members from interventional cardiology and radiology, pulmonary/critical care, clinical pharmacy, and cardiac surgery. Activation of the PERT occurs either through an on-call phone number or via a single contact to the hospital's transfer center if request arises from an outside hospital. Upon initial activation, a virtual multidisciplinary meeting or conference call among all PERT members is held. Treatment decisions are made through shared decision-making among the PERT members. Finally, the consensus plan is presented to the referring clinician. Patients were included if meeting the following criteria: (1) diagnosis of acute PE confirmed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or lung perfusion/ventilation (V/Q) scan; (2) completed treatment of therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 months; and (3) underwent repeat imaging from 3 to 12 months follow-up after an index PE due to persistent dyspnea. Patients were excluded on account of the following: (1) diagnosis of PE not confirmed by CTPA or V/Q scan; (2) did not receive treatment either due to contraindications to anticoagulation, limited life expectancy or hospice care; (3) unavailability of follow-up; (4) PE-related or non-related in-hospital death; (5) death during follow-up without imaging; and (6) duplicated cases. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution (Protocol #26021), and informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.

### An official American Thoracic Society / Society of Thoracic Radiology clinical practice guideline: evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy [^113FcLbj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Society of Thoracic Radiology guideline — overview and principles — addresses evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnancy, noting that PE is a leading cause of maternal mortality and that prevention of death requires timely, accurate diagnosis. The multidisciplinary panel used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, judged the evidence for all recommendations as very low, and placed a high value on minimizing cumulative radiation dose when determining the sequence of tests. The diagnostic algorithm assumes patients are stable and all studies are available, and when patients are unstable or studies are unavailable on a timely basis, empiric initiation of therapy and/or alternate diagnostic strategies should be considered; recommendations will require revision as new evidence and technologies emerge.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected pulmonary embolism: 2022 update [^115yzD9T]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a common and important clinical condition that cannot be accurately diagnosed on the basis of signs, symptoms, and history alone. The diagnosis of PE has been facilitated by technical advancements and multidetector CT pulmonary angiography, which is the major diagnostic modality currently used. Ventilation and perfusion scans remain largely accurate and useful in certain settings. MR angiography can be useful in some clinical scenarios and lower-extremity ultrasound can substitute by demonstrating deep vein thrombosis; however, if negative, further studies to exclude PE are indicated. In all cases, correlation with the clinical status, particularly with risk factors, improves not only the accuracy of diagnostic imaging but also overall utilization. Other diagnostic tests have limited roles. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Management of pulmonary embolism: an update [^112aVqbB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major contributor to global disease burden. Risk-adapted treatment and follow-up contributes to a favorable outcome. Age-adjusted cutoff levels increase D-dimer specificity and may decrease overuse of imaging procedures and overdiagnosis of PE. Primary systemic fibrinolysis has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in intermediate-risk PE; catheter-directed techniques are an option for patients with hemodynamic decompensation and high bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulant agents are effective and safe alternatives to standard anticoagulation regimens. Recent trial data do not support insertion of cava filters in patients who can receive anticoagulant treatments. Remaining areas of uncertainty include the therapeutic implications of subsegmental PE, the optimal diagnostic approach to the pregnant patient with suspected PE, and the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulant agents in patients with cancer. Campaigns to increase awareness combined with strategies to implement guideline recommendations will be crucial steps towards further optimizing management of acute PE.

### Newer modalities for detection of pulmonary emboli [^117MU1X7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke in the United States. Early and accurate diagnosis of this condition is imperative because many patients die within hours of presentation. Clinical and laboratory tests can be used to accurately determine the pretest probability of PE. When necessary, imaging techniques are then used to exclude or diagnose PE. Pulmonary angiography is the reference standard for the diagnosis of PE, but it is invasive and has a high morbidity and mortality rate. Ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) scanning in the past has been recommended as the initial diagnostic test for PE; however, this technique also has limitations. Recently, new modalities for the diagnosis and exclusion of PE have been evaluated. These techniques include V/Q single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), single- and multi-detected computed tomography, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) including gadolinium-enhanced MRA, real-time magnetic resonance imaging (RT-MR), and magnetic resonance perfusion imaging.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) protocol optimization in pregnant patients — technique and alternative pathways: To minimize nondiagnostic and repeat studies, CTPA protocols should be adapted to pregnancy-related physiology; optimization includes automated bolus triggering, high iodine flux via high flow rate (4.5–6 mL/s) and/or high iodine concentration (350–400 mg I/mL), and clear breathing instructions. Technically inadequate CTPA occurs in 6 to 36% of cases, so at sites with high inadequacy rates a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan may be a better alternative, and repeat CTPA after a nondiagnostic study should be undertaken with caution unless a technical improvement opportunity is identified.

### Imaging for pulmonary embolism in sickle cell disease: a 17-year experience [^116DkyMw]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease, a complex disorder with known pulmonary complications, has the potential to confound the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. We hypothesized that when the choice of imaging is guided by chest radiographic results, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy have comparable diagnostic performance in sickle cell disease. Methods: A retrospective cohort of adults with sickle cell disease who were imaged for suspected pulmonary embolism with either CTPA or V/Q, from 2000 to 2016 at our institution, was established. To reduce radiation exposure, our practice recommends V/Q for stable patients with normal chest radiographs. Results of index pulmonary embolism imaging, 90-d follow-up, and results of chest radiography were recorded. Results: Two hundred forty-five adults with sickle cell disease comprised the cohort. The mean age (± SD) was 33 ± 10.5 y, and 58% (141) were men. Index imaging was V/Q in 62.9% (n = 154) and CTPA in 37.1% (n = 91). Chest radiographs, performed in 96.3% (n = 236), were normal in 72.9% (n = 172). Imaging results for pulmonary embolism were negative in 88.2% (n = 216), positive in 4.1% (n = 10), and indeterminate in 7.8% (n = 19) with no difference between V/Q and CTPA (P = 0.63). Reimaging within 90 d occurred in 9.8% (n = 24), 14.7% (20/136) after initial V/Q, and 5% (4/109) after initial CTPA (P = 0.08). Reimaging revealed a pulmonary embolism diagnosis after negative/indeterminate results in 0.7% (1/149) of V/Qs and 1.2% of (1/86) CTPAs (P = 0.69). Over the 17-y study period, 47% (114/245) underwent repeated imaging, and 11% (27/245) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism at least once. Conclusion: In sickle cell disease patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, positive imaging rates were low for any given clinical presentation, but 11% of the cohort was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism over the 17-y study period. CTPA and V/Q performed comparably for pulmonary embolism diagnosis when the choice of imaging was guided by results of chest radiography. Hence, V/Q is a reasonable first choice for sickle cell disease patients with normal chest radiographs.

### Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and impairment after pulmonary embolism: the FOCUS study [^114J3imv]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

To systematically assess late outcomes of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and to investigate the clinical implications of post-PE impairment (PPEI) fulfilling prospectively defined criteria.

Methods and Results

A prospective multicentre observational cohort study was conducted in 17 large-volume centres across Germany. Adult consecutive patients with confirmed acute symptomatic PE were followed with a standardized assessment plan and pre-defined visits at 3, 12, and 24 months. The co-primary outcomes were (i) diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), and (ii) PPEI, a combination of persistent or worsening clinical, functional, biochemical, and imaging parameters during follow-up. A total of 1017 patients (45% women, median age 64 years) were included in the primary analysis. They were followed for a median duration of 732 days after PE diagnosis. The CTEPH was diagnosed in 16 (1.6%) patients, after a median of 129 days; the estimated 2-year cumulative incidence was 2.3% (1.2–4.4%). Overall, 880 patients were evaluable for PPEI; the 2-year cumulative incidence was 16.0% (95% confidence interval 12.8–20.8%). The PPEI helped to identify 15 of the 16 patients diagnosed with CTEPH during follow-up (hazard ratio for CTEPH vs. no CTEPH 393; 95% confidence interval 73–2119). Patients with PPEI had a higher risk of re-hospitalization and death as well as worse quality of life compared with those without PPEI.

Conclusion

In this prospective study, the cumulative 2-year incidence of CTEPH was 2.3%, but PPEI diagnosed by standardized criteria was frequent. Our findings support systematic follow-up of patients after acute PE and may help to optimize guideline recommendations and algorithms for post-PE care.

Recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis — hemodynamically stable, nonpregnant patients: If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, and a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required. D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnancy) due to the high frequency of positive D-dimer results with standard thresholds, and there are limited data on the utility of D-dimer for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who present with suspected recurrent PE. The strategy assumes that test results are obtained under optimal conditions and suboptimal CTPA results may require repeat testing, and if prior imaging is available, comparison of the previous and current imaging is warranted to determine whether the findings are new and represent recurrent PE. Scores were used to assess clinical probability of recurrent PE, but the Wells and Geneva scores have not been specifically validated for patients with suspected recurrent PE.

### Quality initiatives: imaging pregnant patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: what the radiologist needs to know [^114kb9Q8]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Pregnancy is associated with a fivefold increase in the prevalence of venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism is a leading cause of maternal death. However, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism during pregnancy is challenging because classic clinical symptoms are often absent and physiologic changes during pregnancy can mimic pulmonary embolism. Concerns about exposure of the fetus to ionizing radiation and intravenously administered contrast material, as well as potential medicolegal issues, further complicate the diagnosis. Although diagnostic imaging plays an important role in this setting, there are currently no widely accepted guidelines for radiologists and clinicians to follow. Thus, radiologists should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of available imaging modalities, methods for dose reduction, radiation risks, and medicolegal risk management guidelines.

### Advanced treatment strategies for acute pulmonary embolism, including thrombolysis and embolectomy [^112xSRis]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment strategy for acute pulmonary embolism relies upon a multidisciplinary team that rapidly assesses available data, performs additional testing if necessary, weighs treatment options, and recommends an appropriate therapeutic plan to the patient and family. Round-the-clock availability is imperative. Centers that specialize in pulmonary embolism management offer a wide range of therapeutic options. Hospitals with more limited facilities should establish pulmonary embolism patient referral and transfer contingency plans that can be activated at a moment's notice. Management options include anticoagulation alone, thrombolysis plus anticoagulation, insertion of an inferior vena caval filter, catheter embolectomy, or surgical embolectomy. The decision-making process requires accurate risk stratification, which is comprised of several crucial components: clinical evaluation that includes history and physical examination, biomarker measurement especially of troponin, as well as assessment of right ventricular size and function based upon chest CT scanning and echocardiography. The 'old school' approach of declaring a benign prognosis based solely upon the presence of normal systemic arterial pressure can delay advanced therapy until after the onset of irreversible cardiogenic shock. We have now formulated a more contemporary, comprehensive, and multifaceted strategy to prognosticate. Our 'new approach' uses advanced treatment strategies in addition to anticoagulation for those pulmonary embolism patients deemed to be at high risk for a poor outcome.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^112ymNHB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism imaging — Table 2 suggestions for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) specify the following actions using computed tomography (CT) and alternative tests. Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE", with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". Defer CT until after d-dimer result for "Intermediate pretest probability" or "Low pretest probability and PERC > 0", supported by "Low incidence of PE (< 1.1%) if d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0", given an "Incidence of PE < 1%". For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography", because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast". A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required".

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^1116LAHy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — reducing repeat CT use in those with prior scans: Physicians, hospitals, and emergency departments (EDs) should develop diagnostic and treatment pathways for patients with a history of multiple CTs for PE, and at least 1 study has demonstrated that patients evaluated for PE by using CT had a significant probability of having another CT performed for PE within 5 years; in fact, 5% of the patients in this study had 5 or more CTs for PE. Preventing this frequent use of repeated CT requires thoughtful planning, clinicians should educate these patients about the risk of radiation from multiple CTs, and an individualized approach to testing is reasonable, including lower-extremity venous ultrasonography or V/Q scanning when appropriate (although V/Q scanning may not be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema).

### Diagnostic strategies for excluding pulmonary embolism in clinical outcome studies. A systematic review [^113UDnrW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism is a common clinical disorder that is associated with high morbidity and mortality if untreated. It is important to confirm or rule out the diagnosis in patients with clinical suspicion of the disease.

Purpose

To evaluate various diagnostic strategies for excluding pulmonary embolism.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), EMBASE, and DARE; study investigators; and reference lists.

Study Selection

Prospective clinical outcome studies.

Data Extraction

The researchers recorded the frequency of symptomatic venous thromboembolism over 3 months of follow-up in patients in whom pulmonary embolism had been excluded according to various strategies. Strategies were divided into three categories according to the number of rounds of diagnostic tests needed to exclude pulmonary embolism.

Data Synthesis

25 studies involving more than 7000 patients were included. In all referred patients, two strategies-normal results on pulmonary angiography or lung scintigraphy and normal d -dimer levels combined with low clinical probability-safely excluded pulmonary embolism (failure rates ≤ 3%). In the second round of diagnostic tests, in patients who had had a nondiagnostic lung scan, both pulmonary angiography and serial leg testing for venous thrombosis were accurate and safe. When d -dimer testing combined with clinical probability was inconclusive, a normal perfusion lung scan safely excluded pulmonary embolism. Accumulating evidence shows that normal results on spiral computed tomography may also safely exclude the disease.

Conclusions

Many diagnostic strategies to exclude pulmonary embolism have been evaluated in consecutive patients. Interest is likely to increase in a simple, fast strategy, starting with a normal perfusion lung scan or a combination of normal d -dimer levels and low clinical probability. After the initial round of testing, a reliable diagnostic method, such as angiography or lung scintigraphy, is warranted.
