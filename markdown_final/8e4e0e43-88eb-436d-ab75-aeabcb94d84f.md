## Question

gas in stomach what to do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what to do for "gas in the stomach". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenario and excluding emergencies. Then, I should categorize likely etiologies and outline a focused history and exam. Next, I will decide when to test versus when to treat empirically, followed by mechanism-based management strategies. Finally, I should address special populations, follow-up, and red flags that warrant escalation, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and urgency, because "gas in the stomach" can mean benign functional symptoms or life-threatening conditions like emphysematous gastritis, gastric emphysema, or a gas embolism during procedures. I need to check for alarm features such as fever, sepsis, severe pain, vomiting, GI bleeding, weight loss, or a family history of GI malignancy, and I should examine for peritoneal signs or a mass, since these findings would pivot me to urgent imaging and specialty referral rather than outpatient management [^111Nz5Uz] [^116jcaWH] [^115iBJLa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize the presentation into functional gas-related symptoms versus structural or iatrogenic causes, because management diverges substantially. Functional disorders include functional dyspepsia, IBS, belching disorders, and disorders of gut–brain interaction, whereas structural or iatrogenic causes include gastric outlet obstruction, post-surgical gas-bloat, intragastric balloon, emphysematous gastritis, and procedural gas embolism. This framing helps me choose appropriate diagnostics and therapies [^111s7H7c] [^113r8xZ1] [^114aw5cU] [^115iBJLa].

> I will now examine the history elements that sharpen the differential: onset and chronicity, meal-related bloating, belching frequency and timing, constipation or diarrhea, weight change, reflux symptoms, aerophagia behaviors, and prior surgeries such as fundoplication or bariatric procedures. I should also ask about carbonated beverages, gum chewing, and anxiety, and I need to remember that supragastric belching often stops during sleep and with distraction, which helps distinguish it from gastric belching and aerophagia [^116viboQ] [^111Pud8E] [^11361Ytm].

> Next, I should review the physical examination priorities: inspect for visible distension and its timing, palpate for masses or tenderness, and perform a rectal exam if constipation is suspected to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation. If distension is disproportionate to gas volume, I should consider abdominophrenic dyssynergia, which CT can demonstrate even with small increases in intraluminal gas [^113r8xZ1] [^112GuzMN].

> Wait, let me verify when testing is warranted. In the absence of alarm features, routine labs or imaging are not required initially, but I should test for H. pylori in dyspepsia and screen for celiac disease in IBS-like presentations, and if constipation is prominent, I should assess for pelvic floor dyssynergia. If symptoms persist or alarm features emerge, I should escalate to CBC, CMP, KUB, ultrasound, CT/MRI, or endoscopy as indicated, and consider motility studies for suspected gastroparesis or CIPO [^111Nz5Uz] [^114GVbRV] [^113r8xZ1].

> For functional gas-related symptoms, I should start with mechanism-based empiric therapy rather than exhaustive testing. For functional dyspepsia, a PPI trial is reasonable, for IBS with bloating, antispasmodics and dietary strategies can help, and for chronic constipation, osmotic laxatives and fiber are first-line. I need to ensure I tailor choices to predominant symptoms and patient preferences, and I should revisit the diagnosis if there is no response to a well-conducted trial [^114GVbRV] [^113r8xZ1].

> Let me consider dietary contributors carefully. A short, structured trial of lactose or FODMAP restriction can clarify carbohydrate intolerance, and I should remember that fructose intolerance is common in disorders of gut–brain interaction. Breath testing can be reserved for refractory cases or when specific sugar malabsorption is suspected after dietary trials, keeping in mind that most gas produced in the colon is absorbed or metabolized and only a minority is expelled per anus, which explains why modest dietary changes can have outsized symptomatic benefit [^113udJzL] [^111g3ng3].

> I should double-check the role of simethicone. Although it does not consistently improve prep quality, it can reduce adherent bubbles and patient discomfort, so a short empiric trial is reasonable for bothersome bloating or visible bubbles, particularly postprandially or during endoscopic visualization needs [^117BTvYB].

> For belching disorders, I need to distinguish gastric from supragastric belching using impedance-manometry when the diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms are severe. Supragastric belching responds best to psychoeducation and brain–gut behavioral therapies such as diaphragmatic breathing and CBT, whereas gastric belching linked to GERD warrants PPI therapy and lifestyle measures, with baclofen considered in select cases of excessive TLESRs. Importantly, supragastric belching is behavioral and often stops with distraction or during sleep, which I should verify in the history [^111s7H7c] [^111Pud8E] [^116viboQ] [^116PD6xr].

> But wait, what if the patient reports an inability to belch? I should confirm with high-resolution manometry and impedance, and if the upper esophageal sphincter fails to relax appropriately, targeted therapies such as cricopharyngeal botulinum toxin injection can restore belching and relieve symptoms in carefully selected cases, recognizing that this is a distinct functional disorder that requires precise phenotyping [^113bG8xB] [^117RYDqf].

> For post-surgical gas-bloat, I need to ensure expectations are managed. Gas-bloat is common after Nissen fundoplication and persists in a meaningful proportion at 5 years, and while partial fundoplication or magnetic sphincter augmentation may reduce rates, gas-bloat still occurs and can impair satisfaction. Initial management includes simethicone, dietary modification, and prokinetics, with consideration of gastric emptying assessment and, rarely, device removal or conversion if symptoms are refractory and quality of life is severely impacted [^111xS8DQ] [^113TWjzf] [^114dk3sg].

> Let me verify the approach to visible distension out of proportion to gas volume. Abdominophrenic dyssynergia is a paradoxical viscerosomatic reflex with diaphragmatic descent and abdominal wall relaxation that amplifies distension, and it is best addressed with diaphragmatic breathing and pelvic floor biofeedback rather than drugs that target gas production, so I should avoid overpromising pharmacologic fixes here [^112GuzMN] [^113r8xZ1].

> I should confirm the role of herbal therapies. STW 5-II (iberogast) has randomized data showing accelerated gastric gas evacuation and reduced symptom perception in functional dyspepsia without changing objective distension, likely via effects on fundic relaxation, antral motility, and visceral sensitivity, so it can be a reasonable adjunct when available and acceptable to patients [^113Phy7z] [^114Qumgo] [^115Mn4uG].

> For small intestinal bacterial overgrowth risk, I need to check for predisposing conditions and, if suspected after dietary trials, use glucose or lactulose breath testing. Treatment should follow guideline-based regimens with attention to methane-predominant cases where constipation and bloating coexist, and I should avoid repeated antibiotic cycles without a clear indication [^114ghJWi].

> Now, I will examine special populations. In cystic fibrosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is common and undertreated enzyme dosing can cause maldigestion with gas, bloating, and oily stools, so I should confirm enzyme adherence and dosing with a CF dietitian before attributing symptoms to functional disorders. Patient-reported strategies like probiotics and dietary changes may help but should be individualized [^112w8qrQ] [^116HuwWt].

> In pregnancy, I should prioritize nonpharmacologic measures and alginate-antacid combinations for reflux-related belching and bloating, as these are non-systemic and have reassuring safety profiles. I need to avoid unnecessary medications and tailor advice to gestational timing and symptom severity [^112U8maK].

> For infants and children, I should confirm that most reflux and gas symptoms are managed conservatively with feeding adjustments, thickeners, and positioning, reserving medications for selected cases. Persistent, severe, or atypical symptoms should prompt age-appropriate evaluation for allergies, malabsorption, or anatomic issues rather than empiric adult therapies [^113fbVtY].

> Let me reconsider procedural contexts. During anesthesia or mask ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure can promote gastric insufflation, so I should use pressure-controlled ventilation with low peak pressures and be mindful of aspiration risk. During endoscopy, carbon dioxide insufflation reduces residual luminal gas and is preferred when available, particularly in higher-risk procedures [^112UWikf] [^111p51DX].

> I need to ensure I have a clear follow-up plan. Reassess in 4–6 weeks to confirm response to empiric therapy, and if there is no improvement, escalate to targeted testing such as breath tests, gastric emptying studies, or esophageal physiology. Persistent or worsening alarm features should trigger cross-sectional imaging and endoscopy, and refractory functional cases may benefit from referral to a motility or behavioral gastroenterology program [^111Nz5Uz] [^113r8xZ1].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed red flags requiring urgent action: suspected emphysematous gastritis or gastric emphysema warrants emergent imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics with close observation. Postoperative gastric outlet obstruction with acute gas bloat is a surgical emergency requiring decompression. And procedural gas embolism demands immediate cessation of insufflation, hemodynamic stabilization, and supportive care, with early involvement of anesthesia and critical care teams [^116jcaWH] [^113dkGnF] [^115iBJLa].

Gas in the stomach is common and usually harmless, but persistent or severe symptoms can signal an underlying issue [^112f42z7]. Start with **dietary changes** (avoid carbonated drinks, chewing gum, and gas-producing foods; eat slowly) and **lifestyle measures** (regular exercise, upright posture after meals) [^11361Ytm]. Over-the-counter options like simethicone, activated charcoal, or alpha-galactosidase can help reduce gas [^117BTvYB] [^116YgdLv]. If symptoms persist, evaluate for **functional disorders** (IBS, gastroparesis, SIBO) and treat accordingly [^114ghJWi] [^113XaXsK]. Seek urgent care for severe pain, vomiting, or signs of obstruction [^111Nz5Uz].

---

## Dietary modifications

Dietary changes are a cornerstone of gas management; **limit gas-producing foods** — beans, lentils, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and carbonated drinks — and **reduce fermentable carbohydrates** with a low-FODMAP approach [^113udJzL]. Eat slowly, avoid talking while eating, and limit gum chewing to reduce swallowed air [^11361Ytm].

---

## Lifestyle changes

Lifestyle measures can significantly reduce gas: **regular physical activity** (walking, yoga) aids motility and gas clearance, and **upright posture after meals** helps prevent reflux and gas accumulation. Stress management with mindfulness or meditation may reduce gas-related symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Over-the-counter medications

Several OTC options can alleviate gas:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Simethicone | Breaks up gas bubbles | Bloating, flatulence |
| Activated charcoal | Adsorbs gas molecules | Bloating, flatulence |
| Alpha-galactosidase | Digests complex carbohydrates | Gas from beans, vegetables |

---

## Medical evaluation and treatment

Persistent or severe gas may reflect underlying disorders; **evaluate for functional GI disorders** such as IBS, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, and SIBO [^113r8xZ1] [^114GVbRV]. Treat identified conditions with dietary therapy, prokinetics, or antibiotics as indicated [^114xVYkb] [^113r8xZ1] [^111tiKEw].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek medical attention for **severe abdominal pain**, persistent vomiting, or signs of obstruction (e.g. inability to pass gas or stool) [^111Nz5Uz]. Also seek care for **unintentional weight loss**, gastrointestinal bleeding, or anemia [^111Nz5Uz].

---

Gas in the stomach is common and usually benign; start with diet and lifestyle, use OTC remedies as needed, and pursue medical evaluation if symptoms persist or are severe.

### Nasogastric-tube decompression facilitates the pocket-creation method of gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection [^112eyS2L]. Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

The pocket-creation method (PCM)was developed as an effective strategy for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), and its usefulness in gastric ESD has been reported.

Aspirating gas from the stomach and collapsing the lumen facilitates the PCM because it helps to keep the submucosa thick and improves the controllability of the endoscope (Fig. 1). However, it is not efficient to aspirate gas while placing the electric knife in the accessory channel. It is also time-consuming to remove the device just to aspirate gas.

We devised a method of gastric ESD using a nasogastric tube (Video 1). A 14-Fr nasogastric tube was inserted through the nasal cavity and fixed at 65 cm (Fig. 2). ESD with the PCM was then performed in the usual manner. During ESD, unnecessary gas and fluid drained through the tube without being aspirated through the endoscope (Fig. 3). In addition, when bleeding occurred during the ESD, the blood also drained through the tube and no clots accumulated in the stomach. The tube placement did not cause any deterioration in endoscope controllability.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^111Pud8E]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis of belching — esophageal physiology testing differentiates syndromes — High-resolution esophageal manometry, when combined with impedance monitoring and impedance pH monitoring, differentiates gastric and supragastric belching and aerophagia. Gastric belching involves spontaneous relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter followed by air transport from the stomach through the esophagus, may be clinically associated with GERD, and then the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) relaxes with oral expulsion of air. In aerophagia, air enters the esophagus through swallowing, opening the UES, and as the air clears via peristalsis the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes and air enters the stomach. In contrast, supragastric belching involves 2 separate mechanisms — the air-suction and air-injection methods — where the air flow occurs more quickly and is independent of esophageal peristalsis; the air-injection method initiates influx of air into the upper esophagus by elevated pharyngeal pressure, may involve contraction of the base of the tongue rather than a peristaltic pharyngeal contraction, is not followed by an esophageal peristaltic wave, and represents a learned behavior akin to deliberate belching.

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^114Qumgo]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

STW 5‐II is an herbal medicinal product that has been shown to improve numerous symptoms in functional dyspepsia. The effects of STW 5‐II on gastric gas transit and tolerance in functional dyspepsia have not been previously investigated.
Using a parallel, placebo‐controlled study design with direct gas infusion into the stomach, STW 5‐II accelerated transit and rectal evacuation of gastric gas and reduced perception of symptoms like bloating when compared to placebo with no effect on visible abdominal distension.
STW 5‐II improves tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia and may be beneficial for the treatment of gas‐related abdominal symptoms like bloating.

### Definition of belching-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^11361Ytm]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

belchingListen to pronunciationThe release of air or gas from the stomach or esophagus through the mouth. Belching is usually caused by a buildup of air in the esophagus or upper part of the stomach when too much air is swallowed. This can occur when eating or drinking too fast, talking while eating, drinking carbonated drinks, chewing gum, smoking, or having an anxiety attack. Belching may also be a side effect of certain medicines or a symptom of some gastrointestinal conditions and digestive problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, and stomach ulcers or infections. Also called burping and eructation.

### Design and testing of microbubble-based MRI contrast agents for gastric pressure measurement [^117R4Y8R]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This work demonstrates specifically tailored microbubble‐based preparations and their suitability as MRI contrast agents for ingestion and measuring temporal and spatial pressure variation in the human stomach.

Methods

Enhanced alginate spheres were prepared by incorporating gas‐filled microbubbles into sodium alginate solution followed by the polymerization of the mixture in an aqueous calcium lactate solution. The microbubbles were prepared with a phospholipid shell and perfluorocarbon gas filling, using a mechanical cavitational agitation regime. The NMR signal changes to externally applied pressure and coming from the enhanced alginate spheres were acquired and compared with that of alginate spheres without microbubbles. In vivo investigations were also carried out on healthy volunteers to measure the pressure variation in the stomach.

Results

The MR signal changes in the contrast agent exhibits a linear sensitivity of approximately 40% per bar, as opposed to no measurable signal change seen in the control gas‐free spheres. This novel contrast agent also demonstrates an excellent stability in simulated gastric conditions, including at body temperature. In vivo studies showed that the signal change exhibited in the meal within the antrum region is between 5% and 10%, but appears to come from both pressure changes and partial volume artifacts.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that alginate spheres with microbubbles can be used as an MRI contrast agent to measure pressure changes. The peristaltic movement within the stomach is seen to substantially alter the overall signal intensity of the contrast agent meal. Future work must focus on improving the contrast agent's sensitivity to pressure changes.

### The inability to belch syndrome: a study using concurrent high-resolution manometry and impedance monitoring [^113bG8xB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Belching or eructation is a physiological mechanism that enables venting of accumulated gaseous material from the stomach into the esophagus and pharynx. In healthy volunteers, intragastric air enters the esophagus via transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs). The subsequent rapid increase in esophageal pressure to the level of the intragastric pressure, also known as common cavity phenomenon, causes distention of the esophageal body and stimulates stress receptors that will initiate upper esophageal sphincter (UES) relaxation and expulsion of air.

In recent years, an increasing number of patients have been referred to our clinic because of an inability to belch, typically with symptoms of chest pain and audible gurgling noises from the chest. Although inability to belch as part of the gas‐bloating syndrome occurs regularly post‐fundoplication, an inability to belch from esophagus to oropharynx is rarely reported in medical literature, and its underlying etiology is virtually unknown. Three previous case reports described inability to belch and corresponding symptoms and attributed it to UES dysfunction. A more recent study reported on 51 patients with inability to belch who were treated with injections of botulinum toxin (botox) into the cricopharyngeus muscle. Interestingly, all patients reported ability to belch and relief of symptoms post‐treatment, which may support the role of UES dysfunction in these patients. Nonetheless, the question remains whether the symptoms are indeed the result of failure of the belch reflex pathway or are rather functional or behavioral in nature. Esophageal air transport patterns, UES physiology, and the effect of botox injections on UES function have never been objectively investigated in a series of consecutive patients.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate pathophysiological mechanisms underlying symptoms of inability to belch using concurrent high‐resolution manometry and impedance monitoring with belch provocation and 24‐h esophageal impedance monitoring. We aimed to assess the ability of the UES to relax in response to the influx of gas into the esophagus. Secondly, we aimed to study the effect of UES botox injections on pharyngoesophageal symptoms, UES pressure, and gas reflux patterns.

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^115Mn4uG]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms by which STW 5‐II accelerates rectal gas evacuation and improves tolerance to gastric gas likely result from the combined effects of its multiple actions along the gastrointestinal tract, as demonstrated in previous studies. Human studies have shown that STW 5‐II induces relaxation of the gastric fundus and increases antral contractility. Additional in vitro studies have reported that several components of STW 5‐II decrease muscular activity in the proximal stomach while enhancing contractile activity in the antrum.

In addition to its effects on gastrointestinal motility, several studies have demonstrated that STW 5‐II reduces visceral sensitivity. In animal models, STW 5‐II was shown to reduce intestinal afferent nerve discharge in response to intravenous bradykinin, a key mediator of nociception. Thus, the combination of improved gastroduodenal motility and reduced visceral sensitivity may synergistically contribute to enhanced tolerance to gastric gas observed in patients treated with STW 5‐II. However, the specific role of each one of these putative mechanisms in the effects of STW 5‐II on gastric gas transit and tolerance cannot be elucidated from our study, and future research using a methodological approach aimed to discriminate mechanistic effects in response to gastric gas are required.

By contrast to symptom perception, no differences in objective abdominal distension were observed between patients treated with STW 5‐II and placebo. Previous studies have shown that, in patients with bloating and disorders of gut–brain interaction, abdominal distension is produced by altered abdominophrenic responses to small increments in abdominal contents, so‐called abdominophrenic dyssynergia. Our results suggest that STW 5‐II exerts its main effects on visceral sensitivity, but new studies monitoring the diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle responses are needed to evaluate its potential effects on abdominophrenic responses to gastric gas loads.

In the present study, we used a newer variant of the original STW 5 formulation, which contains only 6 of the 9 original herbal extracts. The revised formulation includes higher concentrations of licorice root and chamomile flower, as well as an extract of the fullplant. For decades, the original STW 5 — comprising nine herbs — has been widely used as an effective herbal remedy for FD and DGBI, with multiple iterations having undergone clinical testing. STW 5‐II represents a simplified version of this formulation, yet it has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in treating FD as well.

### Gastric gas dynamics in healthy humans [^1136k53c]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To cope with the daily increments of gastric gas, the stomach can propel gas to the small bowel or trigger the belching reflex. Our aim was to evaluate transit of free gastric gas in healthy humans, and its relationship with abdominal symptoms.

Methods

In 24 healthy volunteers a gas mixture was infused into the stomach at 0 mL/min (sham infusion), 25 mL/min, 50 mL/min, and 100 mL/min (n = 6 each) up to 1500 mL. Belching, rectal gas evacuation, and abdominal perception were continuously recorded for 90 min.

Key Results

Sham infusion was associated to low rectal gas evacuation (187 ± 94 mL after 90 min), and belching (0 ± 0). In contrast, gastric gas infusion increased rectal gas evacuation (1198 ± 176 mL; p = 0.025) and belching (4 ± 1 belches; p = 0.0520) without differences between the infusion rates tested. Overall, there was a negative correlation between rectal gas evacuation and belching (r = -.72; P < .0001): 6 subjects had frequent belching (14 ± 2 belches) and minor rectal gas evacuation (330 ± 112 mL), whereas 12 subjects had virtually no belches (1 ± 1 belches) and greater rectal gas evacuation (1630 ± 147 mL; P < .001 vs belchers for both). Gas infusion induced lower abdominal symptoms in belchers (score increment 0.7 ± 0.3) than in rectal gas evacuators (score increment 1.7 ± 0.5; p = 0.033).

Conclusions and Inferences

An excellent balance between belching and distal gastric empting allows the stomach to adapt to great variations in gas intake. In general, most gastric gas is emptied to distal intestinal segments, but in some circumstances gastric gas induces belching, a mechanism that may improve gas tolerance.

### Tbo-filgrastim (Granix) [^117Y2fEY]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Step 2G: Keep the vial upside down and slowly pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe barrel with GRANIX to the correct marking amount (mL) of medicine that matches the dose your healthcare provider prescribed.

Step 2H: Keep the needle in the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the syringe barrel with your finger until the air bubbles rise to the top. Slowly push the plunger up to push the air bubbles out of the syringe (Figure F).

Step 2I: Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back to the number on the syringe barrel that matches your dose. Check again for air bubbles. The air in the syringe will not hurt you, but too large an air bubble can reduce your dose of GRANIX. If there are still air bubbles, repeat the steps above to remove them.

Step 2J: Check again to make sure that you have the correct dose in the syringe. It is important that you use the exact dose prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not remove the needle from the vial. Lay the vial down on its side with the needle still in the vial while you prepare the injection site (Figure G).

Step 3 – Select and prepare the injection site

Step 3A: Choose an injection site (Figure H)

### Efficacy and tolerability of α-galactosidase in treating gas-related symptoms in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial [^111tiKEw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Bloating and distension together with belching, aerophagia and flatulence, have been attributed to excessive intestinal gas accumulation, impaired handling of gas in the small intestine, impaired clearance from the proximal colon, psychological factors, altered gut microflora, incomplete digestion and malabsorption of carbohydrates.

We did not investigate the dietary habits of children before and during our study. Parents were instructed to continue with their usual diet over the study period in order to avoid any possible impact from a change of diet to the study results. According to clinical history and parents' opinion, the symptoms were apparently related to meals: a fact which is also demonstrated by the bloating severity score which was lowest at the time of waking up and steadily increased during the day.

There are different strategies that may reduce intestinal gas including active charcoal, simethicone etc. Recently, the use of antibiotics seems to provide significant relief of functional GI symptoms, bloating and abdominal pain, but the need for repeated treatment cycles may have an important impact on the intestinal bacterial flora, especially in children.

In recent years, an alternative approach, based on the administration of α -galactosidase, an enzyme with amylase-like activity, seems to be effective in reducing the production of intestinal gas by breaking down non digestible oligosaccharides (NDO) before they reach the lower intestine. Indeed, the human intestine does not contain the enzyme required to digest NDO and their consequent incomplete digestion produces increased bacterial fermentation generating hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide.

Our results show that in children with predominant gas-related symptoms, the administration of α -galactosidase significantly reduces global distress, bloating and flatulence compared to placebo, but does not significantly reduce other symptoms such as abdominal distension and spasms which generally occur in functional gastrointestinal disorder. However this is consistent with the mechanism of action of α -galactosidase. The reduced formation of gas by colonic bacteria may have been expected to have other beneficial effects on distension of colon segments and abdomen.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^111s7H7c]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Gastric versus supragastric belching — impedance pH and high-resolution manometry features are contrasted. For gastric belching, an impedance pH tracing shows a distal to proximal increase in impedance with air clearing from the esophagus, and manometry shows direction of air flow from stomach to upper esophagus that follows a transient relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter (TLES) with the upper esophageal sphincter opening temporarily to expel air. For supragastric belching, impedance pH shows a proximal then distal increase in impedance with air clearing from the esophagus orally, and manometry shows repetitive supragastric belching with upper esophageal sphincter opening then air propagating through the esophagus.

### EUS-guided gastroenterostomy: techniques from east to west [^116Vwt6Y]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic methods

Patient preparation

Written informed consent is obtained, explaining clearly that EUS-GE is a novel technique and an off-label use of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration — approved stent. A CT scan helps determine the proximity of the small bowel to the stomach and to look for ascites, a contraindication to EUS-GE. Antibiotics are not routinely administered.

Technique 1. Antegrade EUS-GE: the traditional/downstream method

Step 1: An endoscopy is performed to place a guidewire in the proximal jejunum past the obstruction. The endoscope is withdrawn, leaving the guidewire in the jejunum.

Step 2: Under fluoroscopic control, a large dilating balloon is advanced over this wire to the jejunum.

Step 3: EUS-guided 19-gauge needle puncture of the balloon is performed from the stomach (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
Fluoroscopic view of large dilating balloon inflated in the third portion of the duodenum, to target with a 19-gauge needle through a therapeutic linear echoendoscope.

Step 4: A new guidewire is passed downstream into the jejunum through this 19-gauge needle.

Step 5: Over this guidewire, the LAMS is deployed, creating a gastroenterostomy.

Technique 2. Antegrade EUS-GE: the rendezvous method

Steps 1 to 3 are the same as in Technique 1.

Step 4: Instead of passing a guidewire downstream into the jejunum, the puncturing guidewire is trapped in the dilating balloon that was punctured, or an ERCP extraction balloon and basket, and pulled back through the duodenal obstruction, out of the mouth, securing it (Fig. 2).

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on intragastric balloons in the management of obesity [^115FLZi3]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Implementation remarks for intragastric balloon therapy — Trials in the United States were limited to a BMI range between 30 and 40 kg/m2, whereas individuals with BMI values outside this range were sometimes included in international trials. Fluid-filled balloons may be associated with more weight loss, lower tolerability, and less favorable safety profile than gas filled balloons, and a shared decision-making is suggested for determining device choice. Evidence is insufficient to recommend a specific antiemetic regimen, and the choice of regimen is based on institutional policy, clinical context, and availability.

### Gas-related symptoms after antireflux surgery [^113dvwcy]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Gas-related symptoms such as bloating, flatulence, and impaired ability to belch are frequent after antireflux surgery, but it is not known how these symptoms affect patient satisfaction with the procedure or what determines the severity of these complaints. We aimed to assess the impact of gas-related symptoms on patient-perceived success of surgery and to determine whether the severity of gas-related complaints after antireflux surgery is associated with objectively measured abnormalities.

Methods

Fifty-two patients were studied at a median of 27 months after antireflux surgery. The influence of gas-related symptoms on their quality of life and satisfaction with surgical outcome was assessed. The rates of air swallows and gastric and supragastric belches before and after surgery were assessed using impedance measurements.

Results

Bloating and flatulence were associated with a decreased quality of life and less satisfaction with surgical outcome. Notably, 9% of the patients would not opt for surgery again due to gas-related symptoms. Antireflux surgery decreased the total number of gastric belches but did not affect the number of air swallows. The severity of gas-related symptoms was not associated with an increased number of preoperative air swallows and/or belches or a larger postoperative decrease in the number of gastric belches.

Conclusion

Gas-related symptoms are associated with less satisfaction with surgical outcome. The severity of gas-related symptoms is not determined by the number of preoperative air swallows or a more severe impairment of the ability to belch after surgery. Preoperative predictors of postoperative gas-related symptoms therefore could not be identified.

3.3 Effect of5‐on Belches During the Gas Challenge Test

During the first 20 min of gas infusion, after 1500 mL of gas has been infused into the stomach over 15 min, 1.07 ± 0.45 and 0.81 ± 0.4 gastric belches were registered on placebo and STW 5‐II, respectively (p = 0.67). At the end of the 90‐min study period, only 1.61 ± 0.67 and 2.18 ± 1.09 gastric belches were registered (placebo and STW 5‐II, respectively; p = 0.33). Gastric belching was exceptional throughout the study period, indicating that rectal gas evacuation was the main route of gas elimination.

Supra‐gastric belching (SGB) was also analyzed. At the end of the study, 0.84 ± 0.60 and 1.63 ± 0.72 SGB episodes were registered in STW 5‐II and placebo studies, respectively (p = 0.20). Supra‐gastric belches were also exceptional throughout the entire study period.

### Responses to gastric gas in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders [^117BqArS]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gas-related abdominal symptoms are common in patients with functional gut disorders, but the responses to cope with the large volumes of gas that enter daily into the stomach have not been studied in detail. Our aim was to evaluate transit and tolerance of gastric gas in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders.

Methods

In eight healthy volunteers and 24 patients with functional gut disorders (eight functional dyspepsia, eight belching disorder, and eight functional bloating) 1500 mL of a gas mixture were infused into the stomach at 25 ml/min. Belching, rectal gas evacuation, and abdominal perception were continuously recorded for 90 minutes.

Key Results

Healthy subjects expelled the infused gas per rectum (1614 ± 73 ml), with a small rise in epigastric perception (score increment 1.0 ± 0.4) and virtually no belching (1 ± 1 belches). Patients with functional dyspepsia had a hypersensitive response to gastric gas, with a significant rise in epigastric perception (score increment 2.5 ± 0.6; p = 0.045), a transient delay in rectal gas evacuation and similar belching as healthy controls. Patients with belching disorders responded to gastric gas with continuous belches (33 ± 13 belches; p = 0.002), low epigastric perception, and a small reduction in rectal gas evacuation. Patients with functional bloating exhibited a slow transit response, with reduced rectal gas evacuation (1017 ± 145 ml; p = 0.002) and abdominal symptoms (score increment 2.5 ± 0.7), but without compensatory belching.

Conclusions and Inferences

Different pathophysiological mechanisms underlay specific adaptive responses to gastric gas in patients with different functional gut disorders. Therapeutic interventions for gas-related abdominal symptoms should be addressed towards these specific pathophysiological disturbances.

Management

We were able to identify 51 cases of air embolism during or after ERCP published in literature shown in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4). A proposed algorithm for diagnosis and management of gas embolism is included in Fig. 2. The key in management is early recognition of signs and symptoms of air embolism, although in many cases the diagnosis is only made post-mortem. Termination of the procedure should be the first step in the treatment to prevent further entry of gas. Decompression of the stomach and duodenum by withdrawal of the endoscope will reduce the pressure gradient and prevent further additional entrapment of air. Hemodynamic and respiratory stabilization should be the priority. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be initiated immediately when needed. Endotracheal intubation with capnography should be performed in somnolent, obtunded or comatose to protect airway and provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

### The intestinal gas questionnaire (IGQ): psychometric validation of a new instrument for measuring gas-related symptoms and their impact on daily life among general population and irritable bowel syndrome [^112f42z7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gas‐related symptoms (GRS) such as bloating, borborygmi/stomach rumbling, or flatulence are common complaints in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and in general population (GPop). They affect daily life, and each of us has experienced how flatulence or bad breath can affect social interactions.GRS fluctuate from day‐to‐day influenced by triggers such as food and beverages. The passage of gas from the anus up to 20 times a day is considered normalas is occasional belching after meals. Indeed, each subject has a unique perception of what he or she considers normal or abnormal. The Rome Foundation has defined a series of diagnostic criteria for what are known as the functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, more recently named as disorders of brain‐gut interactionbut unfortunately, there are no internationally agreed criteria for what constitutes a normal or abnormal amount of GRS, and no validated, objective ways of capturing the extent of the problem.

Previous studies showed that a 4‐item digestive symptom frequency questionnaire (DSFQ) assessing 3 GRS (bloating, flatulence, and rumbling stomach) was sensitive to detect significant changes in response to a probiotic in 2 randomized studies in GPop reporting mild GI discomfort. However, the DSFQ is too short to capture the full experience of subjects with regard to GRS, especially as one, out of the 4 items, refers to abdominal pain, which is outside the scope of the conceptual framework we aimed to create.

Our research program aimed to develop an intestinal gas questionnaire (IGQ) which could assess GRS and their impact in a consistent manner to be used in for the purpose of clinical trials as well as in clinical practice.

In an initial study, IBS patients and subjects from GPop complaining of GRS were interviewed simultaneously in 3 countries (UK, France, and Spain) and a conceptual framework for the pilot version of IGQ, measuring both GRS and their impact on daily life, was created. Similar concepts were identified for both IBS patients and GPop subjects. This 43‐item pilot IGQ consisted of a 24‐hour recall symptom diary assessing 7 GRS using 17 items and a 7‐day recall questionnaire assessing the impact of those symptoms on daily life, using 26 items. The 7 GRS were as follows: abdominal distension, abdominal pressure/feeling bloated, flatulence, belching, bad breath, stomach rumbling, and difficult gas evacuation.

### A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial on the efficacy of carbon dioxide insufflation in gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection [^11417nic]. Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation is expected to be safe and effective in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) as well as in other endoscopic procedures. The present study aimed to clarify the usefulness and safety of CO2 insufflation in gastric ESD.

Patients and Methods

A total of 102 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to CO2 insufflation (CO2 group, n = 54) or air insufflation (Air group, n = 48). Abdominal pain and distension were chronologically recorded on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). The volume of residual gas in the digestive tract was measured by computed tomography performed immediately after ESD.

Results

Abdominal pain on a 100-mm VAS in the CO2 vs. Air group was 4 vs. 3 immediately after ESD, 4 vs. 4 one hour after the procedure, 3 vs. 3 three hours after the procedure, and 1 vs. 4 the next morning, showing no difference between the groups. In addition, there was no difference in abdominal distension on the 100-mm VAS over the time course of the study. The volume of residual gas in the digestive tract in the CO2 group was significantly smaller than that in the Air group (643 mL vs. 1037 mL, P < 0.001). The dose of sedative drugs did not differ between the groups. Neither the incidences of complications nor clinical courses differed between the groups.

Conclusions

Compared with air insufflation, CO2 insufflation during gastric ESD significantly reduced the volume of residual gas in the digestive tract but not the VAS score of abdominal pain and distension.

Raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RVRTC) methodology — RVRTC uses an inflatable jacket wrapped around the thorax of the sedated, supine infant; there should be a minimum of 5 finger breadths between the infant and the jacket to prevent restriction of lung volumes, with tight jackets restricting lung volumes and loose jackets delaying initiation of the "hug". A clear facemask attached to a circuit containing a pneumotachograph is placed around the infant's nose and mouth, and the infant's lung volume is increased to an airway pressure of 30 cm H2O (V30); cricoid pressure could be applied during the inflation maneuver to limit gas entry into the stomach. After the inflation to V30, the infant is allowed to passively exhale and these maneuvers are repeated until the infant exhibits a short respiratory pause; at the end of the V30 inflation, the jacket is inflated to a preset pressure to initiate the forced exhalation maneuver, and the above maneuver is repeated at increasing jacket pressures.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112nA6Sn]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cyanide exposure — key considerations emphasize that pulse oximetry accurately reflects serum levels of oxygen but does not accurately reflect tissue oxygen levels therefore should not be relied upon in possible cyanide and/or carbon monoxide toxicity. After hydroxocobalamin has been administered, pulse oximetry levels are no longer accurate and skin, tears, and urine will all turn red, and this flushing should not be interpreted as an allergic reaction. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas, and clinicians should be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when released with vomiting or belching. Amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite are no longer being used and no longer available in commercial kits.

### Effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on gastric insufflation during induction of anaesthesia when using pressure-controlled ventilation via a face mask: a randomised controlled trial [^112UWikf]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on the results of this study, it seems that PEEP facilitates the passage of gas into the oesophagus during anaesthesia, and the protective mechanisms, seen at spontaneous breathing, are reversed after anaesthesia induction, with an increased risk of gastric insufflation. The reason for the higher incidence of gastric insufflation with PEEP is somewhat unclear. Indeed, there would be a higher mean airway pressure in the PEEP group than in the ZEEP group; however, all the observed gastric insufflations were observed during inspiration. Furthermore, most gastric insufflations were seen immediately after an elevation of Δ P, and even at PIP 30 cmH 2 O, the calculated mean airway pressure was 17 cmH 2 O in the PEEP group, which did not exceed LES pressure in our participants at this level.

When 10 cmH 2 O of PEEP was applied, most of the participants showed gastric insufflation when PIP was titrated above LES pressure, whereas most of the participants in the ZEEP group resisted insufflation even when PIP exceeded LES pressure. The manometry/impedance catheter readings gave no clear explanation for this phenomenon. Theoretically, a high PEEP level could insufflate the oesophagus with gas, abolishing surface tension effect of the collapsed oesophagus, facilitating passage of gas into the stomach. However, when the impedance curves were analysed, there was no indication of gas trapping in the oesophagus, as impedance levels returned to baseline during expiration.

Even if there is an increased risk of gastric insufflation with PEEP during FMV, the use of CPAP/PEEP during pre-oxygenation and FMV after anaesthesia induction has several respiratory benefits and should therefore be used when applicable. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware that PEEP can cause gastric insufflation, especially in certain high-risk patients, who have an increased risk for regurgitation. It seems crucial to maintain PIP as low as possible. We saw no gastric insufflation events until PIP reached 20 cmH 2 O in the PEEP group. We therefore recommend PCV, rather than manual or volume-controlled, to avoid peak pressures above 15 cmH 2 O when PEEP is applied during FMV.

### Food passageway-related sequelae in the refluxStop prospective multicenter trial: patient-centric outcomes of dysphagia, odynophagia, gas-bloating, and inability to belch and / or vomit at 5 years [^112nbzBG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Generally, patients experience alleviation of gas-bloating after anti-reflux surgery, with lower incidence observed using MSA rather than Nissen or Toupet fundoplication despite similar improvements in quality of life overall. A propensity-matched analysis of Nissen fundoplication and MSA found no difference in 1- to 7-year outcomes of gas-bloating and the rate of gas-bloat syndrome remains high after MSA despite its preserved belching mechanism compared to Nissen fundoplication, indicating that gas-bloating is not exclusively related to the inability to belch after fundoplication. Furthermore, some of the literature suggests that unfavorable results after MSA may in fact be related to gas-bloat syndrome and that patients unable to achieve ≥ 50% improvement in GERD-HRQL score with complete cessation of PPI therapy are more likely to report frequent incapacitating gas-bloating symptoms. The proposed mechanism of post-MSA gas-bloating is apropos the forceful distension required to open the device ring and allow for gas venting, in spite of largely preserved gastric anatomy and ability to belch/vomit with MSA. A fair extrapolation is that gas-bloating is not primarily resolved by preservation of the belching process, at least one other attribute of the anti-reflux barrier must be restored for better treatment effect, and that surgical manipulation or augmentation of the LES may not be ideal. This is conceivably true given the favorable outcomes in this study in which a treatment that not only maintains normal dynamic processes of the esophagogastric junction like belching (i.e. 100% in the present study) but also addresses other deficiencies of the anti-reflux barrier without encircling or compressing the distal esophagus.

The present study indicates that RefluxStop surgery seems to be a stronger candidate in closing the treatment gap for PPI-refractory patients that are risk averse to postoperative symptoms like gas-bloating, albeit by indirect comparison the differences are pronounced. The therapeutic effect of RefluxStop surgery on all components of the anti-reflux barrier as well as its non-encircling nature may explain the low rate of gas-bloat syndrome observed. The procedure reconstitutes a dynamically functional flap valve, as part of a broader apparatus, that contributes to normal gas venting physiology in addition to restoration of LES competency, by correct intraabdominal positioning rather than augmentation.

### Retrograde esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection through a gastrostomy [^111eUAzr]. Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

A 74-year-old man complained of trismus and was diagnosed with advanced pharyngeal cancer. A preoperative ultrathin endoscopy detected a superficial esophageal tumor, 30 mm in diameter, at the upper thoracic esophagus.

The patient followed a liquid diet completely owing to his restricted mouth opening. Consequently, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was performed to ensure sufficient nutrition. Chemoradiotherapy was directed toward the pharyngeal cancer and not the esophageal cancer to avoid a larger radiation field leading to complications. However, trismus persisted even after chemoradiotherapy, following which endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was planned for the esophageal cancer.

First, balloon dilation was performed under vision by transnasal endoscopy (Fig. 1). An endoscope (8.9 mm diameter, GIF-H290; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted through the gastrostomy (Video 1), and the tip of the transnasal endoscope was positioned just below the esophagogastric junction (Fig. 2). We then proceeded with endoscopy to the esophageal lumen, and a circumferential marking was made (Fig. 3). After making an oral mucosal incision using the endoscope through the gastrostomy, both circumferential incision and subsequent submucosal dissection were performed until the tumor was resected en bloc (Fig. 4) using a clip with line attached to the anal side of the specimen and pulled through the gastrostomy for appropriate tension. During the procedure, gas insufflated into the stomach was suctioned periodically to relieve the patient's pain and prevent Mallory-Weiss syndrome, particularly when an ESD knife was placed in the esophageal lumen to make reinsertion into the esophageal lumen through the esophagogastric junction easier (Fig. 5).

Distal anastomosis obstruction (RYGB, BPD) presents as an acute emergency with characteristic findings and management. Obstructions around the distal anastomosis may result in acute "gas bloat" of the distal stomach and this is a true surgical emergency because if the distal stomach is not vented, gastric necrosis, perforation, and death may rapidly ensue; patients often present with epigastric fullness and "hiccups" and diagnosis is suggested by a large gas bubble in the right upper quadrant on plain films. Distal gastric remnant is decompressed via tube gastrostomy and attention directed to the etiology of the distal anastomotic obstruction.

This method has other advantages. Keeping the stomach at low pressure by removing gas seems to be less stressful for patients, which may allow sedation to be more effective. In addition, maintaining the stomach at low pressure may prevent Mallory–Weiss syndrome and vagal reflexes associated with hyperextension of the gastric wall. Even if an intraprocedural perforation occurs, leakage of air into the abdominal cavity can be minimized. In situations when the stomach is too collapsed to continue ESD, this can be solved by just clamping the tube with Pean forceps.

In conclusion, the nasogastric tube decompression technique facilitates gastric ESD using the PCM.

### Emphysematous infections of the abdomen and pelvis: a pictorial review [^116jcaWH]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Emphysematous (gas-forming) infections of the abdomen and pelvis represent potentially life-threatening conditions that require aggressive medical and often surgical management. The initial clinical manifestation of these entities may be insidious, but rapid progression to sepsis will occur in the absence of early therapeutic intervention. Conventional radiography and ultrasonography are often the initial imaging modalities used to evaluate patients with abdominopelvic complaints. However, when a differential diagnosis remains, or if further localization or confirmation of tentative findings is needed, computed tomography (CT) should be considered the imaging modality of choice. CT is both highly sensitive and specific in the detection of abnormal gas and well suited to reliable depiction of the anatomic location and extent of the gas. Of equal importance may be the capability of CT to help reliably identify benign sources of gas, because treatment (if any) varies dramatically depending on the source. Knowledge of the pathophysiologic characteristics, common predisposing conditions, and typical imaging features associated with gas-forming infections of the gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, and genitourinary system will help make early diagnosis and successful treatment possible. In addition, such knowledge will aid in further diagnostic work-up, surveillance of potential complications, and evaluation of therapeutic response.

### Food passageway-related sequelae in the refluxStop prospective multicenter trial: patient-centric outcomes of dysphagia, odynophagia, gas-bloating, and inability to belch and / or vomit at 5 years [^112YhhjW]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Gas-bloat syndrome is a subjectively defined sequela of anti-reflux surgery that is commonly reported and characterized by bloating, abdominal pain, early satiety, nausea, and the inability to belch/vomit (i.e. a functional outcome presupposing gas-bloating). The prevalence of GERD-related abdominal bloating before surgery remains unclear, however, up to 50% has been reported. After standard-of-care surgery with Nissen fundoplication, gas-bloating occurs in 52.7% of patients by 5 years. Abdominal bloating after operative intervention is thought to be due to diminished gas venting from surgical manipulation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), but understanding of the exact mechanism is incomplete. Thus, our thesis outlines that minimizing direct manipulation of the LES is the best approximation methodology for reducing abdominal bloating after surgery. Even though newer technology like MSA has been suggested as the preferred choice over standard-of-care surgery in medically refractory patients prioritizing gastrointestinal symptoms, the rate of gas-bloating remains high and implies that LES augmentation alone (with preserved gas venting) is not a sufficient prevention methodology for this physiologically complex sequela associated with the belching process.

It can be associated to a wide range of disorders, and although it usually is an innocuous condition, it should prompt a search for the underlying aetiology, since some of its causes impose an urgent treatment. In rare instances, it may itself represent a life-threatening condition, depending on the site involved and how quickly it evolves. Abnormal air/gas beyond viscera and serosal spaces, reaches its location following some anatomic boundaries, such as fascia, which may help search the source; however if the air pressure exceeds the strength of the tissues, or the time between the aggression and the imaging is too long, the air/gas is almost everywhere, which may hinder its cause. Good knowledge of the anatomic spaces and how they connect between them facilitates the quick detection of the cause. Teaching points
- Ectopic air can be depicted on conventional radiographs; but CT is more sensitive and accurate
- Visceral and retropharyngeal spaces directly communicate with mediastinum
- Renal fascia is a single multilaminated structure, which contains potential space.

### Efficacy and tolerability of α-galactosidase in treating gas-related symptoms in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial [^116YgdLv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders, including those with irritable bowel syndrome, complain of gas-related symptoms, e.g. bloating, abdominal distention, and flatulence. Indeed, more than 20% of the general population suffers from abdominal pain or discomfort and 16% from bloating or distension with no evidence of any inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic or neoplastic process that explains the subject's symptoms. Intestinal gas-related symptoms are generally not considered to be a severe medical problem but can negatively affect quality of life, even in pediatric age.

The mechanism underlying gas-related disorders is not well understood. As a result, the best treatment is still not well defined. Bloating is the sensation of trapped gas and tightness in the abdomen which is exacerbated by meals and fluctuates in intensity during the day. It may be associated with distension (an objective increase in waist size) and flatulence. Flatulence or gas build up in the intestine is typically caused by the fermentation of undigested food and may cause voluntary or involuntary passing of gas.

Therefore, agents that decrease the amount of gas in the intestine may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for the management of gas-related symptoms when their cause depends, at least in part, on gas hyper-production.

There are different strategies that may reduce intestinal gas. Current approaches are based on dietary changes and life-style factors; administration of simethicone; activated charcoal and probiotics. However in most cases results are unsatisfactory.

The food enzyme, α -galactosidase, derived from Aspergillus niger mold, acts in the gastrointestinal tract by breaking down specific non-absorbable oligosaccharides before they are metabolized by colonic bacteria. As a result, this agent may be useful to reduce the amount of fermentable substrates in the colon and prevent the overproduction of gas associated with meals. Obviously the same effect could be obtained by selecting foods which do not contain those specific non-absorbable oligosaccharides. However this selection is not easy and may lead to the elimination of healthy food (cereals, legumes and vegetables).

There are some data supporting the efficacy of α-galactosidase in reducing breath hydrogen (a measure of intestinal gas production) and in preventing gas formation in the colon and related disturbances. However, the studies are available only in adult populations.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of α-galactosidase in pediatric patients with predominant gas-related symptoms.

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^1162TzgB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Gas Transit Test

2.2.1 Gastric Gas Infusion

We used a polyvinyl tube assembly (3.2 mm outer diameter [OD]), that incorporated a gas infusion channel (1.6 mm inner diameter [ID]) with a distal opening positioned in the stomach. Gas was continuously infused at a rate of 100 mL/min for 15 min (1500 mL final volume) using a volumetric pump (GIP‐3000 Infusion Pump, Solfer Solucions SL, Barcelona, Spain). The gas mixture infused was comprised of 88% nitrogen, 6.5% carbon dioxide, and 5.5% oxygen, mimicking the partial pressures of venous blood gases to minimize diffusion across the intestine‐blood barrier.

2.2.2 Nutrients Infusion

To emulate a standard meal, 315 kcal of a nutrient mixture (Fresubin YoDrink 1.5 kcal/mL; Fresenius Kabi, Barcelona, Spain) was continuously perfused at 14 mL/min for 15 min (210 mL final volume) into the stomach via a 1.2 mm ID perfusion channel incorporated into the nasogastric tube assembly, with the distal port located at the same level as the gas infusion site and connected to a volumetric pump (Alaris GH Guardrails Plus; BD Switzerland Sàrl. Eysins, Switzerland).

2.2.3 Measurement of Rectal Gas Evacuation

Rectal gas evacuation was collected via an intrarectal Foley catheter (20 French, Bard, Barcelona, Spain) with the balloon inflated with 5 mL of water. The catheter was connected to a leak‐proof, low‐resistance collection line using a barostat, and the volume was continuously recorded on a personal computer for 90 min.

2.2.4 Measurement of Gastric Belching

Gastric belching was continuously recorded using a pH‐impedance device (Z/pH Recorder, Diversatek, Highlands Ranch, CO). The pH‐impedance catheter was introduced transnasally into the stomach (drop of pH below 4), and then slowly withdrawn in 1‐cm steps to position the pH sensor 5 cm above the point at which the pH rises above 4 (esophageal pH). Belches were continuously recorded during the 90‐min study period.

### Updated panel report: best practices for the surgical treatment of obesity [^115mhzbs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Accepted and emerging endoluminal therapies for weight loss — intragastric balloons are the most prevalent and currently three intragastric balloons are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for weight loss; these balloons are temporary intragastric space-occupying devices that are removed after a maximum of 6 months following placement. In 2015, a meta-analysis assessing short-term results of the intragastric balloon was published, with aggregated data from studies having time points ranging from 3 to 12 months and sample sizes varying from 21 to 128 patients demonstrating significantly improved weight loss versus controls; while the intervention group had significantly more gastrointestinal-related symptoms on initial placement, a safety analysis showed no serious or fatal complications. The other FDA-approved endoluminal device is an aspiration device that enters the stomach similar to a gastrostomy tube and is manually emptied by patients after meals to evacuate 30% of the meal content, with early studies demonstrating 55% excess weight loss at up to 2 years, although at this time aspiration therapy is not widely utilized and it is unclear where it will fit into the treatment paradigm moving forward.

### The intestinal gas questionnaire: development of a new instrument for measuring gas-related symptoms and their impact on daily life [^114hafCo]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although gas-related symptoms (GRS) are common and intrusive, there are no questionnaires to quantitate this problem. This study aimed to develop an instrument to rectify this gap in our knowledge.

Methods

Concepts were initially identified from the literature and interviews with gastroenterologists. Exploratory one-to-one interviews and focus groups with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (n = 28) and non-IBS subjects (n = 27) with GRS were conducted in UK, France, and Spain leading to a conceptual framework for the questionnaire. Last, iterative rounds of cognitive debriefing were performed with IBS (n = 16) and non-IBS subjects (n = 14).

Key Results

From the first three steps, nine GRS (bloating, distension, flatulence, odorous flatulence, difficult gas evacuation, stomach rumbling, belching, bad breath, and abdominal movement) were identified although abdominal movement was subsequently excluded. Twelve quality of life domains affected by these symptoms were identified as: Clothing, emotional, physical appearance, diet, daily living, work, social life, physical activity, relationships, sex life, sleep, and cognitive function. A 24-h recall for symptoms and a 7-day recall for impact assessment were supported by the qualitative findings. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the understanding of the instrument. Across the three languages, the instrument was conceptually and linguistically consistent.

Conclusions & Inferences

The International Gas Questionnaire is a 2-part instrument, developed rigorously and simultaneously in three languages assessing seven symptoms (17 items) and their impact on 12 domains (26 items) in IBS and general population. It is now undergoing psychometric validation and should provide a unique tool for epidemiological surveys and clinical trials for developing new treatments for these symptoms.

### EUS-guided gastroenterostomy: techniques from east to west [^1179U7a9]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Technique 3. Retrograde EUS-GE: enterogastrostomy

Steps 1 to 4 are the same as in Technique 2, with the guidewire secured across the stricture and out of the mouth.

Step 5: A therapeutic endoscope is now advanced over the guidewire, traversing the obstruction to the point of duodenal/jejunal insertion of the guidewire.

Step 6: The LAMS is deployed from the jejunum (gastric flange opens first) (Fig. 3).

Figure 3
Fluoroscopic view of gastric flange being deployed first and seen well because of the large gastric gas shadow by the "jejunogastrostomy technique".

Advantage: This reduces the chances of the first flange (in this case, gastric) misdeploying because the stomach is less likely to be pushed away, and the gastric gas shadow fluoroscopically allows for easier deployment.

Disadvantage: Traversing the obstruction may increase the risk of perforation and has to be within reach of a therapeutic endoscope.

Technique 4. EUS balloon-occluded GE bypass (EPASS)

Step 1: A double-balloon enteroscope (DBE) is used to place a guidewire in the proximal jejunum.

Step 2: The DBE is withdrawn, leaving the overtube in place.

Step 3: A novel balloon-occlusion catheter is passed over the guidewire, and 2 balloons (20 cm apart) are inflated to fix a segment of duodenum and jejunum, which is filled with contrast material and methylene blue.

Step 4: An EUS-guided puncture of this portion of the small bowel is performed between these 2 balloons.

Step 5: The LAMS is deployed.

Advantage: Fixing the jejunum between the 2 balloons may prevent its migration while the LAMS is deployed.

Limitations of Technique 4: This technique would fail if the proximal jejunum and duodenum aren't in close proximity to the gastric wall, and, furthermore, this novel catheter is not commercially available.

### Bronchial thermoplasty reduces gas trapping in severe asthma [^1116DmwD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study recruited a group of subjects with severe asthma, persistent lung function impairment, high current symptom burden and frequent exacerbations. All were at GINA Step 5 treatment, with 50% requiring maintenance oral corticosteroids. Following BT, there was a marked improvement in current asthma control, as reflected in ACQ. Whereas no subject had an ACQ5 < 1.5 at baseline, 18/32 (56%) had achieved this at 6 months (p < 0.001, Chi-square). This improvement was accompanied by a 76% reduction in oral steroid requiring asthma exacerbations. Further, amongst 16 patients requiring maintenance oral corticosteroids pretreatment, 75% had been able to discontinue oral steroids by the 6-month re-evaluation.

Despite the substantive clinical improvement observed in this study, no change was seen in any spirometric parameter. This has been a consistent finding in the published literature in relation to BT. It highlights our lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of the response to BT, and underscores our desire to evaluate the effect of BT on the peripheral airways. Reassuringly, Table 1 demonstrates that BT does not attenuate the response to short acting bronchodilator- something which might otherwise have been anticipated from treatment causing atrophy of airway smooth muscle. This demonstrates that the reason that patients use less reliever medication after BT is not because the reliever medication is in any way less effective.

### Gas, bloating, and belching: approach to evaluation and management [^114GVbRV]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Gas, bloating, and belching are associated with a variety of conditions but are most commonly caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders. These disorders are characterized by disordered motility and visceral hypersensitivity that are often worsened by psychological distress. An organized approach to the evaluation of symptoms fosters trusting therapeutic relationships. Patients can be reliably diagnosed without exhaustive testing and can be classified as having gastric bloating, small bowel bloating, bloating with constipation, or belching disorders. Functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic idiopathic constipation are the most common causes of these disorders. For presumed functional dyspepsia, noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori and eradication of confirmed infection (i.e., test and treat) are more cost-effective than endoscopy. Patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome should be tested for celiac disease. Patients with chronic constipation should have a rectal examination to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation. Empiric therapy is a reasonable initial approach to functional gastrointestinal disorders, including acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia, antispasmodics for irritable bowel syndrome, and osmotic laxatives and increased fiber for chronic idiopathic constipation. Nonceliac sensitivities to gluten and other food components are increasingly recognized, but highly restrictive exclusion diets have insufficient evidence to support their routine use except in confirmed celiac disease.

### Intestinal gas homeostasis: disposal pathways [^111g3ng3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with functional gut disorders frequently complain of gas-related symptoms, but the role of intestinal gas in this context is not clear, because intestinal gas homeostasis is incompletely understood. Our aim was to compare the proportion of the gas produced by colonic fermentation that is evacuated per anus and that eliminated via alternative pathways.

Methods

In 20 healthy subjects, gas evacuated per anus was collected for 4 h after a standard flatulogenic test meal. Paired studies were performed without and with high-rate infusion of exogenous gas (24 mL/min) into the jejunum to wash-out of the gut the endogenous gas produced by bacterial fermentation. The exogenous gas infused was labeled (5% SF 6) to calculate the proportion of endogenous gas evacuated.

Key Results

In the experiments with gaseous wash-out, 1817 ± 139 mL of endogenous gas was produced over the 4-h study period. However, in the experiments without wash-out (basal conditions), 376 ± 43 mL were evacuated, indicating that only 23 ± 3% of the gas produced was finally eliminated per anus, while the rest (77 ± 3%) had been previously eliminated via alternative pathways.

Conclusions & Inferences

Intestinal gas homeostasis is a highly dynamic process by which a large proportion of the gas produced by bacterial fermentation of meal residues is rapidly absorbed into the blood and/or metabolized by gas-consuming microorganisms, and only a relatively modest proportion is eliminated per anus. These data contribute to clarify the complex dynamics of intestinal gas and may help interpret the pathophysiology of gas-related symptoms.

### Review of recent evidence on the management of heartburn in pregnant and breastfeeding women [^112U8maK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Alginates

Alginates are natural polysaccharide polymers which polymerise into a gel upon contact with gastric acid. Alginate formulations for GERD treatment are frequently combined with antacids such as sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate component in the alginate formulation releases carbon dioxide within the alginate gel; this causes the gel to float to the top of the stomach contents to form a raft structure. The alginate-antacid raft forms a non-systemic barrier over the postprandial acid pocket to reduce postprandial acid reflux (Fig. 1). In an alginate/antacid combination, the rapid antacid action works concurrently with the long-lasting alginate reflux suppression.

Fig. 1
Diagram of alginate raft structure formation following ingestion of an alginate-containing formulation. Alginates react with the stomach acid to form a gel-like substance with neutral pH (A). Sodium bicarbonate contained in the formulation releases carbon dioxide gas, which becomes trapped in the gel. The trapped carbon dioxide gas allows the gel to float to the surface of the stomach content (B), effectively forming a raft structure (C) which acts as a barrier over the gastric acid pocket, and blocks against upward reflux.

Adapted from Bor et al.

A double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial to compare the efficacy of an alginate-based reflux suppressant, Liquid Gaviscon® (Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK) Ltd, Hull, UK; Liquid Gaviscon® contains 500 mg sodium alginate, 267 mg sodium bicarbonate and 160 mg calcium carbonate per 10 mL) vs. a magnesium–aluminium antacid gel (Maalox® Olic (Thailand) Co. Ltd. Thailand; 5 mL contains 120 mg magnesium hydroxide and 220 mg aluminium hydroxide) in 100 pregnant women at < 36 weeks' gestation who had ≥ 2 episodes of heartburn a week. The treatment dose was 15 mL orally three times after meal and before bedtime, continued for 2 weeks. Both treatments similarly improved heartburn frequency (80% vs. 88%, p = 0.275) and heartburn intensity (92% vs. 92%, p = 1.000). Alginate-based reflux suppressant was shown no different from magnesium–aluminium antacid gel in the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy.

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^113Phy7z]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In the present study, the effect of STW 5‐II on transit and tolerance to gastric gas in patients with FD and concomitant bloating was evaluated in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial. These results show that STW 5‐II accelerates gastric gas evacuation in dyspeptic patients, reducing early gas retention following gastric loading. Furthermore, gastric gas produces a rise in abdominal symptoms, more frequently referred to as bloating/fullness, that are attenuated by STW 5‐II compared to placebo.

Previous studies in healthy volunteers using the same methodology of direct gas infusion into the stomach have shown that under normal physiological conditions, gas reaching the stomach is promptly emptied into distal intestinal segments and finally expelled via the rectum, producing minimal abdominal symptoms. In contrast, dyspeptic patients exhibit a transient delay in gas evacuation during the initial minutes following gastric gas infusion, and subsequent studies have shown that this delay is exacerbated when gas infusion is combined with nutrient intake, mimicking the postprandial state.

Additionally, patients with FD develop significantly more pronounced abdominal symptoms during gas infusion into the stomach, an effect associated with visceral hypersensitivity that characterizes disorders of the gut–brain axis interaction. Notably, prior studies also showed that the belching reflex is only triggered by massive gastric gas loading at high infusion rates (e.g. 400 mL/min) in healthy individuals. At physiological infusion rates, comparable to those during meals, belching increases only in patients with a belching disorder, but not in healthy controls or FD patients.

Our findings confirmed most of these previous observations. After 2 weeks on placebo, dyspeptic patients showed a delayed onset of rectal gas expulsion, preceded by transient intraluminal accumulation, a rise in abdominal perception, and measurable abdominal distension. In contrast, after 2 weeks of pre‐treatment with STW 5‐II, rectal evacuation of gas was significantly accelerated, and the increase in abdominal symptoms was consistently lower throughout the study period. Likewise, despite the fact that gas infusion induced a rapid onset of moderate‐to‐severe epigastric symptoms, no increase in belching to decompress the stomach was observed in either treatment arm, confirming that at physiological infusion rates, gastric gas is predominantly transferred to the distal intestine and eliminated rectally.

### Food passageway-related sequelae in the refluxStop prospective multicenter trial: patient-centric outcomes of dysphagia, odynophagia, gas-bloating, and inability to belch and / or vomit at 5 years [^115onTSJ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Inability to belch and/or vomit

RefluxStop did not induce the inability to belch and/or vomit in any patient in this study, a side effect very common in standard-of-care surgery (i.e. 39.8% at 5 years in a systematic literature review on Nissen fundoplication). Thus, the complete preservation of the belching/emetic process after RefluxStop surgery, a presupposing factor in gas-bloat syndrome and impactful function for quality of life on its own, helps minimize abdominal bloating as shown by the results discussed above.

The belching process begins with distension of the cardia that induces transient LES relaxation, allowing for air to escape into the esophagus and equalization of gastric-esophageal pressures. The inability to belch/vomit after anti-reflux surgery seems to be closely related to bloating and flatulence and is purportedly due to insufficient LES relaxation. Considering that its manifestation after anti-reflux surgery is common, without returning over time, the utility of minimizing the structural impact on the LES should be emphasized. For instance, the level of LES augmentation that results in the inability to belch and/or vomit is similarly implicated in gas-bloating, with partial fundoplication seeming to provide more relief from such sequelae as compared to total (360°) fundoplication. More specifically, the mechanism behind this following fundoplication appears directly linked to LES function and its relaxation capacity after normal stimulation. Nissen fundoplication is thought to overcorrect mechanical deficiencies in the gastroesophageal junction at the LES, also resulting in an overly competent gastric cardia, that may incur subclinical obstruction of bolus passage at the level of fundoplication. Treatment that mitigates effects on the LES and the passage of boluses may improve preservation of the belching/emetic process.

### Intramural gas in stomach along with acute calculus cholecystitis: an unusual association [^113D1Yk6]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Intramural gas in stomach is a rare finding, but differential diagnosis of this condition into gastric emphysema and emphysematous gastritis is clinically important because of vastly different aetiologies and prognosis. Emphysematous gastritis is caused by gas producing micro-organisms inside the stomach wall and is a potentially fatal condition, while, on the other hand, gas enters stomach wall through mucosal breach in the case of gastric emphysema and prognosis is usually good with complete resolution. To date, no case has been reported in the literature showing gas in the stomach wall in a patient with acute calculus cholecystitis. We present a case of a young man with upper abdominal pain, and who, upon diagnostic work up was diagnosed with acute calculus cholecystitis with associated intramural gas in the stomach with no known aetiological factors to be positive. Conservative management with close observation resulted in complete symptomatic resolution.

### Percutaneous gastrostomy in patients with complete obstruction of the upper digestive tract [^111e78T8]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy for nutritional support can be performed radiologically when endoscopic technique is not possible. In patients with complete obstruction of the upper digestive tract, the radiological technique in its conventional method may not be possible, as insertion of naso-gastric tube for gastric insufflation is not always successful. We reviewed our experience of gastrostomy insertion in nine such patients after failure of the conventional method. In seven of the nine patients, initial gastric puncture was achieved with a 22G needle under direct ultrasound visualisation. In the remaining two patients, initial puncture was made into locules of gas in the stomach with fluoroscopy. The stomach was then distended with air and a gastrostomy tube inserted by conventional technique. We conclude that percutaneous gastrostomy can be undertaken safely even in the presence of complete obstruction of the upper digestive tract and recommend this technique in this selective group of patients.

Cyanide exposure — patient safety considerations advise wearing appropriate PPE during rescue of multiple casualties, managing off‑gassing risk after ingestion, avoiding nitrites when carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected, and selecting pregnancy-safe antidote therapy. In the event of multiple casualties, be sure to wear appropriate PPE during rescue evacuation from the toxic environment. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas; maximize air circulation in closed spaces as gastric contents may release hydrogen cyanide gases with vomiting or belching. Do not use nitrites in conjunction with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning as it worsens the hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity, and hydroxocobalamin is only agent safe for treatment of cyanide poisoning in pregnant patients.

Upper gastrointestinal ulcer bleeding — argon plasma coagulation (APC): In an RCT vs water injection, APC had less further bleeding (4/58 [6.9%] vs 12/58 [20.7%]; difference = −14%, −26% to −1%) with comparable mortality (2/58 vs 2/58). A meta-analysis of 3 RCTs of APC + epinephrine vs other modalities showed no significant differences in further bleeding (RR = 0.82, 0.21–3.91 with heterogeneity [I² = 73%]) or mortality (RR = 0.85, 0.30–2.44). Given indirect very-low-quality evidence, the panel agreed to a conditional recommendation for APC. Supporting RCTs used gas flow 1–2 L/min, power 40–70 W, probe-to-mucosa distance 2–10 mm, and frequent suction to remove smoke and reduce distension is recommended.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^116PD6xr]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of belching — clinicians should first communicate the definition and pathophysiology of gastric and supragastric belching to the patient to establish an understanding and to implement collaborative treatment. Impedance monitoring has helped educate patients, similar to biofeedback therapy for pelvic floor disorders, by objectively demonstrating their physical symptoms as the first step toward treatment when belching is a behavioral disorder and not a consequence of reflux. In belching disorder due to supragastric belching, the reflux episodes are typically nonacidic, which may explain the lack of response to proton pump inhibitors. Recent studies suggested that supragastric belching before reflux activity does not respond to proton pump inhibitor therapy, but supragastric belching after the reflux episodes does. The most effective suggested treatment for supragastric belching has been behavioral strategies, which include helping the patient become aware of the reasons for their symptoms. Diaphragmatic breathing (see video: https://romedross.video/3azBfEE) increases vagal tone, inducing relaxation and reducing stress response, and is a treatment option for supragastric belching. In addition, belching associated with GERD symptoms improves when diaphragmatic breathing is combined with proton pump inhibitor therapy. Similarly, CBT reduces supragastric belching episodes and esophageal acid exposure, improving QOL.

Dietary carbohydrate intolerance and diagnostic approach — In patients with disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBIs), "fructose intolerance was more common — seen in 60% of patients — and was higher than lactose intolerance (51%), and its prevalence was similar across all major types of DGBIs, except IBS-C". The "simplest and most economically sound way to diagnose any food intolerance is usually a dietary restriction of short duration (2 weeks), with resolution of symptoms as a positive predictor". Breath testing, "which measures hydrogen, methane, and CO2, is a better low-cost option, albeit reserved for patients refractory to dietary restrictions first and suspected lactose, fructose, or sucrose intolerances".

The H₂ primary outcome is "reduction of bloating severity or frequency by 50% plus normal H₂ breath test (< 20 ppm at or before 90 minutes) or duodenal aspirate on < 10³ CFU/mL". For CH4 positive enrollment, criteria are "CH4 ≥ 10 ppm at any point during the first 90 minutes of the breath test and constipation (< 3 CSBM/week)". The CH4 primary outcome is "improvement in constipation severity (increase in number of CSBMs/week by ≥ 1 and normalization of CH4 (no CH4 ≥ 10 ppm within 90 minutes))", with a key secondary outcome of "improvement in bloating by ≥ 50% (frequency or severity)".

### Bloating and abdominal distension: old misconceptions and current knowledge [^111EXvgQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Bloating, as a symptom and abdominal distension, as a sign, are both common functional-type complaints and challenging to manage effectively. Individual patients may weight differently the impact of bloating and distension on their well-being. Complaints may range from chronic highly distressing pain to simply annoying and unfashionable protrusion of the abdomen. To avoid mishaps, organic bloating, and distension should always be considered first and appropriated assessed. Functional bloating and distension often present in association with other manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia and in that context patients tend to regard them as most troublesome. A mechanism-based management bloating and distension should be ideal but elucidating key operational mechanisms in individual patients is not always feasible. Some clues may be gathered through a detailed dietary history, by assessing bowel movement frequency and stool consistency and special imaging technique to measure abdominal shape during episodes of distension. In severe, protracted cases it may be appropriate to refer the patient to a specialized center where motility, visceral sensitivity, and abdominal muscle activity in response to intraluminal stimuli may be measured. Therapeutic resources focussed upon presumed or demonstrated pathogenetic mechanism include dietary modification, microbiome modulation, promoting gas evacuation, attenuating visceral perception, and controlling abdominal wall muscle activity via biofeedback.

### Transoral incisionless fundoplication [^112dsyrc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

GERD is a spectrum disorder, and treatment should be individualized to the patient's anatomic alterations. Trans-oral incisionless fundoplication (TIF 2.0) is an endoscopic procedure which reduces EGJ distensibility, thereby decreasing tLESRs, and also creates a 3-cm high pressure zone at the distal esophagus in the configuration of a flap valve. As it produces a partial fundoplication with a controlled valve diameter, gas can still escape from the stomach, minimizing the side-effect of gas-bloat. Herein we discuss the rationale, mechanism of action, patient selection, step-by-step procedure, safety and efficacy data, it's use with concomitant laparoscopic hernia repair, and future emerging indications.

### Pancreatic enzymes clinical care guidelines [^112w8qrQ]. CFF (2006). Medium credibility.

Signs of maldigestion and malabsorption in people with cystic fibrosis include poor weight gain despite a good appetite, frequent loose and/or large bowel movements, foul-smelling bowel movements, mucus or oil in the bowel movement, excessive gas and/or stomach pain, and distention or bloating. Persons with CF who have not yet started taking enzymes may have any or all of the symptoms listed above, and improvement is generally noted once enzymes are started; sometimes, people with CF who already take enzymes experience these symptoms and this may suggest that the dose or type of enzymes may need to be adjusted. Do not increase or decrease the dose of enzymes without talking to your CF dietitian or care provider, and always give the prescribed dose of enzymes. Enzymes are essential in the care of CF. Talk with your CF dietitian or care provider if taking enzymes has become a problem.

### How can we relieve gastrointestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis? An international qualitative survey [^116HuwWt]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosed pancreatic insufficiency and GI complications of CF were reported by a large number of our lay respondents, with 84% (132/157) having been diagnosed with pancreatic insufficiency; 39% (61/157) having had DIOS; 20% (32/157) having CF-related liver disease (CFRLD) and 32% (50/157) having had meconium ileus in the newborn period. Of the respondents who reported these conditions, almost half had at least two diagnoses (48%, 76/157) and a small percentage reported all four diagnoses listed (6%, 10/157).

All of the participants who reported pancreatic insufficiency also reported having experienced GI symptoms at some time compared with 26 out of 36 (72%) pancreatic sufficient participants.

Figure 1 shows the most common symptoms affecting quality of life in pwCF (figure 1A) and the frequency with which symptoms occur (figure 1B). The most commonly reported symptoms were stomach cramps/pain, bloating and a 'combination of symptoms' (this was reported as the concomitant effect of symptoms occurring together including gas, pain, nausea, bloating, diarrhoea and vomiting). The top three symptoms that HCPs said were reported to them were reduced appetite, bloating and constipation (figure 1C). Missing school or work because of GI symptoms was reported by 66% (97/146) of the lay respondents and a similar proportion said that symptoms have affected their confidence or self-image (65%, 95/145). While 95% (147/155) reported being able to discuss GI symptoms with their CF team, only 26% (41/155) reported having the opportunity to discuss these with a gastroenterologist on their CF team.

### Adverse events of pancreatic extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy: a literature review [^113YStpM]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Different from post-ERCP gastrointestinal bleeding, such as duodenal bulb injury or postsphincterotomy bleeding, post-ESWL bleeding is defined as bleeding in a closed chamber due to shock wave damage in peripancreatic organs, including hepatic subcapsular haematoma, mesenteric haematoma, colonic haematoma, gastric submucosal haematoma and renal subcapsular haemorrhage. Bleeding often occurs immediately or within a few hours after P-ESWL. During the P-ESWL procedure, shock waves are targeted to pancreatic stones so that less force spreads to adjacent tissue and the bleeding is limited to be within a closed cavity. Conservative treatment is advised to be the first-line treatment based on closely monitoring the vital signs, whereas digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or an emergency operation should be performed when conservative treatment fails.

The underlying reason for perforation is the large acoustic impedance difference between normal tissue and gas or faeces in the gastrointestinal tract, for which the shock wave will release more energy. Although the stomach wall and feasible intestine are difficult to injure, a relatively fixed hepatic flexure is more likely to be damaged, which is different from post-ERCP perforation. Perforation in the duodenum is possible but has not yet been reported. Leakage is usually due to intestinal juice and gas, which contribute to obvious peritonitis symptoms, but the pores are too small to be detected by colonoscopy. Physical examination showed board-like rigidity, and standing abdominal plain film radiography indicated the presence of subdiaphragmatic free air. For these patients, continuous gastrointestinal decompression is the core of treatment, supplemented by somatostatin or octreotide to reduce the secretion of intestinal juice and to keep the gastrointestinal tract clean. Conservative treatments can relieve the symptoms in most patients, whereas laparoscopic treatments are strongly recommended if the patient's condition deteriorates (presenting with septic or peritonitis signs).

Gas-bloat syndrome

For reference, 52.7% of patients experience gas-bloating 5 years after Nissen fundoplication and almost one-third have gas-bloating quite early (at 1 year). Postoperative gas-bloat syndrome is also common 5 years after MSA and occurs in as many as 23–47% of patients. In this study of RefluxStop the relation of gas-bloating symptoms, expressed as a ratio of none or improved /worsened, was 42/2 subjects at 5 years, and with inclusion of the three subjects lost to COVID-19 (with 3- and 4-year data carried forward) this ratio becomes 45/2 where 95.7% (n = 45/47) of subjects had favorable gas-bloating results. Only two subjects (4.3%) had worsening of symptoms at 5 years compared to baseline. In comparison to more than half (52.7%) of patients with gas-bloating after standard-of-care fundoplication at the same follow-up time, the difference is sizeable.

Gas-bloat syndrome after anti-reflux procedures is thought to occur from impaired venting of gas through a surgically restored LES. Complete understanding of gas-bloat syndrome is lacking but failure of gastric distention-induced LES relaxation, frequent swallowing of air, diminished accommodation of the stomach, and iatrogenic vagal nerve injury are proposed etiologies. Those with mild cases are recommended treatment via dietary modification, avoidance of gas-inducing foods, simethicone, prokinetic agents, avoidance of aerophagia, and reassurance of spontaneous symptom resolution; however, patients are often left underserved as shown by the paucity of convincing evidence supporting the effectiveness of these strategies. Regardless, the effect of gas-bloating on patient dissatisfaction is well known and a study of 1,063 patients that underwent fundoplication surprisingly found that gas-bloating was reported as the most bothersome new-onset symptom, even more so than dysphagia, thus meriting supplementary consideration in treatment choice for such outcomes.

### Emergency management of acute late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic hernia in infants and children [^112PBQXf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 22 patients were involved in this study. The ages ranged from 2 months to 10 years, with a mean age of 22 months. All chest x-rays revealed the left CDH and a compelling herniated swollen stomach as a result of the mediastinal shift. Immediate fluid infusion, nasal oxygen breathing, and gastrointestinal decompression were performed in all patients. Eight patients were relieved after extracting an ample amount of gas and fluid using the nasogastric tube (NGT). Shortness of breath was noted in 14 patients who were not obviously relieved owing to the ineffective placement of the NGT. Five patients underwent conventional ventilation with tracheal intubation. None of the patients underwent high-frequency oscillating ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and inhaled nitric oxide. Three patients underwent the bedside percutaneous puncture of distensible stomach because of shortness of breath, and oxygen saturation continued to decrease. Two patients improved their condition, and 1 patient died because of the failure to extract the contents in his/her stomach. Five thoracotomies and 16 thoracoscopies were performed in the remaining 21 patients. Five thoracoscopies were converted into thoracotomies because of the difficulty in decreasing herniated swollen stomach. After the operations, all patients were relieved and were able to recover 4 to 12 days postoperative stay. All patients, including the 2 puncturing patients, did not report any intrathoracic infection. Patients had normal diet on postoperative 3.2 days (range, 1–10 days). All patients underwent follow-up at least 3 months. The average period was 22 months (range, 3 months to 5 years). All patients improved their condition without recurrence during the follow-up.

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^113ik3gn]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

An "in vitro" study by Simmen et al. demonstrated that STW 5 binds to various receptors involved in pain transmission, including serotonin, muscarinic, and opioid receptors. In this study, the authors analyzed separately the effects of the different herbal components of STW 5 and found that the fresh plant extract of, one of the main components of STW 5‐II, selectively inhibited M3 receptor binding, while chamomile flower and licorice root extracts bound to 5HT 4 and 5HT 3 receptors, respectively.

Beyond receptor binding, components of STW 5‐II have also shown antispasmodic effects comparable to those of papaverine, which may contribute to the reduction in symptom perception reported by patients during gastric gas infusion. These experimental findings support the rationale for the observed reduction in abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients treated with STW 5, as well as the decreased bloating induced by colonic gas infusion in patients with IBS.

In the present study, we used a gas and nutrients infusion methodology that has been previously validated in studies involving healthy individuals and patients with functional dyspepsia. This methodology consists of a gas challenge test with direct infusion of gas and nutrients into the stomach. It offers the advantage of precisely controlling the amount of gas and nutrients reaching the stomach, allowing for the performance of comparative studies under controlled conditions. However, a limitation of the study is that it was performed in a non‐physiological situation, under laboratory conditions. Moreover, to properly challenge the stomach, the amount of gas infused (1500 mL) corresponds to the upper limit of what is typically ingested during a standard meal. This data is calculated from the results of previous studies showing that in a standard meal as much as 40 swallows containing gas can occur, and that each swallow may contain up to 32 mL of gas. In addition to swallowed gas, food and beverages containing different amounts of gas may also increase the volume of gas entering the stomach during a meal. However, no studies have assessed gas swallowing during meals in dyspeptic patients.

### Distress, burden, and wellbeing in siblings of people with mental illness: a mixed studies systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jsPmQ]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Subcategory 1.3: We only talk around the issues. Siblings shared that communication became limited and superficial in their families. This occurred in various relationships and for various reasons. For example, some parents intentionally did not discuss illness-related issues with the siblings of their child with MI. In some families, members talked often among themselves but not with the individual with MI. In others, siblings struggled to talk openly about their own challenges. Across studies, siblings felt that more open communication would be relieving: 'It is like having gas in your stomach. You cannot keep things that way. It leads to pain'. (Ewertzon, Cronqvist, Lutzen, & Andershed, pg. 161). Primary data in this subcategory were all classified under 'burden'.

Category 2: The illness shapes me

Over seventy per cent (72.73%) of included qualitative studies reported at least one (sub)theme relating to pervasive effects on siblings' development of self, values, and/or understanding of the world. Two subcategories captured these impacts.

Subcategory 2.1: I am secondary to my sibling. Many studies (54.55%) suggested that having a sibling with MI can profoundly affect an individual's sense of self, the world, and their relationships. In some instances, this occurred to the extent where individuals understood themselves solely in relation to their sibling with MI. One sibling questioned, 'Do I exist in this world, really, or is it just her?' (Fjermestad, Ro, Espeland, Halvorsen, & Halvorsen, pg. 87). Siblings reported feeling that their needs were less important than others, particularly their sibling with MI. Contributing to this experience, siblings reported that extended family often focused on how their sibling with MI was doing and rarely asked about them. Primary data in this subcategory were classified as 'burden' and/or 'wellbeing'. Two specific components emerged within this subcategory.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^115SJdim]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Psychosocial factors and conditioning in belching — The biopsychosocial history should attend to psychosocial triggering factors, including anxiety, life events, and conditioned responses to stressors of physical symptoms. Notably, supragastric belching stops during sleep, distraction, or when the patient speaks, supporting that psychological factors modulate its occurrence and frequency and that it may be responsive to brain–gut behavioral therapies (BGBTs), such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Belching may be conditioned to reduce the bloating sensation via air release, thereby reducing gastric wall tension. Supragastric belching is less common in children than gastric belching when a GERD association is present.

### Food passageway-related sequelae in the refluxStop prospective multicenter trial: patient-centric outcomes of dysphagia, odynophagia, gas-bloating, and inability to belch and / or vomit at 5 years [^111McDXs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Loss of the ability to belch and/or vomit after anti-reflux surgery is common and appears to be closely related to gas-bloat syndrome, as previously stated. For instance, the ability to belch/vomit is lost in 39.8% of patients managed by Nissen fundoplication at 5 years. There is no convincing data showing that physiologic function of the belching/emetic process returns with time and may thus be consequential to the patient experience. Postsurgical loss of the ability to belch/vomit is thought to result from overcorrection of LES function and diminished capacity for relaxation in response to appropriate stimulation by gastric distension.

Nissen fundoplication and MSA prioritize augmentation of the LES as a mechanism in reflux management. These procedures are associated with a substantial burden of postoperative sequelae like dysphagia, odynophagia, gas-bloating, and the inability to belch/vomit. Such adverse events (AEs) impose a detrimental effect on quality of life and satisfaction after surgery, resulting in a treatment gap that has arguably been overlooked. Applying improved understanding of the anatomical and physiological basis of normal processes, as well as GERD pathogenesis, is likely to optimize treatment success and employing techniques with broader attention to the anti-reflux barrier, like RefluxStop surgery, may alter the paradigm of management. Complications like dysphagia and gas-bloating are highly relevant due to their great effect on patient quality of life. For instance, dissatisfaction following laparoscopic fundoplication is most often due to new-onset symptoms such as dysphagia and gas-bloating despite improvement in GERD, as reported by Humphries and colleagues.

### Can carbonated water support weight loss? [^116LKYup]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). High credibility.

While these findings suggest that carbonated water may indirectly promote weight loss by enhancing anaerobic glycolysis and glucose utilisation, it is crucial to approach these effects in context. Carbonated water is not a standalone solution for weight loss. During haemodialysis, glucose concentrations decrease by an average of 19.7 mg/dL as blood passes through the dialyser. In a typical 4 hour haemodialysis session with a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min, approximately 48 000 mL of blood flows through the dialyser. This results in approximately 9.5 g of glucose being consumed during the session. Given this minimal glucose reduction, the impact of CO 2 in carbonated water is not a standalone solution for weight loss. A balanced diet and regular physical activity remain crucial components of sustainable weight management.

Also, drinking carbonated water can have some effects on the digestive system, particularly for individuals with sensitive stomachs or pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions. The primary concerns include bloating, gas and, in some cases, exacerbation of certain symptoms associated with digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndromeor gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Moderation is key to avoiding discomfort while still enjoying the possible metabolic benefits of carbonated water.

Recent reports have shown that there is a clear positive correlation between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the breath and blood glucose levels. Therefore, although the calorie consumption from CO 2 is small when drinking carbonated water, there is a possibility of a temporary decrease in blood glucose levels, and there may be an effect if blood glucose levels are measured while drinking carbonated drinks.

In conclusion, the CO 2 in carbonated water may support weight loss by converting to HCO 3 − in red blood cells and increasing pHc to enhance glycolysis. However, because this glycolysis due to CO 2 consumes fewer calories, it should be integrated into a broader strategy of healthy living rather than relied on as a primary weight loss tool. Further research is necessary to better understand its long term effects and optimise its role in dietary interventions.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^116viboQ]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Belching diagnosis and management (algorithm) — For excessive belching with reduced quality of life, if diagnosis is suspected perform comprehensive history and clinical observation with clinical clues distinguishing supragastric ("Frequent repetitive belching that doesn't occur during sleep, or when speaking and is reduced with distraction. It may be associated with GERD. Psychological stressors increase belching".) from gastric ("Belching occurs less frequently and with greater time gap than supragastric".). To differentiate, use "Ambulatory impedance monitoring ± high resolution manometry (HRM) (for at least 90 minutes); 24 hour impedance preferred". Supragastric belching is characterized on HRM as "upper esophageal relaxation with air flowing into esophagus then expelled orally through pharynx prior to reaching stomach", and management includes "Communicate findings to patient (psychoeducation)", "Rule out rumination disorder (HRM with impedance)", "Consider PPI therapy if related to GERD", "Gut directed behavior therapy (CBT and hypnotherapy, diaphragmatic breathing)", and "Central neuromodulators especially if psychological distress also reported". Gastric belching is linked to "Findings of air flow from esophagus into stomach and excess TRLES followed by upper esophageal sphincter relaxation", and management includes "Start PPI therapy and lifestyle modifications for reflux", "Rule out gastroparesis in subset of patients with nausea and vomiting", "Consider fundoplication if severe pathologic GERD", and " ± Baclofen if related to excess TRLES". If manometry suggests aerophagia, "Consider aerophagia if manometry shows influx of air into the esophagus with swallowing causing intestinal gas accumulation on abdominal x-rays. The main symptom is bloating, not belching", leading to "Brain–Gut Behavior Therapy".

### Gas-bloat syndrome after magnetic sphincter augmentation: incidence, natural history, risk factors, and impact on surgical outcomes over time [^114dk3sg]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

The findings of the current study have a number of implications for clinical practice. Despite studies demonstrating a lower rate compared with fundoplication, the incidence and impact of GBS on MSA outcomes are not negligible. Patients should be informed of these risks before MSA. However, given that the vast majority of patients had resolution of GBS within 1 year with associated improvement in outcomes, we recommend that these findings be used for risk-stratification and expectation management, not surgical candidacy. There are a number of useful strategies for managing postoperative gas-bloat symptoms. Given that gas bloat is most prevalent early on, all of our patients are empirically started on simethicone for the first 6 weeks after surgery. If bloating symptoms persist, this course is extended. It is also important to consider alternative causes of bloating symptoms, such as gastroparesis. GES can be useful in determining whether a pyloric drainage procedure may be warranted. Finally, MSA is removable if necessary. However, we previously published our experience with MSA removal and found that the indications for removal were persistent dysphagia (78%) followed by inadequate control (22%). In our experience, no patients have required device removal for GBS. Therefore, we recommend watchful waiting with lifestyle modification and medications for the management of GBS.

Gastrointestinal perforation — initial endoscopic response emphasizes immediate team coordination and contamination control. The first step in encountering a perforation is to inform the staff (trainees, colleagues, nurses, technicians, anesthesiologists) of the situation. After alerting the staff, the next reflexive action by the endoscopist should be to ensure that they are using carbon dioxide insufflation and adjust to a low flow setting. The endoscopist should also clear and suction the field of any luminal contents that may cause peritoneal contamination and administer intravenous antibiotics with Gram-negative and anaerobic coverage. Once the cause and morphology of the perforation have been determined, the vast majority of these lesions can be addressed endoscopically if the proper tools and expertise are available.
