## Question

how describe objective assessment of patient with Sequelae of CVA. he has general contractures. general weakness.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to objectively assess a patient with sequelae of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) manifesting as generalized weakness and contractures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching assessment framework and the distinction between impairment, activity, and participation. Then, I should verify the objective tools for measuring weakness and how to anchor severity. Next, I will examine how to differentiate and quantify spasticity versus fixed contracture, including the Tardieu Scale and goniometry. After that, I need to check functional and mobility measures that reflect real-world impact. I will then consider pain, sensation, and associated phenomena that modify risk and treatment. Finally, I should confirm documentation standards, reassessment cadence, and how to translate findings into goal-directed interventions, while double-checking the evidence strength and noting limitations where needed [^115ywf18] [^112WERiL].

> Let me first confirm the framework so I don't miss key domains. The assessment should be organized around the ICF model: body structure/function (impairments such as weakness, spasticity, contracture), activity (task performance), and participation (life roles), with explicit attention to environmental and personal factors; this ensures we capture both the disease process and its lived consequences and aligns with stroke rehabilitation guidance to use standardized tools across these levels [^115ywf18].

> Now, I will examine objective measurement of weakness, but wait, let me verify the most efficient and reliable tools. Manual muscle testing (MRC 0–5) is fast and widely used, but handheld dynamometry provides quantitative force data and improves precision; the Motricity Index offers a validated, rapid composite of key upper and lower extremity segments and correlates with functional outcomes, so I should include it when time allows; I should also document side-to-side asymmetry and proximal versus distal patterns to guide prognosis and therapy selection [^1119k1Rk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "spasticity" without separating it from contracture. I need to ensure I use the Tardieu Scale (TS) to capture velocity-dependent stretch reflexes and the angle of catch, because Ashworth-derived scales conflate tone with resistance from shortening and are less valid for spasticity per se; the TS, embedded within a Five-Step Assessment, helps distinguish spasticity, shortening, weakness, and fatigability and guides whether to prioritize stretching, chemodenervation, or active training; I should also measure passive and active range of motion with a goniometer to quantify contracture and track change over time [^111tdFCY] [^113Qssqx] [^1132pVAY].

> I should double-check the timing dynamics here. Early after stroke, spasticity may be the dominant contributor to limited range, but over months, disuse and weakness drive adaptive shortening; thus, serial TS and ROM data help me avoid misattributing fixed losses to "tone" when they are actually structural, which has direct implications for whether I escalate stretching, serial casting, or surgical referral versus chemodenervation and strengthening [^114UCU8k] [^111tdFCY].

> Next, I should review functional and mobility measures that map to real-world performance. For the upper limb, the Action Research Arm Test and Fugl-Meyer Assessment are complementary and responsive; for the lower limb, timed walking tests (10-meter walk, 2-minute walk) quantify speed and endurance, while the Berg Balance Scale and Tinetti add balance and fall-risk context; I need to ensure I use the same tests at each visit to quantify change and align with patient-centered goals [^111tdFCY] [^115ywf18].

> But wait, what if pain, sensation, or associated reactions are confounding function or safety. I should screen for pain at rest and with stretch, document sensory loss that increases fall risk, and observe for associated reactions during contralateral activation; although associated reactions are not strongly linked to contracture formation, they can interfere with therapy and should be noted for task-specific training modifications [^115jpB2R] [^117G9YJd].

> I need to ensure my documentation is standardized and reproducible. I will record MRC grades, dynamometry values, TS parameters (angles V1 and V3, quality of muscle reaction), goniometric ROM, and functional scores with clear baselines; I should also note assistive devices, orthoses, and environmental modifiers, and schedule reassessment at consistent intervals to track response to interventions and recalibrate goals with the patient and caregivers [^111tdFCY] [^115ywf18].

> Let me consider how to translate these data into interventions, and I should verify the evidence strength. For high shortening coefficients, I will prioritize intensive stretching, serial casting, and consider surgical lengthening; for high spasticity with clonus or dystonia, I will consider botulinum toxin with adjunct therapy; for predominant weakness, I will emphasize strengthening and task-specific training; I should confirm that botulinum toxin reduces tone and can improve function in selected patients, and that early intervention may mitigate contracture progression without added cost in some contexts [^1132pVAY] [^115niwv6] [^116Zy7GL] [^115s5rda].

> Hold on, I should verify adjunct modalities and their evidentiary footing. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation can be offered to improve motor outcomes in appropriate candidates, and modalities like heat may transiently reduce tone to facilitate therapy, though long-term spasticity benefits are uncertain; I will frame these as adjuncts within a multimodal program and document their impact on function rather than tone alone [^111Zq1GS] [^113vZZ1k] [^111vJkRs].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan remains patient-centered and measurable. Using Goal Attainment Scaling alongside standardized measures helps align treatment with what matters to the patient, supports adherence, and provides a transparent way to judge success; I should confirm that reassessment before or at the time of each intervention maintains consistency and allows timely course correction if goals are not being met [^111Tqyjo].

The objective assessment of a patient with sequelae of CVA, general contractures, and general weakness should be **structured and measurable**, using standardized tools and clear documentation. The key elements are:

- **Strength testing**: Use MRC grading (0–5) [^1119k1Rk] for major muscle groups and handheld dynamometry for quantitative strength [^1119k1Rk].
- **Contracture assessment**: Measure passive range of motion with a goniometer [^111tdFCY] and document fixed deformities (e.g. equinovarus, MCP flexion).
- **Spasticity evaluation**: Use the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) [^1119k1Rk] and Tardieu Scale [^111tdFCY] to grade tone and velocity-dependent catch.
- **Functional measures**: Apply the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) [^113Ep1wi], Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) [^113dsASq], and 10-meter walk test [^111tdFCY] to quantify motor impairment and mobility.
- **Balance and gait**: Use the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) [^notfound] and Timed Up and Go (TUG) [^notfound] to assess fall risk and mobility.
- **ADLs**: Document dependence with the Barthel Index or Functional Independence Measure (FIM) [^113dsASq].
- **Pain and sensation**: Screen for neuropathic pain and map sensory deficits [^113icgqZ].
- **Documentation**: Record specific joint angles, MAS/Tardieu scores, MRC grades, and functional test results with clear interpretation and goals [^111Tqyjo].

## Motor strength assessment

Use **manual muscle testing (MMT)** with the Medical Research Council (MRC) grading scale (0–5) [^1119k1Rk] for major muscle groups bilaterally, and apply **handheld dynamometry** for quantitative strength [^1119k1Rk].

---

## Assessment of contractures

Use a **goniometer** to measure passive range of motion (PROM) at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle, and **document fixed deformities** such as equinovarus, MCP flexion, or intrinsic plus hand deformity [^111tdFCY].

---

## Spasticity evaluation

Use the **Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)** [^1119k1Rk] to grade resistance to passive stretch (0–4) and the **Tardieu Scale** [^111tdFCY] to assess velocity-dependent stretch reflexes and the angle of catch.

---

## Functional impairment assessment

- **Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)**: Quantifies motor impairment, balance, sensation, and ROM [^notfound].
- **Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)**: Evaluates upper limb function [^113dsASq].
- **10-meter walk test**: Measures gait speed and mobility [^111tdFCY].

---

## Balance and coordination assessment

Use the **Berg Balance Scale (BBS)** [^notfound] to assess static/dynamic balance and fall risk and the **Timed Up and Go (TUG)** [^notfound] to measure mobility and transitions.

---

## Activities of daily living (ADLs) assessment

Use the **Barthel Index** to assess ADL independence and the **Functional Independence Measure (FIM)** [^113dsASq] to evaluate disability and care needs.

---

## Pain and sensory assessment

Screen for **neuropathic pain** and document its location, intensity, and impact, and map **sensory deficits** (touch, proprioception, pain, temperature) [^notfound].

---

## Documentation and interpretation

Record **specific joint angles, MAS/Tardieu scores, MRC grades, and functional test results**, and interpret findings to guide goals and interventions [^111Tqyjo].

---

This structured approach ensures **objective, reproducible assessment** and supports targeted rehabilitation planning.

Weakness is a common complaint in the emergency department, and a most challenging one, because before the emergency physician can proceed with an evaluation, the complaint of weakness must be fully clarified to determine about what the patient is actually complaining. This article will focus on causes of acute generalized nontraumatic bilateral weakness. Evaluation begins with the history and physical examination, followed by diagnostic testing in some cases.

AAPM&R spasticity assessment and management — key findings guiding recommendations emphasize holistic and patient-centered evaluations, treatment, and reassessments, with assessment of the impact of spasticity management not limited to the reduction of objective measures of tone but also including the impact on function and quality of life. The guidance highlights the importance of multimodal therapies, stating that spasticity interventions should often be used in combination for maximal benefit and that coordination of care between physiatrists, physical and/or occupational therapists, caregivers, and surgeons, when appropriate, is key to achieving optimal outcomes. It also notes a lack of studies that explore effectiveness across conditions and that although there have been marked gains and improvements in management of spasticity, more work needs to be done to differentiate pathologic mechanisms and to achieve more targeted treatment; furthermore, access to care is an obstacle and numerous socioeconomic factors affect access to care and need to be addressed at both an individual patient and societal level.

There are several key components to the meaningful and comprehensive assessment of patients with acquired brain injuries with respect to management of the upper motor neuron syndrome. Type of brain injury, trajectory of recovery, relevant concomitant complications, development of appropriate goals, and an understanding of resources available for patients are all factors to assess when developing a treatment plan. Using appropriate outcome measures will help monitor the efficacy of interventions and guide ongoing management of spasticity.

### Positive signs of functional weakness [^112gKRYL]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Functional (conversion) neurological symptoms represent as one of the most common situations faced by neurologists in their everyday practice. Among them, acute or subacute functional weakness may mimic very prevalent conditions such as stroke or traumatic injury. Hence, accurate and reliable positive signs of functional weakness are valuable for obtaining timely diagnosis and treatment, making it possible to avoid unnecessary or invasive tests and procedures up to thrombolysis. We therefore present here a brief overview of the positive neurological signs of functional weakness available, both in the lower and in the upper limbs, moving from a historical perspective to their relevance in current clinical practice.

### Contractures and muscle disease [^113AkAHp]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Contractures are one of a handful of signs in muscle disease, besides weakness and its distribution, whose presence can help guide us diagnostically, a welcome star on the horizon. Contractures are associated with several myopathies, some with important cardiac manifestations, and consequently are important to recognise; their presence may also provide us with a potential satisfying 'penny dropping' diagnostic moment.

### Relation between spasticity, weakness and contracture of the elbow flexors and upper limb activity after stroke: an observational study [^114UCU8k]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Understanding the relationship between the motor impairments and their impact on physical activity will allow rehabilitation after stroke to be based on scientific principles. The aims of this study were to determine: (i) the relative contribution of weakness and spasticity to contracture, and (ii) the relative contribution of all three impairments to limitations in physical activity during the first 12 months after stroke.

Method

This longitudinal observational study charted the evolution of weakness (loss of maximal force), spasticity (stretch-evoked EMG) and contracture (loss of joint range) of the elbow flexors and limitations in upper limb activity (Motor Assessment Scale) for a year after stroke in 27 subjects who had suffered a first stroke. Spasticity was measured as abnormal reflex activity, weakness was measured as loss of maximum isometric torque, contracture was measured as the difference in range of motion between the affected and intact side, and limitations in physical activity were measured on a clinical scale.

Results

The major independent contributors to contracture were spasticity for the first four months after stroke (p = 0.0001–0.10) and weakness thereafter (p = 0.01–0.05). However, the major and only independent contributor to limitations in physical activity throughout the year was weakness (p = 0.0001–0.05).

Conclusions

For the first time, from a longitudinal study, the findings show that spasticity can cause contracture after stroke, consistent with the prevailing clinical view. However, weakness is the main contributor to activity limitations.

### What are the outcomes after primary total hip and knee arthroplasty in patients with prior cerebrovascular accidents? [^115k9wY6]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients who have a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with neurological sequelae undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), we sought to determine mortality rate, implant survivorship, complications, and clinical outcomes.

Methods

Our total joint registry identified CVA sequelae patients undergoing primary THA (n = 42 with 25 on affected hip) and TKA (n = 56 with 34 on affected knee). Patients were 1:2 matched based upon age, sex, body mass index, and surgical year to a non-CVA cohort. Mortality and implant survivorship were evaluated via Kaplan-Meier methods. Clinical outcomes were assessed via Harris Hip scores or Knee Society scores. Mean follow-up was 5 years (range, 2–12).

Results

For CVA sequelae and non-CVA patients, respectively, the 5-year patient survivorship was 69 versus 89% after THA (HR = 2.5; p = 0.006) and 56 versus 90% after TKA (HR = 2.4, P = .003). No significant difference was noted between groups in implant survivorship free from any reoperation after THA (P > .2) and TKA (P > .6). Postoperative CVA occurred at an equal rate in CVA sequelae and non-CVA patients after TKA (1.8%); none after THA in either group. The magnitude of change in Harris Hip scores (P = .7) and Knee Society scores (P = .7) were similar for CVA sequelae and non-CVA patients.

Conclusion

Complications, including the risk of postoperative CVA, implant survivorship, and outcome score improvement are similar for CVA sequelae and non-CVA patients. A 2.5-fold increased risk of death at a mean of 5 years after primary THA or TKA exist for CVA sequelae patients.

### Toward an epidemiology of poststroke spasticity [^111QgccW]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Poststroke spasticity (PSS)-related disability is emerging as a significant health issue for stroke survivors. There is a need for predictors and early identification of PSS in order to minimize complications and maladaptation from spasticity. Reviewing the literature on stroke and upper motor neuron syndrome, spasticity, contracture, and increased muscle tone measured with the Modified Ashworth Scale and the Tone Assessment Scale provided data on the dynamic time course of PSS. Prevalence estimates of PSS were highly variable, ranging from 4% to 42.6%, with the prevalence of disabling spasticity ranging from 2% to 13%. Data on phases of the PSS continuum revealed evidence of PSS in 4% to 27% of those in the early time course (1–4 weeks poststroke), 19% to 26.7% of those in the postacute phase (1–3 months poststroke), and 17% to 42.6% of those in the chronic phase (> 3 months poststroke). Data also identified key risk factors associated with the development of spasticity, including lower Barthel Index scores, severe degree of paresis, stroke-related pain, and sensory deficits. Although such indices could be regarded as predictors of PSS and thus enable early identification and treatment, the different measures of PSS used in those studies limit the strength of the findings. To optimize evaluation in the different phases of care, the best possible assessment of PSS would make use of a combination of indicators for clinical impairment, motor performance, activity level, quality of life, and patient-reported outcome measures. Applying these recommended measures, as well as increasing our knowledge of the physiologic predictors of PSS, will enable us to perform clinical and epidemiologic studies that will facilitate identification and early, multimodal treatment.

### Spasticity and contractures at the wrist after stroke: time course of development and their association with functional recovery of the upper limb [^111rNCw5]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the time course of development of spasticity and contractures at the wrist after stroke and to explore if these are associated with upper limb functional recovery.

Design

Longitudinal observational study using secondary data from the control group of a randomized controlled trial.

Setting

The Acute Stroke Unit at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

Subjects

Patients without useful arm function (Action Research Arm Test - ARAT) score of 0 within 6 weeks of a first stroke.

Main Measures

Spasticity was measured by quantifying muscle activity during passively imposed stretches at two velocities. Contractures were measured by quantifying passive range of movement and stiffness. Upper limb functional movement was assessed using the ARAT. All assessments were conducted at baseline, and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks after recruitment.

Results

Thirty patients (43% male, median age 70 (range 52–90) years, median time since stroke onset 3 (range 1–5) weeks) were included. Twenty-eight (92%) demonstrated signs of spasticity throughout the study period. Participants who recovered arm function (n = 5) showed signs of spasticity at all assessment points but did not develop contractures. Patients who did not recover useful arm function (n = 25) had signs of spasticity and changes associated with contracture formation at all time points tested.

Conclusion

In this group of patients who had no arm function within the first 6 weeks of stroke, spasticity was seen early, but did not necessarily hinder functional recovery. Contractures were more likely to develop in patients who did not recover arm function.

### Comprehensive examination of upper-extremity spasticity [^112aGWHC]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Spasticity is characterized by heightened muscle tone with exaggerated stretch reflexes and represents a prominent feature of upper motor neuron syndrome. This condition leads to a spectrum of upper limb deformities based on underlying pathology, location and severity of the causative lesion, presence of concomitant contracture, and prior treatment. Because of the heterogeneous presentation of the spastic upper limb, a uniform approach to assessment is a critical component of caring for patients with upper motor neuron syndrome. Unfortunately, existing scientific literature lacks consistent diagnostic standards, thereby preventing effective comparison of outcomes. A minimum set of evaluation criteria should be employed to both clarify clinical communication and improve postoperative outcomes reporting. This review outlines a stepwise approach to evaluation, a guide for standardizing measurements, and explores how diagnostic findings influence surgical decision-making in upper limb spasticity.

### Multifaceted assessment of functional outcomes in survivors of first-time stroke [^112meaL6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Stroke produces long-term residual disabilities across diverse aspects of human functioning. This cohort study may make a useful contribution to the literature by revealing distinct functional recovery patterns and identifying factors associated with multifaceted functional outcomes in long-term prospective follow-up data from patients who experienced strokes. Further research is needed to propose individualized therapeutic strategies for patients who experienced strokes with regard to specific functional deficits.

### Conference report on contractures in musculoskeletal and neurological conditions [^111L43jo]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Limb contractures are debilitating complications associated with various muscle and nervous system disorders. This report summarizes presentations at a conference at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, Illinois, on April 19–20, 2018, involving researchers and physicians from diverse disciplines who convened to discuss current clinical and preclinical understanding of contractures in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, stroke, cerebral palsy, and other conditions. Presenters described changes in muscle architecture, activation, extracellular matrix, satellite cells, and muscle fiber sarcomeric structure that accompany or predispose muscles to contracture. Participants identified ongoing and future research directions that may lead to understanding of the intersecting factors that trigger contractures. These include additional studies of changes in muscle, tendon, joint, and neuronal tissues during contracture development with imaging, molecular, and physiologic approaches. Participants identified the requirement for improved biomarkers and outcome measures to identify patients likely to develop contractures and to accurately measure efficacy of treatments currently available and under development.

### Contractures in the post-stroke wrist: a pilot study of its time course of development and its association with upper limb recovery [^1123od3j]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Contractures are common in a stroke population, yet there is little information on the time course of development.

Objectives

Investigate quantitatively changes associated with contracture formation in an acute stroke population.

Study Design

Longitudinal study on 22 subjects who were 2–4 weeks post stroke.

Outcome Measures

Contractures were assessed by quantifying the resting posture, resistance to passive movement and passive range of movement. Upper limb function was measured using the Action Research Arm Test and the Nine-Hole Peg Test. Active range of extension, wrist extension strength (isometric), grip strength and neglect were also measured. REPEATED MEASURES: Following an initial assessment, repeated measurements were taken at 4, 8, 20 and 32 weeks after recruitment.

Results

Two distinct subgroups, one capable of some functional movement (F group; 8 subjects) and another which was not (NF group; 14 subjects), were identified at the start of the study. The NF group showed changes associated with contracture formation at the wrist, i.e., reduction in the passive range of movement, an increase in resistance to passive movement and a worsening of the flexion posture. Changes were observed from the time of recruitment even though neglect improved. The F group showed improvements in upper limb function and there was no evidence to support contracture formation.

Conclusions

Subjects most prone to contracture formation were those who showed no signs of early functional recovery (2–4 weeks after the stroke). Changes consistent with adaptive shortening were seen from week 4 of the study period.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^1136vPVr]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

AAPM&R best practices for spasticity assessment and management state that, as a component of the initial patient evaluation, clinicians should assess the impact of spasticity on passive and active movement, ability to repeat movements, and function to guide its treatment/management. Reassessment of spasticity should occur throughout the treatment course, with reassessment before or at the time of each treatment to consider whether to continue the same treatment or to change the course of treatment. Standardized measures to evaluate spasticity should be utilized at each evaluation to optimize consistency and to objectively measure response when an intervention is applied. Treating spasticity should start with optimizing medical management, and physiatrists should make sure that patients are medically stable and address any medical problems that may exacerbate spasticity. To assess the extent to which a patient's goals are being met, a goal attainment scale or other means of measuring treatment response may be considered in each reassessment.

### Predicting spasticity after stroke in those surviving to 12 months [^115JLp2k]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To measure muscle tone in a cohort of patients 12 months after stroke and develop a preliminary model, using data recorded routinely after stroke, to predict who will develop spasticity.

Design

A cohort study.

Setting

Initially hospitalized but subsequently community-dwelling stroke survivors in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

Subjects

One hundred and six consecutively presenting stroke patients surviving to 12 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Spasticity measured at a range of joints using the Tone Assessment Scale.

Results

The Tone Assessment Scale revealed spasticity in 38 (36%) patients and more severe spasticity in 21 (20%) of the 106 patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that lower day 7 Barthel Index score and early arm or leg weakness were significant predictors of abnormal muscle tone; and lower day 7 Barthel Index score, left-sided weakness and ever smoked to be significant predictors of more severe muscle tone.

Conclusions

Using the models, it may be possible to predict whether or not spasticity will develop in patients 12 months after stroke. The utility of the models is aided by their use of predictor variables that are routinely collected as part of stroke care in hospital and which are easy to measure. The models need testing prospectively in a new cohort of patients in order to test their validity, reliability and utility and to determine if other data could improve their efficiency.

### Contemporary positive signs of functional limb weakness in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2: an exploratory analysis of their utility in diagnosis and follow-up [^112NAXdi]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

In this study, we verified the disappearance of positive signs in some patients during the follow-up period of 2 months and found that positive signs were associated with the perceived symptomatic improvement in patients, even though they were treated with supportive care alone. The association between positive signs and symptomatic amelioration was not decisive because the number of patients who were successfully followed up was small. However, we speculate that FND contributes to some of the symptoms of long COVID, one of the most common being chronic fatigue. The correlation between general improvement and the disappearance of positive signs indicated that some of the symptoms of those with long COVID may be caused by FND. If so, positive signs may be a useful indicator for symptoms of long COVID in certain patients. In addition, recognising the possible coexistence of FND with long COVID is a good strategy to avoid delayed treatment and unnecessary medical costs. Of note, positive signs in this study were confirmed by general neurologists easily and rapidly in daily medical settings and were without cost. Routine tests in conventional medical settings, such as blood tests, have not been useful for forming a diagnosis of long COVID. Therefore, positive signs will be of some use, at least in part, for physicians as an objective, cost-effective and practical method to assess the clinical course of long COVID.

### Development of a framework for the evidence-based choice of outcome measures in neurological physiotherapy [^113icgqZ]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Neurological physiotherapists recognize the need to include standardized outcome measures (OMs) in clinical practice but lack of information about the OMs available hampers utilization. This paper reports on the first stage of a project to identify the most robust OMs for use in neurological physiotherapy.

Objective

To identify what physiotherapists perceive that they need to measure during a neurological assessment.

Methods

Three separate workshops were held using patient vignettes to represent the acute, rehabilitation and community settings. Thirty senior neurological physiotherapists participated and were asked: 'What would you observe, test or measure if assessing this patient?' Data were analysed using thematic content analysis performed independently by each of the authors. Internal and external member checking ensured validity. In addition, the authors produced definitions of the items and domains identified in the data collection and subsequent content analysis.

Results

Items from the data collection were classified into 16 domains that physiotherapists need to measure: Weakness; range of movement/contracture; pain; muscle tone/spasticity; sensation; ataxia/co-ordination; personal fatigue; oedema; subluxation; postural and balance impairment; walking impairment; upper limb; balance disability; walking disability; mobility disability and falls.

Conclusions

The domains that physiotherapists need to measure during clinical assessment were identified. In the second stage of the project these domains will inform systematic reviews to identify the most robust outcome measures for use in clinical practice.

### Assessment of spasticity after stroke using clinical measures: a systematic review [^115xqypT]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify and appraise the literature on clinical measures of spasticity that has been investigated in people after stroke.

Methods

The literature search involved four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and The Cochrane Library) up to February 2014. The selected studies included those that aimed to measure spasticity using a clinical assessment tool among adult patients post-stroke. Two independent raters reviewed the included articles using a critical appraisal scale and a structured data extraction form.

Results

A total of 40 studies examining 15 spasticity assessment tools in patients post-stroke were reviewed. None of the reviewed measurement tools demonstrated satisfactory results for all psychometric properties evaluated, and the majority lacked evidence concerning validity and absolute reliability.

Conclusion

This systematic review found limited evidence to support the use of most of clinical measures of spasticity for people post-stroke. Future research examining the application and psychometric properties of these measures is warranted. Implications for Rehabilitation There is a need for objective clinical tools for measuring spasticity that are clinically feasible and easily interpreted by clinicians. This review identified various clinical measures of spasticity that have been investigated in people after stroke. Insufficient evidence of psychometric properties precludes recommending one tool over the others. Future research should focus on investigating the psychometric properties of clinical measures of spasticity.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^111tdFCY]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Spasticity assessment — key components and tools (Table 3) detail measures across movement domains. Passive range of motion can be measured with the Modified Ashworth scale (MAS), Tardieu Scale, goniometer, and motion capture using marker-based and markerless technology, and clinically this allows assessment of stiffness using the MAS, spasticity using the Tardieu Scale, and insight into stretch reflex excitability from the angle of catch or clonus upon fast passive stretch. Active range of motion assesses underlying neurological ability, and it is important to preserve any active movement ability the patient has. Rapid alternating movement assesses coordination and fatigue by asking the patient to perform a movement as fast as possible and repetitively, and a decrease in the range of motion with repetition indicates spasticity-related fatigability. Upper limb function can be evaluated with the Modified Frenchay Scale, Wolf Motor Function Test, or Action Research Arm Test, and patients can be rated based on the time taken to perform the task and the quality of the movement. Lower limb function can be assessed with a walking test (10 m or 2 min) used consistently to assess speed and compensatory strategies in ambulatory patients.

Limb Weakness, Contractures, Muscle Bulk and Motor Development

In most cases, limb weakness was predominantly proximal and symmetrical, and affected both upper and lower limbs. Severity was typically mild to moderate (Medical Research Council [MRC] 3–4/5), but sometimes severe (MRC 2/5 or less). Generalized muscle wasting was common (75%). Calf hypertrophy was rare (Family 13 proband only). Acquired limb contractures were frequent (67%), affected both proximal and distal joints, and were often multiple (see Supplementary Table 2).

A total of 19 of 30 patients could, or had previously been able to walk. Three (11%) were younger than 5 years and might still walk. Nine patients could walk fast or run, and 4 could jump. Rate of ambulatory loss was often slow (defined as "still ambulant or predicted to be still ambulant after 20 years of age"; 9/19 patients), and 4 of 19 patients were still gaining rather than losing walking ability (see Supplementary Table 2). Only 1 patient had lost the ability to walk independently (without aids) once achieved (Family 2 proband; unable to walk from age 7 years). Another initially walked with calipers but became wheelchair dependent at age 4 years (Family 5 proband). Three were experiencing increasing walking difficulties due to progressive weakness, pain, contractures, foot deformities, and/or fatigue (Family 7, 8, and 15 probands).

Axial Features and Respiratory Insufficiency

Neck flexion weakness was present in all but 1 of the 21 patients for whom data were available. Neck extension weakness was also common (83%). Three patients had a striking "dropped head" phenotype (Sibling1/Family 1, Sibling 1/Family 26, and Family 2 proband). 27

Many patients (63%) had objective evidence of respiratory impairment, and 44% required nocturnal or full‐time ventilation. Scoliosis was present in 57% of patients and was typically early‐onset, rapidly progressive, and had required (or was likely to require) intervention. Chest wall deformities and scapular winging were present in 43% and 45% of patients respectively. Scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and respiratory insufficiency were often concurrent. Spinal rigidity, kyphosis, and lumbar hyperlordosis were sometimes present (6, 3, and 6 cases respectively).

### Clinical outcome assessments for spasticity: review, critique, and recommendations [^1132pVAY]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Recommendations

In this review, the TS was the only ClinRO recommended to assess spasticity, followed by the CSI, S‐NRS, and the MSSS‐88, all recommended with caveats. The latter two evaluate "spasticity" from the patient's perspective, that is, as perceived tone. As such, however, they can only be recommended with caveats. These recommendations are not based solely on the measurement properties of the COA but also on their critical appreciation from the viewpoint of the concept of spastic paresis comprising not only spasticity but also other forms of muscle overactivity. These COAs are recommended for patients with spastic paresis regardless of the cause with the exception of MSSS‐88, which is a disease‐specific PRO.

The TS closely follows the definition of spasticity as an enhancement of velocity‐dependent stretch reflexes. To make full use of its potential, it should be used as one component of the Five‐Step Assessment (FSA) of spastic paresis, specifically designed to evaluate the most important components of spastic paresis. In brief, as the first step, the FSA identifies key muscle groups that contribute to function impairment. These muscles are subsequently evaluated technically using the TS to obtain information about their shortening and spasticity as an indicator of more disabling forms of muscle overactivity, that is, spastic dystonia and spastic cocontraction. Subsequently, active and rapid alternating movements against the resistance of the evaluated muscles are assessed. Several coefficients can be derived from these measurements, reflecting shortening, spasticity, weakness, and fatigability. These have high clinical relevance as they guide the treatment process. Although precise cutoff scores are not yet available for these coefficients, their significance in the decision‐making process can be — in simple terms — described the following way. Patients with a high coefficient of shortening should be primarily prescribed an intensive stretching regimen, or be sent to surgical lengthening procedures. Similarly, patients with a high coefficient of spasticity, if a bothersome clonus is present and/or if spastic dystonia is and/or if the coefficients of weakness and fatigability suggest the presence of spastic cocontraction, might be primarily treated with neuromuscular agents such as botulinum toxin. At the same time, intensive, specific, and long‐term training of active movements against the overactive muscles should be prescribed. Finally, patients with a low coefficient of spasticity, no clonus, and/or without spastic dystonia or cocontraction — which may be objectified using diagnostic nerve blocks — should primarily undergo the aforementioned active training in combination with various adjunct therapies. Functional electrical stimulation or orthotic devices are two examples. Of course, various other treatments are available, but stretching, active training, and possibly botulinum toxin injections should be the basic ones focusing specifically on deforming spastic paresis. On a worldwide scale, this is often not done. Our recommendation to use the TS might change this, paving the way for establishing a more transparent decision‐making process and utilizing efficient treatment methods.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^111Tqyjo]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Spasticity assessment — initial and follow-up guidance emphasizes consistent tools, comprehensive evaluation, patient-centered goals, and reassessment. We recommend consistency in measurement tools beginning with the initial assessment and continuing through ongoing management. As a component of upper motor neuron syndrome, spasticity includes positive and negative signs/symptoms, with positive signs including excessive muscle tone, hyperactive stretch reflexes, clonus, and spasms, and negative signs including incoordination, fatigue, weakness, and impaired motor control. A comprehensive evaluation of a patient with spasticity should include a patient-centered history and physical examination that incorporates upper and lower limb functional ability, passive range of motion, and active range of motion with repetition of movement. The purpose of the assessment is to set collaborative patient-centered goals for treatment and to evaluate the treatment response in a consistent and repeatable manner, and realistic treatment goal setting for patients (as well as family members and caregivers) is critical because it promotes motivation and cooperation as well as proper management of expectations and can favorably affect outcome. The use of goal attainment scales has been shown to help organize, focus, and clarify the aims of treatment to optimize the clinical response, and Table 3 provides an overview of commonly used tools to guide treatment and for periodic reassessment and follow-up before and after interventions to treat spasticity. Quantitative methods such as motion capture using marker-based or markerless technology can now easily be integrated into clinical practice for reliable and repeated measurement, and electrophysiologic and biomechanical assessments can be used as adjuncts to clinical measures to quantify the associated abnormal muscle activity.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115ywf18]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation — assessment of motor impairment, activity, and mobility highlights that assessment of motor impairments and activity is critical for delivering efficient, high-quality rehabilitation services to individuals with stroke. Motor impairment assessments (paresis/muscle strength, tone, individualized finger movements, coordination) with standardized tools may be useful, and upper extremity activity/function, balance, and mobility assessment with a standardized tool may be useful. The use of standardized questionnaires to assess stroke survivor perception of motor impairments, activity limitations, and participation may be considered, and the use of technology (accelerometers, step-activity monitors, pedometers) as an objective means of assessing real-world activity and participation may be considered. Periodic assessments with the same standardized tools to document progress in rehabilitation may be useful.

### Scar assessment tools: implications for current research [^111DNjgf]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Scarring is considered a major medical problem that leads to cosmetic and functional sequelae. Scar tissue is clinically distinguished from normal skin by an aberrant color, rough surface texture, increased thickness (hypertrophy), occurrence of contraction, and firmness. Marked histologic differences are the change in dermal architecture and the presence of cells such as the myofibroblast. Many assessment tools are available for analysis of pathologic conditions of the skin; however, there is no general agreement as to the most appropriate tools for evaluation of scar tissue. This review critically discusses currently available objective measurement tools, subjective assessment tools, and potential devices that may be available in the future for scar assessment.

### Do associated reactions in the upper limb after stroke contribute to contracture formation? [^117G9YJd]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish (1) whether associated reactions could contribute to contracture formation and (2) whether the presence of spasticity was essential for their expression, after stroke.

Subjects

Subjects were 24 hemiparetics within 13 months of a stroke, unselected for contracture or spasticity.

Main Outcome Measures

Associated reactions were identified by the presence of muscle activity in the affected biceps brachii and quantified as the amount of affected elbow flexor torque produced during a moderate contraction of either the contralateral biceps brachii or the contralateral quadriceps muscles. Contracture was measured as loss of elbow joint range of motion and spasticity as the presence of abnormal reflex activity.

Results

Associated reactions were present in at least one testing condition in seven subjects. During contractions of the contralateral biceps brachii, the median amount of elbow flexor torque produced was 0.39 (interquartile range, IQR 2.5) Nm while during contractions of the contralateral quadriceps muscle it was 0.19 (IQR 1.6) Nm. Associated reactions were not associated with contracture (p = 0.39) which was present in over half of the subjects. The incidence of associated reactions was about the same as that of spasticity, but the two were not related (p = 0.61).

Conclusions

Even though associated reactions were present in 29% of the subjects during moderate contraction of the contralateral muscles, they were not large, nor were they associated with contracture or spasticity, suggesting that this phenomenon is not usually a major problem for everyday function after stroke.

### Assessing and treating functional impairment in poststroke spasticity [^114XkKBp]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Poststroke spasticity (PSS) is associated with significant consequences for a patient's functional status and quality of life. Nonetheless, no uniform definition of spasticity exists that can be utilized across clinical research settings, and difficulties in validating proper assessment tools — both clinical and nonclinical — complicate the ability to evaluate and appropriately treat spasticity. Consequently, the current state of defining, assessing, and treating spasticity requires improved consistency and ongoing validation as clinical research efforts advance. When selecting clinical measures for PSS assessment (e.g., the Modified Ashworth, Tone Assessment, Tardieu, Modified Rankin, and Disability Assessment scales, and the Barthel Index), it is critical to understand the levels of impairment or functional limitation each tool assesses as well as their benefits and limitations. The use of quantitative methods — such as electrophysiologic, biomechanical, and imaging techniques — adjunctive to traditional clinical measures also allows for sensitivity in quantifying the abnormal muscle activity associated with spasticity. In addition to accurate evaluation and assessment of PSS, realistic treatment goal setting for patients as well as family members and caregivers is critical, because it promotes motivation and cooperation as well as proper management of expectations and can favorably affect recovery. Goal attainment scaling has been shown to help organize, focus, and clarify the aims of treatment, thereby enhancing the PSS rehabilitative process. Furthermore, integration of therapeutic modalities and treatment strategies, including both nonpharmacologic intervention and pharmacotherapy, is also important for improved outcomes.

### Intrinsic contracture of the hand: diagnosis and management [^115uPunG]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Intrinsic contracture of the hand may result from trauma, spasticity, ischemia, rheumatologic disorders, or iatrogenic causes. In severe cases, the hand assumes a posture with hyperflexed metacarpophalangeal joints and hyperextended proximal interphalangeal joints as the contracted interossei and lumbrical muscles deform the natural cascade of the fingers. Considerable disability may result because weakness in grip strength, difficulty with grasping larger objects, and troubles with maintenance of hygiene commonly encumber patients. Generally, the diagnosis is made via history and physical examination, but adjunctive imaging, rheumatologic testing, and electromyography may aid in determining the underlying cause or assessing the severity. Nonsurgical management may be appropriate in mild cases and consists of occupational therapy, orthoses, and botulinum toxin injections. The options for surgical management are diverse and dictated by the cause and severity of contracture.

Discussion

This e-Delphi survey generated expert opinions and consensus on items providing a provisional framework for the development of a contracture risk assessment tool (ORACLE) for adults in care homes.

This Delphi survey sought expert opinion and consensus on three aspects of the ORACLE: (1) Clinical factors that form the first part of ORACLE, (2) Preventive care approaches that form the second part of the ORACLE, and (3) Contextual factors that will be used to develop a guidance manual for ORACLE to improve its usability and practical implementation in a care home setting. Table 6 shows a list of finally agreed items for ORACLE by the study team.

Table 6.
Finally agreed items for Observational Risk Assessment Tool for Contractures: Longitudinal Evaluation (ORACLE).

The category, clinical factors encompassed factors associated with the development and progression of joint contractures. Of the total 15 items, ≥ 70% of panellists provided agreement on 10 items of which spasticity is one.

However, there was insufficient panel consensus regarding spasticity being recognisable by the care assistants, the aimed primary users of the tool in the care home. Spasticity is a commonly reported secondary complication following chronic neurological conditions (e.g. stroke) in care home residents. Identifying changes in muscle tone, including spasticity, requires physical and neurological examination by a trained practitioner; the primary care providers at the care home facilities might lack the appropriate training to recognise it; therefore, it was excluded from the final list of items for ORACLE. Interestingly, our systematic review also reported that the evidence on the relationship between spasticity and contractures remains unclear and inconclusive.

Poststroke spasticity — burden and epidemiology: Spasticity is correlated with activity limitations associated with hygiene, dressing, and pain, and these activity limitations increase caregiver burden and reduce quality of life; when spasticity is present, the cost of care is 4 times higher than when spasticity is absent; the prevalence of poststroke spasticity in any limb is in the range of 23% to 43% over the first year after stroke, and for patients who require acute rehabilitation after stroke, the prevalence of spasticity in any limb is 42%; the incidence of upper limb spasticity over the first 3 months in patients admitted to rehabilitation is 33%; and the strongest predictor of moderate to severe spasticity (Ashworth scale score ≥ 2) is severe proximal and distal limb weakness on acute hospital or rehabilitation admission.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^115i4iNp]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Consensus and grading framework for recommendations — The TEP used a modified Delphi process to evaluate the recommendation statements and achieve consensus both on the recommendation language and quality of evidence, and as a result of this consensus process, the TEP approved five recommendations for spasticity management and five best practices covering assessment and management of spasticity and issues with interventional procedures and postprocedural care. Table 1 summarizes best practice recommendations for spasticity assessment and management, while clinical recommendations are distinguished from best practices by requiring a structured review of evidence and an assessment or grading reflecting the quality of the evidence, and in the event a recommendation cannot be graded due to limitations of the evidence, the TEP can assign a rating of "NG". This consensus guidance statement is intended to reflect current practice in patient assessment and treatment options based on best available evidence and expert opinion, and the following AAPM&R Clinical Recommendations for Spasticity Management (Table 2) are based on a structured evidence review and grading of the evidence to achieve consensus on management approaches.

Introduction

Contractures, commonly defined as restrictions in the passive joint range, are preventable but debilitating consequence of prolonged immobility, eventually leading to structural abnormalities within the impacted joint. This can lead to further deterioration in the limb and joint flexibility and physical mobility, potentially leading to further physical impairments, decreased independence with everyday activities, and reduced quality of life. Contractures may vary from marginal restriction at a single joint to severe limitations in the range of motion affecting several joints simultaneously. Based on the severity of functional loss at a joint, contractures can be categorised as (i) severe, (ii) moderate or clinically relevant, or (iii) clinically non-relevant. The development of progressive joint contractures often follows an insidious pattern, and their initial progression is neither painful nor disabling. Joints only become painful when stretched beyond the point of soft-tissue restriction. For this reason, contractures are often unrecognised by individuals and their caregivers until they become clinically relevant, that is, start interfering with daily functional activities.

Evidence suggests that individuals living in long-term care facilities are predominantly sedentary; hence, they are at a higher risk of developing contractures. Long-term care settings demonstrate a considerable variation in the prevalence of contractures spanning from 22% to 75% in at least one joint.– Contracture prevalence was found to be higher in the upper extremities compared with the lower extremities, with the shoulder and knees being the most commonly affected joints. When considering the impact of mobility on contracture development, there is evidence that 70.5% of non-ambulatory care home residents developed a contracture compared with the ambulatory group, which developed none.

Structured risk assessments play an important role in referring patients to the appropriate healthcare practitioner and enacting early treatment strategies to reduce the risk of the condition progressing. In addition, standard risk assessments are also vital to offer appropriate guidance for risk protection and to have confidence in the tool being used. The need for a structured and systematic risk assessment of individuals at risk of developing contractures has been identified in the literature. Despite the reported high prevalence rates, there is a clear lack of a standard, evidence-based measure that can actively identify individuals at risk of developing contractures or worsening of existing contractures in long-term facilities and trigger appropriate and timely referrals to healthcare professionals.

### Can the early use of botulinum toxin in post stroke spasticity reduce contracture development? A randomised controlled trial [^115tuxse]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recovery of arm function in people who survive a stroke is commensurate with severity of impairment at stroke onset. Those people who have severe impairment of the arm at onset and who do not recover useful arm function, are likely to develop contractures. Contracture formation is exacerbated in those who have certain forms of spasticity. – It can therefore be hypothesised that the lack of movement (as a result of the paralysis) in addition to the fixed positioning (associated with some forms of spasticity) accelerate the formation of contractures.

Contractures are characterised by the combination of increased stiffness and loss of range of movement at a joint. Contractures can be established within four weeks of a stroke and 52% of stroke survivors have developed a contracture at six months. In some cases where motor recovery is delayed, it is possible that contractures could limit the recovery of meaningful function rather than the lack of neuro-plastic potential.

One way of slowing contracture development is through intensive mobilisation using cyclical electrical stimulation and this has been demonstrated previously in stroke patients at risk of wrist flexion contractures. The aim of this study was to explore if preventing the fixed positioning associated with spasticity (using additional treatment with botulinum toxin) could reduce both contractures and the rate at which contractures were formed. It was hypothesised that the reduction of spasticity and contractures would lead to a subsequent improvement in arm function. This study, therefore, also aimed to quantify changes in arm function following treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of abobotulinumtoxinA in spastic lower limb: randomized trial and extension [^116Zy7GL]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective:

To demonstrate single abobotulinumtoxinA injection efficacy in lower limb vs placebo for adults with chronic hemiparesis and assess long-term safety and efficacy of repeated injections.

Methods:

In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-cycle study followed by a 1-year open-label, multiple-cycle extension, adults ≥ 6 months after stroke/brain injury received one lower limb injection (abobotulinumtoxinA 1,000 U, abobotulinumtoxinA 1,500 U, placebo) followed by ≤ 4 open-label cycles (1,000, 1,500 U) at ≥ 12-week intervals. Efficacy measures included Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in gastrocnemius–soleus complex (GSC; double-blind primary endpoint), physician global assessment (PGA), and comfortable barefoot walking speed. Safety was the open-label primary endpoint.

Results:

After a single injection, mean (95% confidence interval) MAS GSC changes from baseline at week 4 (double-blind, n = 381) were as follows: −0.5 (−0.7 to −0.4) (placebo, n = 128), −0.6 (−0.8 to −0.5) (abobotulinumtoxinA 1,000 U, n = 125; p = 0.28 vs placebo), and −0.8 (−0.9 to −0.7) (abobotulinumtoxinA 1,500 U, n = 128; p = 0.009 vs placebo). Mean week 4 PGA scores were as follows: 0.7 (0.5, 0.9) (placebo), 0.9 (0.7, 1.1) (1,000 U; p = 0.067 vs placebo), and 0.9 (0.7, 1.1) (1,500 U; p = 0.067); walking speed was not significantly improved vs placebo. At cycle 4, week 4 (open-label), mean MAS GSC change reached −1.0. Incremental improvements in PGA and walking speed occurred across open-label cycles; by cycle 4, week 4, mean PGA was 1.9, and walking speed increased +25.3% (17.5, 33.2), with 16% of participants walking > 0.8 m/s (associated with community mobility; 0% at baseline). Tolerability was good and consistent with the known abobotulinumtoxinA safety profile.

Conclusions:

In chronic hemiparesis, single abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport Ipsen) administration reduced muscle tone. Repeated administration over a year was well-tolerated and improved walking speed and likelihood of achieving community ambulation.

Clinicaltrial.gov identifiers:

NCT01249404, NCT01251367.

Classification of evidence:

The double-blind phase of this study provides Class I evidence that for adults with chronic spastic hemiparesis, a single abobotulinumtoxinA injection reduces lower extremity muscle tone.

### Clinical outcome assessments for spasticity: review, critique, and recommendations [^115ricM8]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Selection

COAs that were used at least once in a sample of patients with spastic paresis (eg, after stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain trauma) were included only if they were clinician‐reported outcome (ClinRO) or patient‐reported outcome (PRO) measures designed to assess spasticity. A COA was qualified based on its stated intention to assess spasticity, its use of the term "spasticity", or its common application in clinical practice or research (eg, the Ashworth scales).

For PROs, however, strict compliance with the definition of spasticity posed challenges as patients may not report changes in their stretch reflexes. Instead, they often interpret "spasticity" as a combination of various forms of muscle overactivity or disorders, including spastic dystonia and spastic myopathy. Because these symptoms are interrelated, the authors decided to include them in the review with revised recommendation levels, as detailed in the subsequent section.

For composite COAs covering multiple constructs, some components had to focus on spasticity to be included. Electrophysiological assessments and assessments using technical devices were excluded. However, they were used for the assessment of validity of the selected COAs (see below). Additionally, COAs were excluded if they were unavailable in English; did not aim to measure spasticity but focused on other spasticity‐related domains such as pain, function, or QoL; were used only in animals; were unpublished, or completely lacked data on their measurement properties. Although the Wartenberg Pendulum Test lacked measurement property data, it was reviewed for its use in clinical practice.

### Outcome measurement in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and recommendations [^112DMGsC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to identify existing outcome measures for functional neurological disorder (FND), to inform the development of recommendations and to guide future research on FND outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to identify existing FND-specific outcome measures and the most common measurement domains and measures in previous treatment studies. Searches of Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were conducted between January 1965 and June 2019. The findings were discussed during two international meetings of the FND-Core Outcome Measures group.

Results

Five FND-specific measures were identified — three clinician-rated and two patient-rated — but their measurement properties have not been rigorously evaluated. No single measure was identified for use across the range of FND symptoms in adults. Across randomised controlled trials (k = 40) and observational treatment studies (k = 40), outcome measures most often assessed core FND symptom change. Other domains measured commonly were additional physical and psychological symptoms, life impact (ie, quality of life, disability and general functioning) and health economics/cost–utility (eg, healthcare resource use and quality-adjusted life years).

Conclusions

There are few well-validated FND-specific outcome measures. Thus, at present, we recommend that existing outcome measures, known to be reliable, valid and responsive in FND or closely related populations, are used to capture key outcome domains. Increased consistency in outcome measurement will facilitate comparison of treatment effects across FND symptom types and treatment modalities. Future work needs to more rigorously validate outcome measures used in this population.

### Measuring neurological severity and complexity in acute setting: the modified neurological impairment scale [^111JoFEH]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In medicine, standardised assessments with broad applicability and consistency can be instrumental in defining the severity of conditions, tracking clinical progress and gauging response to treatments. In neurology, the progressive high degree of sub-specialisation has led to the development of numerous condition-specific scales, each validated within narrow diagnostic frameworks. As a result, neurological assessments are tailored to suit diagnostic categories and clinical scenarios, catering to contexts that range from acute cerebrovascular incidents to chronic evaluation of patients with inflammatory, neurodegenerative or neuromuscular disorders. In addition to this, functional rating scales typically assess the ability of patients to perform tasks and roles in everyday life and must be valid, reliable and responsive. Functional rating scales can be useful tools in clinical settings (eg, acute inpatient evaluation, chronic outpatient follow-up evaluation) and clinical trials, potentially serving as additional outcome measures.

Given the growing heterogeneity of neurological patients in both acute and chronic care settings, there is a pressing need for a standardised scoring system capable of capturing the overall neurological status, beyond diagnostic subfields. A unified tool that reflects a general neurological evaluation would allow for more meaningful comparisons across healthcare services, clinical programmes and diverse patient populations. Moreover, such an instrument would support the identification of patient vulnerabilities and help guide the implementation and tracking of personalised care and targeted therapeutic strategies.

One of the most commonly used rating scales in acute neurology and cerebrovascular disease is the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), developed for stratifying clinical stroke severity. Since its development, the NIHSS has become a key tool in emergency departments and has been used as a standardised outcome measure in ischaemic stroke trials. It was established that the bedside assessment of NIHSS required a mean time of 6.55 min (range 4–12 min) and the remote assessment via telemedicine required a mean time of 9.70 min (range 6–18 min). However, the NIHSS is not applicable across a broader range of acute, subacute and chronic neurological conditions, and focuses mainly on left hemispheric lesions (eg, language impairment).

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111mTg1D]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation — Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) should undergo careful assessment for a coexistent unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Early treatment is generally indicated for patients presenting with cranial nerve palsy caused by a UIA (Class I; Level of Evidence C). The effectiveness of the routine treatment of UIAs for the prevention of ischemic cerebrovascular disease is uncertain (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C).

### Clinical scales for the assessment of spasticity, associated phenomena, and function: a systematic review of the literature [^115PJiFS]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To characterise clinical assessment methods for spasticity and/or its functional consequences in clinical patient populations at risk to suffer from spasticity.

Method

Systematic literature search and manual-based two-step review process of psychometric properties of clinical assessment scales for spasticity and associated phenomena, as well as of functional scales with an association with spasticity. Reviewed psychometric properties included internal consistency, interrater, intrarater as well as retest reliability, construct validity, ecological validity, and responsiveness.

Results

Until May 2003 electronic database searches established a reference pool of 4151 references of which 90 references contributed to the review objectives. An additional 20 references were identified by an informal reference search. Twenty-four clinical scales that assess spasticity and/or related phenomena as well as 10 scales for 'active function' and three scales for 'passive function' with an association with spasticity could be identified. Some evidence signals that a high interrater reliability of the Ashworth and modified Ashworth scales can be achieved, however not in all circumstances. For many scales, reliability data is, however, missing. This is especially true for test retest reliability. Information about construct validity can promote our understanding of what individual scales are likely to assess. Many scales have been able to document changes after therapeutic intervention.

Conclusions

The collated evidence can guide our clinical decision about when to use which scale and can promote evidence-based assessment of spasticity and related clinical phenomena.

Implementation stance for ICU-acquired weakness — In the absence of clarity, the authors state they are unable to explicitly advocate for a systematic identification approach; instead, ICU clinicians can only leverage evidence for early rehabilitation in broadly defined critically ill patients to prevent or ameliorate disability. They add that this process can and should be revised once more rigorous intervention and diagnostic comparison studies are available, and note that while standard case identification can quantify the problem and focus limited resources, true benefit needs to be proven first.

### Assessing competency in spasticity management: a method of development and assessment [^116fssiH]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

This project endeavored to create an educational module including methodology to instruct physical medicine and rehabilitation residents in the evaluation and appropriate treatment of patients with spasticity and other sequelae of the upper motor neuron syndrome. It further sought to verify acquired competencies in spasticity management through objective evaluation methodology. A physical medicine and rehabilitation board-certified physician with 10 yrs clinical experience in spasticity management trained 16 residents using a standardized competency-based module. Assessment tools developed for this program address the basic competencies outlined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. The 16 residents successfully demonstrated proficiency in every segment of the evaluation module by the end of the Postgraduate Year 3 spasticity management rotation. Objective measures compared resident scores on an institution-specific standardized test administered before and after training. Resident proficiency in the skills and knowledge pertaining to spasticity management was objectively verified after completion of the standardized educational module. Validation of the assessment tool is evidenced by significantly improved postrotational institution-specific standardized test scores (mean pretest score, 61.1%; mean posttest score, 95.4%) as well as oral testing. In addition, the clinical development tool was validated by residents being individually observed performing skills and deemed competent by a board-certified physical medicine and rehabilitation physician specializing in spasticity management. The standardized educational module and evaluation methodology provide a potential framework for the definition of baseline competency in the clinical skill area of spasticity management.

### Assessing the spastic condition of individuals with upper motoneuron involvement: validity of the myotonometer [^116RhkHC]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the validity of a newly developed tissue compliance device to measure muscle tone and to quantify the level of severity of the spastic condition.

Design

Validity study.

Setting

Research laboratory.

Participants

Twenty subjects, 10 with upper motoneuron (UMN) disorders (spastic-type cerebral palsy or adult-onset cerebrovascular accident) who comprised the experimental group; and 10 nondisabled, age-equivalent subjects, who served as controls.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Muscle tone of the biceps brachii muscle was assessed with the Myotonometer and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The Myotonometer was used to quantify the muscle's resistance to stretch in a relaxed state and during maximal voluntary isometric contractions. Analyses of variance determined differences among subjects. Correlations between Myotonometer measurements and MAS scores were calculated.

Results

Significant differences (p < .05) were observed between experimental and control groups and between the involved and uninvolved extremities of the experimental group with Myotonometer measurements. Correlations between MAS scores and Myotonometer measurements ranged from .64 to .81.

Conclusion

The Myotonometer effectively identified differences in the spastic condition of the biceps brachii muscle in subjects with UMN involvement. Correlations with the MAS were moderate to high.

### Electrophysiological findings in SH3TC2 neuropathy mimicking inflammatory neuropathies [^1128UtRs]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Biallelic SH3TC2 variants lead to autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4C (CMT4C) which is typically demyelinating and associated with early-onset spinal deformities. Electrophysiology typically reveals a non-uniform conduction velocity (CV) slowing, a pattern traditionally linked to inflammatory neuropathies, potentially leading to diagnostic misinterpretation.

Objective and Methods

Clinical and neurophysiological data from 19 patients belonging to 16 unrelated families with confirmed CMT4C were retrospectively collected across six neuromuscular reference centres in Brazil.

Results

Among the 19 patients, consanguineous parentage was found in 11 patients. Most patients exhibited symptom onset before age 10, and difficulty walking was the most common presenting symptom. A high rate of initial misdiagnosis was noted, with six patients initially diagnosed as inflammatory neuropathy. Proximal muscle weakness since initial assessment, present in 13 patients, and non-uniform CV slowing, present in all patients, contributed to this diagnostic misinterpretation.

Conclusion

This is the largest Brazilian cohort of patients with CMT4C to date. Key findings include frequent non-uniform CV slowing, excessive temporal dispersion and a high rate of misdiagnosis, often as acquired demyelinating neuropathy. Clinicians should be aware of the distinctive neurophysiological pattern of SH3TC2-related neuropathy to avoid misdiagnosis, unnecessary ancillary tests and treatment.

### Effects of repeated abobotulinumtoxinA injections in upper limb spasticity [^1142z1sE]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objectives and Assessments

The primary objective was to assess safety of repeated abobotulinumtoxinA treatment cycles over 1 year in hemiparetic patients with upper limb spasticity post‐stroke or ‐TBI. Treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) were elicited by direct, non‐leading questioning or spontaneous reports from study consent to study end. Other safety parameters were vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate), laboratory data, electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, and binding and neutralizing antibody analysis.

Secondary objectives were assessment of efficacy of repeated abobotulinumtoxinA treatment over 1 year on:
Muscle tone (MAS) for finger, wrist, and elbow flexors, and shoulder extensors.
Steps 2, 3, and 4 of the Five‐Step Assessment [including the Tardieu Scale with passive range of motion (X V1) and angle of catch (X V3), as well as active range of motion (X A); see below], 27 for finger, wrist, and elbow flexors; in shoulder extensors only X V1 and X V3 were assessed.
Perceived function and pain [Disability Assessment Scale (DAS)]. 28
Active upper limb function [Modified Frenchay Scale (MFS)] 29, 30 rated by assessors independent of the study.
Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of treatment response, assessed using a 9‐point scale from –4 (markedly worse) to 4 (markedly improved) and rated by an assessor other than the MAS assessor.
Patient‐reported ease of applying splint. 31

### Clinical outcome assessments for spasticity: review, critique, and recommendations [^114qVoex]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Terminology table: for further details, see Baude et al.

However, the reality of the commonly used "spasticity" COAs parallels the term's ambiguity. Currently, the most widely used assessment tool is the Ashworth Scale (AS) or its modified version (MAS), which rather quantifies general resistance to passive stretch at rest (ie, muscle tone,) velocity‐dependence of the stretch‐reflexes. Nevertheless, it has often been considered the gold standard of "spasticity" assessment, particularly by regulatory agencies, which has confused several spasticity‐related fields, especially when aiming to validate pharmacological, (neuro)surgical, and rehabilitation treatments. Thus, the main goals of this review were to evaluate COAs aiming to assess spasticity, to critically appraise them from the viewpoint of the concept of deforming spastic paresis, and to make recommendations regarding their use based on highly standardized MDS COA methodology.

### Brain regions important for recovery after severe post-stroke upper limb paresis [^116c7A5m]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Experimental design

Patients with stroke provided full written consent to take part in this study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Joint Ethics Committee of the Institute of Neurology, University College London (UCL) and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, London. Patients were recruited from the Sobell Stroke Database. This database comprises first time adult stroke patients presenting with some level of motor impairment who have consented to be contacted about participating in research studies.

The database was screened for patients with severe initial upper limb impairment following first and only stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) as assessed using the SAFE score, which used the Medical Research Council scale to grade shoulder abduction (SA) and finger extension (FE) on a scale of 0–5. Patients were eligible for this study if they had a SAFE score of 0 (no muscle activity) at 72 hours poststroke irrespective of whether reperfusion therapy was administered or not. The SAFE score was recorded in the medical notes (UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) within 72 hours of stroke onset in all cases.

In this study, we required two further pieces of information on each patient: (1) upper limb function in the chronic stage of stroke (at least 6 months since stroke); (2) T1-weighted structural whole brain MRI, which in these patients had been performed at the time of chronic upper limb function being scored. These data would allow us to retrospectively determine the extent of recovery (not just clinical outcome) in each individual.

Upper limb motor impairment in the chronic stage was assessed using four tests: Action Research Arm Test, grip strength, Motricity Index and Nine-Hole Peg Test. A single representative measure was calculated using principal component analysis (PCA) of the four motor scales to account for floor and ceiling effects in individual scores. PCA is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that converts the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate and so on. Patients were ranked according to the first principle component of the PCA. The top 40% and the bottom 40% of patients were then included as good and poor recoverers, respectively. The middle 20% were excluded to ensure that we were investigating two groups of patients with clearly distinct recovery profiles, despite all presenting with the same level of initial severity.

For patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC), treating the medical, neurologic, and neuromuscular complications not only stabilizes their medical disturbances, but minimizes confounding factors that may obscure the ability to accurately identify the level of consciousness and increase the chance of patients' neurologic and functional recovery. Lack of reliable communication and low-level function of patients with DoC make it challenging to diagnose some of the complications. Skilled clinical observation will be imperative to appropriately care for the patients.

### Outcome measurement in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and recommendations [^111Hqe9S]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is a need for greater consistency in outcome measurement in FND research. At present, we recommend an interim set of outcome measures to routinely assess core outcome domains, including core FND symptom change, other physical and psychological symptoms, life impact, health economics/cost–utility and adverse events. These recommendations could be supplemented with additional measures as appropriate to individual studies. Further research is needed to provide more extensive psychometric evaluation of outcome measures for FND and to explore the views of patients, carers and other stakeholders on optimising outcome measurement in this disorder.

### The Delphi of ORACLE: an expert consensus survey for the development of the observational risk assessment of contractures (longitudinal evaluation) [^116PTV3G]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

The category, preventive care approaches included approaches important in preventing contracture development and progression. This forms the second part of ORACLE, which provides guidance to the care home staff to prescribe a set of actions in response to the level of risk identified in the first part. The panel demonstrated a high level of consensus for 9 out of 10 care approaches. The only care approach which failed to reach adequate panel consensus was 'performing passive exercises'. Passive exercises are a common intervention for individuals at risk of developing contractures. When asked by the panellists about the reasoning behind their choice, a few stated that there is insufficient evidence to support its effectiveness in preventing contractures. The panel views are consistent with the findings of a systematic Cochrane review which provides inconclusive evidence of passive movements as an effective treatment approach to prevent or manage contractures. Moreover, a recent systematic review that investigated nonsurgical treatment options for muscle contractures in neurological disorders could not provide convincing evidence for using passive movements. Therefore, 'passive exercises' were excluded from the final list of items. Contrastingly, panellists provided consensus in favour of stretching; however, recent systematic reviews have substantiated that stretching did not produce clinically important short-term effects on joint mobility. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of stretching on joint mobility and the prevention of contractures. Given this contradiction, the study team suggested that it was not appropriate to recommend that non-physiotherapeutic staff engages in the application of stretching exercises on their own; therefore, it was also excluded.

While contextual factors are not included in the tool, they are relevant to its successful implementation. The internal quality of an intervention is only one factor in its effectiveness, which will also depend upon the intervention's interaction with the environment in which it has been introduced and upon the responses of the actors involved. This is especially the case in complex environments such as care homes. A growing body of evidence supports the need for context-specific research studies to successfully implement complex interventions. A recent systematic review by Peryer et al.has reported that several large-scale studies evaluating complex interventions in care homes have demonstrated inconclusive or neutral findings. It is unclear whether the findings are linked solely to the ineffective interventions or contextual barriers around their implementation. The contextual mechanisms identified by the panellists in this study will be included in the ORACLE guidance manual with a view to mitigating their inhibitive effects on the effectiveness of the tool. Panellists provided agreement on 12 out of 13 contextual factors.

### How Do fugl-meyer arm motor scores relate to dexterity according to the action research arm test at 6 months poststroke? [^116svU1x]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the optimal cutoff scores for the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) with regard to predicting no, poor, limited, notable, or full upper-limb capacity according to frequently used cutoff points for the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) at 6 months poststroke.

Design

Prospective.

Setting

Rehabilitation center.

Participants

Patients (N = 460) with a first-ever ischemic stroke at 6 months poststroke.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Based on the ARAT classification of poor to full upper-limb capacity, receiver operating characteristic curves were used to calculate the area under the curve, optimal cutoff points for the FMA-UE were determined, and a weighted kappa was used to assess the agreement.

Results

FMA-UE scores of 0 through 22 represent no upper-limb capacity (ARAT 0–10); scores of 23 through 31 represent poor capacity (ARAT 11–21); scores of 32 through 47 represent limited capacity (ARAT 22–42); scores of 48 through 52 represent notable capacity (ARAT 43–54); and scores of 53 through 66 represent full upper-limb capacity (ARAT 55–57). Overall, areas under the curve ranged from .916 (95% confidence interval, .890-.943) to .988 (95% CI, .978-.998; P < .001).

Conclusions

There is considerable overlap in the area under the curve between the ARAT and FMA-UE. FMA-UE scores > 31 points correspond to no to poor arm-hand capacity (ie, ≤ 21 points) on the ARAT, whereas FMA-UE scores > 31 correspond to limited to full arm-hand capacity (ie, ≥ 22 points) on the ARAT.

### Clinical outcome assessments for spasticity: review, critique, and recommendations [^113Qssqx]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the speed of the stretch, the Ashworth‐derived COAs and some studies using the original AS erroneously address it by fixing the time of the stretch to 1 second, instead of fixing the speed. Because, however, the available ROM and the resistance one encounters markedly differ for various muscles, the speed of stretch will vary between them. Thus, if spasticity is defined as a velocity‐related phenomenon, the ability of the AS/REPAS/MAS/MMAS to detect spasticity will vary in different segments. In addition, ROM is commonly limited by contractures in patients with chronic deforming spastic paresis. Therefore, even in segments with a physiologically large ROM where the AS/REPAS/MAS/MMAS might theoretically stretch fast enough to elicit some spastic response, in clinical practice this is usually not the case because those muscles are shortened, which in turn — due to the 1‐second instruction — leads to a decrease in the speed of the stretch. Also, because the contrast between passive ROM using a slow and a fast stretch is not considered, the Ashworth‐derived COAs mix contracture with "spasticity".

Thus, although they are valid measures of muscle tone, the validity of AS and AS‐derived COAs could not be considered good for spasticity. Regarding other measurement properties, the reliability was rated as good only in the cases of REPAS and MMAS; however, these conclusions should be treated with caution as they are derived from scarce data. Only responsiveness can be considered good in the cases of the AS, MAS, MMAS, and REPAS.

In conclusion, the expert panel recommends using the TS for spasticity assessment optimally within the framework of the FSA. Future efforts should focus on publishing official muscle‐by‐muscle assessment guidelines and potentially also on developing web‐based training to achieve standardized practices. Additionally, a further review — already commissioned by the MDS COA‐SEC — should address the pressing need to evaluate functional COAs in patients with spastic paresis. The authors of this review urge clinicians and researchers to use the TS and adopt the terminology described within the framework of deforming spastic paresis. This approach could enhance understanding of the efficacy of various (non‐)pharmacological treatments and address current research questions, such as the recurrence of "spasticity" following various neurosurgical procedures.

### Clinical outcome assessments for spasticity: review, critique, and recommendations [^113Moxkg]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The exclusion of some of the scales after evaluation requires an explanation, especially in the case of the Ashworth scales — that is, AS, REsistance to PASsive movement (REPAS), MAS, Modified MAS (MMAS), Peacock‐Staudt Modified (Modified) Ashworth Scale (PS‐M(M)AS), and Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS). Then again, this may not be surprising because Ashworth himself stopped short of claiming that his COA was measuring "spasticity" in his original publication. Indeed, the Ashworth Scales rate a superordinate construct, that is, muscle tone defined as resistance to passive movement, and not spasticity, which can be assessed only using at least two velocities of stretch as it is defined as an enhancement of the velocity‐dependent stretch reflexes. Besides failing to specify the speed of the passive stretch performed by the examiner, Ashworth remained silent about the starting position of the movement — which will also impact the reference range of motion (ROM) and the moment of perceiving the first abnormal resistance — and the end of the actual ROM for which the first point of abnormal resistance should be evaluated. In effect, was this the full theoretical range of the joint involved or the practically available range left by contracture? Of these three missing pieces of information, only speed and onset of range are occasionally considered an issue by some of the later authors who produced the Ashworth‐derived COAs. These shortcomings led to rating the feasibility as not good in the case of the AS, MAS, PS‐M(M)AS, and SPRS items 7 and 8.

### Estimating the cost consequence of the early use of botulinum toxin in post-stroke spasticity: secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial [^115s5rda]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have previously demonstrated that the early use of botulinum toxin reduced spasticity and contractures after stroke and that the effects lasted for approximately 12 weeks. In this study, we have demonstrated that the additional treatment with botulinum toxin does not lead to an increase in cost associated with managing these patients.

This indicates that the early use of botulinum toxin for post-stroke spasticity can be cost-saving to the NHS when assessed in terms of gain in the activity of daily living (Barthel Index) and arm function (total Action Research Arm Test). This result contrasts with previously reported cost-effectiveness data that suggested that the base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for botulinum toxin type A plus therapy was £93,500. However, it is possible that the magnitude of difference can be explained by the differences in the two studies:
The previous study measured response to treatment using the Modified Ashworth Score (an invalidated measure of spasticity), which has previously been shown to underestimate treatment effects.
The previous study treatment was initiated in patients who are likely to have established spasticity and/or contractures (mean time to treatment 46 weeks post-stroke). This contrasts with the current study where treatment was initiated in patients who presented with spasticity prior to contractures being established (mean time to treatment 14 days post-stroke).
The previous study primarily focused on improving function using a combination of therapy and botulinum toxinand in the current study, the primary focus was to prevent contractures.
In the current study, all patients had an Action Research Arm Test of 0 to 2 at injection, whereas in the previous study 45% of the participants had an Action Research Arm Test > 3.

### Clinical outcome assessments in encephalitis: a systematic review [^113GV63r]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Encephalitis is a collective term for inflammation of the brain, caused by infectious agents or autoimmunity. The inflammation can affect preferred locations in the brain or have a more diffuse impact, depending on the etiology. As a result, a range of symptoms may persist after diagnosis and treatment. The most important being seizures, deficits in memory, concentration, and speech, and emotional and behavioral changes. The often-reported high chances of good prognosis are often based on generic, aspecific clinical outcome assessments. Approximately two-thirds of patients with encephalitis will not fully recover within 2 years of diagnosis, when assessed with detailed cognitive assessments. Even this may be an underestimation because patient-reported outcomes (i.e. quality of life) do not always correlate to objective cognitive outcomes.

A recent systematic literature review on clinical outcome assessment tools applied in encephalitisdescribes well-known scales including the modified Rankin scale (mRS), the Glasgow outcome score (GOS), and the Barthel index, all originally developed in patients with other neurologic diseases. The most often applied mRS was originally developed for stroke patients. e1 The mRS is a clinician-reported outcome assessment, which categorizes patients from zero — no symptoms — to 6 — death, with different levels of disability. Although easily applicable and relevant for stroke patients, it does not capture the range of potential sequelae of encephalitis (or other types of brain injury). More recently, disease-specific clinical outcome assessments have been developed for patients with encephalitis including the Liverpool Outcome Score (LOS), which is a combination tool scored by clinician reports and patient reports. Another disease-specific clinician-reported outcome assessment for encephalitis is the Clinical Assessment Scale for Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). This tool captures the potential sequelae of encephalitis with more detail than the mRS, especially in the acute phase. Although it has good discriminative ability in the acute phase/severely affected patients, the applicability for long-term and more subtle sequelae is limited.

### Outcome measurement in neurological disease [^112cnjWi]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent publications have focused on the possibilities that neuroscience offers patients in terms of restoring neurological function after trauma or disease. This review highlights the contribution that sophisticated outcome measurement techniques can make to the accurate evaluation of these.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have focused on the role of patient-reported outcomes and their importance in the design of trials to evaluate interventions. Work is focusing on developing banks of measurement items that can be accessed using computers. Algorithms then minimize the number of items that need to be answered by an individual before an accurate measure is obtained, which can be accessed by patients.

Summary

Patient-reported outcomes, item banking, and computerized adaptive testing have the potential to change the way we evaluate outcome, placing individualized testing and meaningful outcome at the heart of both research and clinical care.

### Determining levels of upper extremity movement impairment by applying a cluster analysis to the fugl-meyer assessment of the upper extremity in chronic stroke [^114cJbxp]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantitatively determine levels of upper extremity movement impairment by using a cluster analysis of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) with and without reflex items.

Design

Secondary analysis.

Setting

University and research centers.

Participants

Individuals (N = 247) with chronic stroke (> 6mo poststroke).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Cutoff scores defined by FMA-UE total scores of clusters identified by 2 hierarchical cluster analyses performed on the full sample of FMA-UE individual item scores (with and without reflexes). Patterns of motor function defined by aggregate item scores of clusters.

Results

FMA-UE scores ranged from 2 to 63 (mean, 26.9 ± 15.7) with reflex items and from 0 to 57 (mean, 22.1 ± 15.3) without reflex items. Three clusters were identified. The distributions of the FMA-UE scores revealed considerable overlap between the clusters; therefore, 4 distinct stroke impairment levels were derived.

Conclusions

For chronic stroke, the cluster analysis of the FMA-UE supports either a 3- or a 4-impairment level classification scheme.

Development of joint contractures

Table 3 presents the panellists' agreement levels regarding the importance of clinical factors associated with the development of joint contractures during each round. During the first round, 9 out of 12 items met consensus for inclusion in the core set which were: bed confinement, clonus, dystonia, impaired cognition, muscle weakness, pain, spasticity, physical function, and functional mobility. Of these 9 items, overall levels of agreement ranged between 70% and 100%. Items on which the panel consensus was below the 70% threshold in the first round were: (1) ageing, (2) pressure ulcers, and (3) urinary incontinence.

Table 3.
Agreement levels on clinical factors.

Suggested items: The newly suggested items by the panellists in the first round: (1) postural asymmetry, (2) inability to engage in activities, and (3) hypertonia, were included in the second round.

In the second round, the panellists reviewed their responses in the context of the average group responses in areas of disagreement (≤ 70%) and rated the importance of newly suggested items. Pressure ulcers reached consensus (agreement level of 76%), while ageing and urinary incontinence still failed to reach the agreement threshold (< 70%). Among the newly suggested items, inability to engage in activities and hypertonia reached an agreement level of > 70% while postural asymmetry did not reach the required consensus level (68%).

Progression of joint contractures

Table 3 presents the panellists' agreement levels regarding the importance of clinical factors associated with the progression of joint contractures during each round. The first round identified consensus for 10 out of 12 items. Of these, four items, including bed confinement, muscle weakness, pain, and reduced functional mobility, reached 100% agreement. On the other hand, items on which the panel consensus was below the 70% threshold were: (1) pressure ulcers and (2) urinary incontinence.

Suggested items: The newly suggested items by the panellists in the first round, (1) postural asymmetry, (2) inability to engage in activities, and (3) hypertonia were included in the second round.

In the second round, consensus was reached for pressure ulcers (84%), whereas urinary incontinence fell short of the agreement threshold (< 70%). Among the newly proposed items, inability to engage in activities and hypertonia reached an agreement level of over 70% while postural asymmetry did not reach the required consensus level (64%).

### Comparison of the action research arm test and the fugl-meyer assessment as measures of upper-extremity motor weakness after stroke [^113dsASq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relative responsiveness of 2 commonly used upper-extremity motor scales, the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), in evaluating recovery of upper-extremity function after an acute stroke in patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation.

Design

Prospective.

Setting

An acute stroke rehabilitation unit.

Participants

One hundred four consecutive admissions (43 men, 61 women; mean age ± standard deviation, 72 ± 13y) to a rehabilitation unit 16 ± 9 days after acute stroke.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

The following assessments were completed within 72 hours of admission and 24 hours before discharge: ARAT, upper-extremity motor domain of the FMA, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, FIM instrument total score, and FIM activities of daily living (FIM-ADL) subscore.

Results

The Spearman rank correlation statistic indicated that the 2 upper-limb motor scales (ARAT, FMA) correlated highly with one another, both on admission (rho = .77, P < .001) and on discharge (rho = .87, P < .001). The mean change in score from admission to discharge was 10 ± 15 for the ARAT and 10 ± 13 for the FMA motor score. The responsiveness to change as measured by the standard response mean was .68 for the ARAT and .74 for the FMA motor score. The Spearman rank correlation of each upper-limb motor scale with the FIM-ADL at the time of admission was as follows: ARAT, rho equal to .32 (P < .001) and FMA motor score, rho equal to .54 (P < .001).

Conclusions

Both the FMA motor score and the ARAT were equally sensitive to change during inpatient acute rehabilitation and could be routinely used to measure recovery of upper-extremity motor function.

### Illness weakness, polyneuropathy and myopathy: diagnosis, treatment, and long-term outcomes [^112KBWwW]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

In the ICU

CIW presents as a symmetrical muscle weakness arising after the onset of a critical illness, affecting the limbs and the respiratory muscles, and sparing the facial muscles. There is no agreement as to whether diaphragm weakness (DW) should be considered an integral part of the syndrome or a separate entity. Historically, the coexistence of limb weakness and DW was considered the typical presentation of the syndrome. However, DW is poorly correlated with CIW, suggesting that CIW and DW might be distinct entities. The concept of respiratory muscle weakness has further expanded in recent years to involve extra-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles and expiratory muscles weakness, in addition to DW. Respiratory muscle weakness is associated with weaning failure, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and, if present at ICU discharge, increased risk of in-hospital mortality, ICU and hospital readmission and worse physical function and quality of life at long-term evaluation.

CIW is a diagnosis of exclusion when generalized and symmetrical limb weakness after ICU admission develops in the absence of other etiology. These features are important to distinguish CIW from Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, acute myopathies and neuropathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, drug overdose, envenomation and other conditions that may cause acute neuromuscular respiratory failure. Differential diagnosis is usually obvious, as these conditions are typically a cause of ICU admission, and not a complication of critical illness during ICU stay. Conversely, CIW is commonly diagnosed in patients with persisting critical illness who have normal muscle strength at ICU admission: among patients still in the ICU on day 8 after admission, the incidence of CIW is higher than 50%. Some neuromuscular diseases may have an acute onset, and some chronic conditions may have sudden exacerbations, thereby presenting with acute respiratory failure. These cases represent a diagnostic challenge, because limb weakness becomes apparent when the acute phase of respiratory failure has resolved and patients are weaned off sedatives, thus posing the problem of whether the weakness is pre-existing upon admission to the ICU or developed during the ICU stay. If the etiological diagnosis is not clear at ICU admission, differential diagnosis requires meticulous attention to neurological signs (i.e. weakness of eye muscles with ptosis and ocular palsy in myasthenia gravis; asymmetrical distribution of muscle weakness such as hemiparesis in acute ischemic stroke; poorly reactive dilated pupils as in botulin intoxication; autonomic signs, such as cardiac arrhythmias or blood pressure fluctuations as in Guillain-Barré syndrome) and specialized neurophysiological investigations.

### Clinical assessment in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and the development of disease activity and damage tools [^114yF4SG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the past few years, adult and pediatric experts in the field have combined their skills to achieve major advances in clinical research on pediatric inflammatory myopathies. As rare diseases, it has become recognized that international trials are needed to assess drug treatments and their long-term sequelae. Tools for assessing specific aspects of disease are available and have been studied to better understand their performance strengths and limitations. These tools have been incorporated into disease activity and damage scores that have been developed by international consensus and are now being evaluated.

Recent Findings

This review focuses on the tools whose evaluations have been published in the past year and includes methods to assess muscle strength and function in children with myositis. Two international collaborative efforts have focused on disease activity and damage assessments, and their findings are discussed. Some papers highlighting further diagnostic investigations are also reviewed.

Summary

The standardization of assessment tools has enormous implications for future clinical practice: (1) Clinicians who are not experienced in these rare disorders will be able to evaluate their patients appropriately and highlight important clinical signs that are of prognostic importance. (2) International drug trials can be undertaken and thus improve our understanding of the impact of medication on the disease process. (3) Follow-up studies can be undertaken with sufficient numbers of patients to answer questions about the long-term sequelae of the disease and its treatments.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design of the original trial

Thirty chronic stroke patients took part in the original study (Ramos‐Murguialday et al. 2013). They presented no active finger extension due to their severe motor impairment, as measured by the modified upper limb Fugl‐Meyer Assessment (FMA; Table 1). Apart from the complete paralysis of one hand, the inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 80 years, at least 8 months since the insult, no psychiatric or neurological condition other than stroke, no cerebellar lesion or bilateral motor deficit, no epilepsy and a mini‐mental state (MMS) score of above 21. The patients were recruited publicly via stroke associations, rehabilitation centers and hospitals within Germany from December 2007 to March 2013. 504 patients were contacted, out of which 263 did not meet the inclusion criteria, 202 declined to participate and 9 were excluded because of other reasons, leading to a final pool of 30 patients. This number met the criteria for statistical power calculated in study using a similar technique (Buch et al. 2008). Half of the patients showed lesions with involvement of the motor cortex ("mixed" lesion type), the others presented subcortical lesions only ("subcortical" lesion type). The primary clinical outcome measure of the original trial was the combined modified Fugl‐Meyer assessment (cFMA). It comprises the sum of the arm and hand scores excluding scores related to coordination, speed and reflexes. The maximum score is 54 points. Details on the movements assessed in the cFMA test are presented in Supporting Information, section 5. The assessment was administered at the post test and two tests prior to the intervention. The mean of both baseline FMAs was used to calculate the difference between the values before and after the intervention.

Recommendations

A patient who had a stroke should be kept on the bed in a normal limb position. Lateral position on the affected side is recommended (Grade I recommendation, Level C evidence).
It is reasonable that normal limb position can effectively reduce limb spasticity and improve the rehabilitation outcomes (Grade IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
Transfer training should be performed with patients who had a stroke on-bed with the help of attendant or rehabilitation therapist as soon as possible (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Range of motion training is recommended for patients who had a stroke on-bed, and mechanical injury of the affected limbs should be avoided (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Transferring and range of motion training is reasonable to implement as early as possible and could prevent complications, such as hypostatic pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and bedsores (Grade IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
When clinically stable, patients with acute stroke with paralysis should get out of the bed as soon as possible, and start training standing and walking (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
In the acute stroke phase, the muscle strength training for the paralysed limbs should be emphasised (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Functional electrical stimulation and electromyography biofeedback for the corresponding muscles, combined with conventional rehabilitation, can improve the muscle strength and the function of paralysed limbs (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
It is reasonable for patients who had a stroke with hemiplegia to train standing and walking actively to regain basic walking ability as soon as possible (Grade IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
Analysis of the hemiplegic gait with an integrative gait analysis system is an effective way to make an elaborate walking programme and improve the quality of walking (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Lower-limb robots, weight-supporting devices and orthoses is reasonable to assist with walking recovery (Grade IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
The Modified Ashworth Scale and Modified Tardieu Scale are recommended for the evaluation of spasticity (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Although the electromyography operation is time consuming and complicated, it may lead to some advantages (Grade IIb recommendation, Level B evidence).
The principle of post-stroke spasticity treatment is to improve functional ability (Grade I recommendation, Level C evidence).
Normal limb position, passive stretching, range of motion training and Chinese medical massages are recommended to alleviate spasticity (Class I recommendation, Level C evidence).
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and local muscle vibration therapy are recommended (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Oral medications, including eperisone, baclofen and tizanidine, are recommended, and local botulinum toxin injection is recommended for local muscle spasm after stroke (Grade I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Combined transcranial direct current stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with conventional physiotherapy is reasonable to relieve spasticity (Grade IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
It is reasonable that acupuncture used selectively in combination with clinical practice in spasticity after stroke (Grade IIa recommendation, Class B evidence).

### Inter-and intrarater reliability of the ashworth scale and the disability assessment scale in patients with upper-limb poststroke spasticity [^115N7JFD]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the reliability of the Ashworth Scale and the Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) in poststroke patients with upper-limb spasticity and functional disability.

Design

Single-center trial.

Setting

University medical center.

Participants

Nine patients ≥ 6 months poststroke with upper-limb spasticity and impairment in the areas of hygiene, dressing, limb posture, or pain were included in the analysis.

Interventions

Ten experienced medical professionals rated each patient in randomized order twice on the same day (results based on mean of evaluations at times 1 and 2). Elbow, wrist, finger, and thumb flexion tones were assessed by using the Ashworth score (range, 0–4), and functional disability was assessed using the DAS (range, 0–3).

Main Outcome Measures

Intra- and interrater reliability of the Ashworth Scale and DAS.

Results

For the Ashworth parameters, 38 of 40 evaluations indicated excellent (weighted kappa ≥ .75) or good (weighted kappa ≥ .4) intrarater reliability. For DAS parameters, 31 of 40 evaluations indicated excellent or good intrarater reliability. The interrater reliability was also good for both the Ashworth Scale (Kendall W = .598-.792) and DAS (Kendall W = .494-.772) with statistically significant agreement found among raters (all P < .001).

Conclusions

In patients with upper-limb spasticity after stroke, the Ashworth Scale and DAS had good intra- and interrater reliability when used by trained medical professions.

### Acute brain lesions associated with DNS in carbon monoxide poisoning… [^1173fDMz]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful for identifying acute brain lesions in patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning and patients at risk of developing delayed neurological sequelae. Importance Preventing delayed neurological sequelae is a major goal of treating acute carbon monoxide poisoning, but to our knowledge there are no reliable tools for assessing the probability of these sequelae. Objectives To determine whether acute brain lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging are related to subsequent development of delayed neurological sequelae after acute carbon monoxide poisoning. Design, Setting, and Participants. Conclusions and Relevance The presence of acute brain lesions was significantly associated with the development of delayed neurological sequelae. Diffusion-weighted imaging during the acute phase of carbon monoxide poisoning may therefore help identify patients at risk of developing these debilitating sequelae.

At the time of the ED visit, we collected the following data in our registry: demographic data, risk factors or medical comorbidities, level of consciousness at arrival, 12 vital signs, and laboratory results. We also prospectively collected information about seizures, the presence of neurological symptoms and signs at discharge, survival status, and the development of DNS after discharge. Delayed neurological sequelae were defined as any neurological symptom or sign that newly developed within 6 weeks of discharge from the ED; these could include motor deficits, cognitive decline, dysphagia, dysarthria, dyspraxia, parkinsonism, seizures, psychosis, and mood disorders. 13, 14 We evaluated DNS as follows. First, neurology consultations were routinely requested for the assessment of neurological signs before discharge. Second, patients were informed of DNS symptoms and our contact information.

Third, patients were invited to regular follow-up visits in the neurology clinic after discharge. Fourth, we performed a telephone interview with either the patient or a surrogate using a structured questionnaire to evaluate DNS. 14 Fifth, neurologists evaluated DNS, but objective tools for documenting DNS were not used as dedicated tools to specify DNS were not available. Apparent diffusion coefficient signals were low in 94 patients and iso intense or high in 10 patients. For example, decreased consciousness levels, abnormal levels of key blood parameters, abnormal findings on electroencephalography, and abnormal imaging results (eg, on diffusion tensor imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, and computed tomography.
