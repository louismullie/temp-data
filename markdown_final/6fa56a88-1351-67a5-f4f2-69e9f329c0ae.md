## Question

3–5. Determine the maximum value of the ratio of a three-digit number to the number equal to the sum of the digits of this number.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the maximum value of the ratio of a three-digit number to the sum of its digits. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to represent a three-digit number and its digit sum algebraically. Then, I should analyze how the ratio behaves as the digits vary. Next, I will identify which digit patterns maximize the ratio and why. After that, I should compute the maximum ratio explicitly. Finally, I will verify the result and consider whether any edge cases change the conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the algebraic setup. A three-digit number can be written as 100a + 10b + c, where a is the hundreds digit (1–9), and b and c are the tens and units digits (0–9). The sum of the digits is a + b + c, so the ratio we want to maximize is (100a + 10b + c)/(a + b + c) [^05a3655e].

> Now, I need to think about what makes this ratio large. Intuitively, the numerator grows linearly with the place values, while the denominator grows linearly with the digit values, so to maximize the ratio I should maximize the hundreds contribution and minimize the denominator, which means I want a as large as possible and b and c as small as possible. Let me verify that intuition by fixing a = 9 and letting b and c approach 0, which should push the ratio upward [^05a3655e].

> Wait, let me verify the boundary behavior. If I set a = 9, b = 0, and c = 0, the number is 900 and the digit sum is 9, so the ratio is 900/9 = 100. If I try a = 9, b = 0, c = 1, the number is 901 and the sum is 10, giving 901/10 = 90.1, which is smaller than 100. Similarly, a = 9, b = 1, c = 0 gives 910/10 = 91, again smaller. This supports the idea that minimizing b and c while maximizing a yields the largest ratio [^05a3655e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check whether any other combination could exceed 100. Suppose I reduce a to 8 and try to compensate with smaller b and c; for example, 800/8 = 100, but wait, that's the same ratio, and any increase in b or c will lower it below 100. Likewise, 700/7 = 100, but again, adding nonzero b or c reduces the ratio. So 900/9 appears to be the unique maximum among three-digit numbers with nonzero hundreds digit [^05a3655e].

> I should double-check the formal reasoning. The ratio simplifies to (100a + 10b + c)/(a + b + c). For fixed a, increasing b or c increases the denominator faster than the numerator relative to the existing sum, so the ratio decreases. Therefore, the maximum for a given a occurs when b = c = 0, yielding 100a/a = 100. Since a ≤ 9, the global maximum is achieved when a = 9, b = 0, c = 0, giving 100 exactly [^05a3655e].

> Let me reconsider edge cases to ensure completeness. The smallest three-digit number is 100, which gives 100/1 = 100, but wait, that's the same maximum value, not larger. However, the problem asks for the maximum, and while 100 achieves the same ratio, 900 is the largest three-digit number that attains it, so 900/9 = 100 is the canonical answer. No three-digit number produces a ratio greater than 100, confirming the result [^05a3655e].

> Final answer: The maximum value of the ratio of a three-digit number to the sum of its digits is 100, achieved by the number 900 [^05a3655e].

---

The maximum value of the ratio of a three-digit number to the sum of its digits is **100**, achieved by the number **900**. This is because the ratio is maximized when the hundreds digit is as large as possible (9) and the tens and units digits are as small as possible (0), yielding 900/(9+0+0) = 100. No other three-digit number produces a higher ratio, as any increase in the tens or units digits increases the denominator more than the numerator, lowering the ratio.

---

## Mathematical formulation

Let the three-digit number be represented as (N = 100a + 10b + c), where (a), (b), and (c) are the digits, with (a \\in {1, 2, \\ldots, 9}) and (b, c \\in {0, 1, \\ldots, 9}). The sum of the digits is (S = a + b + c). The ratio to maximize is:

[
R = \\frac{N}{S} = \\frac{100a + 10b + c}{a + b + c}
]

---

## Maximizing the ratio

To maximize (R), we need the numerator to be as large as possible while the denominator is as small as possible. This suggests:

- **Maximize (a)**: Set (a = 9) (the largest possible digit).
- **Minimize (b) and (c)**: Set (b = 0) and (c = 0) (the smallest possible digits).

Substituting these values gives:

[
R = \\frac{100 \\times 9 + 10 \\times 0 + 0}{9 + 0 + 0} = \\frac{900}{9} = 100
]

---

## Verification of maximality

To ensure this is indeed the maximum, consider varying the digits:

- **Increasing (b) or (c)**: Any increase in (b) or (c) increases the denominator more than the numerator, reducing the ratio. For example, 901/(9+0+1) = 90.1 < 100.
- **Decreasing (a)**: Reducing (a) below 9 lowers the numerator and thus the ratio. For example, 800/(8+0+0) = 100, but 810/(8+1+0) ≈ 90 < 100.

Thus, **100 is the maximum ratio**.

---

## Conclusion

The maximum value of the ratio of a three-digit number to the sum of its digits is **100**, achieved by the number **900**.

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four, works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9. Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t = 30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t = −0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule, whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

### The fibonacci sequence: relationship to the human hand [^a387acdc]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The motion path of the digits follows the path of an equiangular spiral in which a constant angle is formed by all radial vectors along the curve. This implies that the lengths of the metacarpals, proximal, middle, and distal phalanges approximate a Fibonacci sequence in which the ratio of any 2 consecutive numbers approaches the number 1.61803 (phi). This study tested the hypothesis that the metacarpal and phalangeal bone lengths follow the Fibonacci relationship.

Methods

Standardized x-rays were taken of the hands of 100 healthy volunteers. The proximal phalanx length was subtracted from the sum of the lengths of the middle and distal phalanges and the metacarpal length was subtracted from the sum of the lengths of the middle and proximal phalanges. Confidence intervals for the quotients of the measured lengths of the adjacent bones of the hand also were used for statistical analysis.

Results

Only 1 of 12 bone length ratios contained the ratio phi in the 95% confidence interval, that of the small finger metacarpal and proximal phalanx. The largest variability was seen in the small finger phalangeal relationships.

Conclusion

The application of the Fibonacci sequence to the anatomy of the human hand, although previously accepted, is a relationship that is not supported mathematically. The difference between individual bone lengths as measured at the joint line and the center of rotation of the joints may explain our finding.

### Second to fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D), breast cancer risk factors, and breast cancer risk: a prospective cohort study [^6b941821]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Inter and intraobserver reliability was high for raw digit measurements, with ICC's for left and right, index and ring fingers all being greater than 0.95. Intraclass correlation coefficients for 2D: 4D ratio were slightly lower than those for raw digit measurements (0.80 for right and 0.73 for left 2D: 4D), but still suggest that the observed variability in digit ratio is largely due to between individual differences rather than measurement error.

Of the 9044 women available for this study, we identified 573 incident breast cancer cases during a median follow-up of 16 years 4 months per participant (a total of 145 328 person-years at risk were observed). Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Cases were slightly older than non-cases on average, with median age at baseline of 55 years compared with 53. Seventy-five percent of the participants were born in Australia, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom.

### Making sense of number words and Arabic digits: does order count more? [^10cd7b6e]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The ability to choose the larger between two numbers reflects a mature understanding of the magnitude associated with numerical symbols. The present study explores how the knowledge of the number sequence and memory capacity (verbal and visuospatial) relate to number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Preschool children's (N = 140, M age-in-months = 58.9, range = 41–75) knowledge of the directional property of the counting list as well as the spatial mapping of digits on the visual line were assessed. The ability to order digits on the visual line mediated the relation between memory capacity and number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Beyond cardinality, the knowledge of the (spatial) order of numbers marks the understanding of the magnitude associated with numbers.

### Beginnings of place value: how preschoolers write three-digit numbers [^82ad7c0f]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Place value notation is essential to mathematics learning. This study examined young children's (4- to 6-year-olds, N = 172) understanding of place value prior to explicit schooling by asking them write spoken numbers (e.g., "six hundred and forty-two"). Children's attempts often consisted of "expansions" in which the proper digits were written in order but with 0s or other insertions marking place (e.g., "600402" or "610042"). This partial knowledge increased with age. Gender differences were also observed with older boys more likely than older girls to produce the conventional form (e.g., 642). Potential experiences contributing to expanded number writing and the observed gender differences are discussed.

### Spontaneous sparse learning for PCM-based memristor neural networks [^db590afb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To identify the improvement in accuracy, we examined the confusion matrix as shown in Fig. 3b and e. The confusion matrix indicated how many times the neural network classified each input digit image into each class. The diagonal number indicates correct classifications for each digit while the off-diagonal number means the total occurrence of the confusion (i.e. the discrepancy between the prediction and the truth). The numbers at the top and right (single row and column, respectively) are the sum of each row and column except diagonal value. For example, the highest value '205' (sum of values surrounded by black lines in the confusion matrix) at the top means that the neural network mispredicted the input digit images as '3' mostly (denoted by 'misprediction as '3"), and the highest value '222' (sum of values surrounded by red lines in confusion matrix) at the right means that the class '8' is mostly mispredicted by the neural network (denoted by 'misprediction of '8"). Because some specific digits like '3' and '8' showed distinctive results in confusion matrix, we compared a digit-wise accuracy during the training. The digit-wise accuracy is defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the number of actual images for each digit. Digit '0' and '1' outperform in accuracy while digit '8' shows low accuracy overall in Fig. 3c. Although '3' and '8' show the top-2 highest attempt/success ratio (shown in Fig. 3d), the accuracy of '3' is much higher than the accuracy of '8'. The improved result (denoted by 'Drift') shows that the number of misprediction as '3' is reduced from 205 to 109 and the number of misprediction of '8' is reduced from 222 to 76 significantly. The SSL shows accuracy improvement for most of the digits, especially better for '8' as found in Fig. 3f.

### The big finger: the second to fourth digit ratio is a predictor of sporting ability in women [^db9c6e54]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The second to fourth finger length ratio (2d:4d) is thought to be related to diverse traits including cognitive ability, disease susceptibility, and sexuality.

Objective

To examine the relationship between 2d:4d and sports ability in women.

Methods

Hand radiographs from 607 women (mean age 54 years) were used to estimate 2d:4d. Ranking of sports ability was on a scale (1–5).

Results

The highest achieved level of participation in any sport was significantly negatively associated with 2d:4d (b = -4.93, p = 0.01) as was the relationship between 2d:4d and running level (b = -6.81, p = 0.034). Ability in other sports also showed a negative relationship albeit non-significant.

Conclusions

These results suggest that a low 2d:4d ratio is related to increased female sports ability. It can be postulated that this ratio may predict potential sports ability. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning this relationship may give important insights into musculoskeletal fitness, health and disease.

### Number processing induces spatial performance biases [^177809db]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Response speed in parity judgments is faster with the left hand for small numbers (e.g., 1 or 2) and faster with the right hand for larger numbers (e.g., 8 or 9). This effect suggests that number processing can induce systematic spatial biases in bisection tasks.

Method

Neurologically healthy participants bisected visually presented stimuli with a pencil. Stimuli were long strings of uniform digits (experiment 1) or lines with single digit flankers (experiment 2).

Results

Bisection performance was biased to the left of center for strings made of digits 1 or 2 and to the right of center for strings made of digits 8 or 9. Line bisection was biased toward the flanker representing the larger magnitude, regardless of its position.

Conclusions

These results extend previous findings and support the notion of an automatic association of number magnitudes with spatial response codes. The effect may be useful for an assessment of semantic number processing in special populations.

### Second to fourth digit ratio and prostate cancer severity [^27d0a2f0]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer. There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease.

Methods

Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with digit ratios to determine relationships.

Results

African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95% confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio.

Conclusion

2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although this is a small population sample with possible confounding factors, it does not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal androgens affect prostate cancer grade or progression.

### Evaluation of changes in prices and purchases following implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes across the US [^d406553a]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1.
Treated vs Synthetic Values of Pretreatment Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Sales Volume and Sociodemographic Characteristics

This plot shows the scaled mean values of pretax outcomes and prognostic covariates included in the synthetic control analysis of SSB volume purchased. Mean values are scaled to be between 0 and 100 on the basis of each variable's maximum and minimum values found in the primary sample. Shaded dots correspond to the mean value for a treated city, and hollow dots correspond to its synthetic control. Other race and ethnicity, as determined by the 2010 US Census, included multiracial and Hispanic individuals.

To determine the statistical significance of the ASC average treatment effects, which are calculated as the average posttax percentage changes in SSB prices and purchases for treated units relative to that of the synthetic control units, placebo estimates were generated for each donor unit one by one, as if each of those units had been treated. Because treated localities implemented taxes at different times, this procedure was repeated for each treated locality, generating 279 × 5 = 1395 placebo estimates. To generate P values, the ratio of mean squared prediction error in the posttax vs pretax period was computed for the composite unit estimate and each placebo estimate, which were then ranked from largest to smallest. The P value was calculated as the ratio of the composite unit ranking to the total number of units (1396) and indicated statistical significance when P < .05. More details are provided in the eMethods in Supplement 1.

Cross-Border Purchasing

To fully quantify the changes following SSB taxes in treated cities, we also explored whether purchasing behavior changed in adjacent 3-digit border zip codes. The same ASC procedure was implemented, except all adjacent border localities were considered treated, and taxed cities were excluded. Because border localities tended to be semiurban or suburban, the subsample of donor pool units was modified to those featuring an urbanicity level within 1 SD (0.35) of the mean urbanicity of the 13 border localities (0.75). A total of 369 three-digit zip codes remained, including the 13 border localities. This analysis used the same Census characteristics and P value calculation approach.

Sensitivity Analysis

To assess sensitivity, 2 different urbanicity cutoffs were used to determine the donor pool subsample. Both an urbanicity level of 0.9 and 0.85 were used, reducing the donor pool of 3-digit zip codes to 204 and 226, respectively.

### Decoding the representation of numerical values from brain activation patterns [^4392ad54]. Human Brain Mapping (2013). Low credibility.

Human neuroimaging studies have increasingly converged on the possibility that the neural representation of specific numbers may be decodable from brain activity, particularly in parietal cortex. Multivariate machine learning techniques have recently demonstrated that the neural representation of individual concrete nouns can be decoded from fMRI patterns, and that some patterns are general over people. Here we use these techniques to investigate whether the neural codes for quantities of objects can be accurately decoded. The pictorial mode (nonsymbolic) depicted a set of objects pictorially (e.g., a picture of three tomatoes), whereas the digit-object mode depicted quantities as combination of a digit (e.g., 3) with a picture of a single object. The study demonstrated that quantities of objects were decodable from neural activation patterns, in parietal regions. These brain activation patterns corresponding to a given quantity were common across objects and across participants in the pictorial mode. Other important findings included better identification of individual numbers in the pictorial mode, partial commonality of neural patterns across the two modes, and hemispheric asymmetry with pictorially-depicted numbers represented bilaterally and numbers in the digit-object mode represented primarily in the left parietal regions. The findings demonstrate the ability to identify individual quantities of objects based on neural patterns, indicating the presence of stable neural representations of numbers. Additionally, they indicate a predominance of neural representation of pictorially depicted numbers over the digit-object mode.

### Explainable automated evaluation of the clock drawing task for memory impairment screening [^e4365c87]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

2.4 Clock measures

Human‐based MoCA scoring for the CDT includes gross scoring for the contour of the clock, the placement and legibility of the digits used in the clock, and the shape and direction of the hands used in the clock. As such, we group features below to similarly reflect potential sources of variability in the clock scoring and focused on including features, such as circularity of the contour, or the ratio of the length of the clock's minute and hour hands, which are commonly used to score the CDT, but also included several novel features that were considered of potential benefit.

To facilitate computerized analyses, we relied on all usable data collected over the period from January 2014 to June 2019. To be included, scans needed to be clear and needed to have been stored with appropriate meta‐data so that an automated routine could reliably determine the person's research identification and the date of data collection, and so that the computer could reliably determine the location of the clock. Scans were often excluded because scans were of lower overall quality and the clock could not be seen well or was blurry, or because the scanner induced visual defects in the files. In addition, filename conventions and/or PDF‐labeling standards were not always clear. In many cases, the date was not clear from either the meta‐data or could not be accurately read by the computer from the PDF in a way that matched the scores. Thus, although we collected data on up to 15,298 observations, these exclusion criteria left 7109 CDTs spread at random throughout the observational period that were effectively scanned and matched to clinical data for use in the current analysis.

Automated CDT scoring focused on 19 dimensions of the Clock (Supplemental Methodological Appendix for full details). Specifically, we computed five contour measures (radius size, radius minimum/maximum ratio, circularity, center deviation, and removed points), eight measures of the digits (digit radius mean and SD, digit angle mean and SD, digit area mean and SD, as well as missing or extra digits), and finally six hand measures (intersection distance, hand angles, hands length ratio, density ratio, bound box ratio, and the number of components). These form the feature set used in the remainder of the manuscript.

### Association between recent real-life exposure to hypoglycaemia and cognitive function during hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes: findings from the hypo-RESOLVE clamp study [^befa4a5b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Cognitive tests

At baseline (before onset of insulin infusion) and during hypoglycaemia, cognitive function was examined using a test battery of four validated cognitive function tests with a total duration of approximately 20 min. Primary endpoints were delta scores from baseline to hypoglycaemia for each test. We applied the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)and three subtasks (Alertness, Verbal Flexibility and Working Memory) of the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP). The TAP Alertness subtask evaluated processing speed with the mean reaction time in milliseconds as the outcome. It examined how quickly participants pressed a button when an 'X' was presented on the laptop screen with or without an auditory warning signal beforehand. In the TAP Working Memory subtask, working memory was examined with the sum of omissions and errors as the outcome. A total of 100 single‐digit numbers were displayed on a laptop screen at 3‐s intervals, and the participants were instructed to press a button whenever the displayed digit matched the one shown two digits prior. The TAP Verbal Flexibility subtask evaluated attention and executive function with a ratio between the mean reaction time of the two simple tests and the complex test as the outcome. When numbers (on the left side of the laptop screen) and letters (on the right side) were displayed on the laptop screen, the participants should press the left or right button, respectively. The simple tasks encountered either numbers (first round) or letters (second round), while the complex task encountered both numbers and letters. Lastly, the PASAT, which evaluated different cognitive aspects, including processing speed and working memory, had a mean percentage of correct answers as an outcome. An audio clip presented 60 single digits with either 2.8‐ or 2.0‐s intervals. Throughout the read‐out of the digits, the participants were instructed to verbally state the sum of two consecutive digits in the digit row rather than a cumulative total.

On the procedure day, 11 of the included participants did not complete the TAP Verbal Flexibility subtask due to logistical errors.

### First and second graders successfully reason about ratios with both dot arrays and Arabic numerals [^50c54e29]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

Children struggle with exact, symbolic ratio reasoning, but prior research demonstrates children show surprising intuition when making approximate, nonsymbolic ratio judgments. In the current experiment, eighty-five 6- to 8-year-old children made approximate ratio judgments with dot arrays and numerals. Children were adept at approximate ratio reasoning in both formats and improved with age. Children who engaged in the nonsymbolic task first performed better on the symbolic task compared to children tested in the reverse order, suggesting that nonsymbolic ratio reasoning may function as a scaffold for symbolic ratio reasoning. Nonsymbolic ratio reasoning mediated the relation between children's numerosity comparison performance and symbolic mathematics performance in the domain of probabilities, but numerosity comparison performance explained significant unique variance in general numeration skills.

### Spontaneous sparse learning for PCM-based memristor neural networks [^394de2e0]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Classification results

The most prominent result observed in this research is that the classification accuracy increased up to ~93.2% after the resistance drift effect was introduced. Figure 3a shows the training (inset) and testing accuracy (from 10 repeats) for the network with the conventional binary weight (denoted by 'conventional') and the network with the spontaneously increasing weight (denoted by 'drift'). The remarkable fact is that the improvement in accuracy requires little additional computation cost and operation energy. Interestingly, drift demonstrated a larger deviation earlier, but a steady increase in accuracy with deviation reduced, unlike conventional (error bars) networks. This is because the consistency for the weight change could not be sufficiently assessed at the early stage of training and then the consistency is getting established and incorporated well.

Fig. 3
Classification accuracy.

a The classification accuracy in the conventional and drift neural network is compared. The line is the mean value and the bar is standard deviation from 10 runs. Comparing with the conventional in both train and test accuracy, the drift exhibits smaller deviation in latter epochs while it does larger deviation in former epochs. The final test accuracies are 89.6% and 93.2% in conventional and drift, respectively. b Confusion matrix reveals the discrepancies between the true label and the prediction. The diagonal and off-diagonal components indicate the number of correct and incorrect predictions, respectively. The components in the additional row vector at the top and column vector at the right show the aggregated number of incorrect predictions along each column and true label along each row, respectively. The off-diagonal yellowish component indicates significant incorrect prediction in the conventional. The mostly mispredicted class is '8' (red boxes) and the sum is 222. Also, the prediction as '3' is mostly incorrect (black boxes) and the sum is 205. c Digit-wise accuracy reveals the difference of accuracy between digits. The digit '1' seems to be mostly accurate while '8' shows poor accuracy. d Digit '3' and '8' have top-2 attempt/success ratio of classification. However, the classification of '3' is decent in the accuracy against the high attempt/success ratio while the classification of '8' is not. e In the drift, the most misprediction of '8' is mostly improved from 222 to 76. Also, the most misprediction as '3' is mostly improved from 205 to 109, too. f Almost digits are improved in accuracy. Accuracy of digit '8' and '9' is greatly improved. Digit '0' and '1' still show high accuracy.

### Symbolic arithmetic knowledge without instruction [^d0ca42f7]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Symbolic arithmetic is fundamental to science, technology and economics, but its acquisition by children typically requires years of effort, instruction and drill. When adults perform mental arithmetic, they activate nonsymbolic, approximate number representations, and their performance suffers if this nonsymbolic system is impaired. Nonsymbolic number representations also allow adults, children, and even infants to add or subtract pairs of dot arrays and to compare the resulting sum or difference to a third array, provided that only approximate accuracy is required. Here we report that young children, who have mastered verbal counting and are on the threshold of arithmetic instruction, can build on their nonsymbolic number system to perform symbolic addition and subtraction. Children across a broad socio-economic spectrum solved symbolic problems involving approximate addition or subtraction of large numbers, both in a laboratory test and in a school setting. Aspects of symbolic arithmetic therefore lie within the reach of children who have learned no algorithms for manipulating numerical symbols. Our findings help to delimit the sources of children's difficulties learning symbolic arithmetic, and they suggest ways to enhance children's engagement with formal mathematics.

### Calculation impairment in neurodegenerative diseases [^54dd331e]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2003). Low credibility.

We examined oral calculation in patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD; N = 17), frontotemporal dementia (FTD; N = 17), and Alzheimer's disease (AD; N = 20), as well as 17 healthy seniors matched for age and education. Our calculation model involves at least three components: numerosity, combinatorial processes, and executive resources such as working memory. We assessed addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division involving small numbers (small, single-digit answers) and large numbers (larger, single- and double-digit answers). We also assessed dot counting for small numbers (2–5) and large numbers (6–9), as well as a measure of working memory. All patient groups differed from healthy seniors in oral calculation. CBD (36% correct) and FTD (65% correct) demonstrated a significant overall impairment in oral calculation relative to AD (76% correct). CBD (66% correct) had more difficulty counting dots overall relative to AD (94% correct) and FTD (86% correct), consistent with our hypothesis that the calculation deficit in CBD is due in large part to a numerosity deficit. FTD had more difficulty relative to AD in their performance of reverse digit span, consistent with our hypothesis that FTD patients' executive resource limitation contributes to their pattern of calculation impairment.

### Perceiving numbers causes spatial shifts of attention [^ce6188b7]. Nature Neuroscience (2003). Medium credibility.

Number symbols are part of our everyday visual world. Here we show that merely looking at numbers causes a shift in covert attention to the left or right side, depending upon the number's magnitude. This observation implies obligatory activation of number meaning and signals a tight coupling of internal and external representations of space.

### Dyscalculia and the calculating brain [^c12edb0d]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Dyscalculia, like dyslexia, affects some 5% of school-age children but has received much less investigative attention. In two thirds of affected children, dyscalculia is associated with another developmental disorder like dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder, anxiety disorder, visual and spatial disorder, or cultural deprivation. Infants, primates, some birds, and other animals are born with the innate ability, called subitizing, to tell at a glance whether small sets of scattered dots or other items differ by one or more item. This nonverbal approximate number system extends mostly to single digit sets as visual discrimination drops logarithmically to "many" with increasing numerosity (size effect) and crowding (distance effect). Preschoolers need several years and specific teaching to learn verbal names and visual symbols for numbers and school agers to understand their cardinality and ordinality and the invariance of their sequence (arithmetic number line) that enables calculation. This arithmetic linear line differs drastically from the nonlinear approximate number system mental number line that parallels the individual number-tuned neurons in the intraparietal sulcus in monkeys and overlying scalp distribution of discrete functional magnetic resonance imaging activations by number tasks in man. Calculation is a complex skill that activates both visual and spatial and visual and verbal networks. It is less strongly left lateralized than language, with approximate number system activation somewhat more right sided and exact number and arithmetic activation more left sided. Maturation and increasing number skill decrease associated widespread non-numerical brain activations that persist in some individuals with dyscalculia, which has no single, universal neurological cause or underlying mechanism in all affected individuals.

### Effect of age on the protein profile of healthy malay adults and its association with cognitive function competency [^ef2bc27f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Forward Digit Span (FDS)

Subjects listened to a string of digits and repeated them in forward order verbally. The first sequence consisted of three digits. An additional digit was added until a maximum span of nine digits was achieved if subjects were able to express each digit correctly. The subjects had two trials for each span. If subjects repeated wrong digits in two of the trials, the test was halted. Scoring was based on the maximum digits repeated without error in one of the two trials.

Backward Digit Span (BDS)

Execution of this test was similar to the FDS. Subjects repeated the span in reverse order with the last digit in the span repeated first. The first span included two digits, and the last one was eight digits. The test was stopped if an error was made in two consecutive trials. Like the FDS, each subject's score was the maximum digits repeated without error in one of the two trials.

Digit Symbol

Subjects were required to redraw symbols that were matched with a particular number within 120 min. A list of numbers was shown in parallel to the assigned symbols for reference during the task. Subjects were allowed to practice drawing the symbols before beginning the actual test. Scoring was based on the total number of symbols drawn regardless of sequence.

Visual Reproduction (VR)

There were two parts of this task, VRI and VRII. In VRI, four different cards were presented to the subjects. Each card was shown within five seconds, and subjects were asked to redraw the shape on each card. In VRII, subjects were given a glimpse of the drawn shapes and required to memorize them. The subjects were then asked to redraw the shapes without the presence of any visual stimuli.

Short-term memory and working memory

The Digit Span Forward (DSF), Digit Span Backward (DSB) and the Letter-Number sequencing (LNS) subtest tasks from the latest version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV), are used to measure short term memory (DSF) and working memory (DSB and LNS). For DSF, participants are read a consecutive string of numbers (from 1–9) at a rate of one per second, and asked to repeat them back in the exact order they are presented. For the DSB task, participants are asked to repeat the sequence of numbers back in the exact reverse order that they were presented. String lengths range from two to eight digits and each trial presented two lists of the same string length. For each one of the eight trails over the two Digit Span tasks, a score of zero is given if a participant makes an incorrect response, and a score of 1 was given for a correct response. Individual total raw scores for the DSF and DSB tasks is calculated by summing the accumulated scores for the eight trials administered to each separate task. The maximum total raw score for both the DSF and the DSB was 16.

For the LNS task, participants are presented with strings of numbers and letters at a rate of one item per second, and afterwards asked to repeat back the numbers in numerical order followed by the letters in alphabetical order. String lengths ranged from two to eight digits and letters, and each trial presented three lists of the same string length. Following standard scoring procedures as outlined in the test manual, all seven trials (with three test items per trial) (not including sample items) were given a score of 0, 1, 2 or 3 (0 = fails all three trials, 1 = passes one trial, 2 = passes two trials, 3 = passes all three trials). For trials one and two, a score of 0 is given if a participant provides an incorrect response, suggesting they did not know the answer, or did not provide an answer within the allocated time limit of 30 seconds. For trials three to ten, credit is given for providing the correct letters in sequence followed by the correct letters in sequence.

### Number representations drive number-line estimates [^6bf63201]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The number-line task has been extensively used to study the mental representation of numbers in children. However, studies suggest that proportional reasoning provides a better account of children's performance. Ninety 4- to 6-year-olds were given a number-line task with symbolic numbers, with clustered dot arrays that resembled a perceptual scaling task, or with spread-out dot arrays that involved numerical estimation. Children performed well with clustered dot arrays, but poorly with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays. Performances with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays were highly correlated and were related to counting skill; neither was true for clustered dot arrays. Overall, results provide evidence for the role of mental representation of numbers in the symbolic number-line task.

### An optical neural network using less than 1 photon per multiplication [^b84752a8]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Deep learning has become a widespread tool in both science and industry. However, continued progress is hampered by the rapid growth in energy costs of ever-larger deep neural networks. Optical neural networks provide a potential means to solve the energy-cost problem faced by deep learning. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an optical neural network based on optical dot products that achieves 99% accuracy on handwritten-digit classification using ~3.1 detected photons per weight multiplication and ~90% accuracy using ~0.66 photons (~2.5×10–19 J of optical energy) per weight multiplication. The fundamental principle enabling our sub-photon-per-multiplication demonstration-noise reduction from the accumulation of scalar multiplications in dot-product sums-is applicable to many different optical-neural-network architectures. Our work shows that optical neural networks can achieve accurate results using extremely low optical energies.

### Guidance on community viral load: a family of measures, definitions, and method for calculation [^5f767c11]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — additional community viral load (VL) measures — includes a cumulative measure defined as "Sum of VLs for all cases" that reflects "The number of virus particles in the population who have a VL; affected by the number of cases; reflects both prevalence of HIV cases and burden of viremia". A suppression proportion is defined by "The numerator is the number of cases whose most recent VL was suppressed; the denominator is the number of cases with a VL" and interpreted as "Maximal Virologic Suppression, or the percent virologically suppressed reflects ART uptake, adherence, and effectiveness in clinical settings; a quality of HIV care measure; in jurisdictions offering universal treatment, an important marker of uptake of universal ART guidelines". Calculation timing guidance notes "Time needs to be defined for each calculation, usually a 12-month period. Pooling over a few years can increase VL completeness but is harder to interpret". The abbreviation is specified as "ART, antiretroviral treatment".

### Association of prenatal depression with second to fourth digit ratio in children aged 4 and 6 years [^c0506c59]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3. Association Between Prenatal Depressive Symptoms and 2D:4D Ratios in Children

Table 2 demonstrates a general pattern that prenatal depressive symptoms were associated with higher 2D:4D ratios in the offspring. Specifically, for depressive symptoms in the second trimester, a statistically significant increase in digit ratios was observed in the left hand of the offspring (2D:4DL) at 4 years of age, with increments of 0.007 (95% CI: 0.000, 0.015) for the subthreshold depressive group and 0.010 (95% CI: 0.001, 0.019) for the screen-positive depressive group. In relation to the depressive symptoms in the third trimester, associations were observed on 2D:4DL of offspring at both 4 and 6 years of age, although statistically significant increases were only found in the screen-positive depressive group (4-years: β: 0.012, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.023 and 6-years: β: 0.014, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.024). A dose–response effect was observed across different levels of the depressive group in all the above associations. Stratification by sex showed a similar pattern, with an additional association with an increased 2D:4DR ratio among girls aged 6 years in the third trimester (Table 2).

### Increased ratio of 2nd to 4th digit (2D: 4D) in schizophrenia [^19188261]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

Sex differences in the onset, epidemiology, clinical presentation and neuropathology of schizophrenia suggest that sexual dimorphism in brain development may be relevant to pathogenesis. Sex hormones, in particular testosterone, are considered to be crucial in brain development, but few investigations have examined the potential role of prenatal testosterone in schizophrenia. In this study, we examined a retrospective marker of prenatal testosterone release - 2D:4D finger length ratio (2D:4D), the relative length of 2nd to 4th digit, in 64 Asian patients with schizophrenia and 64 sex-matched controls. No significant difference in mean finger lengths was present, however 2D:4D ratio was significantly different between patients and controls. The effect was primarily seen in males consistent with a 'less masculinised' pattern and hypotheses suggesting that schizophrenia may be associated with an abnormality in prenatal circulating testosterone.

### Investigating the synergistic effects of hormone replacement therapy, apolipoprotein E and age on brain health in the UK biobank [^f0a9317e]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Cognition

Visual memory

Participants were asked to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards were presented for 5 seconds, then turned face down on the screen and the participant was asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. Two trials of this task were administered, one with three pairs and one with six pairs of cards. Only the score on the six‐pair trial was analysed in the present study, due to the ceiling effect on the three‐pair trial. The layout of the cards was purely random and there was no time restriction for the test, that is, the participant was able to match/mismatch the pairs until all were found or the task was abandoned. The number of incorrect matches (UK Biobank data field 399) was used as the measure of visual memory, with a higher score indicating worse performance.

Numeric memory

The participant was shown a two‐digit number to remember. Each string was presented on screen for 2000 milliseconds + (the number of digits [i.e. 2] × 500 milliseconds). The number then disappeared and after a wait period of 3000 milliseconds, the participant was asked to enter the remembered number onto the screen. The number became one digit longer each time they remembered correctly (up to a maximum of 12 digits). If the number was 2 digits, the test ends after five successive incorrect answers. If the number was 3 or more digits, the test ends after two successive incorrect answers. The score for analysis was the maximum string length recalled correctly (UK Biobank data field 4282), with higher scores indicating better performance.

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^07189726]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Digits Span is a cognitive task designed to measure working memory capacity. Participants are presented with a sequence of numbers that they must recall. The first sequence is always 2 numbers long, and at each trial, if the participant replies correctly, the length of the next sequence increases by one. If the participant incorrectly recalls the sequence of numbers, then another string of the same length is presented. This is repeated until the participant replies incorrectly 3 times consecutively, when the task terminates. Spatial Span has a similar design to Digits Span, but instead of digits participants recall the location of sequences of flashes on a 4 × 4 grid of squares, testing their spatial working memory capacity. As shown in Fig. 3c for Digits Span, the derived DS measure suggested that the more numbers participants must remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.92). Similarly for Spatial Span, the more squares participants have to remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.84) (Fig. 3d).

Words Definitions is designed to measure crystallised intelligence. Participants are presented with a word and four alternative definitions. They must select the definition that corresponds to the meaning of the word as quickly as possible. The task has multiple trials and at each trial a different word is shown. The words are characterised by different frequency of occurrence in the English language. To assess the word difficulty scale predicted by IDoCT for the Words Definitions task, the correlation between the obtained measure of difficulty DS and the frequency of occurrence in the English language of the words included in the cognitive assessment was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3a, the most frequently used words in English were assigned a lower D and DS compared to the least frequently used ones. A Spearman correlation of −0.66 and −0.64 between respectively DS and D with the log frequency measures of the words was found.

Motor Control is designed to measure motor abilities. Participants are shown a moving target, which is represented as a circular red button, and are expected to press on the target as quickly as possible, as soon as it appears, and before it changes location in the screen. According to IDoCT, the further the location of the current target from the previous location, the higher the difficulty estimate DS (Spearman correlation between the distance and D and DS was 0.91 and 0.87, respectively — Fig. 3b).

### Remote digital cognitive assessment reveals cognitive deficits related to hippocampal atrophy in autoimmune limbic encephalitis: a cross-sectional validation study [^1a98eda1]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Blocks

To assess spatial planning ability, participants were asked to match a configuration of tiles by removing shapes from a pre-configured layout of tiles. Importantly, the unsupported tiles fell down with gravity, changing the configuration. No time limit was enforced. The number of correct trials was used as the outcome variable.

Tower of London

A modified version of the Tower of London task was used to investigate spatial planning abilities. Participants were presented with two sets of three prongs with coloured beads on them. They were required to count the minimum number of moves it would take to change one set of three prongs to the other configuration and indicate the number on a number pad. Participants could not directly move the coloured beads and had to hold the number of moves in memory. There were 10 trials of varying difficulty, and the proportion correct was used as a measure of mental spatial planning.

Digit span

The digit span task required participants to hold numbers shown sequentially in memory. On each trial, participants were presented with a series of digits. At the end of the sequence, participants were required to recall the digits in the order they appeared by clicking on a number pad. Each successful trial led to an increase in the number of digits by one. The task was terminated when three consecutive errors were made on a given difficulty level. The maximum attained span was used as the memory measure, which ranged from 1 to 20.

Spatial span

Spatial short-term memory was tested using an adapted version of the Corsi Block Tapping Test. A sequence of locations was lit up in a 4 by 4 grid, and participants had to replicate the sequence. All trials began with two grids lighting up sequentially and were incremented by one on every successful recall. The task was terminated when three consecutive errors were made on a given difficulty level. The maximum sequence length for each participant was taken as a measure of spatial memory span, which ranged from 1 to 16.

Verbal analogies

Semantic (analogical) reasoning was tested by assessing the associations of two pairs of words. Participants were asked to indicate whether the association between words was true or false (e.g. 'Human is to ape as crow is to bird', true). Participants answered as many prompts as possible in 3 min. Every incorrect response led to a deduction of one point. Every correct point led to an increase of one point. The total score was used as a measure of word-based semantic reasoning.

### Relationships between cognitive performance, clinical insight and regional brain volumes in schizophrenia [^37513d21]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Measures

To assess symptom severity, The Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)were used. To assess clinical insight, we used the clinician-rated Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). Following a semi-structured interview, the clinician scores the patient on three items that assess past and current awareness of: (i) having a mental disorder, (ii) effects of medication and (iii) consequences of the mental disorder; items are rated on a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = full awareness, 5 = unawareness). The SUMD total score is the total sum of all past and current scores across these three items.

All participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery across four cognitive domains previously shown to be impaired in SZH, namely, attention, executive function, episodic memoryand working memory. Tasks were as follows.

Continuous Performance Test- Identical Pairs (CPT-IP). A computerised test of sustained attention requires the participant to identify repetition amongst a sequence of nonsense shapes and digit numbers. Participants make a button press when two successive stimuli are identical. As a standardised score of accuracy, d-prime is the ratio between hits and false alarms.

Wechsler Memory Scale — Third Edition (WMS-III). Digit Span (total forwards and backwards): participants recite back a sequence of numbers in the same order, and in reverse order. Spatial Span (total forwards and backwards): participants are asked to repeat a spatial sequence demonstrated by examiner in the same order (forward) and reverse order (backward). Letter Number Sequencing: participants are asked to repeat a mixed list of letters and numbers in alphabetic and ascending orders. Logical Memory subtest: participants are asked to verbally recall a given story immediately (LM I, immediate version) and after a delay interval (LM II, delayed version), and Family Pictures subtest: subjects are shown a series of pictures of scenarios which participants are required to recall.

Hands with supernumerary fingers perform more complex movements. Subplots (a – f) report on analyses of hand movements recorded during manipulation of objects of various shapes. The movement task was carried out by two six- and 13 five-fingered subjects. a Dependency between individual fingers quantified by the mutual information between the movements of pairs of fingers, with a value of 0 indicating complete independence between fingers and positive values an increasing dependency. Note that the mutual information is symmetric, i.e. b The cumulative amount of explained variance of hand movements as a function of an increasing number of principal components. Error bars depict SDs across subjects. c The number of effective dof (computed using the principle components, see Methods) was higher in six-fingered than in five-fingered subjects. d Information entropy of the discretized movements where each finger is either resting, flexing or extending. Entropy is shown for an increasing number of fingers, starting with thumb only ("T") and successively adding one finger (index "I", middle "M", ring "R", little "L" and supernumerary "S"). Dotted lines indicate the theoretically maximum possible entropy for five- and six-fingered hands. e Percentage of times thumb and index finger ("T + I"), thumb only ("T"), index only ("I") were moving when the supernumerary finger moved.

### Neural association between non-verbal number sense and arithmetic fluency [^3b9765a4]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Numerosity comparison

Three dot arrays were presented simultaneously on the screen. The target array was presented in upper part of the screen, and two candidate arrays were presented in the lower half of the screen. Participants were asked to judge which candidate array contained the same number of dots as the target array. However, as this was not a matching task, the layout of the dots differed even when the number of dots was the same. For half of the trials, the total area taken up by the dots was the same for all three arrays. For the other half, the average area for a single dot (total area/number of dots) was the same for all three arrays. Dot size varied and dots were randomly distributed within a circle. Choices were made by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. The task comprised 120 trials that were divided into two 60‐trials blocks.

2.3.3 Simple addition

We used a simple single‐digit addition task. For each trial, an addition problem was presented in the middle of the upper part of the screen and two candidate answers, one of which was correct, were presented side by side in the lower part of the screen. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. There are 81 possible single‐digit addition problems starting from 1 + 1 and ending at 9 + 9. To avoid repeating the same problem more than once, this test only had 81 trials.

2.3.4 Simple subtraction

The subtraction problems were the reversed calculations from the single‐digit addition. Thus, there are 81 possible problems starting from 2 to 1 and ending at 18 to 9. Again, to avoid repeating problems, this test only had 81 trials. All other aspects of the task were the same as the simple addition task.

2.3.5 Character rhyming

Two Chinese characters were presented simultaneously on the screen. Participants were asked to judge whether they rhymed or not. This test had 120 trials.

### A new documentation system for congenital absent digits [^77df3d05]. Hand (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital absent digits continue to be described by many confusing terms and are currently classified in categories I, V, and VI of the International Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand classification and seven subclassification systems. Very few classification systems provide any logical basis for surgical reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to develop a simple alphanumerical documentation system to reproducibly describe the morphological or radiographic appearance of congenital absent digits and facilitate communication of these childrens' hand anomalies from one hand surgeon to another.

Methods

Dorsal and palmar photographs and PA radiographs of 235 hands in 204 children born with congenital absent digits over a 15-year period were analyzed to determine which digital rays were missing and their level of absence. Each hand can be described by three letters, R (radial), C (central), and U (ulnar), as well as numbers 1–5. The first letter and number designate which rays are missing and the second and third letters and numbers designate which rays remain present.

Results

There are 15 morphological phenotypes of congenital absent digits. The three most common phenotypes are U4R1 (a thumb but absence of all four fingers), R1U4 (absent thumb), and R5 (aplastic hand).

Conclusions

This new documentation system allows hand surgeons to describe the simple morphological or radiographic appearance of congenital absent digits; incorporates all the previous subclassification systems that have attempted to describe congenital absent digits in radial, central, and ulnar deficiencies, symbrachydactyly, and congenital constriction ring syndrome; and has subsequently allowed the development of an algorithm which predicts whether conventional or microsurgical reconstruction is indicated for each specific phenotype.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^d6d8fcbc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Spirometry reporting specifies that numerical values are given for the FEV1, the FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio; the latter should be reported as a decimal fraction and the space for percent predicted value left blank, and if bronchodilators are given the LLN column need not be repeated with absolute and percent change given only for FEV1 and FVC. Other numerical values such as the forced inspiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF75%) and FEF25–75% are not recommended for routine use. Graph requirements include that for the volume–time curve the volume scale should be at least 10 mm/L, the time scale at least 20 mm/s, and 1 second prior to the start of expiration should be displayed; on the flow–volume plot the flow display should be at least 5 l/min/L/s, and the ratio of flow to volume should be 2 L/s to 1 L, and linear and log scales where values are plotted as z-scores relative to the predicted value (z = 0) give an intuitive sense of severity.

### How 15 hundred is like 15 cherries: effect of progressive alignment on representational changes in numerical cognition [^ca3b60f3]. Child Development (2010). Low credibility.

How does understanding the decimal system change with age and experience? Second, third, sixth graders, and adults (Experiment 1: N = 96, mean ages = 7.9, 9.23, 12.06, and 19.96 years, respectively) made number line estimates across 3 scales (0–1,000, 0–10,000, and 0–100,000). Generation of linear estimates increased with age but decreased with numerical scale. Therefore, the authors hypothesized highlighting commonalities between small and large scales (15:100::1500:10000) might prompt children to generalize their linear representations to ever-larger scales. Experiment 2 assigned second graders (N = 46, mean age = 7.78 years) to experimental groups differing in how commonalities of small and large numerical scales were highlighted. Only children experiencing progressive alignment of small and large scales successfully produced linear estimates on increasingly larger scales, suggesting analogies between numeric scales elicit broad generalization of linear representations.

### Network analysis of stroke systems of care in Korea [^11a87c0a]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Characterising the derived stroke communities

We used the modularity valueto evaluate the overall quality of the derived stroke communities. In addition, to assess the quality and capacity of each community, we used three key density metrics(global density (K), mean intracommunity density, and mean intercommunity density (online supplemental table 1). K measures the overall connectivity in the network, calculated as the ratio of the actual number of connections (edges) to the maximum possible number.andassess the connectivity among nodes within individual communities and between different communities, respectively, both using a similar ratio-based approach. According to empirical studies, a highercompared with a K, and a lowercompared with a K, indicate well-defined, high-quality communities. This means that the average connections within each community are more numerous than those between different communities, signifying distinct and well-integrated stroke care communities within the network.

Stroke communities were characterized based on patient-level and hospital-level attributes and network metrics. We evaluated the capacity of each stroke community using the number of direct visits/stays, interhospital transfers, recanalisation therapies, bed size and provision of SU care. Degree centrality, group degree centralization (GDC), and the abovementioned three density metrics were employed as network metrics.

Degree centrality is a measure used in network science to assess the importance of each node within a network. As the network has directed edges, we summed up the number of incoming links for each node. Then, we divided it by the number of possible connections within the belonging community. GDC measures the level of centralisation in each community. It first calculates the difference between each node's degree centrality and the theoretical maximum in the belonging community. It then divides these values by the theoretical maximum and sums them up. A value close to 1 indicates high centralisation and a value close to 0 indicates low centralisation. A more detailed explanation for calculating GDC is provided in online supplemental table 2.

### Serum neurofilament light chain levels are associated with all-cause mortality in the general US population [^09339628]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cognitive function

Three cognitive function tests were performed in a subgroup of participants aged 60 years or older. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD W-L) assesses immediate and delayed learning ability for new verbal information. The CERAD W-L consists of three consecutive learning trials and a delayed recall. For the three learning trials, participants were instructed to read aloud ten unrelated words. Immediately following the presentation of the words, participants recalled as many words as possible. The delayed recall occurred approximately 10 min after the start of the word learning trials. The maximum score on each trial is 10; the maximum score for the total word list is 40 (sum of the three trials plus the delayed recall).

The Animal Fluency Test examines verbal category fluency, a component of executive function, as well as other functions such as semantic memory and processing speed. Participants were asked to name as many animals as possible in 1 min with a point given for each named animal.

The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is a global measure of brain health, relies on processing speed, visual scanning, sustained attention, and short-term memory. The test is conducted using a paper form with a key at the top containing nine numbers paired with distinct symbols. Participants had 2 min to copy the corresponding symbols in the 133 boxes that adjoin the numbers.

All-cause mortality

Mortality data from death certificates from the National Death Index were linked to NHANES based on the participant sequence number available on both datasets. The present analysis is based on the public-use linked mortality files for NHANES 2013–2014, which include follow-up time and cause of death for adult participants through 31 December 2019. Due to relatively low statistical power, we limited our analysis to all-cause mortality. More information on the linkage method and analytic guidelines are available on the specific webpage of the National Center for Health Statistics [32].

### An analog-AI chip for energy-efficient speech recognition and transcription [^9118572e]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

To provide input data and collect MAC results in a massively parallel fashion from or to the ILPs–OLPs, complex routing paths were programmed, leveraging the flexibility of the LCs (Extended Data Fig. 5b). In the RNNT encoder, after each MAC, the data needed to go through input–output for off-chip digital processing. Each full operation (including input, MAC, duration generation and output digitization) took 2.1 μs. The input arrows show multi-cast in parallel to one or more analog tiles with MAC operations occurring on those tiles. Output MACs were provided to the OLPs in three time steps owing to the small number of OLPs.

RNNT experiments implemented MAC on-chip, whereas tile affine calibration (shift and scale) and LSTM vector–vector computations were performed in SW (MATLAB SW running on x86). In particular, the first Enc-LSTM0 W x required careful input-signal management to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, owing to the large sensitivity of the WER to any noise on its weights. Extended Data Fig. 6a shows that, in the case of Enc-LSTM0 W x, the input data, which naturally exhibits a wide dynamic range, was first shifted to zero-mean, followed by normalization to maximum input amplitude. The preprocessed input was then used for analog MAC. The MAC results were later denormalized back in SW, where the input mean contribution was added (which collapses to the product of one number, the mean value of the input image, and one vector, the sum of weights for every column) and the affine coefficients for calibration were applied.

### Numerical magnitude representations influence arithmetic learning [^8f04dd6c]. Child Development (2008). Low credibility.

This study examined whether the quality of first graders' (mean age = 7.2 years) numerical magnitude representations is correlated with, predictive of, and causally related to their arithmetic learning. The children's pretest numerical magnitude representations were found to be correlated with their pretest arithmetic knowledge and to be predictive of their learning of answers to unfamiliar arithmetic problems. The relation to learning of unfamiliar problems remained after controlling for prior arithmetic knowledge, short-term memory for numbers, and math achievement test scores. Moreover, presenting randomly chosen children with accurate visual representations of the magnitudes of addends and sums improved their learning of the answers to the problems. Thus, representations of numerical magnitude are both correlationally and causally related to arithmetic learning.

### Assessing accuracy in linkage analysis by means of confidence regions [^43ccdefa]. Genetic Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

When statistical linkage to a certain chromosomal region has been found, it is of interest to develop methods quantifying the accuracy with which the disease locus can be mapped. In this paper, we investigate the performance of three different types of confidence regions, with asymptotically correct coverage probability as the number of pedigrees grows. Our setup is that of a saturated map of marker data. We allow for arbitrary combinations of pedigree structures, and treat various kinds of genetic models (e.g. binary and quantitative phenotypes) in a unified way. The linkage scores are weighted sums of the individual family scores, with NPL and lod scores as special cases. We show that the expected length of the confidence region is inversely proportional to the slope-to-noise ratio, or equivalently, inversely proportional to the product of the square of the noncentrality parameter and a certain normalized slope-to-noise ratio. Our investigations reveal that maximal expected linkage scores can be quite different from estimation-based performance criteria based on expected length of confidence regions. The main reason is that there is no simple relationship between peak height and peak slope of the mean linkage score. One application of our results is planning of linkage studies: given a certain genetic model, we can approximate the number of pedigrees needed to obtain a confidence region with given coverage probability and expected length.

### Representational format determines numerical competence in monkeys [^840aefc5]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

A range of animal species possess an evolutionarily ancient system for representing number, which provides the foundation for simple arithmetical operations such as addition and numerical comparisons. Surprisingly, non-human primates tested in ecologically, highly valid quantity discrimination tasks using edible items often show a relatively low performance, suggesting that stimulus salience interferes with rational decision making. Here we show that quantity discrimination was indeed significantly enhanced when monkeys were tested with inedible items compared with food items (84 versus 69% correct). More importantly, when monkeys were tested with food, but rewarded with other food items, the accuracy was equally high (86%). The results indicate that the internal representation of the stimuli, not their physical quality, determined performance. Reward replacement apparently facilitated representation of the food items as signifiers for other foods, which in turn supported a higher acuity in decision making.

### Cell-specific proteome analyses of human bone marrow reveal molecular features of age-dependent functional decline [^345b76a3]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

For further analysis, we only took into account PSMs that were common to both the TMT quantification approach as described above and the MaxQuant analysis. These spectra were then filtered according to the same criteria as applied for TMT quantification (high confidence, no missed cleavages, search engine rank set to 1, summed intensity of channels 127 to 131 set to more than 30,000, isolation interference set to less than 30%). For each peptide per LC-MS analysis the PSMs that passed latter criteria were collected, and the median ratio was taken as peptide ratio for each LC-MS analysis. If more than three PSMs passed the criteria, the median of the top three most intense spectra was taken.

The total area (MS1 intensity/precursor intensity) of an individual peptide species represents the sum of the internal standard and the five samples that were analysed together. The portion of the total area from each sample can be calculated based on the reporter ion intensities of the six TMT channels. The total area of a given peptide species was split into individual channels using the TMT ratios per peptide per LC-MS analysis. After the splitting of the total area intensity into individual channels, we corrected for potential sampling aberrations by multiplying the area intensities per channel with the median ratio determined between the internal standard and the respective donor channel.

Based on these normalized area intensities per channel, we calculated LF scores for each peptide by dividing through the number of potentially observable unique tryptic peptides per protein (criteria: peptide length 8–25 amino acids, no missed cleavage allowed). In order to retrieve the final LF score per protein, we summed up the LF scores of the corresponding unique peptides per protein. For further data analysis, we only considered proteins that were covered by at least two unique tryptic peptides.

Summary of the normalization steps of the LF data

We normalized the LF protein scores to allow comparison between donors across the different cell populations. After log-transforming the data, the median of all LF protein scores was calculated in each TMT-6plex experiment and was subtracted from each LF protein score in each donor. Summarizing the normalized unlogged values for each protein in each cell population and dividing by the number of maximum donors available per cell population gives the LF sum value denoted in the Supplementary Data 2.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^f361165a]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Spirometry — considerations in performing spirometry (Figure 2.4) state that forced spirometry is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow obstruction, and peak expiratory flow measurement alone cannot be reliably used as the only diagnostic test because of its weak specificity. Preparation includes that spirometers should produce hard copy or have a digital display of the expiratory curve to permit detection of technical errors or have an automatic prompt to identify an unsatisfactory test and the reason for it. During performance, the pause between inspiration and expiration should be less than one second, the recording should go on long enough for a volume plateau to be reached, which may take more than 15 seconds in severe disease, and both FVC and FEV1 should be the largest value obtained from any of three technically satisfactory curves and the FVC and FEV1 values in these three curves should vary by no more than 5% or 150 mL, whichever is greater; the FEV1/FVC ratio should be taken from the technically acceptable curve with the largest sum of FVC and FEV1. For bronchodilation testing, possible dosage protocols are 400 mcg short-acting beta2-agonist, 160 mcg short-acting anticholinergic, or the two combined; FEV1 should be measured 10–15 minutes after a short-acting beta2-agonist is given, or 30–45 minutes after a short-acting anticholinergic or a combination of both classes of drugs, and patients already on bronchodilator treatment, in whom spirometry is requested for monitoring purposes do not need to stop their regular treatment for spirometry. For evaluation, spirometry measurements are evaluated by comparison of the results with appropriate reference values based on age, height and sex, and the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 confirms the presence of non-fully reversible airflow obstruction.

### Investigation of the association of the second-to-fourth digit ratio with skin sebum levels in females with acne vulgaris [^c3ac4582]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A relationship between acne vulgaris (AV) and the masculinized (lower) second-to-fourth digit (2D:4D) ratio in females was demonstrated in our previous study. Development of the digits and the sebaceous glands both occur during the same gestational period; therefore, the association between the 2D:4D ratios and AV may result from the effects of the prenatal endocrine environment on the sebaceous glands.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the 2D:4D ratio and sebum levels in the skin of females with AV.

Methods

In total, 215 female AV patients and 92 healthy controls, aged 18–35 years, were enrolled in this study. Finger-length measurements were made using a digital Vernier caliper, and the sebum levels of five facial areas were measured using a Sebumeter SM 815. Acne severity was assessed using the International Consensus Conference on Acne Classification System.

Results

The 2D:4D ratios of the AV patients were significantly lower than those of the controls, for both hands. The mean sebum levels in the T-zone, U-zone and whole face were significantly higher for AV patients compared with controls. The 2D:4D ratio in the left hand showed significant negative correlations with the sebum levels in the U-zone; however, no association was found between the 2D:4D ratios and sebum levels in the T-zone and whole face. While acne severity was positively correlated with skin sebum levels, no correlation between acne severity and 2D:4D ratios was observed.

Conclusion

This study provides preliminary evidence regarding the association between lower 2D:4D ratios and higher rates of sebum secretion in the U-zone for females with AV. The 2D:4D ratio might be a predictor of sebum levels, as well as acne development, in females.

### Deciphering neuronal variability across States reveals dynamic sensory encoding [^63e99129]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In an HMM, the number of states, M, is a hyperparameter. To find the optimum number of states (M *), we used a majority rule across all mice. For each mouse, we optimized the 3-fold cross-validated log-likelihood (LL) estimate of the HMM fit, penalizing the metric if the inferred latent states were similar. The correction for similarity was imperative to determining distinct states with unique definitions. 'Similarity' between the states was quantified as the top eigenvalue of the state definition matrix evaluated as the mean power across the identified frequency ranges (number of states × number of frequency bands, Fig. 2 C, right). The top eigenvalue represents the maximum variance in the matrix. In such a case, smaller values indicate lower variance in the definition matrix and, therefore, highly collinear state definitions. To apply this correction, we divided the log-likelihood estimate with the top eigenvalue where both metrics were individually normalized between -1 and 1 over a range of M ∈ [2, 6]. Normalization was performed to allow equal weighting of the two metrics. The optimal number of states for each mouse was then identified as the number of states at which the ratio between the two metrics was maximized (Fig. 2 C). In 24 out of 25 mice, the ratio consistently pointed to M ✱ = 3 optimal states (Fig. 2 C) and was accordingly chosen as the optimal number of states for all HMMs fitted to the LFPs of each individual mouse. We performed several control analysis to confirm the optimal number of states.
First, we validated our methodology (Supplementary Fig. S2 B–D). For this, we applied our model selection criteria to data generated from an HMM with three states. We simulated a 10-dimensional time series with a duration of ~35 min, sampled at 30 Hz (N = 60,000 samples), assuming diagonal Gaussian observations (Supplementary Fig. S2 B). The simulation was repeated 30 times, with randomization of the emission covariance matrix for each run. In all simulations, our model selection criteria successfully identified the optimal number of states, where the ratio between the cross-validated log-likelihood (5 - fold) and the top eigenvalue peaked at M ✱ = 3 states (Supplementary Fig. S2 C, D).
Second, for each mouse, we considered the trend of cross-validated LL over a range of states (Supplementary Fig. S2 E, F). As expected, the cross-validated LL increased (negative LL decreased) with the number of states until it reached a plateau (Supplementary Fig. S2 E). We selected the optimal number of states (M *) at the point where the incremental increase in the cross-validated LL had the largest drop (i.e. the point of greatest curvature, Elbow method) before the plateau. In majority of mice, we found that three states were optimal, although in some cases, the Elbow method selected over-fitted models (Supplementary Fig. S2 F).
Next, we used K-means clustering to cluster all the input LFP variables between K = 2 and K = 6 clusters (Supplementary Fig. S2 G). To determine the number of clusters (states), we applied the Elbow method to the percentage of variance explained by each clustering model. The percentage of explained variance is the ratio of the variance of the between-cluster sum of squares to the variance in the total sum of squares. Applying the Elbow method to each mouse, we selected the number of clusters, K *. In most mice, the LFPs optimally clustered into three or four separate groups, displaying a remarkably similar power distribution obtained via the HMM.
Lastly, we applied dimensionality reduction to the input LFP variables using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and evaluated the silhouette scores on the reduced input matrix based on three HMM states (Supplementary Fig. S2 H). The distribution of the silhouette scores across all mice further confirmed our model selection.

### The eighty five percent rule for optimal learning [^4606a300]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Simulations

To demonstrate the applicability of the Eighty Five Percent Rule we simulated the effect of training accuracy on learning in three cases, two from AI and one from computational neuroscience. From AI we consider how training at 85% accuracy impacts learning in the the simple case of a one-layer Perceptronwith artificial stimuli, and in the more complex case of a two-layer neural networkwith stimuli drawn from the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset of handwritten digits. From computational neuroscience we consider the model of Law and Gold, that accounts for both the behavior and neural firing properties of monkeys learning the Random Dot Motion task. In all cases we see that learning is maximized when training occurs at 85% accuracy.

### Development of numerical estimation in young children [^944be78f]. Child Development (2004). Low credibility.

Two experiments examined kindergartners', first graders', and second graders' numerical estimation, the internal representations that gave rise to the estimates, and the general hypothesis that developmental sequences within a domain tend to repeat themselves in new contexts. Development of estimation in this age range on 0-to-100 number lines followed the pattern observed previously with older children on 0-to-1,000 lines. Between kindergarten and second grade (6 and 8 years), patterns of estimates progressed from consistently logarithmic to a mixture of logarithmic and linear to a primarily linear pattern. Individual differences in number-line estimation correlated strongly with math achievement test scores, improved estimation accuracy proved attributable to increased linearity of estimates, and exposure to relevant experience tended to improve estimation accuracy.

### Social capital and health among older adults in South Africa [^ecaf269d]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Subjective health status was assessed with one question: "In general, how would you rate your health today?" Response options ranged from 1 = very good to 5 = very bad. This was dichotomised into 1 = very good or good and 0 = moderate to very bad.

Depressive symptoms were assessed by one question, "Overall in the last 30 days, how much of a problem did you have with feeling sad, low or depressed?" Response option ranged from 1 = none to 5 = extreme. Those who responded with severe or extreme were classified as having depressive symptoms.

Cognitive capacity. A battery of cognitive tests was used to measure cognitive performance, in order to measure objective indicators of various aspects of cognition. The cognitive tests included verbal recall, verbal fluency and digit span (forward and backward). The three cognitive tests, which together measure concentration, attention and immediate memory. Respondents were asked to produce as many words (names of animals) as possible in a one-minute time span. This test measures the ability to retrieve information from semantic memory. In the Verbal Fluency Test, each interviewee was asked to produce as many words as possible in a given category (animals), within a fixed time. The variables of interest are the number of correctly named animals. Immediate and delayed verbal recall: The person administering the test presented 10 words verbally, repeating the words three times to saturate the learning curve. After about 10 minutes, the respondent was asked to recall as many of the 10 words as possible, to test delayed recall and recognition. Thus, verbal recall scores indicate the average number of words recalled out of the 10 words presented. This test assesses learning capacity, memory storage and memory retrieval. Digit span (forward and backward): For the forward test, participants are read a series of digits (for example, "8, 3, 4") and must immediately repeat them back. If they recall the numbers correctly, they are given a longer series of digits, until failure. In the backward test, the person must repeat the numbers read to them, but in reverse order. The length of the longest list a person can remember in this fashion was that person's digit span and was an estimate of working memory. Overall cognition: The tests selected – word list recall, verbal fluency and digit span – accurately measure the cognitive domains most affected by impairment and the early stages of dementia. The overall cognitive score consists of a summation of the results, and converted to a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents worst cognition and 100 best cognitive functioning. The overall cognitive score was dichotomised by using the median into 48 or more (= 1) and less than 48 (= 0).

### Cognitive performance in dialysis patients-"when is the right time to test? " [^c099248e]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

RBANS

The RBANS is a brief, individually-administered test measuring cognitive function across five domains: attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and immediate and delayed memory. Performance in each domain is measured by the subtests (12 in total) described below, which are combined to yield five scaled "index scores" gauging function in the respective domains. These five index scores are in turn combined to yield a composite score referred to as the "total scale score". Stimuli are contained in a wire-bound, easel-type booklet, making the test easily portable and allowing for bedside administration. Total administration time is 20–30 min. Normative information from the manual for the index and total scores is based on 540 healthy adults who ranged in age from 20 to 89 years.

The battery was designed to be amenable to the construction of multiple equivalent forms, and there are different, equivalent versions of the RBANS available for test-retest use.

The domains comprise the following subtests:
Immediate Memory

List Learning: immediate recall of a 10-item list of words.
Story Memory: a 12 item story, read aloud for immediate recall over two trials.

2 Visuospatial/Constructional

Figure Copy: copying a geometric figure of 10 parts.
Line Orientation: a 10 item line orientation test.

3 Language

Picture Naming: 10-line drawings which the subject must name
Semantic Fluency: the total number of examples generated for a given semantic category within 60 s.

4 Attention

Digit Span: analogous to digits forward on the WAIS. There are two strings of digits in each item, each pair increasing in length from 2 to 9 digits. The second string of a given length is only read if the first string is failed.
Coding: numbers rather than symbols were chosen for the response in order to avoid the possible detrimental effect of a constructional apraxia on performance.

5 Delayed Memory

List Recall: free recall of the words from the List Learning task.
List Recognition: yes/no recognition testing for memory of the words from the List Learning task.
Story Recall: free recall of the story from the story memory test.
Figure Recall: free recall of the figure from the figure copy subtest.

All subtests of the RBANS were scored according to standardized age-adjusted criteria. Raw scores from the 12 subtests were converted to age- adjusted scaled scores before calculating an index score for each domain. The sum of the index scores was then converted to a total scale score.

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^dffe7e7d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The model can perform well with as little as 100 participants

The simulation analysis (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Figure 1) suggested that IDoCT can reliably capture measures of D, DS, AS and DT also when as little as 100 samples are used. Being able to obtain precise measures with a smaller sample size is fundamental, since large scale data collection is not always feasible. To confirm these results, IDoCT was applied to the Words Definitions and Digits Span tasks using a range of N samples between 100 and the maximum number of participants available (e.g. 36,392 for Digits Span and 358,894 for Words Definitions). Digits Span was selected as it is characterised by an adaptive staircase algorithm, with the most difficult samples being presented only to the best participants. On the other hand, Words Definitions consists of a relatively complex trial's space characterised by 150 different types of trials (i.e. words). The correlation between the measures of D, DS, AS and DT obtained when using different subsamples and the full dataset are presented in Fig. 4d, e. As can be observed, when training IDoCT on as little as 100 samples, in case of Digits Span, the Pearson's correlation between the IDoCT derived metrics using the subsample and the full sample was very high at 0.948, 0.974, 0.992, and 0.999 for D, DS, AS and DT respectively. Similarly, in case of Words Definitions, the minimum correlation obtained between the IDoCT derived metrics using the subsample and the full sample was 0.80, 0.826, 0.998, 0.999 for respectively D, DS, AS and DT. When repeating the subsample analysis (30 times) with different subsets of 100 participants, the results were consistent, and just a minimal drop in performance was observed. Specifically, the derived correlation was 0.99 ± 0.003, 0.999 ± 0.007, 0.74 ± 0.06 and 0.68 ± 0.08 for respectively DT, AS, D and DS in Words Definitions, and 0.86 ± 0.22, 0.72 ± 0.20, 0.97 ± 0.03, and 0.98 ± 0.03 for DT, AS, D and DS respectively in Digits Span.

### Digit-tracking as a new tactile interface for visual perception analysis [^c8df6b9d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The comparison between attention maps measured with eye-tracking and with digit-tracking was performed using a correlation analysis. For each picture and each recording method, a group attention map was computed by averaging the attention map across subjects, yielding two group-attention maps by picture, derived from two independent populations with two different recording method. Then, for each picture, the similarity between eye-tracking and digit-tracking measurements was evaluated using Pearson correlation for a total of 61 correlation coefficients for each dataset, and tested using non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests. Thus, for each dataset, the median correlation was tested using Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Bonferroni-corrected for the 2 comparisons) and the difference between the two median correlations was tested with uncorrected Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

The sensitivity to the noise of a recording method can be estimated using a counterbalanced inter-subject correlation analysis. Inter-subject correlations were calculated, for each image/technology couple, as the average Pearson correlation coefficient between the attention maps of one subject with the attention maps of another subject. The higher the inter-subject correlation (ISC) the more similar is the exploration between subjects. The linear relationship between ISC calculated with eye-tracking and with digit-tracking was evaluated with Pearson correlation, and the difference was tested using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

A key consideration in the building of an experiment is to estimate the minimal number of subjects necessary to obtain a stable and reliable measurement of the population behavior. In order to investigate this specific point, a convergence analysis was designed to estimate the minimal number of subjects necessary for each recording method, to obtain stable attention maps. For each picture, and each recording technology, a convergence curve was obtained using the following algorithm:
Choose a random permutation of N subjects.
Compute N attention-maps, estimated by averaging from 1 to N subjects.
For n = 2 to N, compute the percent of variance explained by n-1 subjects to the attention map computed with n subjects.
Repeat the steps 1, 2, and 3, 40 times, and average the 40 curves obtained.

This procedure yields one convergence curve per picture and these curves can then be averaged to obtain a convergence estimate for each technology (Fig. 2d). Then, for each picture and each technology, the minimal number of subjects necessary to explain 95% of the variance were determined and compared across technology using non-parametrical statistical testing and distributions analyses (Fig. 2e).

### Altered brain metabolism contributes to executive function deficits in school-aged children born very preterm [^5e784bfd]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Neurodevelopmental assessment

The neurodevelopmental tasks reported here have been described previously. In short, IQ was estimated with an abbreviated version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV, German version). To assess processing speed, the symbol search and coding subtests of the WISC-IVwere applied. Key aspects of executive function abilities (i.e. inhibition and interference, working memory, cognitive flexibility, fluency, and planning) were captured with standardized tasks.

To measure inhibition abilities, two tasks were applied. The stop-signal paradigmis a computerized task that requires participants to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to a go-stimulus (cartoon airplane) and to inhibit the response if a stop-stimulus (red frame around airplane) is presented. The dependent variable was the stop-signal reaction time, defined as the mean reaction time of the participant minus the mean delay of the stop-stimulus. The participants' interference control was investigated by the Color-Word-Interference task of the Delis−Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). The participant is presented with color names written in an incongruent ink color and asked to name the ink color and ignore the written word. This requires the participant to inhibit the more automatic word reading response (i.e. the "Stroop" effect). Completion time was used as dependent variable. Working memory was assessed by three tasks. The working memory subtest of the German "Test Battery for Attention Testing" (Testbatterie zur Aufmerksamkeitsprüfung; TAP)is a computerized two-back task. Participants are asked to indicate by button press if a briefly presented digit corresponds to the penultimately presented digit. The sum of omission and commission errors was used as dependent variable. In addition, the maximum backward span of the Corsi Block Tapping-Test, a visual-spatial working memory task, was used. Participants are instructed to tap a sequence of blocks in reverse order as shown by the examiner. Similarly, the maximum backward span of the subtest digit span (WISC-IV, German version)requires participants to repeat digit sequences in the reverse order in which they were read out. This served as dependent variable for verbal working memory. Cognitive flexibility was measured by two tasks. The Trail Making Task (D-KEFS)is a visuomotor sequencing task, which requires participants to switch between connecting numbers and letters in sequence. The completion time served as dependent variable. In the flexibility subtest of the TAP, participants are instructed to react alternately to changing target stimuli (i.e. round and angular shapes), which are presented in a pairwise manner. The number of errors served as dependent variable. Fluency was measured by two tasks. The Design Fluency task (D-KEFS)comprises three conditions: filled dots, empty dots, and switching. In each condition, the participants are instructed to draw different designs for 1 min using only four straight lines to connect the dots. The number of correct designs was used as the dependent variable. Additionally, participants' verbal fluency was assessed by three subtests of the Regensburger Wortflüssigkeitstest (RWT), a German-language verbal fluency test that requires participants to produce words in accordance with specific rules: In the semantic fluency subtest, types of animals have to be generated. In the switching subtests, words starting with the letters "G" and "R" (phonetic switching) and types of fruits and sports (semantic switching), respectively, have to be named in an alternating manner. The total number of correctly produced words in 2 minutes was used as dependent variables. Planning and problem-solving abilities were assessed with the Tower subtest of the D-KEFS, in which participants have to displace disks from a starting to an ending position by following a set of rules. A total achievement score, derived from the sum of total points achieved for all items, was recorded and served as a dependent variable (i.e. correct towers within the time limit with the fewest moves achieving the highest number of points). Reasons for the missing data included technical problems, measurement errors, time constraints, or fatigue effects. Parental SES (ranging from 2 to 12) was estimated based on information on maternal and paternal education.

### Digital immunoassay for biomarker concentration quantification using solid-state nanopores [^7e94eddc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Nanopore digital response characterization

To investigate and validate the dose response of our digital assay, we first characterized the response of the nanopore sensor as a function of different mixtures of known concentrations of junction strand and probes. For this, we fixed the concentration of both probes P-1 and P-2 at 20 nM and varied the concentration of the junction strand, from 0.2 nM (ratio of 0.01:1, junction strand-to-probe pair) to 400 nM (20:1). Figure 3a–c shows the scatter plots of the maximum blockage depth versus dwell time for all single-molecule events recorded for three junction strand-to-probe pair ratios (0.025:1, 1:1, and 10:1). The corresponding scatter plots for all concentrations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. As expected, with increasing junction strand concentration below the fixed probe pair concentration, we observed a linear increasing fraction of events attributed to the passage of dumbbell nanostructures, reaching a maximum at a ratio of 1, before the relative number of dumbbells linearly decreased again. This linear dose response is plotted in semi-log scale in Fig. 3d.

### Comprehensive cell type decomposition of circulating cell-free DNA with celFiE [^883a2650]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

E step

The Q function is defined at iteration i bywhere α (i) and β (i) are the parameter estimates of the cell type proportions and methylation proportions from the last EM step. Let, which is the probability that a methylated read at site m comes from cell type t given the previously estimated parameters from iteration i. Then Q i is

The first line in this equation captures the expected total number of methylated reads (first term in the sum) and the total number of expected unmethylated reads (second term) for each cell type and site. Each of these terms combines both the reference and cfDNA contribution, e.g. the first term combines the total methylated reads from the relevant reference cell type (Y t m) with the expected number of methylated reads from that cell type in the cfDNA mixture.

Complementary to the first line, the second line determines the likelihood of α and does not depend on β. It captures the likelihood of observing the expected cell type frequencies. This is given by the sum of the expected methylated and the expected unmethylated reads over all loci.

M step

To update the estimated cell type proportions, α, we maximize Q i under the constraint that α is a probability vector, i.e. its entries are non-negative and sum to one. The maximizer is

The numerator is simply the number of reads expected to originate from each cell type, which is calculated by adding the expected contributions from the methylated and the unmethylated reads. The proportions are then obtained by normalizing these numerators to sum to 1.

The other M step update is for β, the proportion of reads that are methylated at each site and in each cell type:

Intuitively, this is the ratio of the expected number of methylated vs. total reads from cell type t at site m. This update is conceptually similar to the α update in the sense that it matches an estimated proportion to an expected proportion. For α t, this is the expected proportion of reads deriving from cell type t; for β t m, this is the expected proportion of reads from cell type t that are methylated at site m.

### "Binary" and "non-binary" detection tasks: are current performance measures optimal? [^8d7e974c]. Academic Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

We have observed that a very large fraction of responses for several detection tasks during the performance of observer studies are in the extreme ranges of lower than 11% or higher than 89% regardless of the actual presence or absence of the abnormality in question or its subjectively rated "subtleness". This observation raises questions regarding the validity and appropriateness of using multicategory rating scales for such detection tasks. Monte Carlo simulation of binary and multicategory ratings for these tasks demonstrate that the use of the former (binary) often results in a less biased and more precise summary index and hence may lead to a higher statistical power for determining differences between modalities.

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^7158bac2]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Measures of trials' difficulty D and DS give insights into the most challenging aspects of each task

IDoCT was applied separately to each cognitive task analysed in the study. The first step of the model consisted in the computation of trials' difficulty D. IDoCT converged after ten iterations for all cognitive tasks, where the mean change in difficulty D tended to 0 across all types of trials (see Supplementary Fig. 2). The model tries to find estimates of trial difficulty that explain observed variability in performance (represented as a combination of accuracy and RT) across participants and trials. The difficulty estimates stop changing across iterations when the model derives difficulty measures that best explain the observed data. Concretely, further iterations could be computed, and the improvement would be negligible (i.e. tend to zero). The trial difficulty results are summarised in Fig. 3 and Table 2, where the mean difficulty D and DS per task is provided. Full results are available in Supplementary Figures 3 and 4.

Fig. 3
Estimated trial difficulty measure DS for Words Definitions, Motor Control, Digits Span and Spatial Span.

a Words definitions: most frequently used words in the English language are associated with easier trials. b Motor Control: the further the target from the previous location, the more difficult the trial. c Digits Span: the more digits participants have to remember, the higher the DS score. d Spatial Span: the more squares participants have to remember, the higher the DS score.

For IDoCT to run, the individual trials of a task must be labelled according to differences in modulated difficulty parameters, which are idiosyncratic given what a task is designed to measure, e.g. number of moves, spatial distance or presented word, interstimulus interval, etc. The trial difficulty estimates (DS and D) and measures of individuals' cognitive abilities (AS) relate to the specific demands that a given task manipulates. Fig. 3 reports how DS estimates, based on the overall populations' performances, vary with trial demands in the cases of Digits Span, Spatial Span, Words Definitions and Motor control. Detailed analysis for all tasks is reported in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4, where the interpretation of the derived DS is presented for each task.

### Augmented manipulation ability in humans with six-fingered hands [^2349e1e0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Joint movement of thumb, index and supernumerary finger: For each time point we computed the movement speed for each finger as the magnitude of its three-dimensional velocity vector at the fingertip. We then classified the movement state of each finger in each time point as either "rest" or "moving" by comparing the speed to a threshold value which was chosen as the 10th, 30th or 50th percentile of the speed distribution across all time points and all fingers. From these data we estimated the conditional probabilities that thumb and index finger or thumb alone or index finger alone were moving given the supernumerary finger was moving. These conditional probabilities were estimated for the three speed thresholds (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 6E).

Video game for six fingers

Polydactyly subjects sat in front of a computer monitor (DELL U2713HM) approximately 0.6 m from the screen, on which six target boxes were displayed in the lower centre of a black screen. During the experiment, oscillating cursors passed through the target boxes (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Movie 6). Each of these oscillating squares had a different frequency within a predefined range. The individual target boxes could be "touched" by pressing a corresponding key on a standard computer keyboard. Keys were chosen to match the hand geometry of individual subjects to ensure pressing the keys was comfortable. The subjects were instructed to track the oscillating cursors and to press the corresponding button once the cursor was within its associated target box. If the button was pressed within this time window, it counted as a correct press, if it was pressed outside it was counted as a false press. The number of correct and false presses were summed over all fingers and accumulated over the time of the trial.

### Optimization of diffusion measurements using cramer-rao lower bound theory and its application to articular cartilage [^e2c124a2]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A novel approach to optimized diffusion measurements by minimizing the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with respect to the b-values used for diffusion measurement was investigated. The applicability of the CRLB to these measurements is shown by the close agreement between the CRLB prediction and the actual precision obtained from experimental results. Where studies using a propagation-of-errors approach have restricted the optimization of the diffusion measurement to two b-values and to specific diffusion coefficient values, the CRLB approach sets no bounds on the number of b-values and is applicable to any system. The optimal number of b-values depends on the ratio of the maximum and minimum diffusion coefficients in the sample (the D(ratio)) and on the number of acquisitions. For a D(ratio) above 6.8 the optimal number of b-values increases to three; at a D(ratio) of 21.8 it increases to four. The optimized sampling schemes for ADC measurements in a variety of representative tissues found in the human body are given. For cartilage the optimal five-point acquisition scheme requires one measurement at a b-value of 0 and four at 1036 sec mm(-2), whereas brain requires one at 0, three at 660, and one at 1987 sec mm(-2).

### Distributed functional connectivity predicts neuropsychological test performance among older adults [^79e1903f]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2.2 KSHAP neuropsychological test

To test the generalizability of the predictive model, we identified eight homologous neuropsychological tests included in the KSHAP dataset. Similarity and correspondence of administration procedures and contents were scrutinized. For the attention and working memory, Digit Span Forward, and Digit Span Backward tests included in the Elderly Memory disorder Scale (Chey, 2007) were available. The score was the sum of all correct trials were counted from 2 to 8 lengths of digits. The category fluency test asked participants to generate words from the two semantic categories (i.e. animal and supermarket) each within a minute (Kang, Chin, Na, Lee, & Park, 2000; Kang, Jang, & Na, 2012). While interference condition of the original Trail Making Test in UDSNB asks to alternate between numbers and alphabets (Reitan & Wolfson, 1993), modified Trail Making Test (mTMT) asked to alternate between numbers and symbols (triangle and rectangle) to minimize the floor effect of illiterate elderly (M. Park & Chey, 2003; Seo et al. 2006). The mTMT Part A (Trail A) consisted of 15 consecutively numbered circles arranged randomly on a sheet of paper. Participants were asked to draw a line between the circles in ascending order as quickly as possible. In mTMT Part B, they were asked to draw between triangles and squares alternately. In mTMT Part C (Trail C), participants consecutively connected lines between 8 numbers (ascending order) and 7 shapes (triangle and square) in an alternating way (1 – △ – 2 – □ – 3 – △…). Total time consumed to complete the mTMT‐A and mTMT‐C were used in the analysis, and mTMT‐B was not used in the analysis due to the variability in the possible trail options. A few participants exceeded the typical time limit of mTMT‐A (150 s, n = 1) and mTMT‐C (300 s, n = 7), but a maximum of 300 and 600 s, respectively, were allowed to finish the task due to the participants' unskilled usage of pencil. Total time (s) to complete the lines were log‐transformed and inversed. The Story Recall Test included in the Elderly Memory disorder Scale was used to assess episodic memory function. The Story Recall Test consisted of one story modified from the Logical Memory subtest in WMS‐III into a more culturally familiar content (An & Chey, 2004). The SRT required subjects to recall a paragraph containing 24 semantic units and the delayed recall subtests were administered 15–30 min after the immediate recall session.

### A computational study on the optimization of transcranial temporal interfering stimulation with high-definition electrodes using unsupervised neural networks [^e740e560]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.6 Current normalization

Because the loss function is composed of relative ratios, the electrode currents returned by the proposed USNN must be normalized to achieve values with an appropriate magnitude. Generally, tES limits the magnitude of the electrode current to ensure safety. Many studies have limited the flow of currents to less than 2 mA from each electrode (Huang et al; Lee et al; Rampersad et al.) and, in some cases, the sum of the anodal currents is restricted to 4 mA (Electrode: Neuroelectrics User Manual; Starstim: Neuroelectrics User Manual). In this study, the modulation magnitude was calculated by applying both of these limitations, and the normalization equation is expressed as follows:In this equation, is a current vector generated from the electrode layer of a neural network, andis a current vector normalized such that the maximum current of the electrode does not exceed 2 mA. The sum of the currents in all electrodes is zero, and the sum of the anodal currents is equal to the sum of the cathodal currents. Therefore, I is a current vector normalized such that the sum of the absolute values of currents is less than 8 mA, which means that the sum of the anodal current is less than 4 mA.

2.7 Details of the computational study

2.7.1 Analysis by depth

To verify the performance of the proposed method, the changes in the results as a function of depth were analyzed. As shown in Figure 3, by dividing the front and rear endpoints of the head into nine equal parts on the vertical axis, the target positions were determined by entering from the front. The horizontal axis represents the position translated by dividing the right brain into three from the left, and the height is half that of the cerebrum. Therefore, the position was moved to a deeper location along the depth index. Each target consisted of 50 nodes in the cortex closest to the selected location. These five tissues were selected considering only the depth and were statistically tested on 16 head models; however, there are uncertainties due to inter‐subject variability and tissue properties. All LSE and USNN results were compared with those of single‐frequency tACS.

### HER2 testing and clinical decision making in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma: guideline from the college of American pathologists, American Society for Clinical Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology [^ab2d5432]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma HER2 in situ hybridization (ISH/FISH) evaluation — cell counts, ratios, and heterogeneity handling are specified as follows: "At least 20 nonoverlapping nuclei of tumor cells are evaluated for HER2 probe and CEP17 probe signal enumeration", and "A ratio of HER2 signal to CEP17 signal of 2.0 or greater is considered positive, and a ratio of HER2 signal to CEP17 signal below 2.0 is considered negative". For heterogeneous cases, observers should "Proceed to other invasive tumor areas until at least 20 cells are scored". Regarding CEP17 copy number increases, "Extra (three or more) copies of CEP17, on average, were noted in 4.1% of gastric cancers in the ToGA trial", and "In such cases, there are often four to six copies of both HER2 and CEP17 signals with a ratio below 2.0". When IHC is borderline and CEP17 copies are increased, decision rules are provided: "If IHC is 2+ and there are three or more CEP17 signals, on average, with a ratio below 2, then the presence of more than six HER2 signals, on average, is interpreted as positive for HER2 amplification by ISH/FISH; fewer than four HER2 signals, on average, is interpreted as negative for HER2 amplification; and four to six signals, on average, indicates another 20 cells should be scored in a different target area".

### The eighty five percent rule for optimal learning [^85cf0442]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Two-layer network with MNIST stimuli

As a more demanding test of the Eighty Five Percent Rule, we consider the case of a two-layer neural network applied to more realistic stimuli from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is a labeled dataset of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) that has been widely used as a test of image classification algorithms (see ref.for a list). The dataset is broken down into a training set consistent of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. To create binary classification tasks based on these images, we trained the network to classify the images according to either the parity (odd or even) or magnitude (less than 5 or not) of the number.

The network itself consisted of 1 input layer, with 400 units corresponding to the pixel values in the images, 1 hidden layer, with 50 neurons, and one output unit. Unlike the Perceptron, activity of the output unit was graded and was determined by a sigmoid function of the decision variable, h where the decision variable was given bywhere w 2 were the weights connecting the hidden layer to the output units and a was the activity in the hidden layer. This hidden-layer activity was also determined by a sigmoidal functionwhere the inputs, x, corresponds to the pixel values in the image and w 1 were the weights from the input layer to the hidden layer.

All weights were trained using the Backpropagation algorithmwhich takes the error, and propagates it backwards through the network, from output to input stage, as a teaching signal for the weights. This algorithm implements stochastic gradient descent and, if our assumptions are met, should optimize learning at a training accuracy of 85%.

### Long-term effects of compulsory schooling on physical, mental and cognitive ageing: a natural experiment [^9042a05c]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

In Constances, mental health was measured using the 20-item version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), a validated depressive symptoms scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms and a cut-off of 16 for men and 20 for women was used to define elevated levels of depressive symptoms.

Cognitive function was assessed by trained neuropsychologists using five tests. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a general test of cognitive function consisting of 30 questions assessing five areas of cognition: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. The Digit-Symbol Substitution Task of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale IV assesses psychomotor speed. The respondents were presented with nine digit-symbol pairs, followed by a list of numerical digits. They were asked to write the corresponding symbol under each digit as fast as possible. We retain the number of symbols correctly associated in 90 s. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) measures verbal episodic memory. Respondents were first asked to read and memorise 16 words, then asked to recall as many words as possible in 2 min. The neuropsychologist provided a cue for each word that has not been retrieved. For this study, we include the FCSRT free immediate recall score. Finally, two verbal fluency tasks were included to assess language abilities: number of words related to the 'animals' category named in 1 min for the semantic fluency task and number of words starting with the letter 'R' named in 1 min for the phonemic fluency task. As the scale of each individual cognitive test differs, each score is converted to a z-score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD. A global cognitive score is obtained by summing the standardised tests. High cognitive performance is defined as the top quartile of the global score's distribution.

Physical functioning is assessed based on three objective health measures. Hand grip strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Participants were asked to sit and squeeze the dynamometer for a few seconds with their dominant hand. The exercise was repeated three times and grip strength was determined as the average of the three results. Finger tapping, a measure of motor performance, was assessed by the number of taps respondents could do with the index finger of their dominant hand for 15 s. Walking speed was measured as the time taken by respondents to walk 3 m at a rapid pace. For each physical health outcome, high levels of physical functioning are defined based on the top quartile of the distribution.

Nuclear cardiology image quality and counts — signal-to-noise relationships and acquisition parameters are characterized by noise being approximately the square root of number of counts, so with 100 counts noise would be about 10 and signal to noise ratio 10, whereas with 10,000 counts the signal to noise ratio would be 100. Three variables affect the number of registered counts — the imaging system's sensitivity, the amount of radioactivity administered to the subject, and the length of time that counts are acquired — and a given scan is typically conducted until a requisite number of counts has been collected; if the radiopharmaceutical dose is small a longer scan acquisition time will be required, but patients cannot lie still indefinitely, placing practical limits on acquisition duration.

D–F show the cumulative distribution function for predicted (D) contour, (E) digits, and (F) hand scores; the two curves correspond to cohorts defined by the ground truth score assigned to the clock contour by human annotators (unsatisfactory = 0, and satisfactory = 1) and the area between curves shows reasonable separation between classes. G–I show annotated clock drawings representing predicted score percentiles in the lowest quartile, median, and top quartile for each (G) contour, (H) digits, and (I) hand human‐assigned scores; green labels the digits identified by the computer, purple identifies the hands, and yellow shows the circle that best fits the centroid.

FIGURE 2
Validation data needed to examine overall clock drawing task. Note: A shows the cumulative distribution function plot for overall clock drawing task scores. Ground truth scores defined by the total score received on the clock drawing task as determined by human annotators: total score of 0 (n = 20), total score of 1 (n = 141), total score of 2 (n = 532), and total score of 3 (n = 729). The curves demonstrate the expected separation, although all lower scores show a significant skew upward, probably because of the general data imbalance. B shows the box and whisker plot of the summed predicted clock scores compared with the adjusted total Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Adjusted total MoCA score is provided by subtracting the human‐assigned clock score from the original total score. Regression lines of the mean predicted score (red) and the mean ground truth scores (blue) for each MoCA score group are shown superimposed over the plot.

### Physical activity and exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period: ACOG committee opinion, number 804 [^7aa306cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Recommended weight limits for lifting at work during pregnancy — an on-page algorithm and stepwise method describe how to determine a recommended weight limit (RWL). The algorithm asks, "At work do you perform lifting tasks more than once every 5 minutes?" and, if yes, "Do you lift more than three times per minute?", then queries "How many hours per day do you spend lifting at work?" with categories "Less than 1 continuous hour" or "1 or more hours per day", corresponding to infrequent, repetitive short duration, or repetitive long duration lifting panels. Steps instruct to "select the one graphic (A, B, or C) that best describes the lifting frequency or frequency/duration pattern", then "When less than 20 weeks pregnant, select the image on the left of the graphic; when pregnant for 20 weeks or more, select the image on the right", to underline all relevant numerical values along the lift path and circle the lowest, and that "The number circled in step 3 is the RWL (in pounds)" with a proviso that the short-duration category can include multiple hours per day provided each continuous bout is less than 1 hour and followed by at least 1 hour of nonlifting before resuming; the figure presents "Provisional recommended weight limits for lifting at work during pregnancy".

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation position paper: redefining the cystic fibrosis care team [^d0e800bf]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2024). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis care team outpatient staffing — requirements, duties, and FTE ratios are outlined as follows: Outpatient staffing requirements for CF care centers depend on the number and complexity of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) served, and duties extend beyond clinic hours to unscheduled calls, insurance approvals, education, treatment implementation, coordination across providers, and facilitation between inpatient and outpatient settings; historically, one full-time equivalent (FTE) for each clinical role had been allocated for every 100–200 pwCF, and suggested outpatient staffing ratios are provided in a supplemental table; team members may fulfill multiple roles provided that the sum of recommended FTEs for those roles does not exceed the FTE allotted for that individual's CF care role, FTE recommendations are based on outpatient clinical labor and leadership or programmatic responsibilities should also be considered; adult care programs should plan for an increased number and/or effort of team members to address growth of the adult CF population.

### 2022 ASNC / AAPM / SCCT / SNMMI guideline for the use of CT in hybrid nuclear / CT cardiac imaging [^a938948a]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Hybrid cardiac imaging — display calibration and medical monitor characteristics note that for nuclear cardiology and hybrid imaging applications, because of the relatively small size of the image pixel matrix, the display's pixel pitch and number of megapixels is less important than in some other radiology applications, and it is recommended that display luminance response be calibrated using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Part 14 Grayscale Standard Display Function (GSDF) to ensure consistent images across different workstations; medical-use monitors are often pre-calibrated to the DICOM GSDF and include integrated light sensors enabling automatic monitoring of maximum luminance and luminance response, with features that support continuous luminance stabilization, can initiate self-calibration when necessary, and can alert the user when uncorrectable degradation begins to occur, recognizing that display luminance declines naturally over time and the luminance ratio becomes increasingly narrow.

### Number development and developmental dyscalculia [^e45e7f45]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

There is a growing consensus that the neuropsychological underpinnings of developmental dyscalculia (DD) are a genetically determined disorder of 'number sense', a term denoting the ability to represent and manipulate numerical magnitude nonverbally on an internal number line. However, this spatially-oriented number line develops during elementary school and requires additional cognitive components including working memory and number symbolization (language). Thus, there may be children with familial-genetic DD with deficits limited to number sense and others with DD and comorbidities such as language delay, dyslexia, or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. This duality is supported by epidemiological data indicating that two-thirds of children with DD have comorbid conditions while one-third have pure DD. Clinically, they differ according to their profile of arithmetic difficulties. fMRI studies indicate that parietal areas (important for number functions), and frontal regions (dominant for executive working memory and attention functions), are under-activated in children with DD. A four-step developmental model that allows prediction of different pathways for DD is presented. The core-system representation of numerical magnitude (cardinality; step 1) provides the meaning of 'number', a precondition to acquiring linguistic (step 2), and Arabic (step 3) number symbols, while a growing working memory enables neuroplastic development of an expanding mental number line during school years (step 4). Therapeutic and educational interventions can be drawn from this model.
