## Question

A 19-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by his roommate for 'strange' behavior over the last 48 hours. The patient states that he is hearing voices speak to him, giving him secret messages and instructions to carry out. He believes that the FBI is following him and spying on his conversations. The patient is concerned that they are listening to these messages and will find out his secrets. The patient's friend does not believe the patient ingested any substance or used any recreational drugs prior to this episode. A negative drug screen is obtained and confirms this. Physical examination does not reveal any abnormalities. Which of the following treatments might best target this patient's symptoms?
A. Sertraline
B. Risperidone
C. Chlorpromazine
D. Psychotherapy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which treatment best targets auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions in a 19-year-old male with a likely first-episode psychosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether this fits first-episode psychosis. Then, I should verify the immediate treatment goals and guideline-concordant first-line pharmacotherapy. Next, I will compare the options against evidence and guidelines, including when psychotherapy is appropriate. Finally, I will consider dosing, monitoring, and follow-up, and I will double-check any points where I might be overgeneralizing from adult data to late adolescence/early adulthood.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its urgency. The patient has command auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions with impaired reality testing, which are core positive symptoms of psychosis and strongly suggest a first-episode psychosis presentation in late adolescence/early adulthood, a period of peak incidence for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, warranting prompt antipsychotic treatment and coordinated specialty care referral [^114t93ve] [^1126vTBv] [^115usPSg].

> Wait, let me verify the differential briefly before jumping to treatment. Substance-induced psychosis is less likely here given a negative drug screen and collateral history, but I should still keep in mind that some synthetic cannabinoids and other agents can be missed on standard screens, so ongoing clinical vigilance is prudent; nonetheless, the current evidence supports proceeding with treatment for presumed primary psychosis while continuing diagnostic clarification and safety monitoring [^111D5gaN] [^112ocfn7].

> I need to ensure the treatment target is explicit. The immediate, highest-yield targets are positive symptoms — auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions — which respond primarily to dopamine D2 receptor blockade from antipsychotic medication. Psychotherapy and SSRIs do not directly treat these symptoms in the acute phase, though they have important roles later in recovery and maintenance [^112ocfn7] [^115mMf9X].

> Now, I will examine the pharmacologic options against guidelines. Risperidone, a second-generation antipsychotic, is a first-line agent for first-episode psychosis and is recommended to be initiated early in coordinated specialty care programs; it has robust evidence for reducing positive symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions, and is commonly used in early psychosis algorithms [^115usPSg]. Hold on, I should verify the comparative evidence signal: a randomized trial in early-onset psychosis showed aripiprazole and quetiapine-ER had similar efficacy with different side-effect profiles, supporting the class efficacy of SGAs for positive symptoms, and risperidone's receptor profile and clinical experience align with strong antipsychotic efficacy in this domain [^115yAGY6].

> Let me consider the other choices carefully. Sertraline is an SSRI and treats mood and anxiety, not psychosis; using it here would not address hallucinations or delusions and could theoretically worsen psychosis via serotonergic mechanisms in vulnerable patients, so it is not appropriate as primary treatment for these symptoms [^112ocfn7]. Psychotherapy, including CBT for psychosis, is guideline-recommended as an adjunct but is not sufficient as monotherapy in acute first-episode psychosis with active positive symptoms; it should follow stabilization with antipsychotic treatment and coordinated care [^115mMf9X] [^1126vTBv]. Chlorpromazine is a first-generation antipsychotic with higher risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects; while effective, SGAs are generally preferred first-line in early psychosis due to a more favorable risk–benefit profile, so chlorpromazine would be a less optimal initial choice here [^112ocfn7].

> I should double-check dosing and titration pragmatics. Typical risperidone initiation in first-episode psychosis starts around 1 mg/day with cautious titration toward 2–4 mg/day based on response and tolerability, with close monitoring for EPS, metabolic effects, and prolactin changes; this aligns with standard early-psychosis practice patterns and the principle of using the minimum effective dose in first episode [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach is consistent with early-intervention frameworks; yes, coordinated specialty care emphasizes rapid initiation and careful monitoring in the first episode, which fits this plan [^111TSXmL].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I need to ensure baseline and serial assessments of weight, BMI, blood pressure, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and lipids, alongside movement-disorder checks for akathisia, parkinsonism, and dystonia at each visit; vitals and mental status should be tracked frequently during acute stabilization, consistent with VA/DoD monitoring guidance [^111yfBZc] [^111TSXmL]. I should confirm that early response benchmarks are reasonable: aiming for at least a 25% reduction in symptom severity within about 2 weeks and 40–50% by 6 weeks is a pragmatic, guideline-supported target in first episode, which helps guide dose adjustments and early switching decisions if response is inadequate [^11716Rmw].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite an adequate risperidone trial? I need to ensure a plan for treatment resistance. If there is inadequate response after an adequate dose and duration of two different antipsychotics, clozapine is recommended for treatment-resistant schizophrenia; this should be considered after reviewing diagnosis, adherence, and side effects, and in the context of coordinated care [^113dtKdA] [^115rD2yX] [^112qhYBB].

> I will now examine the role of psychotherapy and nonpharmacologic care so I don't understate it. CBT for psychosis and coordinated specialty care improve outcomes and should be integrated early alongside medication; specialized early intervention services enhance engagement, reduce hospitalization, and improve functioning, which are critical in late adolescence and early adulthood [^115mMf9X] [^114Rq5bo] [^1126vTBv].

> Final answer: Risperidone is the best initial treatment to target this patient's auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions, with initiation in a coordinated specialty care program, close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects, and timely addition of psychotherapy and psychosocial supports to optimize recovery trajectory [^112ocfn7] [^115usPSg] [^115mMf9X].

The best treatment for this 19-year-old male with acute psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions) is **risperidone**, a second-generation antipsychotic that directly targets positive symptoms [^112ocfn7]. Sertraline is ineffective for psychosis, psychotherapy alone is insufficient in the acute phase, and chlorpromazine is less favored due to higher side-effect burden. Risperidone is **first-line** for first-episode psychosis and should be started with close monitoring for side effects and adherence [^1129pAHi] [^112ocfn7] [^113Gx7sU].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Before initiating treatment, it is essential to consider the **differential diagnosis** for acute psychotic symptoms:

- **Primary psychotic disorders**: Schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder [^116z82yF] [^114oax7K].

- **Substance-induced psychosis**: Methamphetamine, cannabis, LSD, synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. spice) [^113evyc5] [^111D5gaN].

- **Medical conditions**: Thyroid dysfunction, CNS infections, delirium, metabolic disturbances [^115zwdJB].

- **Mood disorders with psychotic features**: Major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder with psychotic features [^1139SwUx].

Given the negative drug screen and absence of medical abnormalities, a **primary psychotic disorder** is most likely [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological treatment options

### Antipsychotic medications

Antipsychotics are the cornerstone of treatment for psychotic symptoms, particularly **hallucinations and delusions** [^114W5jd5]. They are broadly categorized into **first-generation (typical) antipsychotics** — such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and fluphenazine — and **second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics** — such as risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone [^notfound].

---

### Comparison of antipsychotic medications

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Side effects** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Risperidone | High efficacy for positive symptoms | - Low extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) <br/> - Moderate metabolic side effects | - First-line for first-episode psychosis <br/> - Long-acting injectable available [^notfound] |
| Chlorpromazine | Moderate efficacy | - High EPS <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Anticholinergic effects | Less favored due to side-effect profile |
| Olanzapine | High efficacy | - Significant metabolic side effects <br/> - Weight gain | Effective but metabolic risk limits use |
| Quetiapine | Moderate efficacy | - Sedation <br/> - Metabolic side effects | Useful for comorbid insomnia or anxiety |
| Aripiprazole | Moderate efficacy | - Low metabolic risk <br/> - Akathisia | Alternative option with lower metabolic risk |

---

Risperidone is **particularly effective** in reducing positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, with a relatively favorable side-effect profile compared to first-generation antipsychotics like chlorpromazine [^116h9YWW].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) guidelines recommend **second-generation antipsychotics** as first-line treatment for first-episode psychosis due to their efficacy and favorable side-effect profiles [^113Gx7sU]. Risperidone is specifically recommended as a first-line agent for first-episode psychosis [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

While pharmacological treatment is essential, **non-pharmacological interventions** play a crucial role in comprehensive care:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective in reducing symptom severity, improving functioning, and enhancing adherence to medication [^notfound].

- **Psychoeducation**: Essential for patients and families to understand the illness, recognize early warning signs, and manage symptoms effectively [^115usPSg].

- **Coordinated specialty care (CSC)**: Multidisciplinary approach involving medication management, psychotherapy, case management, and family support, shown to improve outcomes in first-episode psychosis [^114Rq5bo].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **symptom severity, side effects, and adherence** is essential. The VA/DoD guidelines recommend frequent follow-up visits, especially during the acute phase, to assess treatment response and adjust medication as necessary [^111TSXmL].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and current clinical guidelines, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is **risperidone**, a second-generation antipsychotic medication [^1129pAHi]. Risperidone is effective in reducing positive symptoms such as auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions, and it has a favorable side-effect profile compared to first-generation antipsychotics [^114oax7K]. Initiate risperidone therapy with close monitoring for side effects, adherence, and symptom improvement. Combine pharmacological treatment with non-pharmacological interventions such as CBT and psychoeducation to optimize outcomes [^115mMf9X].

5.3 Hallucinations/Psychotic Behavior

Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with GOCOVRI because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In controlled trials, the incidence of patients who experienced visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, delusions, illusions, or paranoia was 25% in patients treated with GOCOVRI 274 mg, and 3% in placebo-treated patients. Hallucinations caused discontinuation of treatment in 8% of GOCOVRI-treated patients, and in 0% of placebo-treated patients.

Observe patients for the occurrence of hallucinations throughout treatment, especially at initiation, and after dose increases.

5.4 Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension

In controlled clinical trials, 29% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients experienced dizziness, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, presyncope, postural dizziness or hypotension. In GOCOVRI-treated patients, 3% discontinued study treatment because of dizziness, postural dizziness, or syncope, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

Monitor patients for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting GOCOVRI or increasing the dose. Concomitant use of alcohol when using GOCOVRI is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

5.5 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion

A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone.

Abrupt discontinuation of GOCOVRI may cause an increase in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease or cause delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression, or slurred speech. It is recommended to avoid sudden discontinuation of GOCOVRI [see Dosing Information (2.4)].

### Psychotic PTSD? Sudden traumatic loss precipitating very late onset schizophrenia [^116ER4V1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Understanding the role of trauma in psychosis also has important implications for treatment. Treatment for PTSD focusses on a trauma-focussed psychological approach, with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommending use of antipsychotics only where psychotic features are present. By contrast, medication remains the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia; NICE recommends the use of cognitive behavioural therapy, however this is focussed on addressing symptoms. In a recent randomised controlled trial trauma-focussed therapy (TFT) has been shown to be safe and effective for patients with PTSD and comorbid psychosis, and significantly improved rates of remission from schizophrenia at 12-month follow-up, suggesting that TFT may also prove efficacious in psychosis more generally, including in cases of more insidious developmental trauma. A psychological approach appears particularly relevant for patients who have experienced severe trauma, where illness narratives are often highly complex, including political upheaval and the cultural dislocation associated with migration.

Previous authors have proposed that a psychotic PTSD subtype, also termed PTSD with secondary psychosis (PTSD-SP), should be considered a discrete diagnosis, where both psychosis and PTSD are precipitated by trauma in a person with no prior features of psychosis. Intact reality testing and a lack of thought disorder differentiate PTSD-SP from schizophrenia. Furthermore delusions in PTSD-SP are typically persecutory, whereas in schizophrenia they may also be bizarre and complex. In keeping with this, we postulate a spectrum of responses to trauma, organised according to the pervasiveness of dissociation, from peritraumatic dissociation leading to resolution (acute stress reaction), through failure to integrate traumatic memories with everyday experiences (PTSD and PTSD-SP), to a complete fragmentation of ego-consciousness (schizophrenia). We envisage that the less severe end of this spectrum is more commonly seen to follow abrupt trauma. As such, relatively few cases of schizophrenia result from an identifiable, sudden traumatic event.

### Modafinil [^113zCTuh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Psychiatric Symptoms

Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with modafinil.

In the adult modafinil tablets controlled trials, psychiatric symptoms resulting in treatment discontinuation (at a frequency ≥ 0.3%) and reported more often in patients treated with modafinil tablets compared to those treated with placebo were anxiety (1%), nervousness (1%), insomnia (< 1%), confusion (< 1%), agitation (< 1%), and depression (< 1%).

Postmarketing adverse reactions associated with the use of modafinil have included mania, delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and aggression, some resulting in hospitalization. Many, but not all, patients had a prior psychiatric history. One healthy male volunteer developed ideas of reference, paranoid delusions, and auditory hallucinations in association with multiple daily 600 mg doses of modafinil tablets (three times the recommended dose) and sleep deprivation. There was no evidence of psychosis 36 hours after drug discontinuation.

Caution should be exercised when modafinil tablets are given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania. Consideration should be given to the possible emergence or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms in patients treated with modafinil tablets. If psychiatric symptoms develop in association with modafinil tablets administration, consider discontinuing modafinil tablets.

5.6 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machinery

Although modafinil tablets have not been shown to produce functional impairment, any drug affecting the CNS may alter judgment, thinking or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or other hazardous machinery until it is reasonably certain that modafinil tablets therapy will not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

### Aripiprazole (Abilify asimtufii) [^1175qRD8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Short-Term Efficacy

In the short-term (12-week), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in acutely relapsed adults (Study 1), the primary measure used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30-item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in PANSS total score to week 10.

The inclusion criteria for this short-term trial included adult inpatients who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia. In addition, all patients entering the trial must have experienced an acute psychotic episode as defined by both PANSS Total Score ≥ 80 and a PANSS score of > 4 on each of four specific psychotic symptoms (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness/persecution, unusual thought content) at screening and baseline. The key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) assessment scale to week 10. The CGI-S rates the severity of mental illness on a scale of 1 (normal) to 7 (among the most extremely ill) based on the total clinical experience of the rater in treating patients with schizophrenia. Patients had a mean PANSS total score of 103 (range 82 to 144) and a CGI-S score of 5.2 (markedly ill) at entry.

In this 12-week study (n = 339) comparing Abilify Maintena (n = 167) to placebo (n = 172), patients were administered 400 mg Abilify Maintena or placebo on days 0, 28, and 56. The dose could be adjusted down and up within the range of 400 to 300 mg on a one-time basis. Abilify Maintena was superior to placebo in improving the PANSS total score at the end of week 10 (see Table 8).

The change in PANSS total score by week is shown in Figure 15. Abilify Maintena also showed improvement in symptoms represented by CGI-S score mean change from baseline to week 10. The results of exploratory subgroup analyses by gender, race, age, ethnicity, and BMI were similar to the results of the overall population.

### Efficacy and tolerability of second-generation antipsychotics in children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^117BBvt9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many clinicians view schizophrenia in childhood or adolescence as relatively rare; however, this belief is not fully accurate. Although the prevalence of childhood-onset schizophrenia (onset of psychotic symptoms before 13 years of age) is indeed very low (approximately 1/100 cases of schizophrenia), the incidence of schizophrenia rises sharply at about 12–14 years of age. Before 18 years of age, approximately 12%–33% of individuals with schizophrenia would develop the onset of their illness, and thus would be classified as having an early-onset schizophrenia-spectrum (EOSS) disorder.

When Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third/Fourth Edition (DSM-III/IV), criteria are rigorously applied, clinical and neurobiological studies have demonstrated a number of phenomenological similarities in the presentation of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (ie, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder) in children/adolescents and adults with regard to the relative frequency of core psychotic symptoms (eg, auditory hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder), neurocognitive impairments, psychophysiological abnormalities, and the presence of structural brain abnormalities. In comparison to adults with schizophrenia, there is an increased rate of premorbid abnormalitiesand a rarity of well-formulated delusions reported by children/adolescents.EOSS disorder patients frequently manifest early impairments in expressive language, motor function, and transient symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder well in advance of the first onset of psychotic symptoms. However, children with EOSS disorder and autistic disorder can be distinguished on the basis of developmental history, clinical features, family history, and age at onset. Higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity in EOSS disorder (ie, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and major depressive disorder) appear to be another important developmental difference between adults and youth with schizophrenia. However, in children/adolescents pharmacological treatment of these comorbid conditions is rare that may reflect a lack of empirically driven guidelines for appropriate treatment and/or the hierarchical diagnostic system that is characteristic of DSM-IV. It is important to note that psychotic symptoms are not specific to schizophrenia, and the differential diagnosis of EOSS disorder would include substance abuse, mood and anxiety disorders, and various medical conditions (eg, seizure disorders, infectious disease, metabolic and endocrine disorders, central nervous system lesions, etc). Also, there are a sizable number of children and adolescents with subsyndromal conditions who report psychotic symptoms that would not meet the severity/duration criteria required by DSM-IV to qualify for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^114t93ve]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Schizophrenia — neurodevelopmental features, prodrome, and symptom domains are described as follows: Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with language and motor delays in childhood, premorbid attentional problems, and often mild social impairment, and in adolescence and young adulthood there is typically a prodromal period marked by major deficits in attention, social withdrawal, function decline, and emergence of subthreshold psychotic symptoms; the development of threshold psychotic symptoms often occurs in the context of a life change or stressor relevant to young adult Veterans returning to the United States who can have prodromal symptoms or a first episode of psychosis. Schizophrenia impacts many areas of an individual's life with deficits in perceptual, motor, cognitive, and emotional functioning, with perceptual deficits (positive symptoms) involving distortions such as hallucinations and delusions, motor deficits including unnatural postures or involuntary movements, and negative symptoms clustering into two main components of diminished emotional expression and severe reduction in goal-directed activities because of lack of interest or drive.

### Dopamine manipulations modulate paranoid social inferences in healthy people [^113w9TNg]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiograms were taken, and participants excluded if parameters were exceeded (QTc: 330–430; PR: 120–210; QT: 270–470; QRS: < 120; Heart Rate: 40–90 bpm). Additionally, blood pressure was taken, with acceptable mmHg within 90–140 (systolic) and 40–90 (diastolic) when supine and after 2 min of standing.

A neurological assessment was made by the medical team, testing for tremor, nystagmus, pupillary reactivity, reflex test, finger-nose test, Romberg's sign, gait, shoulder girdle strength, upper extremities strength, lower extremities strength, and myoclonic jerks. General appearance, dermatological signs, respiratory signs, cardiovascular health, abdominal signs, extremities, and musculoskeletal signs were all assessed, and participants included if normal.

Participants were given a full psychiatric exam by the medical team and excluded if any clinically significant signs or symptoms were reported, either currently or historically.

Participants then completed the OCEAN personality questionnaire, Brief OLIFE, Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale, and Bond and Lader mood rating scale.

At least 7 days later participants were then invited back for the first study session if they had satisfactorily passed the assessment day. Participants were paid £20 if they failed the screening day. Each study day was spaced by at least 7 days, but no more than two months. Each study day was identical in procedure. Participants were requested to abstain from alcohol and caffeine at least 24 h before the study day. Study days began with a similar screening procedure to the screening day. ECGs, blood pressure, urinalysis, drug screening, neurological, and physical checks were all completed upon arrival. Participants were also asked to complete the Bond and Lader mood rating scale prior to initial dosing.

Case presentations

A 72-year-old woman with hypertension developed gradual short-term memory impairment 9 years prior to presentation. This cognitive decline manifested through frequent misplacement of belongings, suggesting insidious onset of her neurodegenerative disorder. During cognitive decline, the patient showed characteristic neuropsychiatric symptoms, including delusions (false accusations of abandonment and theft) and auditory hallucinations. The symptom profile, particularly visuospatial disorientation and complex delusions, indicated right hemispheric involvement in the disease process. Auditory hallucinations of insults directed at the patient were reported, indicating paranoid symptoms. These episodes led to her inability to find her way home, showing advancing cognitive impairment.

6 years prior, brain MRI revealed 'bilateral cerebral white matter lesions and brain atrophy'. The patient scored 22 on the Mini–Mental State Examination and was diagnosed with mixed-type Alzheimer's disease (AD). Treatment with 5 mg/night donepezil hydrochloride was initiated to improve memory but proved ineffective. 3 years prior, the patient showed unstable emotions, irritability, shouting, depressive mood, poor sleep, unstable gait, frequent falls and urinary incontinence. Multiple hospital visits led to a diagnosis of AD and depression. Treatment with 10 mg/night of memantine, 5 mg/night of donepezil, 10 mg/morning of paroxetine and 0.5 tablets/night of lorazepam failed to improve her condition. The patient visited our hospital in March 2023.

The patient remained conscious and cooperative, with normal orientation to time, space, and person. A decline was observed in memory and computational abilities, manifesting as inability to perform simple subtraction. Deficits in judgement and naming were apparent, including inability to distinguish chickens from ducks. These cognitive deficits indicate deteriorating condition consistent with NIID. No auditory or other hallucinations were elicited, no delusions of persecution or paranoia were detected, and only partial insight was present. Broad-based gait, difficulty initiating movement, unsteady gait, left foot eversion and negative cranial nerve findings. Muscle strength was grade V in upper limbs and grade IV in lower limbs, with increased muscle tone, normal tendon reflexes bilaterally, and no abnormalities in deep or superficial sensation. The finger-to-nose test was unsteady, with positive Romberg's sign, inability to perform straight-line walking and negative bilateral pathological reflex.

4. There are real dangers

We need to be clear that real dangers exist, that people do bad things to others, and that safety can seldom be guaranteed. Recognizing these facts is not paranoia. Paranoia can be seen as an example of risk assessment gone awry. Moreover, the defences adopted in the face of perceived threat tend to bring additional problems.

5. Causation is multi-factorial

Multiple factors are needed to explain paranoia, and these may vary in the individual instance. Each cause is likely an "inus condition" — "an insufficient but non-redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition". A single cause therefore only increases the probability of a delusion occurring. Greater exposure to environmental risks lessens the need for genetic risk for paranoia to occur. In a recent study, we found that thirteen factors were required to explain two-thirds of the variance across the population in paranoia. In reality, paranoia is likely to emerge from a complex network of interacting factors, many of which will be shared with other common mental health problems.

6. Develop and use better measures

Increasingly, I find that each advance in the theory or treatment of paranoia requires the development of better assessments. This is time well spent. Precise measurement is a powerful means to drive understanding, identify treatment targets, and evaluate outcomes. Regarding the nature of that measurement, however strong the desire to identify biomarkers the best source of information will be patient self-report. Of course, a few patients sometimes do not report accurately. But this is no reason to dismiss the testimony of the overwhelming majority. A far bigger problem is that existing measures are frequently neither patient-centered, psychometrically robust, nor indeed even used in services. When it comes to patient benefit, the single most important innovation would be for services to repeatedly assess patients on appropriate well-developed measures and use the results to guide, monitor, and, when needed, alter the treatment provision.

### Three cases of "spice" exposure [^111D5gaN]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

We describe three cases with confirmed exposure to "spice" by detection of the metabolites JWH-018 and/or JWH-073 in urine. All cases had a negative urine drug screen. Case 1. A 25-year-old male with possible seizure, tachycardia, acidosis, and unresponsiveness, presented to a local emergency department (ED) after smoking a "spice" product. His symptoms resolved with benzodiazepines, fluid, and observation. His urine tested positive for JWH-018 and negative for JWH-073 metabolites. Case 2. A 21-year-old male was found unresponsive after smoking "spice". He had hypertension, was agitated, and had a Glasgow Coma Score of 7; the patient was intubated. The skin was warm and dry. His symptoms resolved with IV fluids and he was discharged home after 24 h. His urine tested positive for metabolites of JWH-018 and JWH-073. Case 3. A 19-year-old male was brought to the ED 1 h after smoking a "spice" product and having paranoia and delusions. His urine tested positive for JWH-018 and JWH-073 metabolites. He was discharged asymptomatic after observation for a few hours.

Discussion

Spice products are new and abused for their psychogenic effects and mood alteration. These cases exhibited changes consistent with either an anticholinergic or sympathomimetic agent that resolved following general supportive care.

Dementia with Lewy bodies — clinical features, cautions, and frequency: Dementia with Lewy bodies has been recognized clinically only in the last 10–15 years and differs from Alzheimer's disease by earlier, more prominent visual hallucinations, early parkinsonian features (postural instability and falls), cognitive fluctuations lasting days to weeks, and a somewhat more rapid evolution. Patients are markedly sensitive to the extrapyramidal effects of antipsychotic medications, and these medications should be used only with the utmost caution. Lewy bodies may account for as many as 7%–26% of dementia cases, depending on the criteria used. The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are interrelated with an abundance of Lewy inclusion bodies in both subcortical and cortical regions; autopsy often reveals both dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease, creating controversy about their independence, and development of valid clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria is an area of active research.

Case history

Case description

The patient is a 16-year-old boy having symptoms of paranoid ideation, anxiety, fear and hallucination for a period of 3 months. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the local psychiatric hospital and treated with aripiprazole 15 mg/day since 6 June 2019. After 14 days of treatment, the patient developed symptoms of stiff limbs, difficulty in limb moving and flushing. The patient was later admitted to our hospital owing to 3 months of paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, headache and 3 days of limb rigidity. Physical examination showed facial flushing, uncoordinated gait, increased muscle tone and Babinski sign presented on the right side. These are important positive signs, which may hint the diagnosis of organic brain disease. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility that chronic mental disorders could be caused by physical disease. The auxiliary examination revealed that the patient's blood routine, biochemical analysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), brain topography, electroencephalographic (EEG) and brain MRI were normal, and the serum drug concentration of aripiprazole was 22.48 µg/L. Psychiatric examination found that patient had auditory hallucinations, loosening of association, delusion, inattention and lack of self-insight. The patient was then diagnosed with schizophrenia again and treated with haloperidol 1.25 mg intramuscular injection two times per day and promethazine 12.5 mg intramuscular injection two times per day. However, the patient's symptoms of anxiety and fear worsened in 2 days, alongside agitated and violent behaviour. Treatment was adjusted to haloperidol 2.5 mg intramuscular injection two times per day and promethazine 25 mg intramuscular injection two times per day. After 2 days, the patient's agitated behaviour improved, but he developed symptoms of unsteadiness while standing, sweating and headaches. In addition, there was no improvement of the psychiatric symptoms, and tolerance to low-dose antipsychotic drugs remained poor.

Psychotic spectrum disorders

Can I diagnose and treat schizophrenia in adolescents who are consuming illicit drugs?

Schizophrenia has a rise in prevalence during adolescence, which is also the time when drug consumption rises. Cannabis, particularly high-potency cannabis, is a common precipitant or contributor to psychosis in young people. Youth experiencing psychosis also frequently misuse substances, which makes the differential diagnosis between substance-induced psychosis and primary psychotic disorders challenging.

NICE guidelines advise inquiry about the use of alcohol and illicit drugs when assessing a young person with psychosis and, if present, about particular substances and patterns of use. Performing a drug urine test may be also useful in acute psychosis. In drug-induced psychosis, psychotic symptoms present in the context of acute intoxication or withdrawal from substances, with a gradual recovery and remission within 1 month of sustained abstinence, which may not always be possible to achieve. Regarding differential clinical features with primary psychotic disorders, later age of onset, fewer negative symptoms, greater insight and less frequent family history of psychosis have been reported more frequently in drug-induced psychosis than in primary psychosis, although differential diagnoses with primary psychotic disorders cannot be made based solely on them.

If diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are met in an adolescent with a substance-use disorder, both diagnoses should be made. Integrated care, in which treatment for both disorders is provided simultaneously by the same clinician in community-based mental health teams, should be provided. There is no evidence-based guidance on choice of antipsychotic in adolescents with schizophrenia and a co-occurring substance-use disorder. However, this comorbidity complicates management and prognosis, increasing relapse rates and worsening medication adherence. Long-acting injectable (so-called) antipsychotics have shown some efficacy in adults with these conditions and may be an option in older adolescents. Antipsychotic treatment may also be considered if symptoms of psychosis persist in adolescents who are not able to maintain abstinence.

### Musical hallucinations and their relation with epilepsy [^117DRBWP]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately not all case reports of ictal musical hallucinations are so richly detailed. Penfield and Erickson, for example, also described a patient with a meningioma in the lesser wing of the sphenoid that caused musical hallucinations in a man of 59, but without providing much additional information. In some of the other cases it is unclear whether the hallucinations described were aura/ictal or post-ictal phenomena. Thus, Isaacson et al. describe a 60-year-old man who became volatile, and experienced visual and auditory hallucinations as well as paranoid delusions after treatment with oral ciprofloxacin for an ear infection. During an EEG, four clinical seizures were recorded, during which he became unresponsive and stared, with occasional head shaking. There was right temporal 10–11 Hz sharp rhythmic activity for 90 s, followed by focal slowing, and then a return to a normal background rhythm. Despite treatment with phenytoin, the episodes continued for 2 days. He developed palinacusis, as well as episodic auditory hallucinations of voices and music. This gradually disappeared in the following week, and 8 days later the EEG had normalised. Seizures recurred on re-challenge with ciprofloxacin, but not in 2 years of follow-up since.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, APA 2020 guidelines recommend to include the following in the initial assessment of patients with a possible psychotic disorder:

- reason the patient is presenting for evaluation

- patient's goals and preferences for treatment

- review of psychiatric symptoms and trauma history

- psychiatric treatment history

- assessment of tobacco use and other substance use

- assessment of physical health

- assessment of psychosocial and cultural factors

- mental status examination, including cognitive assessment

- assessment of the risk of suicide and aggressive behaviors, as outlined in APA's Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults (3rd edition).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider defining a sufficient response to initial treatment as a reduction of 25% in total score on a symptom assessment scale or a one-point improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale within 2 weeks. Define a definitive response as a 40–50% reduction or a two-point improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale after 6 weeks. Aim for symptom remission, such as no more than a mild severity rating for a range of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale items, as the target for the overall treatment of the initial episode.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116AhpfN]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychiatric assessment in dementia — prevalence, monitoring, and target symptoms: Ninety percent of patients with dementia develop a neuropsychiatric or behavioral symptom during the course of the disease, so it is important for the psychiatrist to periodically assess for noncognitive psychiatric symptoms and for progression of cognitive decline, with regular monitoring to detect new symptoms and adapt treatment. In Alzheimer's disease, depression is reported more commonly early in the illness, whereas delusions and hallucinations are more common in the middle and later stages, and it is particularly important to look for the emergence of such symptoms after a medication dose has been lowered or discontinued. Ongoing assessment should address depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, hallucinations, delusions, agitation, aggressive behavior, disinhibition, sexually inappropriate behavior, anxiety, apathy, and disturbances of appetite and sleep; cognitive symptoms that almost always require assessment include impairments in memory, executive function, language, judgment, and spatial abilities, and it is often helpful to track cognitive status with a structured mental status examination while watching for practice effects if the same instrument is used repeatedly.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^116h9YWW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

These updated guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology replace the original version published in 2011. They address the scope and targets of pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia. A consensus meeting was held in 2017, involving experts in schizophrenia and its treatment. They were asked to review key areas and consider the strength of the evidence on the risk-benefit balance of pharmacological interventions and the clinical implications, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. The guidelines cover the pharmacological management and treatment of schizophrenia across the various stages of the illness, including first-episode, relapse prevention, and illness that has proved refractory to standard treatment. It is hoped that the practice recommendations presented will support clinical decision making for practitioners, serve as a source of information for patients and carers, and inform quality improvement.

Stimulant medications — common adverse effects, growth impact, and cardiovascular evaluation are as follows: Common short-term adverse effects are appetite loss, abdominal pain, headaches, and sleep disturbance. Diminished growth was in the range of 1 to 2 cm from predicted adult height, and the effects diminished by the third year of treatment, with no compensatory rebound growth observed. On average, stimulants increase heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) mildly (average increases: 1–2 beats per minute for HR and 1–4 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP), but more substantial increases can occur in a subset of individuals (5%–15%), so clinicians are encouraged to monitor these vital signs. Stimulant medications have not been shown to increase the risk of sudden death beyond that observed in children not receiving stimulants, yet before initiating therapy it is important to obtain the child or adolescent's cardiac history and family history of specific conditions; if any of these risk factors are present, clinicians should obtain additional evaluation. An uncommon significant adverse effect is the occurrence of hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms.

First-episode psychosis and schizophrenia — diagnostic scope, risk factors, and remission: A diagnosis of schizophrenia does not encompass all clinical presentations of psychotic symptoms, and performing a thorough medical evaluation and considering other psychiatric disorders and medical conditions that might present with psychosis is essential. It is stated that no single case is identified for the development of schizophrenia and that interactions among genes, environment, and psychosocial factors might cause schizophrenia, and heavy use of cannabis is associated with an elevated risk. Though schizophrenia is a long-term condition, symptom resolution proceeds to remission in many patients, and in a 2007 naturalistic cohort study, 21% of patients achieved remission with treatment within a year.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^115ddH1E]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic assessment and premorbid functioning in youth with suspected schizophrenia — misdiagnosis is common at onset, many children reporting hallucinations do not have a psychotic illness, and premorbid abnormalities are frequent; in high-risk youth, progression correlates with familial risk plus specific clinical features. Misdiagnosis is common, particularly at time of onset; conditions often misdiagnosed include bipolar disorder and other psychotic mood disorders, personality disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and developmental syndromes. Most children who report hallucinations do not meet criteria for schizophrenia, and many do not have a psychotic illness. Premorbid abnormalities are evident in most youth who develop schizophrenia, especially those with COS. Factors in high-risk youth that predict progression into the illness include familial risk for schizophrenia plus either a recent deterioration in social functioning; nonspecific, suspicious, or paranoid thought content; greater social impairment; and/or a history of substance abuse.

### Specialised early intervention teams for recent-onset psychosis [^114Rq5bo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Psychosis is an illness characterised by the presence of hallucinations and delusions that can cause distress or a marked change in an individual's behaviour (e.g. social withdrawal, flat or blunted effect). A first episode of psychosis (FEP) is the first time someone experiences these symptoms that can occur at any age, but the condition is most common in late adolescence and early adulthood. This review is concerned with first episode psychosis (FEP) and the early stages of a psychosis, referred to throughout this review as 'recent-onset psychosis'. Specialised early intervention (SEI) teams are community mental health teams that specifically treat people who are experiencing, or have experienced a recent-onset psychosis. The purpose of SEI teams is to intensively treat people with psychosis early in the course of the illness with the goal of increasing the likelihood of recovery and reducing the need for longer-term mental health treatment. SEI teams provide a range of treatments including medication, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, and occupational, educational and employment support, augmented by assertive contact with the service user and small caseloads. Treatment is time limited, usually offered for two to three years, after which service users are either discharged to primary care or transferred to a standard adult community mental health team. A previous Cochrane Review of SEI found preliminary evidence that SEI may be superior to standard community mental health care (described as 'treatment as usual (TAU)' in this review) but these recommendations were based on data from only one trial. This review updates the evidence for the use of SEI services.

Objectives

To compare specialised early intervention (SEI) teams to treatment as usual (TAU) for people with recent-onset psychosis.

Search Methods

On 3 October 2018 and 22 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study-based register of trials, including registries of clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SEI with TAU for people with recent-onset psychosis. We entered trials meeting these criteria and reporting useable data as included studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and their 95% CIs, or if assessment measures differed for the same construct, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included three RCTs and one cluster-RCT with a total of 1145 participants. The mean age in the trials was between 23.1 years (RAISE) and 26.6 years (OPUS). The included participants were 405 females (35.4%) and 740 males (64.6%). All trials took place in community mental healthcare settings. Two trials reported on recovery from psychosis at the end of treatment, with evidence that SEI team care may result in more participants in recovery than TAU at the end of treatment (73% versus 52%; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.97; 2 studies, 194 participants; low-certainty evidence). Three trials provided data on disengagement from services at the end of treatment, with fewer participants probably being disengaged from mental health services in SEI (8%) in comparison to TAU (15%) (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.79; 3 studies, 630 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was low-certainty evidence that SEI may result in fewer admissions to psychiatric hospital than TAU at the end of treatment (52% versus 57%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00; 4 studies, 1145 participants) and low-certainty evidence that SEI may result in fewer psychiatric hospital days (MD -27.00 days, 95% CI -53.68 to -0.32; 1 study, 547 participants). Two trials reported on general psychotic symptoms at the end of treatment, with no evidence of a difference between SEI and TAU, although this evidence is very uncertain (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -4.58 to 3.75; 2 studies, 304 participants; very low-certainty evidence). A different pattern was observed in assessment of general functioning with an end of trial difference that may favour SEI (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.66; 2 studies, 467 participants; low-certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether the use of SEI resulted in fewer deaths due to all-cause mortality at end of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.20; 3 studies, 741 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was low risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment in three of the four included trials; the remaining trial had unclear risk of bias. Due to the nature of the intervention, we considered all trials at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. Two trials had low risk of bias and two trials had high risk of bias for blinding of outcomes assessments. Three trials had low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data, while one trial had high risk of bias. Two trials had low risk of bias, one trial had high risk of bias, and one had unclear risk of bias for selective reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that SEI may provide benefits to service users during treatment compared to TAU. These benefits probably include fewer disengagements from mental health services (moderate-certainty evidence), and may include small reductions in psychiatric hospitalisation (low-certainty evidence), and a small increase in global functioning (low-certainty evidence) and increased service satisfaction (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence regarding the effect of SEI over TAU after treatment has ended is uncertain. Further evidence investigating the longer-term outcomes of SEI is needed. Furthermore, all the eligible trials included in this review were conducted in high-income countries, and it is unclear whether these findings would translate to low- and middle-income countries, where both the intervention and the comparison conditions may be different.

### The long-term antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia: a selective review of clinical guidelines and clinical case examples [^1115sJ8U]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a long-lasting debate regarding the long-term antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia. The most frequently advocated strategy is continued antipsychotic maintenance treatment (i.e., continuous treatment with a constant dose of antipsychotic medication after symptom remission). Yet, because of the potential side effects of continued antipsychotic medication, other treatment strategies such as targeted intermittent treatment (i.e., stepwise drug discontinuation and early drug intervention in case of prodromal symptoms or early warning signs) have been discussed. In this manuscript, we review recommendations regarding the long-term antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia from six evidence-based clinical guidelines. In line with the current state of research, all six clinical guidelines recommend continued antipsychotic maintenance treatment. Recommendations regarding other aspects of long-term antipsychotic treatment (e.g., the dosage of antipsychotic medication for long-term treatment, the minimum duration of antipsychotic long-term treatment, and discontinuation strategies) are more vague and heterogeneous. Additionally, we provide clinical case examples to illustrate different course types of patients exposed to targeted intermittent treatment. Finally, we discuss gaps in current clinical guidelines and future research avenues in antipsychotic maintenance treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of roluperidone for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia [^112K72Ng]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

Monotherapy vs. Add-on

Because of the prevailing practice to treat most or all schizophrenia patients continuously with antipsychotic drugs to reduce risk for exacerbation, most trials targeting specific aspects of schizophrenia such as negative symptoms or cognitive impairment employ an add-on design. However, this design introduces a potential confounder that might obscure the effect of the experimental compound. Antipsychotic drugs on one hand indirectly improve negative symptoms by reducing preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations thus enhancing social interactions, but on the other hand, interfere with dopamine-driven motivation circuits hence aggravate avolition which is a major component of the schizophrenia intrinsic negative symptoms. Therefore, by using an add-on design it is difficult to disentangle between the direct effect of the experimental drug on negative symptoms and the pseudo-effect derived from the treatment with antipsychotics that blockade the D2 receptors. To overcome this limitation it has recently been suggested that trials targeting negative symptoms should use monotherapy and placebo-controlled designs, which is the option taken in this trial and the previous trial. Furthermore, data are accumulating showing that over a third of patients do not experience exacerbation during one year of placebo administration and some might even benefit from antipsychotic drug reduction or discontinuation.

Assessment Instruments

There is currently no agreement on what constitutes the best instrument to assess negative symptoms. Assessments based on raters' observations and collateral reports have their inherent limitations, while passive digital phenotyping instruments are still under development. For the current trial, the NSFS and the PSP were selected as primary and key secondary endpoints as informed by the previous trial data where they appear to capture the effect of roluperidone.

### Antipsychotic treatment of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS): a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial [^116JD6U2]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Onset of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis most commonly occurs in late adolescence or early adult life, although a late-onset (aged ≥ 60 years) variant of non-affective functional psychosis without dementia has long been recognised, and is classified as very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. After dementia and depression, very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis is the largest diagnostic group seen by older people's mental health services, with a reported annual incidence of 27 per 100 000 men and 48 per 100 000 women. Female sex, increasing age, sensory impairment, and migrant status are risk factors but, in contrast to schizophrenia, genetic factors have not been implicated in the aetiology of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. Older people with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis present with positive psychosis symptoms, typically persecutory delusions with or without multimodal hallucinations, which are distressing, persist for many years, and are associated with increased risks of social dysfunction, institutionalisation, and death.

We did not find any randomised, controlled, double-blind trials in this patient group with onset of a schizophrenia-like illness at age 60 years or older. Available evidence for the use of antipsychotics in very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis comes from one single-arm trial of 5 weeks of treatment with amisulpride that reported improvements in psychosis symptoms without significant extrapyramidal side-effects and from retrospective case-note reviews and published expert opinion. Because of the absence of reliable evidence on the benefits of antipsychotic treatment and high-profile reports of questionable efficacy and adverse safety of such treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis, there are concerns that the risks of antipsychotics in an older patient group, who are potentially vulnerable to such side-effects, might outweigh any benefits. Furthermore, patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis usually have scarce insight into the potential value of taking antipsychotic treatment, hence most patients with such psychosis have not engaged with antipsychotic treatment.

VA/DoD schizophrenia guideline — evidence rating for switching antipsychotics notes that the recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation and states that the benefits of monotherapy outweighed the potential harm of no medication, polypharmacy, or continuing a medication with significant adverse events. The guideline adds that individuals with schizophrenia who are not treated with antipsychotic medication can experience catastrophic outcomes, including homelessness, unemployment, and inability to care for themselves, and that antipsychotic treatment is the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia; patient values and preferences varied, including that some patients might not want to take a medication if it causes distressing side effects and might want to try a different antipsychotic, and that some patients might not want to take medication at all because of lack of effect, lack of insight, or beliefs about their medications, including causing stigma and shame.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^114hcv4j]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 3 — assessment for comorbidities and medical workup: youth with suspected schizophrenia need comprehensive assessment for other pertinent clinical conditions and/or associated problems, including suicidality, comorbid disorders, substance abuse, developmental disabilities, psychosocial stressors, and medical problems. These youth require a thorough psychiatric and medical evaluation, including assessment for common comorbid conditions such as substance abuse or cognitive deficits; when present, active psychotic symptoms are generally prioritized, but any life-threatening symptoms such as suicidal behavior or severe aggressive behaviors must be prioritized in the treatment plan. There are no neuroimaging, psychological, or laboratory tests that establish a diagnosis of schizophrenia; the medical evaluation focuses on ruling out nonpsychiatric causes of psychosis and establishing baseline laboratory parameters for monitoring medication therapy, and more extensive evaluation is indicated for atypical presentations such as gross deterioration in cognitive and motor abilities, focal neurologic symptoms, or delirium.

### Auditory hallucinations, not necessarily a hallmark of psychotic disorder [^116KfgP4]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations (AH) are often considered a sign of a psychotic disorder. This is promoted by the DSM-5 category of Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum And Other Psychotic Disorder (OSSSOPD), the diagnostic criteria for which are fulfilled with the sole presence of persistent AH, in the absence of any other psychotic symptoms. And yet, persistent AH are not synonymous with having a psychotic disorder, and should therefore not be uncritically treated as such. Many people who seek treatment for persistent AH have no other psychotic symptoms, have preserved reality-testing capacities, and will never develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Instead, hallucinations may be the result of many different causes, including borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hearing loss, sleep disorders or brain lesions, and they may even occur outside the context of any demonstrable pathology. In such cases, the usage of the DSM-5 diagnosis of OSSSOPD would be incorrect, and it may prompt unwarranted treatment with antipsychotic medication. We therefore argue that a DSM-5 diagnosis of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (or any other type of psychotic disorder) characterized by AH should require at least one more symptom listed under the A-criterion (i.e. delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior or negative symptoms). Adhering to these more stringent criteria may help to distinguish between individuals with persistent AH which are part of a psychotic disorder, for whom antipsychotic medication may be helpful, and individuals with AH in the absence of such a disorder who may benefit from other approaches (e.g. different pharmacological interventions, improving coping style, trauma-related therapy).

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of NUPLAZID 34 mg as a treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. In this outpatient study, 199 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to NUPLAZID 34 mg or placebo once daily. Study patients (male or female and aged 40 years or older) had a diagnosis of PD (with or without dementia) established at least 1 year prior to study entry and had psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and/or delusions) that started after the PD diagnosis and that were severe and frequent enough to warrant treatment with an antipsychotic. At entry, patients were required to have a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 21 and to be able to self-report symptoms. The majority of patients were on PD medications at entry; these medications were required to be stable for at least 30 days prior to study start and throughout the study period.

The PD-adapted Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS-PD) was used to evaluate the efficacy of NUPLAZID 34 mg. SAPS-PD is a 9-item scale adapted for PD from the Hallucinations and Delusions domains of the SAPS. Each item is scored on a scale of 0–5, with 0 being none and 5 representing severe and frequent symptoms. Therefore, the SAPS-PD total score can range from 0 to 45 with higher scores reflecting greater severity of illness. A negative change in score indicates improvement. Primary efficacy was evaluated based on change from baseline to Week 6 in SAPS-PD total score.

As shown in Table 3, Figure 3, and Figure 4, NUPLAZID 34 mg (n = 95) was statistically significantly superior to placebo (n = 90) in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions in patients with PDP as measured by central, independent, and blinded raters using the SAPS-PD scale. An effect was seen on both the hallucinations and delusions components of the SAPS-PD.

The effect of NUPLAZID on SAPS-PD improved through the six-week trial period, as shown in Figure 3.

### Efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy for sleep improvement in patients with persistent delusions and hallucinations (BEST): a prospective, assessor-blind, randomised controlled pilot trial [^112SF1hY]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Sleep disturbance occurs in most patients with delusions or hallucinations and should be treated as a clinical problem in its own right. However, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) — the best evidence-based treatment for insomnia — has not been tested in this patient population. We aimed to pilot procedures for a randomised trial testing CBT for sleep problems in patients with current psychotic experiences, and to provide a preliminary assessment of potential benefit.

Methods

We did this prospective, assessor-blind, randomised controlled pilot trial (Better Sleep Trial [BEST]) at two mental health centres in the UK. Patients (aged 18–65 years) with persistent distressing delusions or hallucinations in the context of insomnia and a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis were randomly assigned (1:1), via a web-based randomisation system with minimisation to balance for sex, insomnia severity, and psychotic experiences, to receive either eight sessions of CBT plus standard care (medication and contact with the local clinical team) or standard care alone. Research assessors were masked to group allocation. Assessment of outcome was done at weeks 0, 12 (post-treatment), and 24 (follow-up). The primary efficacy outcomes were insomnia assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and delusions and hallucinations assessed by the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS) at week 12. We did analysis by intention to treat, with an aim to provide confidence interval estimation of treatment effects. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 33695128.

Findings

Between Dec 14, 2012, and May 22, 2013, and Nov 7, 2013, and Aug 26, 2014, we randomly assigned 50 patients to receive CBT plus standard care (n = 24) or standard care alone (n = 26). The last assessments were completed on Feb 10, 2015. 48 (96%) patients provided follow-up data. 23 (96%) patients offered CBT took up the intervention. Compared with standard care, CBT led to reductions in insomnia in the large effect size range at week 12 (adjusted mean difference 6.1, 95% CI 3.0–9.2, effect size d = 1.9). By week 12, nine (41%) of 22 patients receiving CBT and one (4%) of 25 patients receiving standard care alone no longer had insomnia, with ISI scores lower than the cutoff for insomnia. The treatment effect estimation for CBT covered a range from reducing but also increasing delusions (adjusted mean difference 0.3, 95% CI −2.0 to 2.6) and hallucinations (−1.9, −6.5 to 2.7). Three patients, all in the CBT group, had five adverse events, although none were regarded as related to study treatment.

Interpretation

Our findings show that CBT for insomnia might be highly effective for improving sleep in patients with persistent delusions or hallucinations. A larger, suitably powered phase 3 study is now needed to provide a precise estimate of the effects of CBT for sleep problems, both on sleep and psychotic experiences.

### Brief psychotic disorder associated with quarantine and mild COVID-19 [^114oax7K]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 30-year-old man with no significant previous or family psychiatric history became severely anxious about his health after a positive COVID-19 test. Physical symptoms of COVID-19 were mild, with no evidence of hypoxia or pneumonia, throughout his illness. He was admitted to a quarantine facility. He remained highly anxious, and 1week later, he developed paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations (his first psychotic episode). He was treated with lorazepam 1mg four times a day, mirtazapine 30mg nocte and risperidone 1mg two times a day. His psychotic symptoms lasted 1week. He stopped psychiatric medication after 4 weeks and had remained well when reviewed 3 months later. A Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor (brief reactive psychosis) was made. Anxiety about his health and social isolation appeared the main aetiological factors but an inflammatory component cannot be excluded. The case highlights that first episode psychosis can be associated with mild COVID-19.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^1112H83F]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease spectrum illnesses (including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) — management priorities include monitoring, psychosis risk, and selective pharmacotherapy. The cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease and related illnesses requires a broad treatment approach that targets both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and mild cognitive impairment may be partially ameliorated by dopaminergic agents prescribed for motor symptoms, so both cognitive and motor symptoms should be carefully monitored. Because dopaminergic agents predispose patients to visual hallucinations and other psychotic phenomena, especially in patients with dementia, these agents should be used with particular care, and the minimal dosage needed to control motor symptoms should be prescribed. Patients are vulnerable to delirium from medications and concomitant general medical conditions; therefore, development of these symptoms deserves thorough evaluation. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects for specific patients, but strong evidence guiding agent selection is lacking. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia with Parkinson's disease with effects similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. For noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies, if psychotic symptoms result in distress or danger, the judicious use of an antipsychotic agent, often at low doses, is indicated; although all antipsychotic agents can aggravate Parkinsonian motor disturbances and open-label data support second-generation antipsychotics, because antipsychotics can dramatically worsen dementia with Lewy bodies, they should be prescribed very cautiously. Depression is common in Parkinson's disease and may exacerbate functional impairment or be misinterpreted as dementia; data supporting psychotherapy or antidepressants are modest, but clinical experience supports their use.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — evidence inclusion and precision downgrades specify that for all key questions except KQ 1, a prospective, randomized controlled trial with an independent control group was required, and crossover trials were not included unless they reported data for the first phase of the study separately. For KQ 1, observational diagnostic study designs that compared assessment methods, tools, or both and their diagnostic accuracy for detection of schizophrenia in adults with prodromal symptoms or suspected psychosis were included. Eligible studies must have enrolled at least 20 patients (10 per study group for treatment studies, 20 total patients for diagnostic or prognostic studies), and small studies were downgraded for precision by one level for a single study with < 200 patients per study arm. Studies must have enrolled at least 85% of patients who met the study population criteria (adults with schizophrenia, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform symptoms, FEP, first-episode schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with catatonia) and must have reported at least one outcome of interest. Where newer Cochrane reviews had already accounted for small sample size in risk of bias, those data were not downgraded a second time.

### Challenges and opportunities in the diagnosis and treatment of early-onset psychosis: a case series from the youth affective disorders clinic in stockholm, Sweden [^116iFZu9]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Affective and psychotic symptom interplay

As mood symptoms receded, latent psychotic symptoms became evident. Addressing these was crucial for managing the patient's suicidality, and clinicians may consider the possibility of latent psychotic symptoms in severe psychiatric presentations unresponsive to standard treatments.

This case accentuates the need for continual reassessment, especially when treatment resistance or new symptomology is observed. Given the stakes involved — sometimes life and death — meticulous attention to these factors is not just advisable but essential.

Patient 2: differential diagnosis in youth with complex neuropsychiatric presentations

The second case shows that treating bipolar disorder with psychotic features can make gender dysphoria assessments possible. Prior to treatment, the patient had been denied such assessments due to the severity of their symptoms. Up to 25% of individuals with schizophrenia may also experience gender dysphoria. The case confirms both conditions can co-exist, and gender dysphoria may persist post-psychotic treatment. Effective treatment of psychotic symptoms thus serves dual purposes: improving mental health and facilitating gender reassignment assessments.

Furthermore, this case underscores the importance of adhering to a hierarchical approach in the diagnostic process. Similar to case 1, the auditory hallucinations were initially considered to be symptoms of less severe disorders rather than signs of an ongoing psychotic process. It was not until structured screening tools suggested the possibility of psychosis, which was initially thought to indicate dissociation associated with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), that a reevaluation occurred. As with case 1, a significant remission of symptoms was only achieved after these experiences were reclassified as psychotic symptoms and treated with targeted antipsychotic medication.

Patient 3: misdiagnosis and the primacy of severe mental disorders

This case emphasizes the need for thorough assessments in patients with rapidly worsening behavioral and cognitive symptoms. The symptom overlap between disorganized psychosis and comorbid ADHD/ASD further highlights the risks of not using a diagnostic hierarchy. Initial assessments focused on neuropsychiatric and behavioral comorbidities, potentially overlooking broader severe mental illnesses like psychosis. Such misdiagnoses can lead to ineffective treatments that exacerbate the condition; such as the prescription of central stimulants to a child with severe psychotic symptoms. In youth with acute episodes and significant functional impairments, clinicians may improve outcomes by focusing on possible severe mental illnesses rather than multiple, less severe conditions. This approach requires deep understanding of neurobiology, cognitive processes, and symptom trajectory. Overall, the case stresses the importance of precise differentiation among these conditions, and suggests prioritizing treatment of severe mental disorders for better outcomes.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Both positive and negative symptoms of psychotic disorders warranted referral for an assessment. All referrals of adolescents and young adults living in a site's catchment area were considered for eligibility. A phone screening interview with a trained referrer assessed whether eligibility was likely. If so, the young person and family were offered a full research and clinical assessment, which included the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS), a component of which is the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) scale. Inclusion criteria for the full study sample were established to recruit clinically lower risk (CLR), clinically higher risk (CHR), and very early first-episode psychosis (EFEP) participants. Those criteria were: (a) age 12–25, (b) living in the site's defined catchment area, and (c) having at least a 1 on any Positive Symptom Scale or a 3 on any Negative Symptom Scale of the SOPS. For instance, for Unusual Thought Content (the prodromal version of delusional ideas), a "1" would be rated if the person experienced "mind tricks" or a "sense that something is different". At a level "3" on Avolition on the Negative Symptoms Scale, the person would be manifesting "low levels of motivation to participate in goal-directed activities" or "impairment in task initiation and/or persistence". Youth having a current frank psychotic episode (a 6 on any Positive Symptom Scale for longer than 30 consecutive days) were excluded from the study and assisted in finding other treatment. Other exclusion criteria included: (a) a prior episode of psychosis or having received antipsychotic medication for 30 days or more at a dosage appropriate to treat a psychotic episode, (b) IQ less than 70, (c) permanent residence outside the catchment area, (d) not an English speaker or neither parent is an English speaker, (e) currently a prisoner in the criminal justice system, and (f) psychotic symptoms due to an acute toxic or medical etiology.

### Rasagiline mesylate (azilect) [^111XHx1o]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with AZILECT or after starting or increasing the dose of AZILECT. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.

Patients should be informed of the possibility of developing hallucinations and instructed to report them to their healthcare provider promptly should they develop.

Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with AZILECT because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis with an increase in central dopaminergic tone. In addition, many treatments for psychosis that decrease central dopaminergic tone may decrease the effectiveness of AZILECT [see Drug Interactions (7.8)].

Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops hallucinations or psychotic like behaviors while taking AZILECT.

5.9 Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors

Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including AZILECT, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, or other urges while being treated with AZILECT. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking AZILECT.

5.10 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion

A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone.

### The long-term effects of antipsychotic medication on clinical course in schizophrenia [^115YP71t]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Concerns have been raised that treatment with antipsychotic medication might adversely affect long-term outcomes for people with schizophrenia. The evidence cited for these concerns includes the association of antipsychotic treatment with brain volume reduction and with dopamine receptor sensitization, which might make patients vulnerable to relapse and illness progression. An international group of experts was convened to examine findings from clinical and basic research relevant to these concerns. Little evidence was found to support a negative long-term effect of initial or maintenance antipsychotic treatment on outcomes, compared with withholding treatment. Randomized controlled trials strongly support the efficacy of antipsychotics for the acute treatment of psychosis and prevention of relapse; correlational evidence suggests that early intervention and reduced duration of untreated psychosis might improve longer-term outcomes. Strategies for treatment discontinuation or alternative nonpharmacologic treatment approaches may benefit a subgroup of patients but may be associated with incremental risk of relapse and require further study, including the development of biomarkers that will enable a precision medicine approach to individualized treatment.

### A counterweight model for understanding and treating persecutory delusions [^1123cQvc]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In our counterweight model of paranoia, we list 10 categories of factors that provide weight to the inaccurate threat belief (see Figure 1 and online Supplementary materials Figure S1). The focus is on factors that are tractable to intervention and that patients want treated (Freeman, Taylor, Molodynski, & Waite). The factors are designed to accommodate the influence of past experience on current processing (e.g. trauma may have had effects on, for example, self-beliefs, beliefs about others, anxious arousal, and imagery). The model is designed to provide structure to a clinical assessment of persecutory delusions and to do so from the patient's perspective. The conversation in that assessment starts at the belief itself. We discuss how much feeling unsafe pervades the person's life, and the types of direct evidence supporting that feeling. Often, the person's threat belief is fueled by the physiological effects of anxiety. The anxiety can sometimes be accompanied by negative images (Kingston et al; Morrison et al.). Sometimes the person hears a voice telling them that they are vulnerable and will be attacked, which is then believed (Sheaves et al.). The long shadow of negative past events is often perceptible. Such events may involve things others have done to the person or actions the person feels guilty about. We then move on to a discussion of the defense behaviors – safety-seeking behaviors (Salkovskis,) – that the person adopts to reduce the likelihood of harm. Often, the person avoids situations they find threatening. If they do enter such situations, they use subtle strategies for protection (e.g. rushing, choosing a quiet time of day, making themselves inconspicuous). Next, we assess how much the person is anticipating and thinking about threat, and, conversely, the time they spend in positive activities, such as social contact. Most patients devote considerable time to worrying about the threats and much less to other activities. We then broaden out into a discussion of how the person may feel inherently vulnerable in regards to other people due to negative self-beliefs (Collett, Pugh, Waite, & Freeman; Humphrey et al; Waite et al.). We may note that it is hard for the person to view events in different ways, and that the situation is not helped by disruption to sleep and routines (Freeman & Waite). Typically, we conclude by exploring how much control the person feels the persecutors possess. This signposts that we want the person themselves to have greater control. In sum, the process we follow in the assessment allows us to build a personalized picture of the individual's situation. It gives us a tailored appraisal of the weights pulling the person's understanding towards paranoia. Descriptions of the mechanistic links between the factors and paranoia are provided in Table 1.

Consider prescribing GABA-modulating agents if applicable, such as benzodiazepines, for anxiety or insomnia for up to 2 weeks before tapering off.

Appendix K — MDD severity variants and psychotic features are described: individuals demonstrating more severe or atypical presentations, including marked physical slowness or marked agitation and somatic symptoms, are often referred to as melancholic depressions or depression with melancholia. People with severe depressive episodes may also develop psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and/or delusions), most commonly thematically consistent with negative, self-blaming cognitions and low mood, while others may develop psychotic symptoms unrelated to mood; in the latter case, the mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms prove difficult to distinguish from those that occur in other psychoses such as schizophrenia.

### Provigil [^111rej1a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Psychiatric Symptoms

Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with modafinil.

In the adult PROVIGIL controlled trials, psychiatric symptoms resulting in treatment discontinuation (at a frequency ≥ 0.3%) and reported more often in patients treated with PROVIGIL compared to those treated with placebo were anxiety (1%), nervousness (1%), insomnia (< 1%), confusion (< 1%), agitation (< 1%), and depression (< 1%).

Postmarketing adverse reactions associated with the use of modafinil have included mania, delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and aggression, some resulting in hospitalization. Many, but not all, patients had a prior psychiatric history. One healthy male volunteer developed ideas of reference, paranoid delusions, and auditory hallucinations in association with multiple daily 600 mg doses of PROVIGIL (three times the recommended dose) and sleep deprivation. There was no evidence of psychosis 36 hours after drug discontinuation.

Caution should be exercised when PROVIGIL is given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania. Consideration should be given to the possible emergence or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms in patients treated with PROVIGIL. If psychiatric symptoms develop in association with PROVIGIL administration, consider discontinuing PROVIGIL.

5.6 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machinery

Although PROVIGIL has not been shown to produce functional impairment, any drug affecting the CNS may alter judgment, thinking or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or other hazardous machinery until it is reasonably certain that PROVIGIL therapy will not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

### Is methamphetamine blood concentration in emergency department patients associated with the clinical picture? [^113evyc5]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychosis, predominantly paranoia and thought disorder, was common in our cohort, but usually transient, with most patients discharged from the emergency department or the adjacent observation ward. Persistent psychiatric symptoms requiring admission were only seen in a small proportion. Similar findings were found in another recent Australian study. We did not collect data on the frequency or pattern of methamphetamine usage in these patients, which is known to be associated with the likelihood of psychosis. Future research in an emergency department cohort investigating the medium term exposure pattern to methamphetamine and sleep quality in such patients would aid interpretation of the concentration data from our study.

Acute psychosis associated with methamphetamine use can differ from that seen in schizophrenia. The most distinguishing feature appears to be its transient nature, resolving on cessation of methamphetamine use sometimes with the aid of sedative and antipsychotic medication. However, the character of symptoms can also be different, with paranoid delusions predominating in methamphetamine induced psychosis, whereas in schizophrenia other symptoms may predominate, such as complex auditory hallucinations and delusions of reference. It has been proposed that the presence of the latter symptoms in patients with a history of methamphetamine use could increase the likelihood they might be suffering from a primary psychotic disorder.

Although a large number of symptoms and signs were assessed for association with methamphetamine concentration, multivariable analysis only showed a significant difference in concentration in patients with heart palpitations or with choreoathetoid movements, which are random jerking or writhing movements of the face, limbs or trunk. Mean or median vital signs were within normal ranges, with the exception of heart rate. Sympathomimetic features, which might be expected after stimulant drug exposure such as dilated pupils and hyperthermia, were not generally a feature of this cohort. These findings may be due in part to any delay in presentation of these patients post initial drug exposure. We propose that aside from heart rate, physiological criteria are not useful as a screening tool for methamphetamine use in the emergency department setting.

We found a significant association between methamphetamine concentration and plasma creatinine concentration. This warrants further investigation. Creatinine is a product of normal protein metabolism, which is secreted by the kidneys, and the concentration in the blood is an accurate marker of kidney function. A recent cohort of patients with reported methamphetamine exposure supported by positive urine drug screening were evaluated by Isoardi et al. with 12% (73/595) of cases having a raised creatinine concentration. They found the acute kidney injury in such patients was mild, short‐lived and resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. These findings are closely matched with our cohort.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^115zwdJB]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis in youth psychosis — effective treatment relies on an accurate diagnosis and a thorough assessment to identify any other contributing medical or psychiatric conditions and/or psychosocial stressors, and the proper assessment of psychosis in youth requires the gauging of potential symptom reports in the context of normal development; the mere fact that a child responds affirmatively to questions regarding hallucinations or delusions does not ipso facto mean the child is psychotic. Psychotic symptoms occur in the context of an illness, and psychotic illnesses are rare in youth, especially in children younger than 12 years. The accurate diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses should be based on characteristic patterns of illness and overt signs on the mental status examination, and clinical features that help confirm a diagnosis of schizophrenia include deteriorating function, thought disorder, and bizarre behavior. Medical conditions that can result in psychosis include central nervous system infections, delirium, neoplasms, endocrine disorders, genetic syndromes (e.g., velocardiofacial [22q11] syndrome), autoimmune disorders, and toxic exposures. Drugs of abuse that can result in psychotic symptoms include dextromethorphan, lysergic acid diethylamide, hallucinogenic mushrooms, psilocybin, peyote, cannabis, stimulants, and inhalants, and prescription drugs associated with psychosis include steroids, anticholinergics, antihistamines, and amphetamines; typically, acute psychosis secondary to intoxication resolves within days to weeks once the offending drug is discontinued. Adolescents with EOS appear to be at substantial risk for comorbid substance abuse, cannabis use in teenagers is associated with a higher risk of eventually developing psychosis, and when drug abuse precedes the development of schizophrenia it is difficult to gauge whether the psychosis represents independent drug effects or the unmasking of the underlying illness.

### Antipsychotic drugs versus cognitive behavioural therapy versus a combination of both in people with psychosis: a randomised controlled pilot and feasibility study [^111aVKNp]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Little evidence is available for head-to-head comparisons of psychosocial interventions and pharmacological interventions in psychosis. We aimed to establish whether a randomised controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus antipsychotic drugs versus a combination of both would be feasible in people with psychosis.

Methods

We did a single-site, single-blind pilot randomised controlled trial in people with psychosis who used services in National Health Service trusts across Greater Manchester, UK. Eligible participants were aged 16 years or older; met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder, or met the entry criteria for an early intervention for psychosis service; were in contact with mental health services, under the care of a consultant psychiatrist; scored at least 4 on delusions or hallucinations items, or at least 5 on suspiciousness, persecution, or grandiosity items on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); had capacity to consent; and were help-seeking. Participants were assigned (1:1:1) to antipsychotics, CBT, or antipsychotics plus CBT. Randomisation was done via a secure web-based randomisation system (Sealed Envelope), with randomised permuted blocks of 4 and 6, stratified by gender and first episode status. CBT incorporated up to 26 sessions over 6 months plus up to four booster sessions. Choice and dose of antipsychotic were at the discretion of the treating consultant. Participants were followed up for 1 year. The primary outcome was feasibility (ie, data about recruitment, retention, and acceptability), and the primary efficacy outcome was the PANSS total score (assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks). Non-neurological side-effects were assessed systemically with the Antipsychotic Non-neurological Side Effects Rating Scale. Primary analyses were done by intention to treat; safety analyses were done on an as-treated basis. The study was prospectively registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN06022197.

Findings

Of 138 patients referred to the study, 75 were recruited and randomly assigned-26 to CBT, 24 to antipsychotics, and 25 to antipsychotics plus CBT. Attrition was low, and retention high, with only four withdrawals across all groups. 40 (78%) of 51 participants allocated to CBT attended six or more sessions. Of the 49 participants randomised to antipsychotics, 11 (22%) were not prescribed a regular antipsychotic. Median duration of total antipsychotic treatment was 44.5 weeks (IQR 26–51). PANSS total score was significantly reduced in the combined intervention group compared with the CBT group (-5.65 [95% CI -10.37 to -0.93]; p = 0.019). PANSS total scores did not differ significantly between the combined group and the antipsychotics group (-4.52 [95% CI -9.30 to 0.26]; p = 0.064) or between the antipsychotics and CBT groups (-1.13 [95% CI -5.81 to 3.55]; p = 0.637). Significantly fewer side-effects, as measured with the Antipsychotic Non-neurological Side Effects Rating Scale, were noted in the CBT group than in the antipsychotics (3.22 [95% CI 0.58 to 5.87]; p = 0.017) or antipsychotics plus CBT (3.99 [95% CI 1.36 to 6.64]; p = 0.003) groups. Only one serious adverse event was thought to be related to the trial (an overdose of three paracetamol tablets in the CBT group).

Interpretation

A head-to-head clinical trial of CBT versus antipsychotics versus the combination of the two is feasible and safe in people with first-episode psychosis.

### Heterogeneity in treatment outcomes and incomplete recovery in first episode psychosis: does one size fit all? [^114xqH8x]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneity in recovery outcomes for individuals with First Episode Psychosis (FEP) calls for a strong evidence base to inform practice at an individual level. Between 19–89% of young people with FEP have an incomplete recovery despite gold-standard evidence-based treatments, suggesting current service models, which adopt a 'one-size fits all' approach, may not be addressing the needs of many young people with psychosis. The lack of consistent terminology to define key concepts such as recovery and treatment resistance, the multidimensional nature of these concepts, and common comorbid symptoms are some of the challenges faced by the field in delineating heterogeneity in recovery outcomes. The lack of robust markers for incomplete recovery also results in potential delay in delivering prompt, and effective treatments to individuals at greatest risk. There is a clear need to adopt a stratified approach to care where interventions are targeted at subgroups of patients, and ultimately at the individual level. Novel machine learning, using large, representative data from a range of modalities, may aid in the parsing of heterogeneity, and provide greater precision and sophistication in identifying those on a pathway to incomplete recovery.

There were no significant sex differences in current mental and physical health ratings, or the number of days participants reported that poor physical or mental health kept them from doing their usual activities (table 3). During a screen of psychotic experiences in the last 2 weeks, 10% of current clozapine users reported experiencing 3 or 4 hallucination sensory modalities for several days or more (decreasing to 1.6% of participants who experienced 3–4 modalities nearly every day) and 27.5% reported experiencing 3 or more delusion subtypes for several days or more (decreasing to 6.0% who experienced them nearly every day). The most commonly reported psychotic experiences in the last 2 weeks were auditory hallucinations (37.4% of participants) and paranoid delusions (33.3%). Finally, 33.4% of current clozapine users reported being free of hallucinatory and delusional symptoms in the last 2 weeks.

### Efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy for sleep improvement in patients with persistent delusions and hallucinations (BEST): a prospective, assessor-blind, randomised controlled pilot trial [^111Hm1YF]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbance occurs in most patients with delusions or hallucinations and should be treated as a clinical problem in its own right. However, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-the best evidence-based treatment for insomnia-has not been tested in this patient population. We aimed to pilot procedures for a randomised trial testing CBT for sleep problems in patients with current psychotic experiences, and to provide a preliminary assessment of potential benefit.

Methods

We did this prospective, assessor-blind, randomised controlled pilot trial (Better Sleep Trial [BEST]) at two mental health centres in the UK. Patients (aged 18–65 years) with persistent distressing delusions or hallucinations in the context of insomnia and a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis were randomly assigned (1:1), via a web-based randomisation system with minimisation to balance for sex, insomnia severity, and psychotic experiences, to receive either eight sessions of CBT plus standard care (medication and contact with the local clinical team) or standard care alone. Research assessors were masked to group allocation. Assessment of outcome was done at weeks 0, 12 (post-treatment), and 24 (follow-up). The primary efficacy outcomes were insomnia assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and delusions and hallucinations assessed by the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS) at week 12. We did analysis by intention to treat, with an aim to provide confidence interval estimation of treatment effects. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 33695128.

Findings

Between Dec 14, 2012, and May 22, 2013, and Nov 7, 2013, and Aug 26, 2014, we randomly assigned 50 patients to receive CBT plus standard care (n = 24) or standard care alone (n = 26). The last assessments were completed on Feb 10, 2015. 48 (96%) patients provided follow-up data. 23 (96%) patients offered CBT took up the intervention. Compared with standard care, CBT led to reductions in insomnia in the large effect size range at week 12 (adjusted mean difference 6.1, 95% CI 3.0–9.2, effect size d = 1.9). By week 12, nine (41%) of 22 patients receiving CBT and one (4%) of 25 patients receiving standard care alone no longer had insomnia, with ISI scores lower than the cutoff for insomnia. The treatment effect estimation for CBT covered a range from reducing but also increasing delusions (adjusted mean difference 0.3, 95% CI -2.0 to 2.6) and hallucinations (-1.9, -6.5 to 2.7). Three patients, all in the CBT group, had five adverse events, although none were regarded as related to study treatment.

Interpretation

Our findings show that CBT for insomnia might be highly effective for improving sleep in patients with persistent delusions or hallucinations. A larger, suitably powered phase 3 study is now needed to provide a precise estimate of the effects of CBT for sleep problems, both on sleep and psychotic experiences.

### Mirtazapine adjunct for people with schizophrenia [^112Spwri]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many individuals who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience a range of distressing and debilitating symptoms. These can include positive symptoms (such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech), cognitive symptoms (such as trouble focusing or paying attention or using information to make decisions), and negative symptoms (such as diminished emotional expression, avolition, alogia, and anhedonia). Antipsychotic drugs are often only partially effective, particularly in treating negative symptoms, indicating the need for additional treatment. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant drug that when taken in addition to an antipsychotic may offer some benefit for negative symptoms.

Objectives

To systematically assess the effects of mirtazapine as adjunct treatment for people with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (including registries of clinical trials) up to May 2018.

Selection Criteria

All randomised-controlled trials (RCTs) with useable data focusing on mirtazapine adjunct for people with schizophrenia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. For included studies we assessed risk of bias and created 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

We included nine RCTs with a total of 310 participants. All studies compared mirtazapine adjunct with placebo adjunct and were of short-term duration. We considered five studies to have a high risk of bias for either incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, or other bias. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in mental state (negative and positive symptoms), leaving the study early for any reason, clinically important change in global state, clinically important change in quality of life, number of days in hospital and incidence of serious adverse events. One trial defined a reduction in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) overall score from baseline of at least 20% as no important response for negative symptoms. There was no evidence of a clear difference between the two treatments with similar numbers of participants from each group showing no important response to treatment (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.14, 1 RCT, n = 20, very low-quality evidence). Clinically important change in positive symptoms was not reported, however, clinically important change in overall mental state was reported by two trials and data for this outcome showed a favourable effect for mirtazapine (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.92; I² = 75%, 2 RCTs, n = 77, very low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a clear difference for numbers of participants leaving the study early (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.66, 9 RCTs, n = 310, moderate-quality evidence), and no evidence of a clear difference in global state Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) severity scores (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.48, 1 RCT, n = 39, very low-quality evidence). A favourable effect for mirtazapine adjunct was found for the outcome clinically important change in akathisia (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.52, 2 RCTs, n = 86, low-quality evidence; I² = 61%I). No data were reported for quality life or number of days in hospital. In addition to the main outcomes of interest, there was evidence relating to adverse events that the mirtazapine adjunct groups were associated with an increased risk of weight gain (RR 3.19, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.65, 4 RCTs, n = 127) and sedation/drowsiness (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.68, 7 RCTs, n = 223).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence is primarily of very low quality and indicates that mirtazapine adjunct is not clearly associated with an effect for negative symptoms, but there is some indication of a positive effect on overall mental state and akathisia. No effect was found for global state or leaving the study early and data were not available for quality of life or service use. Due to limitations of the quality and applicability of the evidence it is not possible to make any firm conclusions, the role of mirtazapine adjunct in routine clinical practice remains unclear. This underscores the need for new high-quality evidence to further evaluate mirtazapine adjunct for schizophrenia.

A 26-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our unit with exacerbated paranoid schizophrenia. Prior to his admission, daily administration of olanzapine had been sufficient to maintain a partial remission of his schizophrenia, but due to an exacerbation of his delusions, he had then also been prescribed aripiprazole, which had been followed by no improvement in symptoms and a gradual further exacerbation of auditory delusions. Physical examinations, brain MRI and neurophysiological assessment were unremarkable. Blood analysis, however, revealed extremely low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin-releasing hormone (PRL) concentration. Interestingly, after aripiprazole discontinuation, he returned to partial remission with an increase in plasma TSH and PRL concentration.

Psychotic symptoms presenting in youth can be clinically complex and require that a child and adolescent psychiatrist use significant skill in making a diagnosis and initiating treatment. There are a number of illnesses to rule out before making a diagnosis of early-onset schizophrenia in particular. Psychosis in youth has significant associated morbidity and places high demands not only on families but also on the medical and educational systems. More effective pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for psychosis are needed. Nonpharmacologic therapies targeting relatively treatment-resistant domains of dysfunction such as neurocognition are also necessary as adjunctive treatments to our extant pharmacologic agents.

### Stratification and prediction of remission in first-episode psychosis patients: the OPTiMiSE cohort study [^1129pAHi]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psychotic symptomatology includes loss of contact with reality, thought disorder, delusions and hallucinations, unusual or bizarre behavior, impaired social interactions and difficulties to carry out daily activities. While psychosis could be caused by recreational drug use, physical illness or brain trauma, it is often symptomatic of the onset of severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder.

According to current guidelines, first-line treatments of psychosis involve the use of the minimum effective dose of second-generation antipsychotics whenever possible. Whatever criteria are used to assess response to treatment, responses are highly heterogeneous. While 25–30% of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients fully respond, a majority respond partially or not at all, and are therefore switched to second-line treatments. As early response to treatment is one of the main factors associated with improved long-term prognosis –, identifying predictors of treatment response in FEP patients is an important issue in the field. Response to treatment could be assessed either using predefined cutoffs in the percentage of reduction of baseline scores on a psychopathology rating scale, or by measuring the proportion of patients meeting remission criteria. According to the definition proposed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group (RSWG), remission can be defined by an absolute threshold of severity of symptoms in three dimensions: reality distortion, disorganization and negative symptoms. Using this consensus definition, it was found that global functioning in the year before admission, the total score of the Strauss Carpenter Prognostic Scale and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative sub-score at admission were all predictive of symptom remission in cohorts of schizophrenia inpatients. Despite these latter studies, clinicians still lack reliable predictors of remission in FEP patients.

### Quetiapine extended release versus aripiprazole in children and adolescents with first-episode psychosis: the multicentre, double-blind, randomised tolerability and efficacy of antipsychotics (TEA) trial [^115yAGY6]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Head-to-head trials to guide antipsychotic treatment choices for paediatric psychosis are urgently needed because extrapolations from adult studies might not be implementable. In this superiority trial with two-sided significance testing, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of quetiapine-extended release (quetiapine-ER) versus aripiprazole in children and adolescents with first-episode psychosis, to determine whether differences between the two treatments were sufficient to guide clinicians in their choice of one drug over the other.

Methods

In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial in seven Danish university clinics, we recruited children and adolescents aged 12–17 years with a diagnosis of ICD-10 schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, delusional disorder, or affective-spectrum psychotic disorder, and psychotic symptoms scoring at least 4 on at least one of the following Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) items: P1 (delusions), P2 (conceptual disorganisation), P3 (hallucinations), P5 (grandiosity), P6 (suspiciousness/persecution), and G9 (unusual thought content), and a total PANSS score greater than 60. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 12 weeks of treatment with target doses of 600 mg/day of quetiapine-ER (starting from 50 mg/day) or 20 mg/day of aripiprazole (starting from 2.5 mg/day). The assigned drug was titrated over five levels, with 2 days at each dose, and the final dose achieved on day 9. Randomisation was done using a computer-generated concealed sequence with a block size of 8, and stratified by baseline PANSS positive score (≤ 20 points or > 20 points) and age (12–14 years or 15–17 years). Study drugs were administered in identical capsules, and interventions, assessments, and data analysis were done masked. The primary outcome was PANSS positive score. Key adverse outcomes were bodyweight, homoeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), akathisia, and sedation. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01119014.

Findings

Between June 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2014, 231 participants were assessed for elegibility, of whom 113 were randomly assigned to quetiapine-ER (n = 55) or aripiprazole (n = 58). PANSS positive score did not differ between groups after 12 weeks (adjusted mean change -5.05 [5.46] for quetiapine-ER, -6.21 [5.42] for aripiprazole; p = 0.98), but decreased over time in both groups (p < 0.0001). Weight gain was more rapid with quetiapine-ER (p = 0.0008), with an adjusted mean weight group difference at week 12 of 3.33 kg (SD 7.23; effect size 0.64; p < 0.0001). The HOMA-IR group difference at week 12 favoured aripiprazole (adjusted mean log-transformed group difference 0.259 [SD 0.906]; effect size 0.35; p = 0.0060). Akathisia was more common with aripiprazole at week 2 (observed in 34 [60%] of 57 patients; estimated 63.5%) than with quetiapine-ER (15 [30%] of 50; estimated 31.3%; p = 0.0021), but not at other timepoints. Sedation proportions did not change significantly over time with either intervention (observed at weeks 2, 4, and 12, respectively, for quetiapine-ER in 43 [83%] of 52, 40 [83%] of 48, and 34 [72%] of 47 patients and for aripiprazole in 49 [89%] of 55, 52 [96%] of 54, and 44 [92%] of 48 patients), and the overall estimated probability combining all timepoints was significantly higher for aripiprazole (97.1%) than for quetiapine-ER (89.2%; p = 0.012). In addition to sedation and akathisia, the most common adverse events were tremor (42 [79%] patients in the quetiapine-ER group vs 52 [91%] patients in the aripiprazole group), increased duration of sleep (47 [92%] vs 39 [71%]), orthostatic dizziness (42 [78%] vs 46 [81%]), depression (43 [80%] vs 44 [77%]), tension/inner unrest (37 [69%] vs 50 [88%]), failing memory (41 [76%] vs 44 [77%]), and weight gain (46 [87%] vs 38 [68%]).

Interpretation

This first head-to-head comparison of quetiapine-ER versus aripiprazole in early-onset psychosis showed no significant group differences in severity of psychopathology after 12 weeks of treatment. Quetiapine-ER was associated with more metabolic adverse events and aripiprazole with more initial akathisia and, unexpectedly, more sedation. The limited antipsychotic efficacy and high level of adverse events were noticeable.

Outcome measures and decision inputs in schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis are framed as key questions addressing how symptom measures should be supplemented with cognition, functioning, QoL (quality of life), treatment adherence, recovery, and care experience; which patient-reported outcome measures are valid and reliable and whether they should target symptoms versus comorbid disorders, functioning, and QoL; which measures have evaluated sensitivity to change and what constitutes clinically meaningful change; the appropriate frequency for repeat administrations to maximize treatment outcomes; whether decision making should include patient-reported outcomes, provider ratings, reports from significant others, physiological measures, device outputs, experience sampling, and other modalities; methods for data acquisition that minimize burdens for patients and providers; and whether predictive modeling can identify high-risk individuals and support targeted preventive interventions for suicide, overdose, external cause mortality, and excess all-cause mortality.
