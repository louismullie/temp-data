Basic BP management

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about basic blood pressure management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define hypertension and classify blood pressure categories. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation and diagnostic confirmation strategy. Next, I will consider risk stratification and when to start pharmacotherapy. After that, I need to establish blood pressure targets by guideline and patient population. Then, I will select initial pharmacologic therapy, including combination therapy and single-pill combinations. I will also integrate lifestyle therapy and adherence strategies. Finally, I should outline monitoring, titration, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that reconciles guideline differences and highlights implementation priorities.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic thresholds and classification, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline defines hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg and categorizes elevated BP as 120–129/ < 80 mmHg, whereas JNC 8 retained the ≥ 140/90 mmHg definition and did not redefine hypertension, so I need to be explicit about which framework I'm using in a given discussion [^484f9bb0] [^659422f9]. Wait, let me verify the implication: using ACC/AHA thresholds increases prevalence and the number of people eligible for treatment, which is a key reason for controversy and variability across guidelines, so I should flag that when advising patients or systems [^659422f9].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation and confirmatory measurement strategy. I need to ensure accurate office measurement with proper technique and, when feasible, confirm elevated readings with out-of-office monitoring because ambulatory or home BP improves diagnostic precision and guides therapy; many contemporary guidelines endorse ABPM/HBPM for confirmation and monitoring, though JNC 8 did not explicitly address ABPM cutoffs, which is a limitation I should note [^7345921e] [^659422f9]. Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence: ACC/AHA suggests re-evaluation at 1 year if normal, 3–6 months with lifestyle therapy, and 1 month after starting medication, then every 3–6 months once at goal, which aligns with pragmatic primary care workflows [^58d53333].

> I will now examine risk stratification because it drives treatment intensity. Let me think about absolute cardiovascular risk: using a 10-year ASCVD risk estimator helps prioritize pharmacotherapy for those at higher risk, and many guidelines integrate risk alongside BP level to decide when to treat, particularly for stage 1 hypertension where evidence is mixed and shared decision-making is essential [^659422f9] [^922ef231]. I should double-check that this approach is consistent with both ACC/AHA and ESH/ESC perspectives, which emphasize risk-based treatment decisions and earlier intervention in higher-risk patients [^659422f9] [^58d53333].

> Now, when to start medication? For ACC/AHA, initiate pharmacotherapy for confirmed hypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg) in adults with CVD or high ASCVD risk, and consider drug therapy for stage 1 hypertension (130–139/80–89 mmHg) if lifestyle fails and risk is ≥ 10% or if clinical CVD is present, whereas JNC 8 recommended initiating at ≥ 150/90 mmHg for ≥ 60 years and ≥ 140/90 mmHg for < 60 years, reflecting a more conservative threshold strategy [^659422f9] [^70d3354b]. Wait, let me verify the rationale: ACC/AHA's lower thresholds are supported by trials like SPRINT showing cardiovascular benefit with more intensive BP lowering, which explains the divergence from JNC 8's stricter RCT-only approach [^da7b4c2c].

> Next, I should review BP targets by guideline and population, and I need to be careful to distinguish aspirational goals from evidence-based floors. ACC/AHA 2017 recommends < 130/80 mmHg for most adults with hypertension, with encouragement to target < 120 mmHg in selected high-risk patients, acknowledging feasibility and tolerability constraints [^659422f9]. JNC 8 recommended < 150/90 mmHg for ≥ 60 years and < 140/90 mmHg for < 60 years, and AAFP endorses a standard target of < 140/90 mmHg to reduce mortality, while also noting a small additional MI benefit with lower targets in some analyses [^70d3354b] [^36b312b2] [^d668bc20]. Hold on, I should verify the 2025 update: the 2025 AHA/ACC multispecialty guideline continues to support < 130/80 mmHg broadly and encourages < 120 mmHg in appropriate high-risk patients, reinforcing the more intensive target paradigm [^ab6bb533] [^a68e5a02]. For older or frail adults, I need to ensure individualization and watch for falls or cognitive effects when pursuing lower targets, which is why some guidelines allow higher thresholds in the very elderly or frail [^e768f47a].

> Let me consider initial pharmacologic therapy, and I should confirm the shift toward combination therapy. ESH 2023 recommends initiating with a two-drug combination in most patients, preferably a RAS blocker (ACEi or ARB) plus a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, and to prefer single-pill combinations to improve adherence and speed control, which is a major departure from older monotherapy-first paradigms [^2141ea9f] [^3ba9a65b]. I should double-check exceptions: monotherapy may be reasonable in frail or very elderly patients, or in grade 1 hypertension with low risk and only modest elevation, aligning with individualized care principles [^e768f47a]. ACC/AHA similarly supports initial combination therapy when BP is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above goal, which operationalizes the same principle in U.S. practice [^659422f9].

> I need to ensure I cover the five major classes and their roles. Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers remain the foundation, with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications such as CAD, heart failure, or arrhythmias rather than routine first-line use in otherwise uncomplicated hypertension [^88e45e41] [^659422f9]. But wait, what if the patient is Black? JNC 8 emphasized initial therapy with a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB in Black patients, including those with diabetes, based on trial data, so I should incorporate that nuance when selecting initial agents [^a4680c5c].

> Next, I should review lifestyle therapy because it is foundational and synergistic with drugs. Weight loss, dietary sodium reduction toward < 1,500–2,300 mg/day, adoption of the DASH dietary pattern, increased physical activity, moderation of alcohol, and smoking cessation all lower BP and can reduce medication needs; importantly, structured programs and sustained support improve durability of lifestyle change, which I should emphasize in care plans [^92a0f595] [^e99fe508]. Hold on, I should verify potassium guidance: unless contraindicated, higher potassium intake is beneficial, and in some settings salt substitution with potassium-enriched alternatives can aid BP reduction at the population level, though individualization is key in CKD or on RAAS blockade [^79315763].

> I will now examine adherence and implementation strategies, because poor adherence and therapeutic inertia are major drivers of suboptimal control. Single-pill combinations, once-daily dosing, medication reminders, and education with self-monitoring improve adherence and time to control, and team-based care with pharmacists, nurses, and community health workers reduces BP and complications over time, which I should build into routine workflows [^3ba9a65b] [^deead368] [^f0207213] [^c2d74475]. Let me reconsider whether to mention digital tools: while promising, I should note that evidence is evolving and device validation remains a challenge, so I will frame them as adjuncts rather than replacements for validated cuffs and clinical follow-up [^7dc0f10e].

> Next, I should review monitoring, titration, and escalation. Reassess BP within 2–4 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, titrate or add a second agent if not at goal, and avoid combining ACEi and ARB; if dual therapy fails, add a third agent and consider secondary causes or resistant hypertension pathways, including referral to hypertension specialists when needed [^324185d6] [^99e6a127]. I should confirm that ESH 2023 aligns with this cadence and emphasizes achieving control within about 3 months, which reinforces early intensification rather than prolonged observation of uncontrolled BP [^58d53333].

> Special populations require tailored targets and agents, so I need to check those carefully. In chronic kidney disease, most guidelines target < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated and prioritize ACEi/ARB for kidney protection, with KDIGO providing detailed implementation guidance and risk–benefit framing for different CKD stages [^e178a138]. In diabetes, lower targets are generally favored when tolerated, consistent with cardiovascular risk reduction goals, though I should individualize in older adults with frailty or autonomic dysfunction [^659422f9]. For pregnancy, I should avoid ACEi/ARB and methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are preferred depending on gestational timing and severity, which is a critical safety distinction I must not overlook [^notfound]. In older adults, I should start low, go slow, and reassess falls, cognition, and renal function when intensifying therapy, balancing absolute risk reduction against iatrogenesis [^6aa89bbb].

> Let me synthesize and reconcile the guidelines so the practical approach is coherent. Across ACC/AHA, ESH/ESC, and AAFP, the convergent themes are to confirm hypertension with accurate measurement, stratify cardiovascular risk, initiate lifestyle therapy universally, and use pharmacotherapy to reach evidence-based targets, with a modern shift toward earlier combination therapy and single-pill regimens to improve adherence and speed control; differences largely reflect threshold philosophy and the weight given to intensive BP lowering trials, not a fundamental disagreement on the value of BP reduction [^659422f9] [^2141ea9f] [^36b312b2]. I should emphasize that shared decision-making is essential when evidence is mixed, such as in low-risk stage 1 hypertension, and that ongoing follow-up with structured titration is necessary to maintain control over time [^922ef231] [^324185d6].

> Finally, I need to ensure the implementation plan is actionable. Prioritize accurate BP measurement training, embed risk calculators, default to combination therapy when BP is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above goal, prefer single-pill combinations, schedule timely follow-up, screen for secondary causes when resistance is suspected, and leverage team-based care to close gaps in control; these steps are consistently associated with improved outcomes and are emphasized in contemporary guidelines and implementation science [^659422f9] [^2141ea9f] [^c2d74475]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about perfect control for all; I should set expectations that most patients require more than one drug and that iterative adjustment is normal, which helps sustain engagement and reduces therapeutic inertia [^17932ecc].

Basic blood pressure management centers on **accurate measurement** [^d668bc20], **lifestyle modification** [^92a0f595], and **pharmacotherapy** [^88e45e41] tailored to risk and comorbidities. Confirm hypertension with **two or more readings on two or more occasions** [^d668bc20], then initiate lifestyle measures (weight loss, DASH, sodium restriction, exercise, alcohol moderation) [^92a0f595] for all patients. Start **medications** [^88e45e41] if BP is ≥ 140/90 mmHg or ≥ 130/80 mmHg with high cardiovascular risk, using first-line agents (ACEi/ARB, CCB, or thiazide) [^88e45e41] and escalating to combination therapy as needed [^2141ea9f]. Target < 140/90 mmHg for most adults [^36b312b2], < 130/80 mmHg for high-risk patients [^a68e5a02], and individualize for older or frail adults [^e768f47a]. Monitor every 2–4 weeks until control, then every 3–6 months, and address adherence and secondary causes if targets are not met [^324185d6].

---

## Diagnosis and confirmation

- **Confirm hypertension**: Two or more BP readings on two or more occasions [^d668bc20], measured correctly (cuff size, arm position, rest 5 minutes) [^d668bc20].
- **Out-of-office monitoring**: Use home or ambulatory BP to confirm white-coat or masked hypertension [^659422f9].
- **Initial evaluation**: History, exam, labs (CBC, chemistries, lipids, HbA1c, urinalysis) to identify risk factors and secondary causes [^notfound].

---

## Lifestyle modifications (first-line for all)

- **Weight loss**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²; each 1 kg lost reduces SBP by ~1 mmHg [^notfound].
- **DASH diet**: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and reduced saturated fat [^notfound].
- **Sodium restriction**: < 2.3 g/day; ideal < 1.5 g/day [^notfound].
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise [^notfound].
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 2 drinks/day (men), ≤ 1 drink/day (women) [^659422f9].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

### Indications for initiation

Initiate pharmacotherapy for **BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg** in most adults [^a4680c5c], and for **BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg** in high-risk patients (CVD, diabetes, CKD) [^659422f9].

---

### First-line agents

- **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: Preferred in diabetes, CKD, or LVH [^a4680c5c].
- **Calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics**: Preferred in Black patients or those intolerant to ACEi/ARBs [^a4680c5c].
- **Beta-blockers**: Reserved for CAD, heart failure, or arrhythmias [^notfound].

---

### Combination therapy

Use **initial combination therapy** for BP ≥ 160/100 mmHg or when BP is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above target [^659422f9], and prefer **single-pill combinations** to improve adherence [^3ba9a65b].

---

## Blood pressure targets

| **Patient population** | **Target bp** |
|-|-|
| General adult population | < 140/90 mmHg [^36b312b2] |
| High-risk patients (CVD, diabetes, CKD) | < 130/80 mmHg [^a68e5a02] |
| Older adults (≥ 65 years) | Individualize; < 150/90 mmHg if tolerated [^54056bb9] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess **every 2–4 weeks** until BP is at goal, then every 3–6 months [^58d53333]. At each visit, reinforce adherence, evaluate for adverse effects, and screen for secondary causes if BP remains uncontrolled despite optimal therapy [^324185d6].

---

## Special considerations

- **Resistant hypertension**: Evaluate adherence, secondary causes, and consider adding spironolactone or referral to a specialist [^0c140797].
- **Pregnancy**: Methyldopa, labetalol, or nifedipine are preferred; avoid ACEi/ARBs [^notfound].
- **Elderly/frail patients**: Start low, go slow, and individualize targets to avoid hypotension [^e768f47a].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Education should explain hypertension risks, the importance of adherence, and lifestyle changes, and adherence tools such as **single-pill combinations**, once-daily dosing, and reminders should be used to improve control [^f3c96c4f] [^deead368] [^f0207213].

---

Basic BP management combines **accurate diagnosis**, **lifestyle change**, and **risk-tailored pharmacotherapy** with regular monitoring and adherence support to reduce cardiovascular risk [^659422f9].

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of >65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

Japan has long maintained a robust national health system with universal health coverage and accessible antihypertensive therapy. Nevertheless, population-level blood pressure (BP) control remains suboptimal. To address this public health challenge, the Japanese Society of Hypertension published the Guidelines for the Management of Elevated Blood Pressure and Hypertension 2025 (JSH2025), integrating evidence-based recommendations and practical approaches to improve hypertension care. JSH2025 introduces a dual-format structure comprising clinical question sections developed through systematic reviews and consensus-based narrative chapters. The key updates include universal BP targets of <130/80mmHg across populations, promotion of home BP monitoring, stratified cardiovascular risk assessment, expanded guidance on digital health and behavioral interventions, and condition-specific management strategies for older adults, women, and cancer survivors. We outline the major updates and innovations in JSH2025 and show their clinical and public health implications.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^98e5ce8f]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Hypertension guidelines: criteria that might make them more clinically useful [^6457830e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease prevention depends on reduction of risk factors, including hypertension. Guidelines designed to improve management of hypertension are widely available. Their purpose is to assemble the available data from basic biomedical science, epidemiology, and clinical science in an accessible form with which physicians and patients can make reasoned decisions for individual cases. However, guidelines have been neither widely accepted, nor effectively implemented. We recommend a strategy for guideline preparation designed to yield a product more user friendly, accessible, and effective. Guideline recommendations and the evidence used to make them should be based on an explicit grading system. Relevant clinical as well as nonclinical factors must be considered. Moreover, because the goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent cardiovascular events, and the likelihood of such events is determined by multifactor or absolute risk assessment, risk, rather than level of blood pressure (BP), should determine the need for therapy. Similarly, the benefit of therapy must be assessed by reduction in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^1ad6939b]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension—representing >29 million people—are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in >1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively.With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction,, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.

### The need for transformative innovation in hypertension management [^e51c76b4]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Despite multiple available effective therapies for hypertension, many patients with high blood pressure in the United States are not adequately controlled. This inability to effectively manage hypertension can be attributed to patient, provider, and system failures. To create an effective model for hypertension management, current care delivery systems must be reorganized around the following principles: improved patient engagement and patient-provider communication, increased use of nonphysician providers, better performance monitoring and feedback systems, and better aligned reimbursement models. Transformation of care around these principles would lead to marked improvements in cost, quality, and access to care.

### Aafp grading system (...) [^d668bc20]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

The most common pharmacologic treatments for reducing blood pressure include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. Selection of medications should include cost, ease of use, adverse effect profile, and comorbid conditions. Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential to the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Ambulatory and home blood pressure measurements can be useful in diagnosis and monitoring. Although the optimal method for blood pressure measurement remains unclear and under investigation, diagnosis requires two or more blood pressure readings on two or more occasions that meet the criteria for hypertension. RECOMMENDATION 2 The AAFP recommends clinicians consider treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target to reduce risk of myocardial infarction.

Although treatment to a standard blood pressure target reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, there was a small additional benefit observed with a lower blood pressure target. There was no observed additional benefit in preventing stroke with the lower blood pressure target. . Moderate-quality evidence showed treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target further reduced the risk of myocardial infarction. In the included systematic review, eight RCTs evaluated the incidence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with a lower target compared with those with a standard target. It is recommended that a patient’s bladder be empty, that caffeinated beverages be avoided for 30 minutes prior, and that the patient rest for five minutes before measuring blood pressure. Multiple readings in the morning and evenings, taken at least one minute apart, can be averaged. Patients should check with their insurance plans to see whether a home blood pressure monitor is a covered benefit. The AAFP also recommends primary care clinicians consider treating adults with hypertension to a lower blood pressure target to reduce risk of myocardial infarction. Treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, as well as patient preferences and values, and involve shared decision-making by the patient and clinician. Variation exists across specialty society guidelines, with some recommending lower blood pressure targets regardless of age. However, it should be noted that lower blood pressure targets are not recommended across all guidelines, and the recommendations outlined here are consistent with recommended blood pressure targets from others.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^abcbd776]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

### Editors' commentary on the 2023 ESH management of arterial hypertension guidelines [^0b0b0009]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are ideally suited to the provision of advice on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP). The recently published European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension is the latest in a long series of high BP clinical practice guidelines. It closely resembles the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines, with incremental rather than major changes. Although the ESH guidelines are primarily written for European clinicians and public health workers, there is a high degree of concordance between its recommendations and those in the other major BP guidelines. Despite the large number of national and international BP guidelines around the world, general population surveys demonstrate that BP guidelines are not being well implemented in any part of the world. The level of BP, which is the basis for diagnosis and management, continues to be poorly measured in routine clinical practice and control of hypertension remains suboptimal, even to a conservative BP target such as a systolic/diastolic BP <140/90 mmHg. BP guidelines need to focus much more on implementation of recommendations for accurate diagnosis and strategies for improved control in those being treated for hypertension. An evolving body of implementation science can assist in meeting this goal. Given the enormous health, social, and financial burden of high BP, better diagnosis and management should be an imperative for clinicians, government, and others responsible for the provision of health care services. Hopefully, the 2023 ESH will help enable this.

### Novel approaches to management of hypertension [^975adda6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Of the roughly 1.4 billion people with hypertension worldwide, only about one in seven has their blood pressure (BP) successfully treated and adequately controlled. This review will focus on new therapeutic approaches of hypertension.

Recent Findings

Several recent clinical studies and guidelines have favoured the assessment of target organ damage and cardiovascular risk scores for the diagnosis and treatment approach of hypertension. Paradigm shifts recommended in the guidelines are the initiation of antihypertensive treatment with combination (not mono) therapy and the recommendation of single-pill combinations (SPC), which improve adherence and result in rapid and effective BP control. In clinical trials with optimized design and renal denervation (RDN) technology, the biological proof of concept has been established. Consistent, durable ambulatory and office BP reductions without procedure associated serious adverse events have been documented. The challenges are now to identify patients who respond best to interventional treatment.

Summary

Major key points in the treatment strategy for hypertension are: individualization of the therapy according to total cardiovascular risk, combination therapy as initial step, recommendation of SPC and RDN as promising interventional therapy.

### Update on low-renin hypertension: current understanding and future direction [^a5e4a463]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Low-renin hypertension is common and affects 1 in 4 people with hypertension. Understanding the different causes and management of low-renin hypertension is becoming increasingly relevant as renin measurements are more widely ordered in clinical practice. Importantly, many people with low-renin hypertension do not fit traditional definitions of known causes, and the approach to management of these people is not unclear. This review provides an overview of our evolving understanding of the causes of low-renin hypertension, the expanding spectrums of pathophysiology, key differentiating characteristics, distinct management strategies, and highlights our knowledge gaps. It is important to distinguish the underlying pathophysiology of an individual with low-renin hypertension to individualize treatment.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^60d930f5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Box. 
Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline’s recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient’s values and preferences.

### Assessment of hypertension complications and health service use 5 years after implementation of a multicomponent intervention [^c2d74475]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a protocol-driven, team-based, multicomponent hypertension management program implemented in the public primary care setting associated with fewer complications and mortality in patients with hypertension?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 212 707 adults with uncomplicated hypertension, participation in the Risk Assessment and Management Program for Hypertension, offered in addition to usual primary care, was associated with clinically significant reductions in incidences of hypertension-related complications, all-cause mortality, and hospital-based health service use after 5 years.

Meaning

This study’s results suggest that a protocol-driven, team-based hypertension management program incorporated into the public primary care setting is a viable strategy to reduce disease burden on health care systems due to hypertension.

### Case-based applications of the 2025 AHA / ACC / multispecialty high blood pressure guideline [^12c9db79]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly half of all adults in the United States and is the leading, preventable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and 11 other professional organizations recently published an updated 2025 guideline to reflect the latest advances in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure. To bridge the gap between this guideline update and individualized patient care, this Special Article presents 4 hypothetical cases of high blood pressure, focusing on management in the outpatient setting. These cases illustrate how to apply a risk-based approach to high blood pressure management that incorporates blood pressure levels, cardiovascular disease risk factors and the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events cardiovascular disease equations. They also highlight notable updates in the 2025 guideline such as recommendations for lifestyle approaches, initiation of medications, blood pressure goals, primary aldosteronism screening, and management of high blood pressure before, during and after pregnancy. By contextualizing the 2025 guideline within these hypothetical case scenarios, this Special Article provides practical guidance to health care teams to offer the most up-to-date, evidence-based care of high blood pressure.

Other Topics

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for detection and management of secondary hypertension, definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the advantage of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and overcome therapeutic inertia, and team-based care. Both guidelines also focus on implementation, that is, models for delivery of care, use of health information technology, improving quality of care, health literacy, access to care, social and community services, and a patient-specific plan of care. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension, and it recommends reserving device-based treatments of hypertension for research settings. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for managing concomitant CVD risk with specific recommendations for the use of statins, antiplatelet drugs, and oral anticoagulation (in atrial fibrillation), whereas the ACC/AHA largely defers to other ACC/AHA guidelines that cover these topics. Last, both guidelines identify gaps in evidence and provide a summary key message (ESC/ESH) or BP treatment thresholds and goals (ACC/AHA).

### Revised definition of pulmonary hypertension and approach to management: a clinical primer [^1ac6d33c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

The definition of pulmonary hypertension (PH) has changed recently based, in part, on contemporary outcome data and to focus on early disease detection. Now, PH includes patients with mean pulmonary artery pressure >20 mm Hg measured by right heart catheterization. In contrast to the classical era, pulmonary vascular resistance >2.0 Wood units is also used for diagnosis and prognostication. These lowered thresholds aim to identify patients early in the disease course, which is important because delay to diagnosis of PH is common and linked to elevated morbidity and shortened lifespan. This clinical primer highlights key changes in diagnosis and approach to PH management, focusing on concepts that are likely to be encountered frequently in general practice. Specifically, this includes hemodynamic assessment of at‐risk patients, pharmacotherapeutic management of pulmonary arterial hypertension, approach to PH in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and newly established indications for early referral to PH centers to prompt comanagement of patients with pulmonary vascular disease experts.

### High blood pressure: ACC / AHA releases updated guideline-AAFP (...) [^659422f9]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment Physicians caring for patients with high BP should focus on overall patient health, with an emphasis on reducing the risk of future adverse CVD outcomes. All patient risk factors should be managed in an integrated fashion with a comprehensive set of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies. NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS Weight loss is recommended to reduce BP in adults who are overweight or obese. A heart-healthy diet and increased physical activity through a structured exercise program are recommended. Sodium intake should be reduced, and potassium should be supplemented unless contraindicated. Alcoholic drinks should be limited to two per day for men, or one per day for women. PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS The use of BP-lowering medications is recommended for secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with clinical CVD and an average BP of 130 mm Hg or greater systolic or 80 mm Hg or greater diastolic.

Medication is recommended for primary prevention in adults with an estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD of 10% of more and an average BP of 130 mm Hg or greater systolic or 80 mm Hg or greater diastolic. . First-line agents include thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Initiation of BP-lowering therapy with two first-line agents of different classes is recommended for adults with stage 2 hypertension and an average BP more than 20/10 mm Hg above their target. Therapy with a single agent is reasonable in adults with stage 1 hypertension and target BP less than 130/80 mm Hg. The dosage should be titrated and additional agents added sequentially to achieve the BP target.

Simultaneous use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and/or renin inhibitor is not recommended. Follow-Up Adults with elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension whose estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD is less than 10% should be treated with nonpharmacologic interventions and reevaluated in three to six months. Those with stage 1 hypertension whose estimated risk is 10% or more should receive BP-lowering therapy in conjunction with nonpharmacologic interventions, then undergo repeat evaluation in one month.

Hypertension is an extremely common clinical problem, affecting approximately 50 million people in the USA and approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Approximately 1% of these patients will develop acute elevations in blood pressure at some point in their lifetime. A number of terms have been applied to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crises, emergencies, and urgencies. By definition, acute elevations in blood pressure that are associated with end-organ damage are called hypertensive crises. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage. This article reviews current concepts, and common misconceptions and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated blood pressure.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^bbf9517c]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of <150 mm Hg and a DBP of <90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower--SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP <80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to <140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^f54e01be]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA guideline provides 106 formal recommendations and the ESC/ESH provides 122. In both guidelines, each recommendation is characterized by a class of recommendation that specifies the strength or importance of the recommendation and by a level-of-evidence designation. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guideline committees voted on the wording and grading of each recommendation. Both guidelines provide comprehensive advice for prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high BP/hypertension. As a result, the 2 full reports are relatively long (103 pages for the ACC/AHA and 84 pages for the ESC/ESH). For ease of reading, however, the documents are divided into sections and subsections that use a similar presentation format. In addition, a variety of shorter executive summaries and brief synopses have been published. Guideline authors have published articles that expand on individual guideline topics, provide perspective for the evidence underpinning selected recommendations, and furnish quantitative estimates of potential impact based on universal application of guideline recommendations in their target populations. Last, both guidelines are complemented by publicly available slide sets, CVD risk estimation calculators, and other educational tools.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^e9337161]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al., JAMA 311: 507-520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al., JAMA 311: 507-520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥150/≥90 mmHg in adults≥60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3-4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: emphasis on defense against the BP threshold and why we may not get there easily [^80e7fed8]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is the most important noncommunicable disorder worldwide. Finding and effectively managing elevated BP is the single greatest public health benefit we can accomplish, as it will reduce premature death and enable patients to live longer free of the disabilities that target organ damage inflicts on the brain, heart, kidneys, and legs. Hypertension guidelines are an invaluable source of information on how to detect elevated BP, how to evaluate people for situations where hypertension is a symptom of other disorders, and how to apply the various treatments that lower BP effectively in patients. Determining the point at which treating high BP is more likely to result in benefit than harm is a marriage of science and art. There is no right answer to what clearly constitutes hypertension when using a systolic or diastolic BP to define it. The science shows the mathematics behind the reduction of BP and the number of lives saved and target organs preserved. The art comes into play when a decision is made that, when a systolic or diastolic BP exceeds a certain level, it becomes reasonable to intervene at that point with treatment. Caregivers play an important role in monitoring and educating patients with hypertension-especially in the detection of unintended effects of treatment, such as excessive BP lowering, symptomatic hypotension, and impacts on laboratory tests and well-being. Nonadherence to prescribed therapies is a barrier to effectively managing chronic disorders like hypertension. Having a solid foundation in the science behind the guidelines and recognizing that the application of guidelines requires some clinical judgment gleaned from balancing the risks and benefits of treatment in each individual patient, is the basis for healthy exchanges of ideas, like this pro and con series which discusses the science and furthers the art. This review has taken the con side of several issues in the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2025 Hypertension Guidelines.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^ee782d1c]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Hypertension is very common, but guideline recommendations for hypertension have been controversial, are of increasing interest, and have profound implications.

Objective

To systematically assess the consistency of recommendations regarding hypertension management across clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of hypertension management recommendations included CPGs that had been published as of April 2018. Two point-of-care resources that provided graded recommendations were included for secondary analyses. Discrete and unambiguous specifications of the population, intervention, and comparison states were used to define a series of reference recommendations. Three raters reached consensus on coding the direction and strength of each recommendation made by each CPG. Three independent raters reached consensus on the importance of each reference recommendation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were rates of consistency for direction and strength among CPGs. Sensitivity analyses testing the robustness were conducted by excluding recommendation statements that were described as insufficient evidence, excluding single recommendation sources, and stratifying by importance of recommendations.

Results

The analysis included 8 CPGs with a total of 71 reference recommendations, 68 of which had clear recommendations from 2 or more CPGs. Across CPGs, 22 recommendations (32%) were consistent in direction and strength, 18 recommendations (27%) were consistent in direction but inconsistent in strength, and 28 recommendations (41%) were inconsistent in direction. The rate of consistency was lower in secondary analyses. When insufficient evidence ratings were excluded, there was still substantial inconsistency, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis suggested the inconsistency could not be attributed to any single recommendation source. Inconsistency in direction was more common for recommendations deemed to be of lower importance (11 of 20 recommendations [55%]), but 17 of 48 high-importance recommendations (35%) had inconsistency in direction.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertension is a common chronic condition with widespread expectations surrounding guideline-based care, yet CPGs have a high rate of inconsistency. Further investigations should determine the reasons for inconsistency, the implications for recommendation development, and the role of synthesis across recommendations for optimal guidance of clinical care.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^484f9bb0]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions—definition and targets note that this evidence-based guideline "has not redefined high BP, and the panel believes that the 140/90 mm Hg definition from JNC 7 remains reasonable." It adds that "the relationship between naturally occurring BP and risk is linear down to very low BP, but the benefit of treating to these lower levels with antihypertensive drugs is not established," and emphasizes that "for all persons with hypertension, the potential benefits of a healthy diet, weight control, and regular exercise cannot be overemphasized," as "these lifestyle treatments have the potential to improve BP control and even reduce medication needs."

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^0041cbd1]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Despite assertions to the contrary,there is greater congruity between the 2017 ACC/AHA and 2018 ESC/ESH CPGs than previous BP guidelines on each side of the Atlantic. Additional harmonization of the 2 guidelines in the future would be helpful. Ways to achieve this goal could include the use of processes that better approximate each other, liaison membership from each writing committee to the other, temporal synchronization of guideline preparation allowing ongoing communication between writing committees, structured open discussion of the science underpinning recommendations by the writing committees and sharing systematic reviews related to key questions, peer review of each report by members of the other guideline writing committee, and joint presentations/publications, such as the one provided here, to compare the ACC/AHA and the ESC/ESH recommendations and to place them in the context of the populations and practice communities for which they are being written. Much of this is already happening to some extent, but it is informal and would likely benefit from a more structured approach. The ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines have a common purpose of assisting clinicians, the public health community, and the public in achieving the goal of better health. Current rates of treatment and control of hypertension, however defined, remain suboptimal in Europe and the United States. The more convergent the major American and European guideline recommendations are with each other, the more unified the message to patients, clinicians, professional societies, governmental agencies, and the public. Greater congruence would thus be expected to underscore a common purpose and command the attention necessary to catalyze changes in practice leading to improvement in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in the future.

Implementation

Globally reduce mean salt intake in the population by 30% by 2025, as proposed by the WHO and supported by the World Health Assembly. Approaches should be tailored considering local context, especially in regards to differences in food and lifestyle-related behaviours, including the source of salt intake. Adopting the WHO SHAKE package at country level provides a unique opportunity for salt reduction at population and individual levels. Importantly, salt substitution with low sodium and high potassium alternatives may provide an opportunity to reduce BP at the population level. Translation of fundamental research into practice is crucial as mechanisms explaining how sodium increases BP is partly understood and assessment of salt intake on the individual level is poorly associated with actual daily intake – complicating the interpretation of the epidemiological link between estimated salt intake and health outcomes. To this end, academic organizations and learned societies called on scientists, clinicians, healthcare providers and other stakeholders to support global efforts to implement the reduction in salt. The global actors’ policy priorities and funding allocation need to align, making salt reduction at the population level a key priority. Finally, industry and governments play a major role in shaping salt consumption at the population level. Governments should follow the expert advice and introduce legislation decreasing sodium in processed foods which, in turn should be endorsed by the food industry.

### Pulmonary hypertension in the intensive care unit [^6b9cb8bf]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension, a condition that can lead to right ventricular failure and hemodynamic collapse, can be very challenging to manage in critically ill patients who require the intensive care unit. Because of the underlying structure of the right ventricle, significant increases in right ventricular afterload initiate a vicious cycle of degenerating right ventricular function, giving rise to right ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, inciting factors such as sepsis and arrhythmias can exacerbate this process. Important management principles include close monitoring of hemodynamics with both noninvasive and invasive modalities, optimization of right ventricular preload, maintenance of systemic blood pressure, enhancement of right ventricular contractility, reduction of right ventricular afterload, and reversal of identifiable inciting factors. The goal of this review is to discuss these key concepts in managing this difficult patient population.

### Management of stage 1 hypertension in adults with a low 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease: filling a guidance gap: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^922ef231]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading cause of worldwide cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Patients and clinicians dealing with hypertension have benefited from the evidence of event-based randomized controlled clinical trials. One result from those trials has been the development of evidence-based guidelines. The commitment to using evidence from these event-based randomized trials has been a cornerstone in the development of guideline treatment recommendations. However, in some situations, evidence from event-based trials is not available to guideline writers or clinicians for assistance in treatment decision making. Such is the case for the management of many patients with stage 1 hypertension. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide information complementary to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for the patient with untreated stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP/diastolic BP, 130-139/80-89 mmHg) with a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease <10% who fails to meet the systolic BP/diastolic goal (<130/80 mmHg) after 6 months of guideline-recommended lifestyle therapy. This statement provides evidence from sources other than event-based randomized controlled clinical trials and offers therapy options for consideration by clinicians.

HYPERTENSION GUIDELINE AND TREATMENT CONTROVERSIES

Hypertension care is complex. Multiple guidelines with different treatment thresholds, diagnostic criteria, and target goals introduce potential program, communication, and management complexity may have contributed to the decline in controlled BP.The 2017 AHA/ACC BP guidelineand the report from members initially appointed to the Joint National Committee (JNC-8)have been the subject of debate and inconsistent implementation by some professional organizations and clinicians. For example, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended that patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older should be treated to a systolic BP target of <150 mm Hg,aligning with the JNC-8 writing group recommendation, but conflicting with JNC-7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline.It is unclear whether these inconsistencies contribute to reduced BP control. Of note, hypertension control to <140/<90 mm Hg declined more in adults 40–59 years than in those 60 years and older.This finding suggests that factors other than the JNC-8 report and ACP/AAFP recommendations for a higher systolic BP target may contribute to the broad-based decline in hypertension control.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^a4680c5c]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

Implementation

Continual support for people with overweight or obesity is required to make a sustainable behavioural change and encourage healthy weight levels over the life course. The development of government-supported and industry-supported programmes, environment, facilities and infrastructure promoting healthy eating and weight reduction is paramount.

In the primary care of hypertension, healthcare providers should (whenever available) refer patients to appropriate weight loss programmes and prescribe individualized exercise and physical activity. Behavioural change techniques and coaching that include goal setting, monitoring and feedback should be considered to reduce overweight and maintain a healthy weight.

INTRODUCTION

The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) published several guidelines (GLs) for the management of arterial hypertension in recent years to help physicians and patients make decisions in particular disease conditions. The last one was published in 2023, the ESH 2023 guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.

The year 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the hypertension guidelines of the ESH, which were published for the first time in 2003. It is evident that guidelines – based on past collected knowledge – are important regarding diagnosis and treatment, to prevent or delay the adverse effects of hypertension.

Several studies conducted in the past few decades have shown that clinical practice guidelines, for the management of cardiovascular diseases, include a small percentage, less than 15%, of the recommendations which are supported by Level A evidence, meaning that multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses providing the highest level of evidence are not present. Furthermore, these studies also have demonstrated a steady temporal trend or small increase in Level A evidence [,–]. Based on a recent study comparing 50 clinical practice guidelines from 2011 to 2022, 16% of the recommendations were supported by the highest quality of evidence, Level A, at the same time, there was a slight global increase in Level A in recent years.

There are no systematic methods to measure quantitatively the helpfulness or quality of GLs, that is, how much help they provide to the physicians. Moreover, previous assessments/methods also pose several questions. Whether the previous analysis could provide an objective ‘result’ on the helpfulness of a GL, for example, based on: the frequency of recommendations and evidence, the frequency of evidence at each class of recommendation (Level by Class), or vice versa the frequency of recommendations in each level of evidence (Class by Level)? These questions underline the need to further develop the methods of assessing GLs, which can be improved by including implementation advice and translating scientific Evidence into Recommendations.

The ESH 2023 guideline was a further development of the 2018 guideline, in terms of structure and function, covering more than 40 new aspects in detail. In addition, several new clinical trials were completed in recent years, thus we have hypothesized that the 2023 guideline will provide greater help to clinicians in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. We also hypothesized that our method provides an objective assessment of the usefulness of a guideline, as a kind of ‘quality control’, and allows comparison of various medical guidelines.

Conclusion

While JNC 8 offers improvements over JNC 7 with a laudable dedication to high‐quality randomized evidence‐based recommendations, it leaves open some areas of improvement for the new ACC/AHA committee. By focusing solely on RCTs, we are left with areas of uncertainty where high‐quality observational studies could help elucidate effective recommendations to ultimately achieve the goal of improving hypertension control and the health of our patients. By creating a higher SBP treatment threshold for people >60 years old, the very group who are at the highest CVD risk, implementation of JNC 8 recommendations could mean that >6 million people in this category may not be started on treatment and an additional 13.5 million may have their treatment target liberalized, with potential detrimental consequences. 29

While the previous BP target of <140/90 mm Hg could be liberalized for patients who are frail or >80 years old, adopting these new guidelines in persons aged 60 to 80 years may lead to a resurgence of stroke rates. More research is needed, particularly on the use of estimated ASCVD risk cut‐points to inform therapeutic antihypertensive targets, but the new ACC/AHA hypertension guideline committee should consider a risk‐based treatment approach for adults >60 years of age by; for example, initiating BP treatment for those with SBP ≥140 mm Hg based on a ≥7.5% 10‐year ASCVD risk score. Finally, the results from SPRINT will further undermine the JNC 8 recommendations and will likely result in a paradigm shift in how we treat hypertension.

JNC 8—Recommendation 9 (treatment strategy and titration) states that the main objective of hypertension treatment is to attain and maintain goal blood pressure (BP). If goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes in recommendation 6 (thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB), and the clinician should continue to assess BP and adjust the treatment regimen until goal BP is reached. If goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug from the list provided; do not use an ACEI and an ARB together in the same patient. If goal BP cannot be reached using the strategy in recommendation 6 because of a contraindication or the need to use more than 3 drugs to reach goal BP, antihypertensive drugs from other classes can be used. Expert Opinion – Grade E.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: new blood pressure targets, lower is better-and possible [^f242ff75]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has now released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for 8 years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these, the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of <130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to <120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^53a62912]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical implications of hypertension in addition to a high prevalence of both uncontrolled blood pressure and medication nonadherence promote interest in developing device-based approaches to hypertension treatment. The expansion of device-based therapies and ongoing clinical trials underscores the need for consistency in trial design, conduct, and definitions of clinical study elements to permit trial comparability and data poolability. Standardizing methods of blood pressure assessment, effectiveness measures beyond blood pressure alone, and safety outcomes are paramount. The Hypertension Academic Research Consortium (HARC) document represents an integration of evolving evidence and consensus opinion among leading experts in cardiovascular medicine and hypertension research with regulatory perspectives on clinical trial design and methodology. The HARC document integrates the collective information among device-based therapies for hypertension to better address existing challenges and identify unmet needs for technologies proposed to treat the world’s leading cause of death and disability. Consistent with the Academic Research Consortium charter, this document proposes pragmatic consensus clinical design principles and outcomes definitions for studies aimed at evaluating device-based hypertension therapies.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^c870bffa]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective—and, where appropriate, more intensive—therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of <10, 10 to 19, and ≥20 mm Hg, respectively.Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP >140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention—potentially with dual therapy—should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Digital hypertension-what we need for the high-quality management of hypertension in the new era [^7dc0f10e]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Digital technologies are playing an increasing role in hypertension management. Digital hypertension is a new field that integrates advancing technologies into hypertension management. This research area encompasses various aspects of digital transformation technologies, including the development of novel blood pressure (BP) measurement devices-whether cuffless or cuff-based sensors-the transmission of large-scale time-series BP data, cloud-based computing and analysis of BP indices, presentation of the results, and feedback systems for both patients and physicians. A key component of this approach is novel blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices. This article summarizes the latest information and discussions about "held at the 2024 Japan Society of Hypertension scientific meeting. Novel BP monitoring includes cuffless devices that estimate BP, but cuffless devices require achieving accuracy without the need for calibration using conventional cuff-based devices. New BP monitoring devices can provide information on novel biomarkers beyond BP and may improve risk assessment and outcomes. Integration of BP data with omics and clinical information should enable personalized hypertension management. Key data gaps relating to novel BP monitoring devices are accuracy/validation in different settings/populations, association between BP metrics and hard clinical outcomes, and measurement/interpretation of BP variability data. Human- and health system-related factors also need to be addressed or overcome before these devices can be successfully integrated into routine clinical practice. If these things can be achieved, new BP monitoring technologies could transform hypertension management and play a pivotal role in the future of remote healthcare. This article summarizes the latest information and discussions about digital hypertension from the Digital Hypertension symposium that took place during the 2024 Japan Society of Hypertension scientific meeting.

### Optimizing hypertension management in clinical practice [^17932ecc]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

A clear relationship exists between elevated blood pressure (BP) and various manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Despite the availability of numerous treatment guidelines, hypertension remains inadequately controlled, with only a small proportion of patients achieving target BP levels. Many factors, both patient and physician related, contribute to this poor level of hypertension control. Major determinants include the implementation of inappropriate treatment regimens that do not enable patients to achieve goal and poor patient compliance. For example, it is widely acknowledged that most patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve BP goal; however, physicians may be reluctant to employ such treatment strategies. The aim of this review is to explore factors that contribute to poor hypertension control rates and how to overcome these, including the rationale for selecting combination therapy, with particular reference to angiotensin II receptor blocker combinations.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies’ guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2 
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

Conclusion

Acute HTN management is heterogenous across various presentations, based on available resources and local expertise. High-quality evidence is either missing or where available does not necessarily conclusively favour specific rates of reduction in BP or specific medications. In conclusion, based on available evidence and where lacking consensus statements were made in consultation with the BIHS. The proposed set of recommendations for the management of acute hypertensive states aim to offer an evidence-based and consistent approach to the delivery of high-quality patient care.

### Non-pharmacological aspects of blood pressure management: what are the data? [^92a0f595]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects 29% of US adults and is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological data support contribution of several dietary and other lifestyle-related factors to the development of high blood pressure (BP). Several clinical trials investigated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications to reduce BP. Best evidence from randomized controlled trials supports BP-lowering effects of weight loss, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and dietary sodium (Na(+)) reduction in those with prehypertension, with more pronounced effects in those with hypertension. In hypertensive participants, the effects on BP of DASH combined with low Na(+) alone or with the addition of weight loss were greater than or equal to those of single-drug therapy. Trials where food was provided to participants were more successful in showing a BP-lowering effect. However, clinical studies with long-term follow-up revealed that lifestyle modifications were difficult to maintain. Findings from controlled trials of increased potassium, calcium, or magnesium intake, or reduction in alcohol intake revealed modest BP-lowering effects and are less conclusive. The reported effects of exercise independent of weight loss on BP are inconsistent.

Recommendation

1 Alcohol consumption should be zero for the best cardiovascular outcomes (Supplementary Box 2). However, the recommended daily upper limit for alcohol consumption is two standard drinks for men and 1 for women (10 g alcohol/standard drink), while acknowledging that there is no safe limit for alcohol consumption to prevent hypertension and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
2 Binge drinking should be avoided.

Implementation

Explicit assessment of alcohol intake should be a routine part of the history in the initial diagnosis and subsequent management of hypertension. The effect of counselling alone is uncertain, though data from several RCTs support the effect of brief interventions such as motivational interviews in reducing alcohol intake.
