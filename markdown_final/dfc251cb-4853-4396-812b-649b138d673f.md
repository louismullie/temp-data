## Question

Detailed pain algorithm for back pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a detailed low back pain management algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about scope and framing, including how to triage low back pain and define acuity. Then, I should verify imaging decision points and red flags. Next, I will examine acute and subacute management, followed by chronic management, interventional options, neuromodulation, and surgical considerations. After that, I need to consider special populations and follow-up cadence. Finally, I will reflect on implementation and quality improvement so the algorithm is practical in real-world settings [^112pGDGa] [^111pxHxH] [^113sgg8c] [^114ybyzQ].

> Let me first confirm the foundational clinical assessment and triage approach because everything downstream depends on it. I should classify pain by duration into acute (< 4 weeks), subacute (4–12 weeks), and chronic (> 12 weeks), and screen for red flags indicating fracture, infection, malignancy, or severe/progressive neurologic deficits such as cauda equina syndrome, while also documenting baseline pain and function to track response over time, which is emphasized across major guidelines and supports later reassessments using thresholds of clinically important improvement [^111pxHxH] [^112pGDGa] [^114hvKiN] [^114XKJ6i].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags that trigger immediate imaging or urgent referral so I don't miss serious disease. Older adults with low-velocity trauma or osteoporosis, those on chronic corticosteroids, patients with immunosuppression, fever, IV drug use, or known cancer, and anyone with severe/progressive neurologic deficits should be prioritized for prompt imaging and specialty input, with the ACR underscoring specific risk profiles in which X-ray or MRI is indicated up front and the ACP advising against routine imaging otherwise [^113sgg8c] [^114hvKiN].

> Next, I should review the imaging decision node because inappropriate early imaging is common and potentially harmful. In the absence of red flags, imaging should generally be avoided in acute and subacute low back pain as it does not improve outcomes and increases incidental findings and downstream procedures, while for suspected radiculopathy with progressive deficits or for chronic pain when procedural or surgical decisions hinge on anatomy, MRI without contrast is typically appropriate, reserving contrast for postoperative or infection/malignancy scenarios as clinically indicated [^114hvKiN] [^113sgg8c] [^112pGDGa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about psychosocial drivers; I need to check for "yellow flags" because they modify prognosis and treatment intensity. Beliefs about pain, fear-avoidance, depression, anxiety, catastrophizing, and occupational factors increase risk of chronicity and should prompt early education and psychologically informed care, with NICE recommending combined physical and psychological programs when psychosocial barriers are substantial and WHO emphasizing non-pharmacologic strategies in primary care [^113CM3GM] [^111pxHxH].

> Now I will examine first-line care for acute and subacute low back pain, staying conservative and active. Education and reassurance about the favorable natural history, encouragement of activity while avoiding bed rest, use of superficial heat, and consideration of spinal manipulation, massage, or acupuncture as options are supported, while short courses of NSAIDs and, when needed, short-term skeletal muscle relaxants can be used judiciously if non-pharmacologic care is insufficient, with the ACP explicitly recommending heat and noninvasive therapies and advising NSAIDs or muscle relaxants if medication is desired [^1164WXri] [^11438T4J] [^117JnJgu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized recommendations for topical NSAIDs from acute non–low back musculoskeletal injuries to low back pain, but I should correct that. The AAFP/ACP 2020 guideline on topical NSAIDs pertains to non–low back injuries and should not be extrapolated to low back pain, so I will avoid applying that here and instead anchor pharmacologic decisions in LBP-specific guidelines that prioritize NSAIDs and time-limited muscle relaxants while discouraging opioids for acute low back pain [^111cvUzN] [^1164WXri] [^112pGDGa].

> Let me think about acetaminophen, as it's commonly used but the evidence differs by context. For chronic primary low back pain, WHO highlights insufficient evidence to support acetaminophen as monotherapy, so I should avoid presenting it as a primary option in chronic care, whereas its role in acute low back pain is limited and inferior to NSAIDs in most comparisons, reinforcing a cautious, individualized approach to analgesic selection [^117M4Sa8] [^1164WXri].

> I should confirm the reassessment cadence in the acute/subacute phase to prevent therapeutic inertia. A practical approach is to reassess within 2–4 weeks, using standardized pain and function measures and looking for at least 30% improvement; insufficient improvement should trigger escalation to structured physical therapy or addition of another noninvasive modality, aligning with guideline principles of measured, stepwise care and meaningful change thresholds that patients can interpret [^114ybyzQ] [^114XKJ6i].

> Next, I should review chronic low back pain management, where multimodal nonpharmacologic care is the cornerstone. Supervised exercise therapy (aerobic, strengthening, flexibility) tailored to patient preferences, group programs that combine physical and psychological components, and cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based stress reduction have consistent support across NICE, ACP, APS, and Cochrane syntheses, with interdisciplinary rehabilitation reserved for patients with higher disability or complex psychosocial profiles and modest but durable benefits over usual care [^117JnJgu] [^115crRCd] [^113wcf39] [^116qnjL9].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of yoga and spinal manipulation in chronic low back pain because evidence and effect sizes vary. NASS suggests yoga can yield medium-term improvements for mild chronic low back pain, though gains may be small, and supports offering spinal manipulative therapy across acute and chronic presentations, while WHO and ACP also note options such as massage and manipulation in selected patients, so these can be integrated based on preference and access [^111UM9vk] [^114SM6s4] [^111pxHxH] [^1164WXri].

> I will now examine pharmacologic therapy in chronic low back pain using a stepped approach. NSAIDs remain first-line when not contraindicated, duloxetine is a reasonable second-line option particularly with comorbid depressive symptoms or central pain features, and short-term topical agents such as capsaicin can be considered, whereas long-term opioids should generally be avoided and considered only after failure of comprehensive multimodal care with documented functional goals and ongoing risk mitigation per VA/DoD recommendations [^111upJXW] [^112kienb] [^115e2c9Y] [^112pGDGa].

> But wait, what about phenotyping pain mechanisms to personalize treatment; is that ready for routine use? The BACPAP consortium's 2024 consensus on nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic phenotypes is promising for research and hypothesis-driven care, but they explicitly state it is not ready for broad clinical implementation, so I will treat it as an adjunctive lens rather than a guideline-mandated framework in everyday practice [^112Hut8Y].

> Next, I should review interventional procedures and keep indications precise. For radicular pain due to disc herniation or stenosis, epidural corticosteroid injections may offer small, short-term improvements in pain and disability, particularly in acute severe sciatica, but do not confer long-term benefit, so they should be used selectively while pursuing active rehabilitation, and intradiscal injectates lack sufficient evidence for discogenic pain in NASS guidance [^115vv67U] [^1176p7Jr] [^113nj7VL].

> Let me verify facet joint intervention protocols because practices differ and false positives are a concern. Diagnostic medial branch blocks should precede radiofrequency ablation, with recognized controversy around the number of blocks and percent pain relief required; the multispecialty consensus accepts a single block with a 50% cutoff, whereas SIS favors two blocks with an 80% cutoff to reduce false positives, highlighting the need to balance accuracy, access, and cost in shared decision-making [^113BTKpL] [^112PNSQF].

> I should also consider sacroiliac joint and less common etiologies. For sacroiliac joint pain, a stepped approach from education and exercise to diagnostic injection and potential radiofrequency or rehabilitation is reasonable, and in Bertolotti's syndrome with a pseudoarticulation, a staged plan of diagnostic injection, radiofrequency ablation, and rarely endoscopic resection can both diagnose and treat selected refractory cases when imaging confirms the transitional anatomy [^1126EECG] [^113ZMwR6].

> Hold on, I need to check my prior assumption about fixed limits on epidural injections such as "a maximum of 3 per year". That sounds too rigid and may not be explicitly specified across high-credibility guidelines; instead, I should emphasize documenting short-term benefit, spacing injections appropriately, and avoiding serial procedures without functional gains, which aligns better with AAFP and VA/DoD caution about limited long-term efficacy and the need for outcome-driven use [^115vv67U] [^112pGDGa].

> Now I will examine neuromodulation and advanced therapies for refractory cases after comprehensive conservative and interventional care. Spinal cord stimulation can be considered for persistent radicular pain or failed back surgery syndrome in carefully selected patients, and neuropathic pain frameworks often position neurostimulation before targeted intrathecal drug delivery because of safety profiles, with TDD reserved for focal, severe, refractory pain; however, I should acknowledge these neuropathic algorithms are lower-credibility sources and adapt them cautiously in the LBP context [^113wcf39] [^115m8Lkc] [^111NK1fd].

> I need to ensure surgical indications are clear and not overextended to nonspecific chronic low back pain. Emergencies include cauda equina syndrome, progressive neurologic deficits, infection, malignancy with compression, and unstable fractures, while elective surgery is reserved for concordant pathology such as stenosis or spondylolisthesis failing extended conservative care, or persistent radiculopathy from a herniated disc with matching imaging and progressive deficits after an adequate trial of nonoperative therapy [^112pGDGa] [^1144ayFA].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with older adults where fracture risk and coexisting pain generators are common. In older patients, the threshold for plain films is lower in the setting of low-velocity trauma or osteoporosis, NSAID risks should be weighed against GI and renal comorbidities, and lateral hip or thigh pain often coexists with low back pain, necessitating a broader regional assessment to avoid anchoring bias [^113sgg8c] [^116Lmq5o].

> I should double-check recommendations for patients with substance use disorders and those in workers' compensation or litigation contexts. In SUD, opioids should generally be avoided and comprehensive nonpharmacologic and interventional pathways emphasized, while workers' compensation populations often have higher psychosocial complexity, reinforcing early psychologically informed rehabilitation and functional restoration as core strategies per VA/DoD guidance [^112pGDGa] [^113CM3GM].

> Let me reconsider follow-up and reassessment timelines to operationalize the algorithm. Early follow-up at about 2 weeks for acute cases, then every 4 weeks across subacute care, with quarterly reassessment in chronic care can work, using validated instruments and thresholds such as ≥ 30% improvement in pain or function to define response, while tracking trajectories helps identify those at risk for persistence who may benefit from escalated rehabilitation intensity [^114XKJ6i] [^111e6jE8].

> Finally, I need to check implementation strategies because evidence-concordant care often fails without systems support. Multifaceted implementation that includes academic detailing, EMR prompts embedding red-flag and imaging criteria, and patient-facing tools improves adherence, yet real-world adherence remains suboptimal as shown in physical therapy cohorts; recent analyses also highlight both the potential and limits of AI summarization against NASS guidelines, underscoring the need for clinician oversight and iterative quality improvement [^116zc3Bu] [^113sgg8c] [^114VMgy7] [^115wfV6h].

> To synthesize the pathway without losing nuance, I should confirm the overall flow. Start with history, exam, red/yellow flags, and duration classification; avoid imaging unless red flags or specific intervention decisions require it; for acute/subacute, prioritize education, activity, heat, and selective noninvasive therapies with short-term NSAIDs or muscle relaxants as needed; for chronic, deploy structured exercise, CBT or mindfulness, and interdisciplinary rehab as indicated, with NSAIDs first-line, duloxetine or topical capsaicin as adjuncts, and no routine long-term opioids; reserve interventional procedures for well-defined indications, consider neuromodulation only after failure of comprehensive care, and limit surgery to clear structural pathologies or emergencies, all while reassessing at defined intervals and embedding implementation supports to sustain guideline-concordant practice [^114hvKiN] [^1164WXri] [^117JnJgu] [^111upJXW] [^115vv67U] [^112pGDGa].

---

A detailed back pain algorithm starts with red flag screening [^114hvKiN] and mechanism-based classification (nociceptive, neuropathic, nociplastic) [^112Hut8Y] to guide targeted care. For **acute pain**, use education, activity, and NSAIDs [^1164WXri]; for **chronic pain**, prioritize exercise [^117JnJgu], CBT [^115crRCd], and multidisciplinary rehabilitation [^116qnjL9], reserving opioids and interventional procedures for refractory cases [^112kienb]. Imaging is only for **red flags** [^114hvKiN] or **persistent symptoms** [^113sgg8c], and **regular reassessment** ensures timely escalation or de-escalation [^112pGDGa].

---

## Initial assessment and triage

### Red flag screening

During screening, **red flags** include cancer, infection, fracture, cauda equina, and severe or progressive neurologic deficits [^114hvKiN]; the **immediate action** is urgent imaging [^113sgg8c] and specialist referral if any are present.

---

### Pain classification

Pain is classified as **nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic**: nociceptive pain reflects mechanical or degenerative sources (e.g. facet, disc) [^1172mCQ5]; neuropathic pain involves nerve pathology such as radiculopathy [^111NK1fd]; and nociplastic pain arises from central sensitization (e.g. fibromyalgia) [^112Hut8Y].

---

## Diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended imaging** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute LBP without red flags | No routine imaging | Not indicated [^114hvKiN] |
| Persistent LBP (> 6 weeks) with red flags | MRI | Suspected cancer, infection, fracture, severe neurologic deficits [^113sgg8c] |
| Radiculopathy or spinal stenosis | MRI | Persistent neurologic symptoms [^113sgg8c] |
| Suspected osteoporosis or compression fracture | X-ray or MRI | Elderly, low-velocity trauma, osteoporosis, chronic corticosteroid use [^113sgg8c] |

---

Within the diagnostic workup, **laboratory tests** include CBC, ESR, and CRP when infection or inflammatory disease is suspected [^112pGDGa].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

### Acute and subacute back pain

- **Education**: Reassure, stay active, avoid bed rest [^112tRWkk].
- **Exercise**: Supervised or group programs [^117JnJgu].
- **Manual therapy**: Spinal manipulation, massage [^111pxHxH] [^114SM6s4].
- **Superficial heat**: For acute/subacute pain [^11438T4J].

---

### Chronic back pain

Management emphasizes **structured exercise** — such as aerobic, strength, flexibility, or yoga programs [^117JnJgu] — alongside psychological therapies, including CBT, mindfulness, and operant approaches [^115crRCd] [^112nVT6h]. **Multidisciplinary rehabilitation** using biopsychosocial programs is recommended [^116qnjL9] [^113wcf39].

---

## Pharmacological management

| **Pain type** | **First-line medications** | **Second-line medications** | **Third-line medications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nociceptive pain | NSAIDs [^111upJXW] | Acetaminophen | Short-term opioids (severe cases) [^112kienb] |
| Neuropathic pain | Gabapentin, pregabalin, TCAs, SNRIs [^111NK1fd] | Tramadol, tapentadol [^111NK1fd] | Low-dose opioids (refractory cases) [^111NK1fd] |
| Nociplastic pain | Antidepressants, anticonvulsants | Combination therapy | Low-dose opioids (refractory cases) |

---

As part of pharmacologic therapy, **topical agents** include capsaicin for short-term relief [^115e2c9Y] [^114f95vv].

---

## Interventional procedures

- **Epidural injections**: Short-term relief for radicular pain [^115vv67U] [^1176p7Jr].
- **Facet joint interventions**: Medial branch blocks, radiofrequency ablation [^115HmUgK] [^113BTKpL].
- **SI joint injections**: For sacroiliac pain [^1126EECG].
- **Spinal cord stimulation**: Refractory neuropathic pain [^111NK1fd].

---

## Surgical interventions

For surgical interventions, **indications** include persistent neurologic deficits, cauda equina, severe spinal stenosis, and refractory radiculopathy; typical **procedures** are decompression, discectomy, fusion, and interspinous spacers [^113y8zVv].

---

## Follow-up and reassessment

Follow-up includes **regular reassessment** of pain, function, psychosocial factors, and treatment response [^1167F3gY] [^111e6jE8]. If response is inadequate, consider escalation to interventional or surgical options as appropriate; if improved, de-escalate by reducing pharmacologic and interventional treatments [^112pGDGa].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly**: Caution with NSAIDs, prefer acetaminophen, topical agents, gentle exercise.
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid NSAIDs, opioids; use acetaminophen, physical therapy, manual therapy.
- **Comorbidities**: Tailor to cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, psychiatric conditions [^112pGDGa].

---

A structured algorithm that integrates red flag screening, mechanism-based classification, selective imaging, and stepwise non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic care — with escalation to interventional or surgical options only when necessary — **optimizes outcomes and minimizes harm**.

### Noninvasive treatments for acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1164WXri]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the noninvasive treatment of low back pain.

- **Methods**: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published through April 2015 on noninvasive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for low back pain. Updated searches were performed through November 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included reduction or elimination of low back pain, improvement in back-specific and overall function, improvement in health-related quality of life, reduction in work disability and return to work, global improvement, number of back pain episodes or time between episodes, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain.

- **Recommendation 1**: Given that most patients with acute or subacute low back pain improve over time regardless of treatment, clinicians and patients should select nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat (moderate-quality evidence), massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). If pharmacologic treatment is desired, clinicians and patients should select nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or skeletal muscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade: strong recommendation).

### Diagnostic imaging for low back pain: Advice for high-value health care from the American College of Physicians [^114hvKiN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is indicated for patients with low back pain only if they have severe progressive neurologic deficits or signs or symptoms that suggest a serious or specific underlying condition. In other patients, evidence indicates that routine imaging is not associated with clinically meaningful benefits but can lead to harms. Addressing inefficiencies in diagnostic testing could minimize potential harms to patients and have a large effect on the use of resources by reducing both direct and downstream costs. In this area, more testing does not equate to better care. Implementing a selective approach to low back imaging, as suggested by the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guideline on low back pain, would provide better care to patients, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

### Nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic low back pain? The low back pain phenotyping (BACPAP) consortium's international and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations [^112Hut8Y]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

The potential to classify low back pain as being characterized by dominant nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic mechanisms is a clinically relevant issue. Preliminary evidence suggests that these low back pain phenotypes might respond differently to treatments; however, more research must be done before making specific recommendations. Accordingly, the low back pain phenotyping (BACPAP) consortium was established as a group of 36 clinicians and researchers from 13 countries (five continents) and 29 institutions to apply a modified Nominal Group Technique methodology. This was done to develop international and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations that provide guidance for identifying the dominant pain phenotype in patients with low back pain and potentially adapt pain management strategies.

The BACPAP consortium's recommendations are also intended to provide direction for future clinical research by building on the established clinical criteria for neuropathic and nociplastic pain. The BACPAP consortium's consensus recommendations are a necessary early step in the process of determining if personalized pain medicine based on pain phenotypes is feasible for low back pain management. Therefore, these recommendations are not ready to be implemented in clinical practice until additional evidence is generated that is specific to these low back pain phenotypes.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^115m8Lkc]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

For effective therapy, patient selection is crucial. Patients with localized pain, such as axial back pain, focal abdominal pain, or dermatomal pain, are likely to respond best to TDD. In contrast, those with diffuse pain, for example, pain affecting an entire extremity, as well as global and whole-body pain, are less likely to respond well due to the limited spread of drugs in the cerebrospinal fluid. Although some patients may benefit from a trial of TDD before neurostimulation, the generally higher safety profile of neurostimulation places it ahead of TDD in a neuropathic pain algorithm. For select patients, intrathecal ziconotide may be considered before initiating oral opioids due to ziconotide's safety profile. However, in most cases, TDD should be considered after low-dose oral opioid therapy has failed to provide adequate pain relief.

### Performance of ChatGPT on NASS clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A comparison study [^115wfV6h]. Spine (2024). High credibility.

This study is a comparative analysis aimed at evaluating the performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in predicting appropriate clinical recommendations based on the most recent clinical guidelines for diagnosing and treating low back pain.

Low back pain is a widespread and often debilitating condition affecting many people globally. ChatGPT, an advanced artificial intelligence model, might offer valuable recommendations for managing this condition.

Using the North American Spine Society's evidence-based clinical guidelines as the gold standard, researchers independently input 82 clinical questions related to low back pain into ChatGPT (GPT-3.5). For each question, ChatGPT's response was recorded and compared to the guideline recommendation using a point-answer system. Researchers assessed response accuracy by determining whether the guideline point was mentioned in ChatGPT's answer. This assessment was repeated with a modified approach: ChatGPT was prompted to respond as an experienced orthopedic surgeon for each question by guideline category. A two-sample proportion z test was applied to evaluate differences between the preprompt and postprompt scenarios with a significance level of alpha = 0.05.

The results indicated that ChatGPT's responses accurately reflected the guidelines with clinical recommendations 65% of the time (72% postprompt, P = 0.41), 46% for guidelines with insufficient or conflicting data (58% postprompt, P = 0.11), and 49% for guidelines without adequate studies to address the clinical question (16% postprompt, P = 0.003*). These findings highlight the potential and limitations of using AI tools like ChatGPT in clinical decision-making processes.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^113BTKpL]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The presubmission version of these guidelines was sent to participating organizations on 9 October 2019 and approved by all who voted by 8 November 2019, except for the American Society of Anesthesiologists, who requested a 3-week extension. There was 100% consensus among the committee members (coauthors) for each recommendation. Nine of the 13 organizations approved every recommendation, with one (SIS) dissenting on questions 10 (cut-off for designating a facet block as positive) and 11 (number of blocks that should be performed before RF ablation). Specifically, SIS believes the cut-off for a positive block should be 80% rather than 50%, and that two positive blocks should be routinely required in the absence of mitigating circumstances.

The American Pain Society disbanded during the development of the guidelines and did not vote. These guidelines were approved en bloc by the American Society of Anesthesiologists' Administrative Council and Committee on Pain Medicine, but were not voted on by their Board of Directors or House of Delegates. The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs did not vote on the document per internal regulations (i.e. these guidelines were not solicited and funded by those organizations), but sent representatives (the US Army Pain Medicine Consultant to the Surgeon General and the Director of Interventional Pain Management) to participate in guideline development, and they concurred with all recommendations.

### Low back pain and sciatica: Summary of NICE guidance [^113CM3GM]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for low back pain, specifically regarding physical therapy, the NICE 2017 guidelines recommend considering offering a combined physical and psychological program that incorporates a cognitive-behavioral approach. This is preferably conducted in a group setting and should take into account the patient's specific needs and capabilities. It is advised for patients with persistent low back pain (LBP) or sciatica when there are substantial psychosocial obstacles to recovery, such as avoiding normal activities based on inappropriate beliefs about their condition. It is also recommended when previous treatments have not been effective.

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: Prospect methodology [^112h2Nra]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

The PROSPECT sub-group determines if each intervention should be recommended or not recommended. To be recommended, the intervention must be shown to be beneficial in at least two RCTs. Studies are not excluded from the review based on the risk of bias scoring. Additionally, to ensure clinical relevance, the relevance to peri-operative practice is assessed. We also evaluate whether the intervention would improve postoperative pain relief and/or outcomes when added to the 'basic analgesic regimen' or if it would be beneficial if this regimen is not possible or is contraindicated.

Furthermore, consideration is given to the balance between the invasiveness of the analgesic technique and the consequences of postoperative pain, as well as the balance between analgesic efficacy and the adverse event profile of the analgesic technique. Relevant patient characteristics, such as opioid tolerance and psychiatric comorbidities, may also be included to ensure the pain management is not only procedure-specific but also patient-specific. It is important to note that efficacy data from 'similar' procedures are not utilized for recommendations.

Adverse effects of analgesic interventions are identified through an extensive literature search, which is not procedure-specific; however, risks are adjusted for the procedure being evaluated. Case-control studies and cohort or observational studies can be used to identify adverse effects of analgesic interventions.

Finally, a draft table or algorithm of the recommendations for analgesic, anaesthetic, or surgical interventions is prepared, detailing each recommendation's applicability and considerations.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^116Lmq5o]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article presents an evidence-based algorithm to assist primary care providers with the diagnosis and management of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. It is part of a series that focuses on coexisting pain patterns and contributors to chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the aging population. The objective of the series is to encourage clinicians to take a holistic approach when evaluating and treating CLBP in older adults.

- **Methods**: A content expert panel and a primary care panel collaboratively used the modified Delphi approach to iteratively develop an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm. The panelists included physiatrists, geriatricians, internists, and physical therapists who treat both civilians and veterans. The algorithm was developed so that all required resources are available within the Veterans Health Administration system. An illustrative patient case was chosen from one of the author's clinical practices to demonstrate the reasoning behind principles presented in the algorithm.

- **Results**: An algorithm was developed which logically outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. A case is presented which highlights the potential complexities of identifying the true pain generator and the importance of implementing proper treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults can contribute to and coexist with CLBP. Distinguishing the true cause(s) of pain from potentially a myriad of asymptomatic degenerative changes can be challenging.

### Evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management [^1145Kfbe]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen an unprecedented interest in evidence-based medicine. Various avenues have emerged to provide valid and reliable healthcare information, including clinical practice guidelines. Consequently, healthcare decisions are increasingly based on research-based evidence rather than expert opinion or clinical experience alone. However, methods describing evidence synthesis or the development of guidelines in interventional pain management remain scarce.

- **Objective**: To describe the methods of evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management in practical terms.

- **Description**: This review aims to provide an understanding of evidence-based medicine, the importance and synthesis of clinical practice guidelines, and the variety of issues related to rating the quality of individual articles. It covers understanding narrative and systematic reviews, grading the strength of the body of evidence, searching for evidence, and finally, the analytical preparation of guidelines with a focus on interventional pain management.

- **Conclusion**: Evidence synthesis and development of guidelines in interventional pain management is a complex and challenging task. It is emphasized that practice guidelines are not intended as standards or absolute requirements. Consequently, practice guidelines may be adapted, modified, or rejected according to the clinical needs and constraints of each practitioner and patient.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline: Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^112pGDGa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In September 2017, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) approved the joint Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the diagnosis and management of low back pain. This CPG was intended to provide healthcare providers with a framework to evaluate, treat, and manage patients with low back pain (LBP).

- **Methods**: The VA/DoD Evidence-Based Practice Work Group convened a joint VA/DoD guideline development effort that included a multidisciplinary panel of practicing clinician stakeholders and conformed to the Institute of Medicine's tenets for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines. The guideline panel developed key questions in collaboration with the ECRI Institute, which systematically searched and evaluated the literature through September 2016, developed an algorithm, and rated recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. A patient focus group was also convened to ensure that patient values and perspectives were considered when formulating preferences and shared decision-making in the guideline.

- **Recommendations**: The VA/DoD LBP CPG provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnostic approach, education and self-care, non-pharmacologic and non-invasive therapy, pharmacologic therapy, dietary supplements, non-surgical invasive therapy, and team approach to the treatment of low back pain.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment: Part X: Sacroiliac joint syndrome [^1126EECG]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

To present an algorithm of sequential treatment options for managing sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain in the setting of chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the older adult, an illustrative clinical case is included.

The stepped care drug table and evaluation and treatment algorithm were created following a thorough literature review of approaches and subsequent analysis through a modified Delphi process. The principal investigator developed the initial draft, which was refined for content by an interdisciplinary panel of five experts. The refined materials were then assessed for the feasibility of implementation and validity of recommendations for older adults in a primary care setting by a panel of nine primary care providers. While not exclusive to Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) facilities, emphasis was made to include resources and medications available to providers in the VHA.

The algorithm and drug table developed to systematically identify and address SIJ pain in the older adult is presented. The process should begin with recognizing the presenting symptoms of CLBP stemming from the SI region and supporting physical exam testing using the compression test and thigh thrust maneuver. Identification of the SIJ as a pain generator is followed by assessment and treatment of contributory factors. SIJ pain treatment should begin with education and self-management, including exercise, and may escalate to include interventional procedures or referral to a pain rehabilitation program.

### Corrigendum to: A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^114f95vv]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

This is a corrigendum to the original paper titled "A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain", published in Pain Medicine, Volume 20, Issue Supplement_1, June 2019, Pages S2–S12.

A reader brought to our attention that the originally published version contained two errors in Table 1. Below is the correct information:

- **Starting dose of Pregabalin**: 75 mg PO BID. Max. daily dose = 600 mg.
- **Topical Capsaicin caution**: The caution to avoid topical 8% Capsaicin for use in diabetic peripheral neuropathy has been removed.

These details have been corrected only in this corrigendum to preserve the published version of record.

**What is the purpose and context of the algorithm**: Algorithm development should be driven by a clinical need or "pain point", not by what is simply technically feasible due to available data. Clinicians should ask if, during the design phase, developers collaborated with end-users in agreeing on: (1) the specific clinical task or function of the algorithm, such as diagnosis, prognostication, or treatment response; (2) the target population and clinical setting; and (3) the intended method of algorithm implementation.

### New developments in the treatment algorithm for peripheral neuropathic pain [^111nxpTr]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain often imposes a substantial and unrelenting burden on individuals who experience it; single-agent analgesics typically only reduce pain at best. Worldwide, five sets of treatment recommendations offer insight into managing neuropathic pain, including two European guidelines, one Canadian, one Latin American, and another constructed under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). The analgesics common to these guidelines are topical lidocaine, secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors, calcium channel α(2)-δ ligands, tramadol, and opioid antagonists.

Significant knowledge gaps in the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions have hampered the development of algorithms and multimodal approaches. As the evidence base expands, the addition of new comparative trial data will further refine the development of new guidance for the clinical management of neuropathic pain. New alternatives for managing neuropathic pain, such as the high-concentration capsaicin patch, will enlarge the treatment armamentarium and potentially impact therapeutic guidelines.

### Optimal strategies for reporting pain in clinical trials and systematic reviews: Recommendations from an OMERACT 12 workshop [^114XKJ6i]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). High credibility.

Pain is a patient-important outcome, but reporting in randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews is often suboptimal, impeding clinical interpretation and decision making.

- **Objective**: A working group at the 2014 Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT 12) was convened to provide guidance for reporting treatment effects regarding pain for individual studies and systematic reviews.

- **Methods**: For individual trials, authors should report, in addition to mean change, the proportion of patients achieving one or more thresholds of improvement from baseline pain (e.g. ≥ 20%, ≥ 30%, ≥ 50%), achievement of a desirable pain state (e.g. no worse than mild pain), and/or a combination of change and state. Effects on pain should be accompanied by other patient-important outcomes to facilitate interpretation.

- **Results**: When pooling data for meta-analysis, authors should consider converting all continuous measures for pain to a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and use the established, minimally important difference (MID) of 10 mm, and the conventionally used, appreciably important differences of 20 mm, 30 mm, and 50 mm, to facilitate interpretation. Effects ≤ 0.5 units suggest a small or very small effect. To further increase interpretability, the pooled estimate on the VAS should also be transformed to a binary outcome and expressed as a relative risk and risk difference. This transformation can be achieved by calculating the probability of experiencing a treatment effect greater than the MID and the thresholds for appreciably important differences in pain reduction.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: A systematic review [^1178hpTB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Appraisal of selected CPGs using AGREE II instrument

The AGREE II instrument, an updated version of the original AGREE instrument, is an international, rigorously developed, and validated tool used widely to assess clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). It consists of 23 key items organized into six domains: "scope and purpose" (items 1–3), "stakeholder involvement" (items 4–7), "rigor of development" (items 8–14), "clarity of presentation" (items 15–18), "applicability" (items 19–21), and "editorial independence" (items 22–23). Each item in a domain is scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). A score of 1 (strongly disagree) should be given if there is no relevant information on the AGREE II items or if this information is very poorly reported. Conversely, a score of 7 (strongly agree) should be assigned when the full criteria and considerations articulated in the User's Manual have been met. Scores between 2 and 6 should be given if reporting information does not meet the full criteria or considerations relevant to the AGREE II item. Three reviewers assessed each included CPG independently and provided their scores on the overall assessment. Item scores were discussed, and scoring discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The score for each domain was calculated as follows: (obtained score-minimal possible score)/(maximal possible score-minimal possible score). As defined by AGREE II, we considered a CPG satisfactory if it scored at least 50% on all six domains.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive and statistical analyses were performed for each domain of the AGREE II instrument. Inter-rater reliability was assessed, and adjustments were made for any inconsistencies.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^111NK1fd]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to merge treatment guidelines and best practice recommendations for the management of neuropathic pain into a comprehensive algorithm for primary physicians. The algorithm covers assessment, multidisciplinary conservative care, nonopioid pharmacological management, interventional therapies, neurostimulation, low-dose opioid treatment, and targeted drug delivery therapy.

- **Methods**: Available literature was identified through a search of the U.S. National Library of Medicine's Medline database, PubMed.gov. References from identified published articles were also reviewed for relevant citations.

- **Results**: The algorithm provides a comprehensive treatment pathway from assessment to the provision of first- through sixth-line therapies for primary care physicians. Clear indicators for progression of therapy from first-line to sixth-line are provided. Multidisciplinary conservative care and nonopioid medications (tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, topicals, and transdermal substances) are recommended as first-line therapy. Combination therapy (first-line medications) and tramadol and tapentadol are recommended as second-line options. Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, NMDA antagonists, and interventional therapies are third-line treatments. Neurostimulation is a fourth-line treatment. Low-dose opioids (no greater than 90 morphine equivalent units) are fifth-line options, and, finally, targeted drug delivery is the last-line therapy for patients with refractory pain.

- **Conclusions**: The presented treatment algorithm provides a structured pathway for managing neuropathic pain effectively.

### Adherence to back pain clinical practice guidelines by Brazilian physical therapists: A cross-sectional study [^114VMgy7]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

This was a cross-sectional observational study. The objectives were: (i) to investigate whether Brazilian physical therapists make clinical decisions for patients with low back pain based upon clinical practice guidelines and (ii) to determine whether the physical therapists are able to recognize differential diagnoses of low back pain associated with red or yellow flags.

Early adherence to clinical practice guidelines may accelerate recovery and reduce the costs associated with low back pain. It is unknown whether Brazilian physical therapists follow clinical practice guidelines to make their clinical decisions in the treatment of patients with low back pain.

The sample consisted of physical therapists from two Brazilian physical therapy associations. The data were collected via electronic survey and face-to-face interviews. The survey was composed of six hypothetical clinical cases of low back pain, which served as a basis to evaluate clinical decisions and adherence to clinical practice guidelines for low back pain. The study participants had 27 possible answers for each clinical case and could choose up to five answers. The results were analyzed in three ways: full adherence, partial adherence, or no adherence to the recommendations from clinical practice guidelines.

A total of 530 physical therapists were invited and 189 participated in the study (response rate = 35.6%). Full adherence to the guidelines was low for all six cases, with rates ranging from 5%-24%. Partial adherence to the guidelines was higher.

### Interventional therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain: An evidence-based clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society [^113wcf39]. Spine (2009). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for low back pain, particularly concerning psychological interventions, the APS 2009 guidelines recommend considering offering an intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation program with a cognitive-behavioral emphasis to patients with nonradicular LBP not responding to usual, noninterdisciplinary interventions.

### Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for chronic low back pain: Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qnjL9]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Referral of a patient with chronic low back pain for multidisciplinary rehabilitation, as opposed to usual care or a physical treatment, is likely to confer a benefit in terms of reduced pain and disability that endures beyond one year. Compared with physical treatments, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is also likely to confer a benefit in terms of the likelihood of being at work a year later.

These modest effects should be weighed against the monetary costs and time commitments associated with multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes. Although our subgroup analysis regarding the influence of symptom severity was inconclusive, it would seem reasonable to refer only those patients with major physical and psychological effects of low back pain to multidisciplinary rehabilitation, given the intervention costs.

Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is an umbrella term applied to programmes that adhere to the biopsychosocial conceptualisation of chronic pain and include more than just a physical treatment. Substantial variation may exist in the approach used by a particular clinic or programme, the intensity of each component, and the skill and experience of the clinicians delivering the programme. Our findings show that a coordinated intervention covering several domains of the biopsychosocial model and delivered by clinicians from different backgrounds is more likely to benefit patients with chronic low back pain in the long term than is usual care or physical treatment alone. We recognise that access to dedicated centres that offer quality multidisciplinary care may be limited.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^112YxJqA]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article presents an evidence-based algorithm to assist primary care providers with the diagnosis and management of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. It is part of a series that focuses on coexisting pain patterns and contributors to chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the aging population. The objective of the series is to encourage clinicians to take a holistic approach when evaluating and treating CLBP in older adults.

A content expert panel and a primary care panel collaboratively used the modified Delphi approach to iteratively develop an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm. The panelists included physiatrists, geriatricians, internists, and physical therapists who treat both civilians and veterans. The algorithm was developed so that all required resources are available within the Veterans Health Administration system. An illustrative patient case was chosen from one of the author's clinical practices to demonstrate the reasoning behind principles presented in the algorithm.

An algorithm was developed which logically outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. A case is presented which highlights the potential complexities of identifying the true pain generator and the importance of implementing proper treatment.

Lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults can contribute to and coexist with CLBP. Distinguishing the true cause(s) of pain from potentially a myriad of asymptomatic degenerative changes can be challenging.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: a systematic review [^1171tnuQ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are defined as "statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options". These guidelines are expected to facilitate more consistent, effective, and efficient medical practice, ultimately improving health outcomes. While many organizations worldwide have published CPGs on similar topics over the past several decades, their quality has varied significantly, raising concerns about the overall quality of these guidelines.

Neuropathic pain (NP), caused by a somatosensory lesion or various diseases, comprises a wide range of heterogeneous conditions. It affects millions of people worldwide, with an estimated prevalence in the general population as high as 7–8%. Generally, NP is chronic, severe, and resistant to over-the-counter analgesics, making its management particularly challenging. To improve the management of NP, various organizations, including the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS), the Canadian Pain Society Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NePSIG), the Assessment Committee of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and expert panels from the Middle East region (MER), Latin America (LA), and South Africa (SA), have developed CPGs for the management of NP.

In the present study, we systematically reviewed the available CPGs for NP, focusing on their methodological aspects.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^114ybyzQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for low back pain, the ACP/APS 2007 guidelines emphasize several general principles. It is recommended to assess the severity of baseline pain and functional deficits as well as potential benefits and risks. Consider the relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy. Offering medications with proven benefits should be considered, along with back care information and self-care measures.

### Psychological interventions for chronic, non-specific low back pain: Systematic review with network meta-analysis [^112nVT6h]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

To optimize the co-delivery of exercise and psychological therapies at the onset of treatment, interdisciplinary or intradisciplinary approaches to treatment delivery can be feasible alternatives. In health, interdisciplinary approaches describe the coordination of different health disciplines working together to optimize care delivery. In contrast, intradisciplinary approaches involve single health disciplines blending skills within their own scope of practice, with concepts, methods, or techniques borrowed from other disciplines.

The amount of evidence is growing, suggesting that, in line with psychologically-informed practice, exercise providers (mainly physiotherapists) have the capacity to successfully incorporate psychological strategies into treatment for patients with musculoskeletal pain conditions. In clinical psychology, the promotion of physical activity and movement are established as inherent components of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for chronic pain, such as graded activity or graded exposure. A recent systematic review with a network meta-analysis (NMA) of 217 randomized controlled trials has shown that patients with low back pain benefit from being encouraged to perform exercises that they enjoy. Consequently, psychologists are well situated to potentially incorporate structured exercise programs, guided by a patient's preference, into treatment.

Overall, we remind exercise providers that incorporating psychological strategies into treatment is crucial for maximizing physical function or reducing pain intensity and fear avoidance. We also remind psychologists that exercise is an important component.

### An introduction to an evidence-based approach to interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain [^1158WHSm]. Pain Physician (2009).

Practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioners and patients in making decisions about appropriate healthcare for specific clinical circumstances. Clinical practice guidelines present statements of best practice based on a thorough evaluation of the evidence from published studies on the outcomes of treatment. In November 1989, Congress mandated the creation of the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR). AHCPR was given broad responsibility for supporting research, data development, and related activities. Associated with this mandate, the National Academy of Sciences published a document indicating that guidelines are expected to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of healthcare services.

Guidelines as a whole have been characterized by multiple conflicts in terminology and technique. These conflicts are notable for the confusion they create and for what they reflect about differences in values, experiences, and interest among different parties. Despite this confusion, public and private development of guidelines is growing exponentially. There are only limited means to coordinate these guidelines to resolve inconsistencies, fill in gaps, track applications and results, and assess the soundness of individual guidelines. Significant diversity exists in clinical practice guidelines. The inconsistency among guidelines arises from variations in values, tolerance for risks, preferences, expertise, and conflicts of interest.

### Methods for evidence synthesis in interventional pain management [^112PHtQe]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Healthcare decisions are increasingly being made based on research-based evidence, rather than on expert opinion or clinical experience alone. Consequently, the process by which the strength of scientific evidence is evaluated and developed through evidence-based medicine recommendations and guidelines has become crucial. Over the past decade, there has been unprecedented interest in evidence-based medicine and clinical practice guidelines.

Systematic reviews, also known as evidence-based technology assessments, attempt to minimize bias by ensuring comprehensiveness and reproducibility in the search for and selection of articles for review. Evidence-based medicine is defined as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Thus, the practice of evidence-based medicine requires the integration of individual clinical expertise with the best available external evidence from systematic research.

To arrive at evidence-based medicine decisions, all valid and relevant evidence should be considered alongside randomized controlled trials, patient preferences, and resources. However, many systematic reviews in interventional pain management fail to follow evidence-based medicine principles. Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements that assist clinicians, consumers, and policymakers in making appropriate healthcare decisions. The complex processes of guideline development depend on the integration of various activities, from the collection and processing of scientific literature to evaluation.

### An updated overview of clinical guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain in primary care [^112tRWkk]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to present and compare the content of international clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain. To rationalize the management of low back pain, evidence-based clinical guidelines have been issued in many countries. Given that the available scientific evidence is the same, irrespective of the country, one would expect these guidelines to include more or less similar recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment.

We updated a previous review that included clinical guidelines published up to and including the year 2000. Guidelines were included that met the following criteria: the target group consisted mainly of primary health care professionals, and the guideline was published in English, German, Finnish, Spanish, Norwegian, or Dutch. Only one guideline per country was included — the one most recently published. This updated review includes national clinical guidelines from 13 countries and 2 international clinical guidelines from Europe published from 2000 until 2008.

The content of the guidelines appeared to be quite similar regarding diagnostic classification (diagnostic triage) and the use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Consistent features for acute low back pain were the early and gradual activation of patients, the discouragement of prescribed bed rest, and the recognition of psychosocial factors as risk factors for chronicity. For chronic low back pain, consistent features included supervised exercises, cognitive behavioural therapy, and multidisciplinary treatment.

### Validity of algorithms for identification of individuals suffering from chronic noncancer pain in administrative databases: A systematic review [^113sjTr7]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Key finding 3**: For many chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) conditions, very few different algorithms were tested for accuracy (≤ 4 algorithms for each of the following conditions: back disorders in general, complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain, neck/back problems studied together, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or painful neuropathic disorders in general).

- **Key finding 4**: Pharmacy claims data were not included in the commonly studied CNCP algorithms, except for headache and/or migraine. This was expected as, contrary to conditions such as arthritis where prescription claims are often used in case-finding algorithms, many pharmacological treatments used for CNCP are not specific to a particular type of syndrome (e.g. opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or not specific to pain management (e.g. antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cannabinoids). However, it would be important to test and publish about the contribution of adding pharmacy claims to the equation, no matter if the results are positive or not. Key findings 3 and 4 could be explained by selective reporting and publication of results. Our findings emphasize the need for more studies aiming to develop, test, refine, and publish case-finding algorithms.

- **Key finding 5**: The diversity of administrative databases in which case-finding algorithms were tested is limited. In fact, none of the specific combinations of codes, time windows, and number of health care encounters was tested in more than one database. As the validity of a given algorithm could vary from one data source to another because of database variability.

Data extraction

The modified EPOC data extraction form was tailored for data extraction. Data were independently extracted by two of five reviewers (S.Z. A.V.L. Q.C. M.L., and C.W.C.L.). When extracting data, all reports from the same study were linked. Discussions among reviewers were used to settle any discrepancies. The following information was extracted:

1. **Study information**: Study design (e.g. parallel), first author, year of publication, country of origin, and clinical setting.

2. **Participants' characteristics**: Population description, sample size, total number of participants randomized, age, and sex.

3. **Implementation strategy used in the intervention and comparator group**: Type (grouped by a taxonomy developed by the EPOC group or by consensus between reviewers if the EPOC taxonomy was not applicable. Definitions of each strategy described in Supplementary Table S1), format (e.g. written, electronic, or verbal), mode (e.g. internet-based, face-to-face, electronic-based, or paper-based), strategy provider and recipient, and duration.

4. **Outcome data**: In addition, data were extracted on how implementation strategies were developed based on feedback from a consumer advisory group. This was added to the protocol after registration.

Risk of bias assessment

Studies were assessed by two independent reviewers (S.Z. and Q.C.) using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Six domains (sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinded or objective assessment of main outcome(s), incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential sources of bias) were evaluated.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for facet joint interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines facet joint interventions 2020 guidelines [^115HmUgK]. Pain Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic axial spinal pain is one of the major causes of significant disability and health care costs, with facet joints as one of the proven causes of pain.

- **Objective**: To provide evidence-based guidance in performing diagnostic and therapeutic facet joint interventions.

- **Methods**: The methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards. The literature pertaining to all aspects of facet joint interventions was reviewed. A best evidence synthesis of available literature was conducted, utilizing grading for recommendations.

- **Summary of evidence and recommendations**:
	- **Non-interventional diagnosis**:
		- The level of evidence is II in selecting patients for facet joint nerve blocks at least 3 months after onset and failure of conservative management, with a strong strength of recommendation for physical examination and clinical assessment.
		- The level of evidence is IV for an accurate diagnosis of facet joint pain with physical examination based on symptoms and signs, with weak strength of recommendation.
	- **Imaging**:
		- The level of evidence is I with strong strength of recommendation for mandatory fluoroscopic or computed tomography (CT) guidance for all facet joint interventions.
		- The level of evidence is III with weak strength of recommendation for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
		- The level of evidence is V with weak strength of recommendation for scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT).

- **Interventional diagnosis: Lumbar spine**:
	- The level of evidence is I to II.

### Methods for pragmatic randomized clinical trials of pain therapies: IMMPACT statement [^115AsxLj]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

Although uncommon in real-world clinical pain management, authors have repeatedly called for some standardization (or protocolization) of study treatments in pragmatic trials, monitoring of fidelity, and detailed reporting of intervention content. Especially in trials of nonpharmacological interventions, provider expertise and style of practice require consideration. It is crucial to balance the need for a representative range of skillsets with acceptable levels of heterogeneity in treatment delivery. Furthermore, clinical practice may not always follow evidence-based guidance, necessitating provider training and thus introducing elements of standardization into a trial.

The extent to which treatment flexibility needs to be controlled depends on the research question and the specifics of the intervention; opportunities to train and oversee clinicians may also be limited in trials that take place in real-world settings. Notably, dosage safety and therapeutic ranges are important considerations in drug trials. In contrast, the potential to introduce undesired heterogeneity through practitioners and intervention complexity is more pertinent in nonpharmacological therapies.

However, any standardization of treatment delivery, such as through trial-specific training and protocolization, ought to be well justified. If training and standardization exceed what is observed in routine practice of a given intervention, this needs to be clearly identified, and implications for a trial's generalizability should be discussed.

### An algorithmic approach for clinical management of chronic spinal pain [^116VS9Pz]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Interventional pain management, and the interventional techniques which are an integral part of that specialty, are subject to widely varying definitions and practices. How interventional techniques are applied by various specialties is highly variable, even for the most common procedures and conditions. At the same time, many payors, publications, and guidelines are showing increasing interest in the performance and costs of interventional techniques. There is a lack of consensus among interventional pain management specialists with regards to how to diagnose and manage spinal pain and the type and frequency of spinal interventional techniques which should be utilized to treat spinal pain.

Therefore, an algorithmic approach is proposed, providing a step-by-step procedure for managing chronic spinal pain patients based upon evidence-based guidelines. The algorithmic approach is developed based on the best available evidence regarding the epidemiology of various identifiable sources of chronic spinal pain. Such an approach to spinal pain includes an appropriate history, examination, and medical decision-making in the management of low back pain, neck pain, and thoracic pain. This algorithm also provides diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to clinical management utilizing case examples of cervical, lumbar, and thoracic spinal pain. An algorithm for investigating chronic low back pain without disc herniation commences with a clinical question, examination, and imaging findings. If there is evidence of radiculitis, spinal stenosis, or other demonstrable causes, resulting in radi…

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management: Part 7: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy studies [^1153JYch]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Appropriate diagnosis is essential in providing proper and effective therapy. The field of diagnostic accuracy tests is dynamic, with new tests being developed at a fast pace, alongside continuous technological improvements of existing tests. Well-designed diagnostic test accuracy studies can assist in making appropriate health care decisions, provided they transparently and fully report their participants, tests, methods, and results. Exaggerated and biased outcomes from poorly designed and reported diagnostic test studies can lead to their premature dissemination, potentially causing physicians to make incorrect treatment decisions. Consequently, a diagnostic test is beneficial only to the extent that it differentiates between conditions or disorders that might otherwise be confused.

Since it is unlikely that clinicians, patients, and policy makers possess the time, skills, and resources necessary to find, appraise, and interpret the evidence and incorporate it into their health care decisions, systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide an accurate and reliable synthesis of vast quantities of data. A systematic review can identify what is known and what is unknown, offering guidance for future research. Systematic reviews are considered a vital link in the chain of evidence that stretches from the laboratory to the bedside, helping to segregate the insignificant, unsound, or redundant studies from those that are salient and critical. A dangerous discrepancy exists between experts and evidence across all types of evidence.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: Synopsis of the 2021 US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense clinical practice guideline [^1167F3gY]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

Low back pain is a significant issue in the US Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense populations, as well as the general US population. This type of pain can be distressing to those who experience its effects, leading patients to seek relief of their symptoms. In 2022, leadership within the US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense approved a joint clinical practice guideline for the management of low back pain. The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for assessing and managing low back pain.

Development of the guideline included a systematic evidence review, which was guided by 12 key questions. A multidisciplinary team, which included clinical stakeholders, reviewed the evidence that was retrieved and developed 39 recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. The scope of the clinical practice guideline is broad; however, the authors have focused on key recommendations that are important for clinicians in the evaluation and nonoperative treatment of low back pain, including pharmacologic therapies and both noninvasive and invasive nonpharmacologic treatments.

### A proposed treatment algorithm for low back pain secondary to Bertolotti's syndrome [^113ZMwR6]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Chronic low back pain is widely prevalent, and a range of conditions may result in low back pain. Typically, treatment begins with conservative management, such as medications, physical therapy, and home exercise regimens. If these measures fail, various interventional techniques can be employed to manage the pain. An uncommonly recognized cause of back pain is Bertolotti's syndrome, which results from lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV). LSTV is a congenital abnormality, characterized either by the lumbarization of the sacrum, where the first sacral bone fails to fuse with the rest of the sacrum, or the sacralization of the lumbar spine, where the L5 vertebra fuses with the sacrum, creating a longer sacrum. In many cases, the condition can be recognized by imaging techniques such as an X-ray, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Objectives**: To propose a treatment algorithm for patients with low back pain secondary to Bertolotti's syndrome.

- **Study design**: Case study and treatment algorithm proposal.

- **Methods**: A treatment algorithm for patients with low back pain secondary to Bertolotti's syndrome is proposed. It involves starting with a local anesthetic and steroid injection of the pseudo-articulation, followed by radiofrequency ablation of the pseudo-articulation and then complete endoscopic resection of the pseudo joint.

- **Results**: The proposed stepwise treatment guideline has the ability to diagnose Bertolotti's syndrome as the cause of low back pain and provide symptomatic relief.

### Interventional therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain: An evidence-based clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society [^1144ayFA]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

The study design is a clinical practice guideline aimed at developing evidence-based recommendations on the use of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies, surgeries, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain of any duration, with or without leg pain.

The summary of background data highlights the clinical challenge in managing patients with persistent and disabling low back pain. Although numerous interventional diagnostic tests, therapies, and surgeries are increasingly utilized, their utility remains uncertain or controversial. Interdisciplinary rehabilitation is also proposed as a potentially effective noninvasive intervention for persistent and disabling low back pain.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel convened by the American Pain Society based its recommendations on a systematic review focusing on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Recommendations were graded using methods adapted from the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group.

- **Results**: Investigators reviewed 3348 abstracts, and a total of 161 randomized trials were deemed relevant to the recommendations. The panel developed a total of 8 recommendations.

- **Conclusion**: Recommendations on the use of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation are presented. Due to significant trade-offs between potential benefits, harms, costs, and burdens of alternative therapies, shared decision-making is an important component.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: A systematic review [^1135XnrU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Study selection**: The database search identified 1,759 documents. After three reviewers read the titles, abstracts, and full texts according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 articles were eventually selected for inclusion. **Characteristic of the CPGs**: Sixteen CPGs were published between 2004 and 2014. Among the 16 included CPGs, 12 CPGs were original, and five were updated versions. With the exception of the CPGs published by Latin American, South American, and Middle East regions, all the included CPGs were developed using an evidence-based approach. The 16 CPGs selected focused on the assessment and pharmacological and interventional treatments. CPGs were financed independently by professional organizations, governments, and academic societies, except for one CPG developed in Latin America that did not disclose a funding source. Of the sixteen selected CPGs, ten CPGs were developed by medical societies, four by governmental agencies, and two by professional organizations.

- **CPGs appraisal results using the AGREE-II instrument**: Three reviewers evaluated the 16 included CPGs using the AGREE II instrument.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management, part I: introduction and general considerations [^116wktY4]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines play a crucial role in modern interventional pain management. Similar to other specialties in the United States, evidence-based medicine drives the pursuit of answers to many questions related to the costs and quality of healthcare, as well as access to care. Scientific and relevant evidence is essential in clinical care, policymaking, dispute resolution, and law. Consequently, evidence-based practice compiles pertinent, trustworthy information by systematically acquiring, analyzing, and transferring research findings into clinical, management, and policy settings.

In the United States, researchers, clinicians, professional organizations, and government entities are seeking a pragmatic approach to healthcare with practical evidence-based medicine. All forms of evidence-based practice, whether through evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, or guidelines, evolve through methodical, rational accumulation, analysis, and comprehension of evidentiary knowledge applicable in clinical settings.

Historically, evidence-based medicine dates back to the 1700s, although it wasn't explicitly defined and advanced until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Initially referred to as "critical appraisal", it described the application of basic rules of evidence as they developed for daily practices. Evidence-based medicine is defined as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^1156mxux]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to merge treatment guidelines and best practice recommendations for management of neuropathic pain into a comprehensive algorithm for primary physicians. The algorithm covers assessment, multidisciplinary conservative care, non-opioid pharmacological management, interventional therapies, neurostimulation, low-dose opioid treatment, and targeted drug delivery therapy.

Available literature was identified through a search of the US National Library of Medicine's Medline database, PubMed.gov. References from identified published articles were also reviewed for relevant citations.

The algorithm provides a comprehensive treatment pathway from assessment to the provision of first- through sixth-line therapies for primary care physicians. Clear indicators for the progression of therapy from first-line to sixth-line are provided. Multidisciplinary conservative care and non-opioid medications (tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, topicals, and transdermal substances) are recommended as first-line therapy. Combination therapy (first-line medications) with tramadol and tapentadol is recommended as second-line; serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, NMDA antagonists, and interventional therapies as third-line; neurostimulation as a fourth-line treatment; low-dose opioids (no greater than 90 morphine equivalent units) are fifth-line; and finally, targeted drug delivery is the last-line therapy for patients with refractory pain.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^1144jTXr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of low back pain, more specifically with respect to general principles, the ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend considering the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits in patients not responding to self-care options. For acute low back pain (LBP), spinal manipulation is suggested. For chronic or subacute LBP, options include intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation.

### A critical review of the American Pain Society clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques: Part 2. Therapeutic interventions [^113hqQYf]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines serve as a constructive response to the reality that practicing physicians need assistance in assimilating and applying the rapidly expanding, often contradictory body of medical knowledge. They aim to define practices meeting the needs of most patients under typical circumstances. Ideally, specific clinical recommendations within practice guidelines are systematically developed by expert panels who have access to all available evidence, understand the clinical problem, have clinical experience with the procedure being assessed, and possess knowledge of relevant research methods.

The recent development of the American Pain Society (APS) guidelines has sparked significant controversy due to their perceived lack of objective analysis and recommendations considered biased because of conflicts of interest.

- **Objectives**: To formally and carefully assess the APS guidelines' evidence synthesis for low back pain therapeutic interventions using the same methodology as the APS authors. The interventions examined were therapeutic interventions for managing low back pain, including epidural injections, adhesiolysis, facet joint interventions, and spinal cord stimulation.

- **Methods**: A literature search by two authors was conducted utilizing appropriate databases from 1966 through July 2008. Articles where conflicts arose were reviewed and mediated by a third author to reach a consensus. Selection of manuscripts and methodological quality assessment were also performed by at least two authors using established criteria.

### Low back pain: Guidelines for the clinical classification of predominant neuropathic, nociceptive, or central sensitization pain [^1172mCQ5]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is a heterogeneous disorder, including patients with dominant nociceptive (e.g. myofascial low back pain), neuropathic (e.g. lumbar radiculopathy), and central sensitization pain. To select an effective and preferably efficient treatment in daily clinical practice, LBP patients should be clinically classified as predominantly nociceptive, neuropathic, or central sensitization pain.

- **Objective**: To explain how clinicians can differentiate between nociceptive, neuropathic, and central sensitization pain in patients with LBP.

- **Study design**: Narrative review and expert opinion.

- **Setting**: Universities, university hospitals, and private practices.

- **Methods**: Recently, a clinical method for the classification of central sensitization pain versus neuropathic and nociceptive pain was developed, based on a body of evidence from original research papers and expert opinions of 18 pain experts from 7 different countries. This classification algorithm is applied to the LBP population.

- **Results**: The first step involves examining the presence of neuropathic low back pain. Next, the differential diagnosis between predominant nociceptive and central sensitization pain is conducted using a clinical algorithm.

- **Limitations**: The classification criteria are substantiated by several original research findings, including a Delphi survey, a study of a large group of LBP patients, and validation studies of the Central Sensitization Inventory. Nevertheless, these criteria require validation in clinical settings.

### The effect of an integrated multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for patients with chronic low back pain: Long-term follow-up of a randomised controlled trial [^112GNcvV]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). High credibility.

Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is recommended as a second-line treatment in the management of chronic low back pain. It is based on the widely accepted biopsychosocial approach and comprises a multifaceted intervention targeting the wide range of modifiable factors known to contribute to chronic low back pain. The team providing rehabilitation can reinforce the integration of knowledge, skills, and behaviors by considering the patient's environment and ensuring regular interaction with the patient via scheduled booster sessions. Thus, combining the biopsychosocial approach with the chronic care model seems reasonable from a theoretical point of view. However, the optimal dose, content, and delivery of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes remain unknown.

Therefore, as described in a previous paper, we designed an integrated multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme comprising inpatient stays alternating with home-based activities and booster sessions. The intention was to support the integration of knowledge, skills, and behaviors gained from a multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation programme into the daily lives of patients with chronic low back pain. In another previous paper, we reported results from the six-month follow-up of a randomised controlled trial comparing an integrated rehabilitation programme with an existing rehabilitation programme.

Long-term (one year) follow-up data on the effect of such a rehabilitation programme are needed, given that time is thought to be related to the successful integration of knowledge, skills, and behaviors.

### EAU guidelines on pain management [^1169uEmF]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom of any illness. The physician's therapeutic task is twofold: to discover and treat the cause of pain and the pain itself. Whether or not the underlying cause is treatable, the goal is to provide relief and reduce the suffering caused by pain. Although we use the term "pain" to define all sensations that hurt or are unpleasant, two quite different kinds of pain actually exist.

- **Types of pain**: The first type is nociceptive pain, which is associated with tissue damage or inflammation. The second type is neuropathic pain, which results from a lesion to the peripheral or central nervous systems. Additionally, pain can be divided into acute and chronic categories. Caregivers must address pain in two main settings: post-surgery and in cancer patients. These tasks require a multidisciplinary team capable of properly assessing and treating pain.

- **Postoperative pain**: Postoperative pain should be treated early and aggressively. Several drug options are available and should be tailored to the surgical procedure and the patient.

- **Pain in cancer patients**: Pain in cancer patients can be caused by the cancer itself, muscular spasms, or cancer treatments. Management primarily involves pharmacotherapy, but primary treatments such as surgery, radiochemotherapy, or even antibiotics can provide adequate relief. Analgesics should be employed according to an ascending scale. If a satisfactory balance between relief and side effects is not achieved, other options can be combined to improve outcomes. These include invasive techniques, physical, and psychological therapy.

The mainstay of pain management entails interdisciplinary cooperation.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^112PNSQF]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). High credibility.

- **Question 11**: How many prognostic blocks should one perform before radiofrequency ablation?

- **Basis for multiple blocks and false-positive rate**: The number of blocks that should be performed before lumbar medial branch RFA is a subject of great controversy. In the only guidelines espoused by pain organizations, the SIS and the ASIPP both advocate two blocks before RFA, with the latter concluding that the evidence for diagnostic accuracy is poor (< 75% relief) to limited (≥ 75% relief) when single blocks are used. The rationale for performing either placebo-controlled blocks or 'blinded' comparative LA blocks, in which two LAs with different durations of action are used for blocks on two separate occasions, and longer relief from the longer-acting agent is necessary for diagnosis, is that it reduces the placebo effect. However, the placebo effect is only one of several causes of false-positive blocks, which include leakage of the injectate into adjacent pain-generating structures such as muscles and the epidural space; excessive use of superficial anesthesia; the use of sedation; and not participating in one's normal activities after the injection.

### Aaapt: Assessment of the acute pain trajectory [^111e6jE8]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pain trajectory patterns in the subacute phase (i.e. beyond 7 days but less than 3 months) further impact clinical decision-making. Assessment of subacute pain trajectories can identify patients with ongoing treatment needs, optimize resource allocation, and detect early patterns of recovery that may indicate the emergence of pain persistence. Monitoring the pain trajectory into the subacute period to distinguish rapid or expected patterns of pain resolution from slower resolution (i.e. slower improvement or worsening pain) can identify patients who may benefit from intensive rehabilitative treatment. This can guide clinicians in treatment stratification — for example, matching more intensive physical and psychological therapies to these patients who demonstrate slower recovery.
