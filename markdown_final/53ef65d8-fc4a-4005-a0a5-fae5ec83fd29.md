## Question

How long does a patient need to take spironolactone for female patterned hair loss before considering treatment failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a patient should take spironolactone for female pattern hair loss before considering treatment failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence on spironolactone specifically for female pattern hair loss. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about assessing response to hair-loss therapies and whether they extrapolate to spironolactone. Next, I will consider indirect evidence from related antiandrogenic uses and the pharmacologic time course of hair cycling. After that, I need to check safety and monitoring considerations that might influence duration and dose titration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with explicit checkpoints and contingencies for escalation or discontinuation.

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence base for spironolactone in female pattern hair loss. The most relevant study is a before-after intervention in 80 women with biopsy-confirmed FPHL who received oral antiandrogens, including spironolactone 200 mg/day, for a minimum of 12 months; standardized photography showed that 44% had regrowth, 44% stabilized, and 12% continued to lose hair, with no clear predictors of response except higher midscalp clinical grade, suggesting that a 12-month horizon is reasonable to capture both stabilization and regrowth in a meaningful proportion of patients [^115828CE].

> Wait, let me verify whether guidelines provide explicit timelines for spironolactone in FPHL. The European S3 guideline for androgenetic alopecia recommends assessing response to medical therapy at 6 months and notes that in some patients response may not be evident until 12 months; while this is framed around topical minoxidil, the biology of hair cycling supports applying the same 6–12 month assessment window to other medical therapies, including antiandrogens, given the time needed for follicular remodeling and visible clinical change [^116QDaaq] [^11414oCi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider indirect evidence from related antiandrogenic indications. In PCOS and hirsutism, international guidelines recommend trialing antiandrogens, including spironolactone, after a minimum of 6 months of combined oral contraceptives or cosmetic therapy, reflecting that antiandrogenic effects on hair follicles often require at least 6 months to manifest clinically; this aligns with the biological plausibility that hair growth responses lag behind biochemical changes [^113gn2Gq] [^114CeHFo].

> I need to check the pharmacologic rationale and hair-cycle kinetics. Hair follicles have prolonged anagen–telogen dynamics, and meaningful changes in density or caliber typically emerge after multiple cycles; antiandrogens modify androgen receptor signaling and may reduce follicular miniaturization, but visible clinical benefit commonly accrues between 6 and 12 months, which supports using 6 months as the earliest formal assessment and extending to 12 months before declaring nonresponse [^115AYpGZ] [^116rT5Jn].

> Let me consider dosing and tolerability, because dose titration can influence both efficacy and adherence. Typical spironolactone dosing for dermatologic antiandrogenic effects ranges from 50–200 mg/day, often starting at 50–100 mg/day and increasing based on response and side effects; menstrual irregularities are dose-related and can be mitigated by concomitant combined oral contraceptives, which also address teratogenic risk counseling for patients who can become pregnant [^1131dUQg] [^112J9tFp] [^113gn2Gq].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring so I don't overstate the need for labs. In healthy premenopausal women without renal disease or interacting medications, routine potassium monitoring is generally unnecessary; baseline renal function and potassium are reasonable, with repeat testing guided by risk factors, age, comedications, or dose escalation, and patients should be counseled on symptoms of hyperkalemia and potassium-sparing drug interactions [^112BbFne] [^112dNsem].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on minoxidil or other therapies; does that change the timeline? Combination therapy is common in practice, and the same 6–12 month assessment principle applies; stabilization of loss is itself a clinically meaningful endpoint, and if there is no stabilization by 6 months and no improvement by 12 months at an adequate dose, that constitutes a reasonable point to declare treatment failure and pivot to alternatives such as finasteride in select cases, topical antiandrogens, or procedural options, while ensuring contraception and safety throughout [^116QDaaq] [^113jh7kq] [^113gn2Gq].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical recommendation. A minimum 12-month trial of spironolactone at 50–200 mg/day, with dose optimization and attention to tolerability, is appropriate before declaring treatment failure in female pattern hair loss; assess formally at 6 months for early signals of stabilization or regrowth, and extend to 12 months to capture the full response, recognizing that about 44% stabilize and 44% improve in observational cohorts and that higher baseline severity may predict better response [^115828CE] [^116QDaaq] [^1131dUQg].

> Final answer: Trial spironolactone for at least 12 months at a therapeutic dose before labeling treatment failure, with a structured 6-month checkpoint to assess stabilization or early improvement; if there is no stabilization by 6 months and no improvement by 12 months despite adequate dosing and adherence, discontinue and consider alternative therapies, ensuring ongoing contraception and safety monitoring as indicated [^115828CE] [^116QDaaq] [^11414oCi] [^113gn2Gq].

---

A patient should be on spironolactone for **at least 6–12 months** before declaring treatment failure for female pattern hair loss, as stabilization or regrowth can take this long [^115828CE]. Assess response at 6 months; if there is no stabilization or improvement by 12 months, discontinue and consider alternatives [^notfound]. Continue effective contraception throughout therapy due to teratogenic risk [^113gn2Gq].

---

## Recommended duration of spironolactone therapy

- **Minimum duration**: 6 months to assess stabilization or improvement [^11414oCi].
- **Optimal duration**: 12 months to confirm efficacy or failure [^115828CE].
- **Rationale**: Hair cycles are slow; visible change requires ≥ 6 months [^116rT5Jn].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting duration

Evidence includes a study of 80 women with FPHL treated with spironolactone or cyproterone acetate for ≥ 12 months, showing **88% had stabilization or improvement**, with only 12% continuing to lose hair [^115828CE]. Guidelines recommend assessing response at 6 months and continuing if effective; if there is no response by 12 months, consider failure and alternative therapy [^116QDaaq].

---

## Factors influencing response time

Several factors influence response time, including **age and hormonal status** — younger patients and those with hyperandrogenism may respond faster — and **severity and duration of hair loss**, as longer-standing or more severe loss may require longer treatment. Concurrent therapies such as minoxidil or oral contraceptives may enhance or delay response, and adherence to therapy and dose titration also affect outcomes.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines recommend assessing response at **6 months** and continuing if effective; if there is no response by 12 months, consider failure and alternative therapy [^116QDaaq]. Expert consensus supports a **6–12 month trial** before declaring failure.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should occur **every 3–6 months** to assess efficacy and tolerability. Assess stabilization or improvement at 6 months and confirm failure or success at 12 months. Throughout therapy, monitor for menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal impairment or those on ACE inhibitors.

---

## When to discontinue spironolactone

Discontinue spironolactone if there is **no stabilization or improvement by 12 months** [^notfound]. Also discontinue for intolerable side effects (e.g. significant menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, hyperkalemia) or if the patient becomes pregnant or plans pregnancy due to teratogenic risk [^113gn2Gq].

---

## Alternative treatments after spironolactone failure

- **Topical minoxidil**: First-line alternative; apply 2–5% solution or foam [^115RdfET].
- **Oral finasteride or dutasteride**: Consider in postmenopausal women or with effective contraception [^115XtR5N].
- **Low-level laser therapy**: Nonpharmacologic option with some evidence [^1122SLRZ].
- **Hair transplantation**: For advanced, refractory cases [^115AYpGZ].

## Spironolactone therapy timeline for FPHL

| **Timeframe** | **Clinical action** |
|-|-|
| 0–3 months | - Initiate therapy <br/> - Monitor tolerability |
| 3–6 months | - Assess early response <br/> - Adjust dose if needed |
| 6 months | Formal assessment; continue if stabilization or improvement |
| 6–12 months | - Continue monitoring <br/> - Titrate dose as needed |
| 12 months | - Declare failure if no response <br/> - Consider alternatives |

---

Patients should receive spironolactone for **6–12 months** before declaring failure, with a 6-month checkpoint and a 12-month decision point. This approach balances the slow hair cycle with evidence that most responders show stabilization or improvement within this window [^115828CE].

### Spironolactone in dermatology: uses in acne and beyond [^117Cea4c]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone is a synthetic aldosterone receptor antagonist, with a role off-label in various dermatological conditions. Its antiandrogenic properties make it suitable for diseases in which excess androgen production results in unwanted and psychologically distressing manifestations in susceptible females. Treatment with spironolactone aims to attenuate androgen-mediated conditions including acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, female pattern hair loss and hirsutism. We discuss the emerging utility of spironolactone in dermatology, its potential adverse effects and considerations for monitoring.

### Innovative use of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in the treatment of female pattern hair loss [^1141APvf]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Patterned hair loss in men and women, although medically benign, is a common, albeit unwelcome, event that may cause considerable anxiety and concern. Patterned hair loss is progressive and when untreated leads to baldness. The prevalence and severity of this physiologic process both increase with advancing age. Although androgens play a key role in the pathogenesis of male pattern hair loss (MPHL), the role of androgens in female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is less well established. Satisfactory treatment response to antiandrogen therapy supports the involvement of androgens in the pathogenesis of FPHL. Spironolactone has been used for 30 years as a potassium-sparing diuretic. Spironolactone is a synthetic steroid structurally related to aldosterone. Since the serendipitous discovery 20 years ago that spironolactone given to a woman for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and associated hypertension also improved hirsutism, it has been used as a primary medical treatment for hirsutism. Spironolactone both reduces adrenal androgen production and exerts competitive blockade on androgen receptors in target tissues. Spironolactone has been used off-label in FPHL for over 20 years. It has been shown to arrest hair loss progression with a long-term safety profile. A significant percentage of women also achieve partial hair regrowth. Spironolactone is not used in male androgenetic alopecia because of the risk of feminization.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113gn2Gq]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) anti-androgens — clinical use, contraception, and safety considerations are as follows: In combination with effective contraception, anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in women with PCOS if there is a suboptimal response after a minimum of six months of COCP and/or cosmetic therapy; given the negative psychological impact of female pattern hair loss, anti-androgens in combination with COCP could be trialed, acknowledging the lack of evidence in the PCOS population; whenever pregnancy is possible, healthcare professionals must educate and counsel women and adolescents, parents/or guardian/s, regarding the risks of incomplete development of external genital structures of male fetuses when anti-androgens are used and, to prevent this, women who can get pregnant should be strongly counselled to use effective contraception (e.g., intrauterine device or COCPs); anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in the presence of another effective form of contraception for women with contraindications for COCP therapy or when COCPs are poorly tolerated; when prescribing anti-androgens, healthcare professionals should consider that spironolactone at 25–100mg / day appears to have lower risks of adverse effects, cyproterone acetate at doses ≥ 10mg is not advised due to an increased risk including for meningioma, finasteride has an increased risk of liver toxicity, flutamide and bicalutamide have an increased risk of severe liver toxicity, and the relatively limited evidence on anti-androgens in PCOS needs to be appreciated with small numbers of studies and limited numbers of participants.

### Spironolactone in dermatology [^111nzxoU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone is a drug, similar in structure to aldosterone and acts as an aldosterone receptor antagonist with an anti-androgenic effect. This drug has proven to be useful in several dermatological entities, however its use has not been well explored. Its use in diseases such as acne has opened the door to the possibility of new therapies depending on the clinical manifestations of the patients, as well as its possible to use it as a first line treatment. Other diseases associated with the use of spironolactone where its effects have been shown to be useful are hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutism, and female pattern androgenetic alopecia. In this review, we discuss the use of spironolactone in different skin diseases that are common in our environment, dosage according to different studies, treatment recommendations and adverse effects; all of the above mentioned in order to use this drug in a daily clinical practice.

Regarding medical management for androgenetic alopecia, more specifically with respect to hormonal therapy (female-pattern hair loss), EDF 2018 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of oral anti-androgens (chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, drospirenone, spironolactone, flutamide) to improve or to prevent the progression of androgenetic alopecia in normoandrogenic female patients.

Background

It has not been conclusively established that female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is either due to androgens or responsive to oral antiandrogen therapy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of oral antiandrogen therapy in the management of women with FPHL using standardized photographic techniques (Canfield Scientific), and to identify clinical and histological parameters predictive of clinical response.

Methods

For this single-centre, before-after, open intervention study, 80 women aged between 12 and 79 years, with FPHL and biopsy-confirmed hair follicle miniaturization [terminal/vellus (T/V) hair ratio ≤ 4: 1] were photographed at baseline and again after receiving a minimum of 12 months of oral antiandrogen therapy. Forty women received spironolactone 200 mg daily and 40 women received cyproterone acetate, either 50 mg daily or 100 mg for 10 days per month if premenopausal. Women using topical minoxidil were excluded. Standardized photographs of the midfrontal and vertex scalp were taken with the head positioned in a stereotactic device. Images were evaluated by a panel of three clinicians experienced in the assessment of FPHL, blinded to patient details and treatment and using a three-point scale.

Results

As there was no significant difference in the results or the trend between spironolactone and cyproterone acetate the results were combined. Thirty-five (44%) women had hair regrowth, 35 (44%) had no clear change in hair density before and after treatment, and 10 (12%) experienced continuing hair loss during the treatment period. Ordinal logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of response revealed no influence of patient age, menopause status, serum ferritin, serum hormone levels, clinical stage (Ludwig) or histological parameters such as T/V ratio or fibrosis. The only significant predictor was midscalp clinical grade, with higher-scale values associated with a greater response (P = 0.013).

Conclusion

Eighty-eight percent of women receiving oral antiandrogens could expect to see no progression of their FPHL or improvement. High midscalp clinical grade was the only predictor of response identified. A placebo-controlled study is required to compare this outcome to the natural history of FPHL.

### Androgens in women: hormone-modulating therapies for skin disease [^1125jH57]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Androgen-mediated cutaneous disorders (AMCDs) in women, including acne, hirsutism, and female pattern hair loss, can be treated with hormone-modulating therapies. In the second article in this Continuing Medical Education series, we discuss the hormone-modulating therapies available to dermatologists for the treatment of AMCDs, including combined oral contraceptives, spironolactone, finasteride, dutasteride, and flutamide. Available hormone-modulating treatments used for each AMCDs are reviewed, along with mechanisms of androgen modulation, safety profile, contraindications, monitoring parameters, and evidence of efficacy. Medications discussed include those that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for certain AMCDs and some that are used off-label. Despite the ubiquity of hormone-modulating therapies used for AMCDs, this review highlights the need for more rigorous studies to evaluate these therapies for acne, hirsutism, and female pattern hair loss.

### Chronic telogen effluvium: a study of 5 patients over 7 years [^113tjq75]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic telogen effluvium is said to be self-limiting in the long run; the natural history of this condition, however, has not been investigated prospectively. Four women, aged between 18 and 64 years and diagnosed with chronic telogen effluvium between 1996 and 1997, were followed up prospectively for a minimum of 7 years. One (previously reported) woman diagnosed in 1998 developed female pattern hair loss confirmed on biopsy specimen within 18 months that was partially reversed by spironolactone. The remaining 4 women continued to experience chronic diffuse telogen hair shedding that fluctuated in severity. However, serial photography demonstrated no visible reduction in hair density, and serial scalp biopsy specimen showed no follicular miniaturization. Although 4 out of 5 of our patients showed no tendency toward development of female pattern hair loss or to spontaneous improvement, further work is required to define the natural history of chronic telogen effluvium and the relative risk of developing female pattern hair loss.

Limitations in the review process should also be noted. Due to being poorly reported or presented in a format which was not amenable to meta-analysis, some data were excluded, leading to missing or incomplete information for some comparisons. Although exclusion of these data was necessary to ensure consistency and rigor in the review process, this meant that sample sizes were small for many comparisons and it is possible that their inclusion may have impacted on our results, urging caution in the interpretation of these findings. We addressed this limitation to some extent via sensitivity analysis by RoB; however, this was not possible for all comparisons or outcomes due to the small number of included studies. Moreover, studies in languages other than English were excluded due to resource and time constraints, and some full texts were not found; hence, potentially relevant results may have been excluded from the review. Lastly, publication bias cannot be ruled out given that this could not be adequately judged by inspection of funnel plots (since less than 10 studies were assessed in each analysis) and grey literature (unpublished work) was not sourced or included in the review.

In summary, anti-androgens may have possible benefits on clinical hyperandrogenism (i.e. hirsutism) in combination with effective contraception but, per guideline recommendations, should be used in circumstances where COCP (and/or cosmetic options including mechanical laser and light therapies for hair reduction) are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or have been ineffective for a minimum period of 6 months. This general recommendation is based on the best available evidence, which remains limited due to high heterogeneity; hence, application should incorporate clinical judgement, contextual factors and individual characteristics and preferences. While the optimal types and doses of anti-androgens in PCOS cannot be determined from the available evidence, general population data suggests that 25–100 mg daily of spironolactone appears to be safe. Based on the available evidence, COCPs remain the recommended first-line therapy for clinical hyperandrogenism in PCOS, until further high-quality, adequately powered studies can demonstrate further benefits for anti-androgens in the context of PCOS.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^112faurD]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone for adult women

The results of the spironolactone for adult female acne trial, published in The BMJ in 2023, showed that oral spironolactone alongside topical treatment is effective for improving outcomes for women with persistent acne, with greater effects seen at 6 months than 3 months. Spironolactone was well-tolerated starting at a dose of 50 mg increasing to 100 mg per day, although higher doses can be associated with adverse effects, particularly menstrual irregularity. Previous small trials suggest that the effectiveness of spironolactone may be similar to oral tetracycline for acne, but comparable data are limited. Ongoing trials of spironolactone compared with oral tetracycline for acne mean that more information should be available in the next few years.

Baseline check of renal function and potassium levels is advised prior to starting spironolactone for acne. However, large observational studies show that abnormal renal function or potassium levels are very unusual in this population. Ongoing monitoring is unnecessary for most young women and has recently been advocated just for women aged over 45 years. Spironolactone is less teratogenic than oral tetracyclines commonly used for acne, so it would be appropriate for spironolactone to be treated with no special restriction beyond contraceptive counselling, as is the case for oral tetracyclines.

Spironolactone is not currently licensed for the treatment of acne. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises that clinicians can use a licensed medicine outside the terms of its licence (off-label prescribing) if they are satisfied that this is in the best interest of the patient, an alternative, licensed medicine would not meet the patient's needs and there is sufficient safety and efficacy evidence. In addition, the prescriber should take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient's care, including monitoring and follow-up.

Spironolactone versus Ketoconazole and Tetracycline

Spironolactone (60 mg/day) was compared with (1) 200 mg/day ketoconazole and (2) oral tetracycline at an initial de-escalating dose of 1 g/day. All three treatments were similarly effective using the proportion of women with at least 50% improvement in lesion count as the outcome measure (Table 4). However, as the numbers of participants in each treatment arm were not equal, the study may not have been sufficiently powered to detect a difference between spironolactone (n = 63) and tetracycline (n = 14). For details and quality of evidence, see Electronic Supplementary Tables 10 and 11.

Supplementary Efficacy Data from Case Series and Comparison with RCTs

Of the 18 case series, 13 were in English, two in Spanish, and one each in French, Czech and Turkish. As well as these, three additional articles included some data on side effects in women with acne; they did not address clinical effectiveness. One definite case series (in Portuguese) and two possible case series (in Czech) including acne patients treated with spironolactone were unobtainable and had either no abstract or an uninformative abstract. Two further unobtainable articles, one in Spanish and one in Turkish, had abstracts containing sufficient information to identify them as duplicate publications of two included case series.

Acne severity ranged from mild to severe and was not reported in nine of the case series. The location of lesions was reported in only three case series. Seven studies did not make a clear statement about concomitant medications, making attribution of any clinical effect to spironolactone uncertain. Further details are reported in Table 3. Insufficient data were provided to conduct any subgroup analyses on the effect of dose or duration of spironolactone therapy on efficacy or side effects. Within the case series, between 216 and 259 of 728 women (29.7–35.6%) were receiving daily doses of ≥ 150 mg, compared with only 35/343 women (10.2%) in the RCTs.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and / or acne [^114TJzv8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. The most common cause is by increased production of male sex hormones (androgens). It is also affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles, and secretory glands around hair follicles (sebaceous glands). Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat hirsutism.

Objectives

The objective was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone and/or in combination with steroids (oral contraceptive pill included) in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) trials register was searched (April 2008). The Cochrane MDSG register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and CENTRAL, handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. In addition, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched and drug companies contacted for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus: placebo, steroids (oral contraceptive pill included), spironolactone of varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Nine trials were included in the review, eight trials were excluded. Two other trials are awaiting assessment. Only one trial studied acne as an outcome, the remainder were concerned with hirsutism. Major outcome measures include the following: subjective observations, Ferriman and Gallwey hair scores, hormonal and biochemical parameters, side effects, sebum production measurement.

Main Results

In the two trials that compared 100 mg of spironolactone with placebo significant differences were reported for subjective improvements in hair growth (OR 7.18, 95% CI 1.96 to 26.28), although not the Ferriman-Galwey score (WMD 7.20, 95% CI -10.98 to -3.42)). Data could not be otherwise pooled as only one trial reported an outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

From the studies included in this review, there is some evidence to show that spironolactone is an effective treatment to decrease the degree of hirsutism but there was no evidence for effectiveness for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Studies in this area are scarce and small. Individual study data indicates some superiority of spironolactone over other drugs but results cannot be generalised.

### Long-term use of spironolactone for acne in women: a case series of 403 patients [^113YwTcV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data regarding the long-term outcomes of spironolactone use for women with acne and its effect on truncal acne.

Objective

To comprehensively describe outcomes of patients treated with spironolactone in routine clinical practice, including long-term outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective case series of 403 adult women treated for acne with spironolactone at an academic medical center between 2008 and 2019. Rates of objective, as assessed by Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale scores, and subjective acne clearance were evaluated, as well as rates of treatment discontinuation, dosage changes, and drug survival. Logistic regression was used to assess for association between incidence of menstrual adverse effects and combined oral contraceptive use.

Results

As evaluated by Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale scores, at the first follow-up, 75.5%, 84.0%, and 80.2% of patients with available data had reduction or complete clearance of acne on the face, chest, and back, respectively. The mean drug survival was 470.7 days. Menstrual adverse effects were less common among those using combined oral contraception (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.50).

Limitations

This study was conducted at a single academic medical center.

Conclusions

Spironolactone improves clinical outcomes and is well tolerated for many adult women with acne using it for an extended duration.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in england and wales: pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^111fnaQQ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SAFA was published by Miriam Santer and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: Acne vulgaris. In the SAFA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in female patients with acne vulgaris? In the SAFA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SAFA study, the population was: 410 female patients. The inclusion criteria were adult female patients with facial acne for at least 6 months, judged to warrant oral antibiotics. The key exclusion criteria were Investigator's Global Assessment acne score of 0–1; previous use of spironolactone; use of oral isotretinoin in the past 6 months; use of oral antibiotics for > 1 week for acne within the previous month. In the SAFA study, the interventions were: n = 201 spironolactone (50 mg/day until week 6, increasing to 100 mg/day until week 24) n = 209 placebo (matching placebo). In the SAFA study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in improvement in Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 12 (19.2 points vs. 17.8 points; AD 1.27 points, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.46). In the SAFA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in improvement in Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 24 (21.2 points vs. 17.4 points; AD 3.45 points, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.75) Significant increase in self-assessed overall improvement score of 3–6 at week 24 (82% vs. 63%; OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.93) Significant increase in Investigator's Global Assessment for treatment success at week 12 (19% vs. 6%; OR 5.18, 95% CI 2.18 to 12.28). In the SAFA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue. significant differences in at least one adverse reaction (64% vs. 51%), headache (20% vs. 12%). In the SAFA study, the conclusion was: in adult female patients with facial acne for at least 6 months, judged to warrant oral antibiotics, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to improvement in Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 12.

a Inhibition of steroidogenesis in the adrenals, ovaries and/or peripheral tissues, including skin, reduces serum levels of androgens and androgen precursors

Four of the RCTs evaluated spironolactone in combination with a COC. Hirsutism or PCOS was the primary diagnosis and acne was the secondary diagnosis. Since COCs are potent anti-androgens, and are effective as monotherapy for acne, superiority of the combination needs to be demonstrated over the COC alone. Despite this, only one trial included a COC monotherapy arm and found no benefit of adding spironolactone to norgestimate/EE, although, at trend, the combination was more effective. In this three-arm trial, treatment allocation was unbalanced, with three times as many women in the combination arm as those receiving COC monotherapy. Any added benefit of spironolactone might have been revealed had treatment arms been of equal size.

One potentially more useful trial put spironolactone head-to-head against oral tetracycline and found no difference in efficacy over 8 weeks of treatment; however, caution is necessary in interpreting the results as this trial was also unbalanced, with 63 women receiving spironolactone but only 14 receiving tetracycline. Interestingly, the duration of therapy was consistently short (2–3 months) for those RCTs in which acne was the primary diagnosis, and much longer (9–12 months) for the trials in which hirsutism was the primary diagnosis. After only 3 months of treatment, the response of acne to spironolactone may not be optimal. The case series show that clinicians often use longer courses to manage acne in the real world. Using the PP population, improvement rates were significantly higher in the case series compared with those RCTs that had also used an outcome measure that could be dichotomized. This difference in efficacy rates may be an indication that longer treatment is likely to be more successful.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^113HhNRE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Use of Outcome Measures Within the RCTs

Heterogeneity of outcome measures and methods of reporting meant that pooling of data from different trials versus the same comparator was not feasible. Only two studies reported the same outcome in the same way for a similar patient population. Of our primary outcomes, four trials included a lesion count and five included an investigator-assessed change in global acne severity, all but one of which used recognized but different severity scales. Of our secondary outcomes, three trials included participant-assessed global improvement, none measured changes in HRQOL and only two included a post-treatment follow-up. One trial included time points prior to month 3, theoretically enabling calculation of time to improvement.

All but one trial reported side effects in full; one reported side effects associated with discontinuation only. Only two trials reported the number of women experiencing any side effect. Seven trials monitored changes in serum potassium (risk of hyperkalemia), but none reported the number of women with raised levels as a result of treatment.

Effect of the Interventions

The ten RCTs included 16 comparisons of spironolactone versus placebo or active treatment. The quality of the evidence was assessed for all comparisons and was downgraded by several levels, principally due to limitations in study design and implementation, and imprecision due to low sample sizes, and was consequently rated low or very low for our predefined outcomes. Inadequate data reporting did not permit calculation of RRs or MDs for any of the outcomes in four trials.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and / or acne [^111xVCSq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. Hirsutism is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones also known as androgens. It is also affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles, and the secretory glands around the hair follicles, called sebaceous glands. Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat hirsutism.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone and/or in combination with steroids (oral contraceptive pill included) in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched 12 June 2003). The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and CENTRAL, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. In addition, all reference lists of relevant trials were searched and drug companies contacted for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus: placebo, steroids (oral contraceptive pill included), spironolactone of varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seven trials were included in the review, eight trials were excluded. Two other trials are awaiting assessment. All included trials were small (no more than 41 participants) randomised and controlled. Only one trial studied acne as an outcome, the remainder were concerned with hirsutism. Two trials investigated spironolactone versus placebo; one trial was a dosage studies of spironolactone; one trial compared spironolactone with spironolactone in combination with dexamethasone; one trial used topical spironolactone for the treatment of acne, one trial compared three treatments; spironolactone, finasteride, cyproterone acetate. Major outcome measures include the following: subjective observations, Ferriman and Gallwey hair scores, hormonal and biochemical parameters, side effects, sebum production measurement.

Main Results

All sample populations were small and confidence intervals were wide. In the two trials that compared 100 mg of spironolactone with placebo significant differences were reported for subjective improvements in hair growth (OR 7.18, 95% CI 1.96 to 26.28), Ferriman-Galwey score (WMD 7.20, 95% CI -10.98 to -3.42)). The remaining comparisons were not statistically significant. There were statistically significant improvements in Ferriman-Galwey scores 12 months after the end of treatment in those women who received 100mg/day spironolactone compared to 12.5 mg/day cyproterone acetate (first 10 days of cycle) (WMD -1.18, 95% CI -2.1 to -0.26) and 5mg/day finasteride (WMD -2.34, 95% CI -3.23 to -1.45).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Six months treatment with 100 mg/day spironolactone compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant subjective improvement in hair growth and a decrease in Ferriman-Galwey scores. Spironolactone 100mg/day is superior to finasteride 5 mg/day and low dose cyproterone acetate 12.5 mg/day (first 10 days of cycle) up to 12 months after the end of treatment. The effectiveness of treatment for acne vulgaris cannot be determined due to the small sample populations involved in the trials. Its value in clinical practice is difficult to assess from currently available research.

### Use of spironolactone to treat acne in adolescent females [^113fwhod]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Studies assessing the utility of spironolactone for treating acne in adolescent females are lacking. Thus, we sought to examine spironolactone's role in treating this patient population.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed to determine the efficacy of spironolactone treatment in adolescent females seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, from 2007 to 2017.

Results

In a cohort of 80 pediatric patients with a median age of 19 years (range, 14–20 years), 64 patients (80%) experienced improvement of acne on treatment with spironolactone (median dose, 100 mg daily) with a favorable side effect profile. Approximately a quarter of patients (22.5%) had a complete response; more than half (58.8%) had a complete response or a partial response greater than 50%. Initial and maximal responses were observed at a median of 3 months and 5 months, respectively. Patients received treatment with spironolactone for a median duration of 7 months (range, 3–45 months) with limited side effects.

Conclusions

Spironolactone demonstrated efficacy in treating acne in adolescent females and is a safe long-term alternative to systemic antibiotics in these patients.

Spironolactone versus Placebo

Three trials evaluated this comparison. One provided useful data for a 200 mg daily dose in a crossover trial that examined 29 women. For the inflamed lesion count, the MD in favor of spironolactone was 26.1 lesions fewer, despite baseline imbalance in favor of the placebo (p < 0.00001; PP population of 21, both phases combined). Data for the first phase, which would be free of any potential carryover effects, were not reported. Combined data from both phases showed that 18/21 women taking spironolactone, compared with 5/21 taking placebo, reported improvement (RR 3.6, 95% CI 1.64–7.89; p = 0.001), and 15/20 versus 4/20 had at least a 50% reduction in inflamed lesion count (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.51–9.34; p = 0.005). In a mixed gender RCT, 24/30 participants receiving spironolactone (50 mg/day, including 27 women) improved, compared with 2/25 receiving placebo (PP population); separate data were unavailable for females. A similar problem arose in the third trial, which also included males. Data could not be extracted for three women receiving the 50 mg dose, but 6/9 women receiving doses of 100–200 mg/day improved, irrespective of which outcome measures were used (PP population). In neither mixed gender trial was the extent of improvement quantified. For details and quality of evidence, see Table 2.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^116jbnzK]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — treatment of hirsutism and acne — For women with PCOS in whom hirsutism is a major concern, treatment focuses on reducing androgen production, decreasing the fraction of circulating free T, and limiting androgen bioactivity at the hair follicle, and in general, 6 months of treatment is considered the minimal interval to detect differences in hirsutism. Therapeutically, inhibition of ovarian steroid production with estrogen and progestins as in oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) is emphasized; antiandrogens include spironolactone alone or with OCPs, flutamide, and finasteride (a 5α-reductase type 2 inhibitor). Insulin-sensitizing agents such as metformin and pioglitazone have minimal effectiveness on hirsutism and acne. For severe acne, isotretinoin can be of great benefit but is not effective for hirsutism and may result in alopecia. Topical eflornithine hydrochloride has been effective in decreasing of unwanted facial hair.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^114E6XzM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dropout rates due to side effects in spironolactone-treated participants were low in the RCTs and case series, suggesting that most women who begin the drug will continue to take it. However, side effect rates were significantly higher for the 200 mg/day dose than for lower doses. This was especially true for menstrual irregularities, the most common side effect reported in the RCTs and case series. Pooling of data has shown that the rate of menstrual irregularities can be significantly reduced by concomitant use of a COC, a practice that is widely recommended by experts. However, experts also recommend dose escalation, which, paradoxically, was rarely used in the included trials or case series as a potential, but as yet untested, means of improving tolerance and adherence.

A recent multicenter study in 974 women concluded that routine monitoring of serum potassium in healthy women taking spironolactone for acne is not necessary. The findings from this systematic review support that conclusion. Occasional testing may be justified on a case-by-case basis when risk factors are present. Although 14 women with raised potassium levels were identified among 469 women in the RCTs and case series, hyperkalemia was invariably mild and clinically insignificant. Some of the side effects of spironolactone, notably nausea, fatigue, and especially muscle weakness, can be indicative of hyperkalemia and, if persistent, could be used to indicate patients in whom testing may be justified. Crucially, the non-requirement for routine testing would reduce the overall direct costs of spironolactone treatment.

### Ethinylestradiol / chlormadinone acetate for use in dermatological disorders [^114etWyV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Among the pharmacological treatments available to manage or treat the dermatological disorders in the patients in our case series, a rational treatment choice would be hormonal therapies that target androgen excess (in which androgen excess is found, e.g. in acne) or those that target pilosebaceous unit sensitivity to androgens (in which increased 5α-reductase activity is found, e.g. in idiopathic hirsutism).

Oral hormonal therapies investigated for female androgenetic alopecia have had varied success. The 5α-reductase inhibitor (a testosterone conversion blocker) finasteride does not appear to be effective, at least in postmenopausal women (at a dose of 1 mg). The oral anti-androgens (androgen receptor antagonists) spironolactone and cyproterone acetate (alone or when given in combination with an estrogen) have been shown to be effective in limiting the progression of hair loss or improve hair growth, and have been used off-label for many years despite a lack of evidence from well-designed studies. The use of anti-androgens requires the use of good contraception because of the risk of feminization of a fetus. Evidence of their use from well-designed studies is lacking. Limited evidence suggests hormonal therapy is helpful even in patients with FPB with normal hormone levels. Currently, the only approved agent for female androgenetic alopecia is a non-hormonal therapy (minoxidil). None of the pharmacological treatments for FPB result in full hair recovery, and they are therefore used indefinitely to prolong their effect. Similarly, the management of hirsutism requires ongoing treatment with cosmetic (e.g. topical eflornithine hydrochloride) and physical measures (such as electrolysis, laser hair removal) and/or hormonal therapy. Anti-androgens (e.g. spironolactone, cyproterone acetate) have been investigated in this indication but not in randomized controlled trials, and again, their use is limited by the potential for feminization of male fetuses. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs; combination of an estrogen and a progestin) are the first line of pharmacological treatment of hirsutism, particularly in young women who do not want to become pregnant. COCs that may be used include those with low androgenic activity, such as ethinylestradiol in combination either with drospirenone (Yasmin), norgestimate (Ortho-Cyclen) or ethynodiol diacetate (Demulen 1–50). Cyproterone has also been combined with ethinylestradiol in a contraceptive (Dianette) and is approved for use in moderately severe hirsutism, but is associated with body weight gain, reduced libido and breast tenderness.

### Efficacy and safety of a low-level laser device in the treatment of male and female pattern hair loss: a multicenter, randomized, sham device-controlled, double-blind study [^111bFMV4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

To be included in the trials, subjects must have been healthy, 25–60 years of age, with active androgenetic hair loss (Norwood–Hamilton classification of IIa–V for male subjects and Ludwig/Savin classification of I-4, II-1, II-2, or frontal for female subjects) and have Fitzpatrick skin type I–IV. Race/ethnicity information was collected. Subjects must not have taken or used the following medications within 6 months prior to screening: minoxidil, finasteride (or any other 5α-reductase inhibitors), medications with anti-androgenic properties (e.g. cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, ketoconazole, flutamide, bicalutamide), topical estrogen, progesterone, tamoxifen, anabolic steroids, medication that can potentially cause hypertrichosis (e.g. cyclosporine, diazoxide, phenytoin, psoralens), oral glucocorticoids (inhaled glucocorticoids were permitted), lithium, phenothiazines, or other medications at the discretion of the investigators. Other excluded medications were phytotherapy (e.g. saw palmetto) within 8 weeks, isotretinoin within the past year, and anticoagulation use [other than aspirin (< 325 mg every day, which was stable for 3 months)]. Subjects were excluded if they had malignancy in the target area within 5 years, active infection on the scalp, chronic dermatologic conditions (e.g. eczema, psoriasis, infection) of the scalp other than pattern hair loss, a history of poor wound healing or keloid formation, a history of thyroid or other medical condition that might influence hair growth and loss; human immunodeficiency virus infection, possession of a pacemaker, defibrillator, or other active implantable device; a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse within the past 12 months; or any other medical conditions at the discretion of the investigators. Pregnant female subjects or female subjects planning on becoming pregnant during the duration of the study were excluded. Subjects with a history of photosensitivity to laser light, hair transplantation, scalp reduction, radiation to the scalp or chemotherapy within the past year, current hair weave or tattooing, as well as subjects with hair shorter than one-half inch or with light-blonde hair were also excluded.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^112J9tFp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Side Effects Reported in RCTs and Case Series

None of the studies carried a clear statement as to how information on side effects had been elicited, e.g. spontaneous reporting versus an open-ended question at each visit. Within the RCTs, there was no difference in the proportion of participants who dropped out due to side effects: 14/303 (4.6%) receiving spironolactone at any dose versus 10/343 (2.9%) receiving the comparators (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71–3.52; p = 0.26). Dropout rates due to side effects could not be calculated for two trials. In the case series, 49/729 (6.7%) women dropped out due to the side effects of spironolactone (ITT population). This was not significantly different to the rate in the RCTs (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39–1.23; p = 0.20).

Due to inadequate reporting in 8/10 RCTs, the proportion of women experiencing any side effect(s) could not be calculated. In the case series, at least 241 women experienced side effects equivalent to 48.0% of the PP and 43.9% of the ITT population. Reported rates varied from 0 to 90.7%, with the highest rates associated with the 200 mg/day dose. The most common side effect in both the RCTs and case series was menstrual irregularities: 38/264 (14.4%) in the RCTs and 216/543 (39.8%) in the case series (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26–0.49; p < 0.00001). From the case series, it was apparent these were dose-related: 137/176 women receiving 200 mg/day experienced menstrual disturbances, compared with 66/349 on lower daily doses (RR 4.12, 95% CI 3.27–5.19; p < 0.00001).

### Interventions for hirsutism (excluding laser and photoepilation therapy alone) [^112WKwR3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism occurs in 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age when there is excessive terminal hair growth in androgen-sensitive areas (male pattern). It is a distressing disorder with a major impact on quality of life. The most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome. There are many treatment options, but it is not clear which are most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (except laser and light-based therapies alone) for hirsutism.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and five trials registers, and checked reference lists of included studies for additional trials. The last search was in June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in hirsute women with polycystic ovary syndrome, idiopathic hirsutism, or idiopathic hyperandrogenism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors carried out study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses.

Main Results

We included 157 studies (sample size 30 to 80) comprising 10,550 women (mean age 25 years). The majority of studies (123/157) were 'high', 30 'unclear', and four 'low' risk of bias. Lack of blinding was the most frequent source of bias. Treatment duration was six to 12 months. Forty-eight studies provided no usable or retrievable data, i.e. lack of separate data for hirsute women, conference proceedings, and losses to follow-up above 40%. Primary outcomes, 'participant-reported improvement of hirsutism' and 'change in health-related quality of life', were addressed in few studies, and adverse events in only half. In most comparisons there was insufficient evidence to determine if the number of reported adverse events differed. These included known adverse events: gastrointestinal discomfort, breast tenderness, reduced libido, dry skin (flutamide and finasteride); irregular bleeding (spironolactone); nausea, diarrhoea, bloating (metformin); hot flushes, decreased libido, vaginal dryness, headaches (gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues)). Clinician's evaluation of hirsutism and change in androgen levels were addressed in most comparisons, change in body mass index (BMI) and improvement of other clinical signs of hyperandrogenism in one-third of studies. The quality of evidence was moderate to very low for most outcomes. There was low quality evidence for the effect of two oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (ethinyl estradiol + cyproterone acetate versus ethinyl estradiol + desogestrel) on change from baseline of Ferriman-Gallwey scores. The mean difference (MD) was -1.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.86 to 0.18). There was very low quality evidence that flutamide 250 mg, twice daily, reduced Ferriman-Gallwey scores more effectively than placebo (MD -7.60, 95% CI -10.53 to -4.67 and MD -7.20, 95% CI -10.15 to -4.25). Participants' evaluations in one study with 20 participants confirmed these results (risk ratio (RR) 17.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 259.87). Spironolactone 100 mg daily was more effective than placebo in reducing Ferriman-Gallwey scores (MD -7.69, 95% CI -10.12 to -5.26) (low quality evidence). It showed similar effectiveness to flutamide in two studies (MD -1.90, 95% CI -5.01 to 1.21 and MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.99 to 2.97) (very low quality evidence), as well as to finasteride in two studies (MD 1.49, 95% CI -0.58 to 3.56 and MD 0.40, 95% CI -1.18 to 1.98) (low quality evidence). Although there was very low quality evidence of a difference in reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores for finasteride 5 mg to 7.5 mg daily versus placebo (MD -5.73, 95% CI -6.87 to -4.58), it was unlikely it was clinically meaningful. These results were reinforced by participants' assessments (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.29 and RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.69 to 175.86). However, finasteride showed inconsistent results in comparisons with other treatments, and no firm conclusions could be reached. Metformin demonstrated no benefit over placebo in reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores (MD 0.05, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.12), but the quality of evidence was low. Results regarding the effectiveness of GnRH analogues were inconsistent, varying from minimal to important improvements. We were unable to pool data for OCPs with cyproterone acetate 20 mg to 100 mg due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies. However, addition of cyproterone acetate to OCPs provided greater reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores. Two studies, comparing finasteride 5 mg and spironolactone 100 mg, did not show differences in participant assessments and reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores (low quality evidence). Ferriman-Gallwey scores from three studies comparing flutamide versus metformin could not be pooled (I² = 62%). One study comparing flutamide 250 mg twice daily with metformin 850 mg twice daily for 12 months, which reached a higher cumulative dosage than two other studies evaluating this comparison, showed flutamide to be more effective (MD -6.30, 95% CI -9.83 to -2.77) (very low quality evidence). Data showing reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores could not be pooled for four studies comparing finasteride with flutamide as the results were inconsistent (I² = 67%). Studies examining effects of hypocaloric diets reported reductions in BMI, but which did not result in reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores. Although certain cosmetic measures are commonly used, we did not identify any relevant RCTs.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatments may need to incorporate pharmacological therapies, cosmetic procedures, and psychological support. For mild hirsutism there is evidence of limited quality that OCPs are effective. Flutamide 250 mg twice daily and spironolactone 100 mg daily appeared to be effective and safe, albeit the evidence was low to very low quality. Finasteride 5 mg daily showed inconsistent results in different comparisons, therefore no firm conclusions can be made. As the side effects of antiandrogens and finasteride are well known, these should be accounted for in any clinical decision-making. There was low quality evidence that metformin was ineffective for hirsutism and although GnRH analogues showed inconsistent results in reducing hirsutism they do have significant side effects. Further research should consist of well-designed, rigorously reported, head-to-head trials examining OCPs combined with antiandrogens or 5α-reductase inhibitor against OCP monotherapy, as well as the different antiandrogens and 5α-reductase inhibitors against each other. Outcomes should be based on standardised scales of participants' assessment of treatment efficacy, with a greater emphasis on change in quality of life as a result of treatment.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-analysis is the first evidence synthesis of RCTs investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgen pharmacological agents, alone or in combination, on endocrine and metabolic features in adolescents and adults with PCOS. Our findings address key gaps in the literature and directly inform the current 2023 update of the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS. Based on findings from this review, the guideline recommends that anti-androgen pharmacological agents could be considered to treat clinical hyperandrogenism (hirsutism), in situations where the COCP and/or cosmetic therapies (including mechanical laser and light therapies for hair reduction) are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum period of six months. Where appropriate, the use of effective contraception is strongly recommended, and women should be advised that anti-androgens may cause under-virilisation of a male fetus. It should be noted that this recommendation is based on the best available evidence, which remains largely limited as noted by the high heterogeneity (12 comparisons across 20 studies) and the low to very low GRADE certainty across most outcomes. Therefore, the recommendation remains general, and should not override clinical judgment with consideration of individual circumstances and perspectives.

In relation to safety, specific recommendations on optimal doses or formulations cannot be made based on the available evidence, due to high levels of heterogeneity across the included studies, with a considerable number of comparisons. In view of the limited data in PCOS, ascertaining the required information from general population literature may be appropriate. Based on general population recommendations, spironolactone doses of 25–100 mg daily appear to have low risks of adverse side effects, while high doses of CPA (≥ 10 mg) may lead to meningioma or venous thromboembolism, and flutamide and bicalutamide are associated with increased risks of liver toxicity. Most importantly, anti-androgens should not be used in the absence of effective contraception in sexually active individuals, due to the risks of under-virilisation of a male fetus if an unplanned pregnancy occurs.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^117Mno5k]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations suggest the use of the COCP alone with cosmetic therapy for at least 6 months prior to considering antiandrogens. Where COCPs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, and in the presence of effective forms of contraception, antiandrogens could be considered to treat hirsutism or androgen-related alopecia. The use of effective contraception is essential due to the teratogenic potential of antiandrogens and their impairment of external genital development in male foetuses. This conditional evidence-based recommendation of very low GRADE quality was based mainly on studies in adult women and included the use of flutamide, finasteride or spironolactone alone or in combination with a diet intervention. The reported side effects were gastrointestinal, including mild elevation of transaminases. There was only one study including a small number of adolescents with PCOS (n = 14) that evaluated finasteride, but it lacked a direct comparison between groups and did not report side effects. There was insufficient evidence to make an evidence-based recommendation in relation to efficacy of specific types of antiandrogens; the trials included small numbers of subjects and some were not RCTs (see Section 4.6 in the Technical Report). This recommendation was also informed by the Endocrine Society guidelines for the management of hirsutism, which recommend the use of cosmetic and COCP therapy as the first-line treatment for hirsutism in women with PCOS.

### Hair loss in women: medical and cosmetic approaches to increase scalp hair fullness [^115AYpGZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia affects both men and women. In men it produces male pattern hair loss with bitemporal recession and vertex baldness. In women it produces female pattern hair loss (FPHL) with diffuse alopecia over the mid-frontal scalp. FPHL occurs as a result of nonuniform hair follicle miniaturization within follicular units. Diffuse alopecia is produced by a reduction in the number of terminal fibres per follicular unit. Baldness occurs only when all hairs within the follicular units are miniaturized and is a relatively late event in women. The concepts of follicular units and primary and secondary hair follicles within follicular units are well established in comparative mammalian studies, particularly in sheep. However, discovery of these structures in the human scalp hair and investigation of the changes in follicular unit anatomy during the development of androgenetic alopecia have provided a clearer understanding of the early stages of androgenetic alopecia and how the male and female patterns of hair loss are related. FPHL is the most common cause of alopecia in women and approximately one-third of adult caucasian women experience hair loss. The impact of FPHL is predominantly psychological. While men anticipate age-related hair loss, hair loss in women is usually unexpected and unwelcome at any age. Treatment options to arrest hair loss progression and stimulate partial hair regrowth for FPHL include the androgen receptor antagonists spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride and the androgen-independent hair growth stimulator minoxidil. These treatments appear to work best when initiated early. Hair transplantation should be considered in advanced FPHL that is resistant to medical treatments. Hair transplantation requires well-preserved hair growth over the occipital donor area. The psychological impact of FPHL may also be reduced by cosmetic products that improve the appearance of the hair. These agents work to minimize hair fibre breakage, improve hair volume or conceal visible bald scalp.

### Antiandrogen therapy for the treatment of female pattern hair loss: a clinical review of current and emerging therapies [^113jh7kq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia is the most common hair loss type in women, but topical minoxidil is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment option. The pathophysiology involves shortened anagen phases, lengthened telogen phases, and hair follicle miniaturization. Androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a crucial role in male androgenetic alopecia pathogenesis, but their exact role in female pattern hair loss is unclear. Oral antiandrogens demonstrate some efficacy in women, albeit with considerations for side effects and contraindications. Topical antiandrogens may be used in combination with topical minoxidil or as alternatives to oral medications, likely with fewer systemic adverse effects. Patient-specific factors, including age, signs of hyperandrogenism, or need for contraception may help determine which antiandrogen therapy is most appropriate. This review focuses on current antiandrogen treatments for female pattern hair loss available in the United States and their limitations, as well as emerging treatments that are investigational, studied in other hair loss types, or available in other countries.

### Finasteride treatment of hair loss in women [^115XtR5N]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available evidence on the safety and efficacy of finasteride in the treatment of alopecia in women.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted through PubMed (1948-March 2010) and MEDLINE (1950-March 2010) using the search terms finasteride and alopecia. References cited in relevant publications were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All data sources identified were reviewed for inclusion. Reports of finasteride treatment of female alopecia were included in the review. This included prospective and retrospective trials, case series, and case reports. Studies in men were not included.

Data Synthesis

Few pharmacologic options exist for women with alopecia who do not achieve satisfactory responses to topical minoxidil solution. Treatment successes with finasteride in women with female pattern hair loss, although an off-label indication, have been primarily described in uncontrolled studies and anecdotal reports. In 2 controlled clinical studies, finasteride showed no benefit over placebo or no treatment in female pattern hair loss. A finasteride regimen of 1 mg orally daily, as indicated in male pattern hair loss, may be recommended for those who fail or cannot tolerate minoxidil therapy. A 12-month trial is needed to assess stabilization of hair loss, and hair regrowth may take 2 years or longer. Although data are sparse, menopausal status, circulating androgen concentrations, and concomitant symptoms of hyperandrogenism do not appear to predict response to finasteride. Overall, finasteride is well tolerated; however, women of childbearing potential must adhere to reliable contraception while receiving finasteride, and treatment is contraindicated in pregnancy, due to known teratogenicity.

Conclusions

Although objective evidence of efficacy is limited, finasteride may be considered for treatment of female pattern hair loss in patients who fail topical minoxidil treatment.

### Hormonal therapies for acne [^115Lf1SW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acne is a common, worldwide problem that is usually multifactorial in etiology, but androgens may play a pivotal role in the development and severity of acne. Endocrinopathies, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, ovarian tumors, or adrenal hyperplasia or tumors, may be detected in some patients with acne, especially if acne is sudden in onset, associated with hirsutism or menstrual irregularities, or associated with cushingoid facies, acanthosis nigricans, patterned hair loss, or deepened voice. In these instances, serum-free and total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone should be tested. Appropriate referral and long-term follow-up is warranted in patients diagnosed with an endocrinopathy. Hormonal therapies for acne include systemic medications with various mechanisms: androgen receptor blockers, adrenal androgen production blockers, or ovarian androgen production blockers. Androgen receptor blockers include spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone, and flutamide; adrenal androgen production blockers include glucocorticoids; and ovarian production blockers include gonadotropin-releasing agonists and oral contraceptives. Practical guidelines are shared for the practicing physician treating hormonally related acne.

### A novel topical combination of minoxidil and spironolactone for androgenetic alopecia: clinical, histopathological, and physicochemical study [^112aDp2e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Topical minoxidil 5% are effective in androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Spironolactone acts as an androgen antagonist by competitively blocking androgen receptors. Studying the effect of topical minoxidil 5% gel and spironolactone gel 1% in management of AGA. The study includes 60 patients diagnosed as AGA; (group I): treated with topical minoxidil gel 5%, (group II): with topical spironolactone gel 1% and group (III) treated with combined minoxidil 5% and spironolactone 1% gel. All patients were followed up monthly throughout the treatment period. Scalp biopsy was taken before and after 12months. In group I, the clinical response was in 90% of patients with variable degrees in improvement, in group II, the clinical response was in 80% of patients, meanwhile, in group III the clinical response was in all patients (100%). Histopathological examination of skin biopsy after treatment revealed significant increase in anagen hair on the other hand, both telogen and vellus hair was significantly decreased meanwhile, the T/V ratio was significantly increased. The results of this work revealed that topical minoxidil gel 5% and topical spironolactone gel 1% were effective in treatment of AGA, while the combination of two agents was better in treatment.

### Case series evaluating the efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma for androgenetic alopecia in pediatric patients [^114jaCbA]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a form of hair loss commonly referred to as male or female pattern hair loss. It is traditionally diagnosed by clinical examination with no further testing needed. Although prevalence varies based on the population, it commonly occurs between the fourth and seventh decades of life in both sexes. AGA can also be seen in children with an average onset age of 14.8 years but can be seen as young as 6 years old. Pediatric AGA is the most common cause of hair loss in adolescence. Many treatments including minoxidil, spironolactone finasteride, dutasteride, lasers, and platelet- rich plasma (PRP) have been studied in adult AGA, but not pediatrics. This is a retrospective clinical review of efficacy and safety in 4 cases of pediatric AGA treated with PRP injections (Table I).

### Effectiveness of exosome treatment in androgenetic alopecia: outcomes of a prospective study [^112G46RS]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Androgenic alopecia (AGA) occurs through different mechanisms in people with genetic predisposition; its frequency and severity increase with age have different characteristic hair loss patterns in men and women. Since the pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment management of androgenetic alopecia may differ, evaluating it as male-type and female-type androgenetic alopecia is more accurate. In men, hair in the frontal, vertex, and sometimes temporal areas of the scalp is lost, while the frontal hairline is usually preserved, and hair loss is observed in women's frontal and vertex areas. The prevalence of androgenetic alopecia is estimated to vary between 23 and 87%. Although the possibility of polygenetic inheritance cannot be excluded, it is thought to show an autosomal dominant transmission with variable penetrance.

Androgenic alopecia treatment aims to stop follicular miniaturization and improve hair density. Before starting treatment, patients should be informed about the treatments' possible effects, side effects, and costs. The patient's expectations from the treatments should be carefully questioned, and it should be shared with the patient that even if there is no new hair growth, even the cessation of hair loss will be considered a good response to the treatment.

Minoxidil is the most used drug in local treatment. Antiandrogens and 5-α reductase inhibitors belong to the class of androgen-dependent treatments. Among the antiandrogens, cyproterone acetate (CPA), spironolactone (SP), and flutamide are used only in female patients due to their potential side effects in male patients. CPA suppresses the production of gonadotropins by inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. It also blocks androgen receptors. CPA, which is often included in oral contraceptives in combination with androgen and treated with estradiol, is especially preferred in female patients with hyperandrogenism. The basic surgical method is auto transplantation, where hair follicles in the occipital region are transplanted to the frontal, temporal, parietal and vertex regions.

Extracellular vesicles are lipid-bound structures secreted by various cell types. They play a crucial role in intercellular communication by transporting various molecules between cells, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and other bioactive molecules. Recent research suggests that these extracellular vesicles, particularly stem cell-derived exosomes, possess remarkable regenerative properties, demonstrating a potential for stimulating hair follicle regeneration and promoting hair growth.

### Hirsutism: an evidence-based treatment update [^114Po2jr]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism has a relatively high prevalence among women. Depending upon societal and ethnic norms, it can cause significant psychosocial distress. Importantly, hirsutism may be associated with underlying disorders and co-morbidities. Hirsutism should not simply be looked upon as an issue of cosmesis. Patients require appropriate evaluation so that underlying etiologies and associated sequelae are recognized and managed. Treatment of hirsutism often requires a multidisciplinary approach, and a variety of physical or pharmacologic modalities can be employed. Efficacy of these therapies is varied and depends, among other things, upon patient factors including the underlying etiology, hormonal drive, and local tissue sensitivity to androgens.

Objective

The objective of this paper is to review and summarize current evidence evaluating the efficacy of various treatment modalities for hirsutism in premenopausal women.

Methods

Online databases were searched to identify all relevant prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as recently published (2012-present) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on hirsutism treatment.

Results

Four recently published RCTs met criteria for inclusion in our review. In addition, one meta-analysis and one systematic review/treatment guideline were identified in the recent literature. Physical modalities and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) remain first-line treatments. Evidence supports the use of electrolysis for permanent hair removal in localized areas and lasers (particularly alexandrite and diode lasers) for permanent hair reduction. Topical eflornithine can be used as monotherapy for mild hirsutism and as an adjunct therapy with lasers or pharmacotherapy in more severe cases. Combined OCPs as a class are superior to placebo; however, antiandrogenic and low-dose neutral OCPs may be slightly more efficacious in improving hirsutism compared with other types of OCPs. Antiandrogens are indicated for moderate to severe hirsutism, with spironolactone being the first-line antiandrogen and finasteride and cyproterone acetate being second-line antiandrogens. Due to its risk for hepatotoxicity, flutamide is not considered a first-line therapy. If used, the lowest effective dose should be administered with careful monitoring of liver enzymes. Monotherapy with an insulin sensitizer does not significantly improve hirsutism. While insulin sensitizers improve important metabolic and endocrine aberrations in polycystic ovary syndrome, they are not recommended when hirsutism is the sole indication for use. Lifestyle modification counseling is recommended. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and glucocorticoids are only recommended in specific circumstances. Additional therapies without sufficient supportive evidence of efficacy are ovarian surgery, statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), and vitamin D supplementation.

Limitations

In general, most therapies garner recommendations that are weak (where the estimates of benefits versus risks of therapy are either closely balanced or uncertain) and are based on low- to moderate-quality evidence.

Conclusions

Risks and benefits of treatment must be carefully considered and discussed with the patient. Expectations for efficacy should be appropriately set. A minimum of 6 months is required to see benefit from pharmacotherapy and lifelong treatment is often necessary for sustained benefit.

### Interventions for female pattern hair loss [^115RdfET]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Female pattern hair loss, or androgenic alopecia, is the most common type of hair loss affecting women. It is characterised by progressive shortening of the duration of the growth phase of the hair with successive hair cycles, and progressive follicular miniaturisation with conversion of terminal to vellus hair follicles (terminal hairs are thicker and longer, while vellus hairs are soft, fine, and short). The frontal hair line may or may not be preserved. Hair loss can have a serious psychological impact on people.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the available options for the treatment of female pattern hair loss in women.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), PubMed (from 1947), Web of Science (from 1945), and reference lists of articles. We also searched several online trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of interventions for female pattern hair loss in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Twenty two trials, comprising 2349 participants, were included. A wide range of interventions were evaluated, with 10 studies investigating the different concentrations of minoxidil. Pooled data from 4 studies indicated that a greater proportion of participants (121/488) treated with minoxidil reported a moderate increase in their hair regrowth when compared with placebo (64/476) (risk ratio (RR) = 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 2.43). In 7 studies, there was an important increase of 13.28 in total hair count per cm(2) in the minoxidil group compared to the placebo group (95% CI 10.89 to 15.68). There was no difference in the number of adverse events in the twice daily minoxidil and placebo intervention groups, with the exception of a reported increase of adverse events (additional hair growth on areas other than the scalp) with minoxidil (5%) twice daily. Most of the other comparisons consisted of single studies. These were assessed as high risk of bias: They did not address our prespecified outcomes and provided limited evidence of either the efficacy or safety of these interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Although more than half of the included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias, and the rest at unclear, there was evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of topical minoxidil in the treatment of female pattern hair loss. Further direct comparison studies of minoxidil 5% applied once a day, which could improve adherence when compared to minoxidil 2% twice daily, are still required. Consideration should also be given to conducting additional well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trials investigating several of the other treatment options.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111zM2Qq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

3.1–3.2 Values and preferences

In evaluating the benefits and risks of HC treatment in women with PCOS, we believed concerns related to untreated menstrual dysfunction and quality of life related to anovulatory bleeding and hirsutism to be the primary considerations. Screening recommendations follow the current World Health Organization and CDC medical eligibility guidelines (Table 6). In making these recommendations, the committee strongly believes that larger controlled studies should be performed to evaluate the risk of long-term HC use in women with PCOS, particularly in the presence of obesity, IR, and lipid disorders. There are insufficient data about whether women with PCOS face increased risk of thromboembolism on particular HC preparations, although preparations may vary with respect to thromboembolic risk in the general population. There are insufficient data to define the optimal duration of treatment with HCs. Women with severe hirsutism or contraindications to hormonal contraception may require other therapies such as antiandrogens (spironolactone, flutamide, finasteride, etc) or mechanical hair removal (laser, electrolysis, etc) (see hirsutism guidelines in Ref.).

Role of exercise in lifestyle therapy

3.3 We suggest the use of exercise therapy in the management of overweight and obesity in PCOS (2|⊕⊕○○). Although there are no large randomized trials of exercise in PCOS, exercise therapy, alone or in combination with dietary intervention, improves weight loss and reduces cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes risk in the general population.

3.3 Evidence

It is well recognized in the general population that cardiovascular fitness, as measured by maximal oxygen consumption during exercise, is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality. This remains significant after adjustment for age, smoking, cholesterol measures, diabetes, hypertension, and family history of cardiovascular disease. Overall, there is good evidence in the general population that metabolic status is improved with exercise alone, and this reduces the risk of diabetes. Thirty minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity is effective in reducing the development of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. There are few trials of exercise therapy targeting women with PCOS, and no large randomized trials are available, but there is a suggestion of weight loss, improved ovulation, and decreased IR.

3.3 Values and preferences

Despite the limited evidence in PCOS, we suggest that the benefits of exercise in improving metabolic disease are strong enough to favor its recommendation, despite a paucity of controlled trials available for review.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113hs44n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Hirsutism in premenopausal women — antiandrogen efficacy and safety: In analyses of individual agents versus placebo, spironolactone 100 mg/d, finasteride 2.5 to 5 mg/d, and flutamide 500 mg/d each showed a significant reduction in hirsutism scores, and pooled across trials antiandrogens were significantly more effective than placebo with a weighted mean difference of −7.02 [95% CI (−11.51 to −2.52)]. Spironolactone is generally well tolerated but should not be used if there is renal impairment, may have a dose-dependent association with menstrual irregularity unless an OC is used concomitantly, and may rarely result in hyperkalemia; it may cause increased diuresis and occasionally postural hypotension and dizziness early in treatment. OCs containing DSP have a mild mineralocorticoid effect and should not be used with a potassium-sparing diuretic. If spironolactone is inadvertently used during early pregnancy, there is a danger that a male fetus could be feminized although the absolute risk is not known. Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is used worldwide but is not available in the United States, and in one systematic review the OC CPA (2 mg) with 35 mcg EE was similar to antiandrogen therapy and more effective than placebo.

### Evidence-based (S3) guideline for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in women and in men-short version [^115eRCMr]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for androgenetic alopecia, more specifically with respect to hormonal therapy (female-pattern hair loss), EDF 2018 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of topical alfatradiol, topical fluridil, topical natural estrogens, or progesterones to improve or to prevent the progression of androgenetic alopecia in female patients.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^112BbFne]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — spironolactone safety and potassium monitoring: Common side effects include diuresis (29%), menstrual irregularities (22%), and breast tenderness (17%), and non–clinically relevant potassium elevations may occur in about 13.7% of patients; in 967 women aged 18 to 45 years taking 50 to 200 mg daily, only 0.75% of 1723 potassium measurements exceeded 5.0 mmol/L and 6 of the 13 abnormal tests were normal on repeat; serum potassium testing is therefore not required, but should be considered in older patients and in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or digoxin, with measurements performed at baseline, during therapy, and after dose increases; patients should also be educated to avoid foods high in dietary potassium such as low-sodium processed foods and coconut water; spironolactone may be used safely with drospirenone-containing COCs, with no elevations in serum potassium in a series of 27 patients receiving spironolactone 100 mg daily plus ethinyl estradiol 30 μg/drospirenone 3 mg.

### Management of hirsutism [^115qdhxq]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

This review reports our own experience with, and literature studies of, the pharmacological management of hirsutism in women with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome) or with normal serum androgen levels and regular ovulatory menstrual cycles (idiopathic hirsutism). Treatment consists of suppressing ovarian or adrenal androgen secretion, or blocking androgen actions in the skin. The major drugs used are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and steroidal (cyproterone acetate and spironolactone) or nonsteroidal (flutamide and finasteride) antiandrogens. GnRH agonists, suppressing the pituitary, decrease androgen and estradiol secretion and improve severe hirsutism. To avoid estrogen deficiency problems, 'add back' therapy with estrogen-progestogen or COCs is advisable. This method of treatment is complicated and expensive, limiting its use to severe forms of ovarian hyperandrogenism with hyperinsulinemia. The third-generation COCs, containing new progestogens or cyproterone, have very restricted effectiveness in the short term (6 cycles), but their long term use (> 12 cycles) cures mild-to-moderate hirsutism and improves severe hirsutism. As well as suppressing gonadotropins and ovarian androgen steroidogenesis, these formulations decrease free testosterone levels and may also decrease adrenal androgen production. In women being treated with antiandrogens, COCs are important to provide control of the menstrual cycle and contraception. Cyproterone, a progestational agent, inhibits gonadotropin secretion and blocks androgen action. It is used in COCs or in a reverse sequential regimen. In the latter, it is very effective in the short term treatment of hirsutism. Spironolactone blocks androgen receptors. Its effectiveness in hirsutism is dosage-dependent: low dosages are less active than other antiandrogens, whereas high dosages (200 mg/day) are very effective at the cost of several adverse effects (particularly dysfunctional uterine bleeding), but the concomitant use of a COC may prevent these. Flutamide is a pure antiandrogen that blocks androgen receptors and inhibits hair growth. It is very effective in treating hirsutism within 6 to 12 months. Dry skin is very frequent during treatment with flutamide, and hepatotoxicity is possible at high dosages. Finasteride, a 5 alpha-reductase type 2 inhibitor, is the least effective antiandrogen, but a dosage of 5 mg/day decreases hirsutism without adverse effects. Pregnancy must be avoided during therapy with antiandrogens because of the possible risk of abnormal development of a male fetus. Antiandrogens, especially flutamide (250 to 500 mg/day) and cyproterone (12.5 to 50 mg/day in a reverse sequential regimen), alone or in association with COCs, seem to be the most effective agents for the treatment of hirsutism.

### Efficacy and safety of a low-level laser device in the treatment of male and female pattern hair loss: a multicenter, randomized, sham device-controlled, double-blind study [^1122SLRZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In four randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trials of MPHL and FPHL, we detected a statistically significant increase in terminal hair density after 26 weeks of lasercomb treatment compared with sham treatment. Such improvement was independent of the sex and age of the subject, and independent of the lasercomb model when similar laser dose rates were delivered. A higher percentage of lasercomb-treated subjects reported overall improvement of hair loss condition and thickness and fullness of hair in self-assessment, though the results did not always reach statistical significance. Increase in terminal hair count was comparable to the short-term trials of 5% minoxidil topical solution and 1 mg/day finasteride, but less efficacious than longer term (≥ 1 year) trials. Further clinical trials are needed to define the optimal duration of treatment, the duration of response, and the use of the lasercomb in other alopecia conditions.

### A randomized trial assessing efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy compared to standard antihypertensive therapy in hypErtension with low renin (REMASTER): rationale and study design [^112PFg31]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety considerations

All medications used in the trial have been entered into the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Spironolactone, perindopril, and amlodipine are approved by Therapeutic Guides Australia for the treatment of hypertension. The following adverse effects will be noted at each visit: gynecomastia, breast pain, reduced libido, menstrual irregularity, cough, hyperkalemia, and an increase of > 30% in serum creatinine.

Adverse effects will be described in the patient's medical record as follows: a description of symptoms including duration, severity (mild, moderate, or severe), seriousness (i.e. is it a serious adverse event?), any action taken, the outcome and likelihood of the relationship to the trial treatment (unrelated, possible, probable, definite). All serious adverse effects that occur from the time the participant signs the consent form, up to and including the last scheduled visit, will be reported within 24 h to an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, consisting of four members including a biostatistician and doctors with expertise in clinical trials. A trial progress update will be sent quarterly to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Trial conduct, protocol compliance, and safety are under their oversight.

Dose and medication modification

If a participant on spironolactone treatment develops troublesome gynecomastia, breast tenderness, or irregular menses, they will be prescribed eplerenone in place of spironolactone at the same dose but twice a day e.g. participants on spironolactone 25 mg daily will be switched to eplerenone 25 mg twice a day. Eplerenone is a less potent but more selective MRA with minimal effect on the progesterone and androgen receptors. If perindopril 5/10 mg is not tolerated due to side effects such as cough, participants will be prescribed irbesartan 150/300 mg, respectively. Participants requiring a change in medication to eplerenone or irbesartan will be unblinded but will remain in the study and contribute to the final analysis. If a participant develops hyperkalemia, defined as serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L on a non-hemolyzed blood sample, or has a 30% increase in creatinine due to perindopril/irbesartan or spironolactone/eplerenone, the dose of the trial mediation will be reduced to the highest tolerated dose.

### Use of topical clascoterone for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa [^111nJRVv]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The pathogenesis of HS involves obstruction of the hair follicle within the pilosebaceous-apocrine unit, leading to inflammation and a robust immune response that results in the formation of the characteristic lesions. Although the exact mechanism of how hormones are involved in HS is uncertain, there are several studies supporting their involvement, as many female patients experience perimenstrual flares, as in our patient, and diagnosis usually occurs around the age of puberty. Because antiandrogen therapies such as spironolactone have been successful in treating HS, and testosterone levels have not been significantly different compared with those in controls, it has been suggested that androgen involvement in HS is in the terminal conversion of testosterone to DHT. Given that clascoterone works locally at the site of application to target DHT, it may benefit patients with HS via a similar mechanism to how acne is improved, by reducing inflammation and sebum production. Clascoterone may be most effective in a subgroup of patients who perhaps have a hormonal component to their HS, as in our patient. Furthermore, it may also be an option in men to avoid the systemic side effects of spironolactone. Although additional studies must be conducted to elucidate the efficacy of treating HS with clascoterone, this topical therapy warrants further exploration as a potential treatment option for HS.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: a hybrid systematic review [^112dNsem]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk of Hyperkalemia

Serum electrolytes were measured in 7/10 RCTs involving 157 women (PP population) and 10/18 case series involving 312 women (PP population) as a means of detecting possible adverse effects of spironolactone on fluid balance and kidney function. Serum electrolyte data reporting was inadequate in almost all cases and no results were presented for two RCTs that monitored this. No women in the remaining five RCTs were reported to have elevated levels. Fourteen women (4.5%) in two case series, one that used doses ≥ 200 mg/day (4/18) and the other 50–100 mg/day (10/73), were reported to have slightly raised levels post-treatment. In an earlier study (not one of the 18 case series), serum potassium was measured in otherwise healthy women with acne treated with 50–150 mg/day of spironolactone. Mild hyperkalemia was detected in 6/60 (10%) women. It is impossible to determine whether the women in the later study were a separate group to those in the earlier study, and thus whether these were independent samples. Most recently, Plovanich et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of serum potassium levels in 974 women aged 18–45 years taking 50–200 mg/day of spironolactone for acne, seen in two US hospitals between December 2000 and March 2014. Among 1802 measurements, 13 were slightly elevated, yielding a mild hyperkalemia rate of 0.72%, similar to the expected baseline rate of 0.76% derived from all available serum potassium measurements for females of the same age (32/4209). Repeat testing in 6/13 women yielded values within the normal range, suggesting initial measurements could have been erroneous.

### Potassium concentrations in transgender women using spironolactone: a retrospective chart review [^1171kgjc]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the incidence of hyperkalemia in transgender women using spironolactone.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of transgender women who received gender-affirming hormone therapy that included spironolactone between January 2000 and September 2018. Forty-four participants who had paired potassium concentrations documented and were on spironolactone were included and analyzed. Study outcomes included the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations > 5.0 mmol/L), the relationship between the duration of treatment and degree of hyperkalemia, and difference between serum potassium concentrations at the beginning of spironolactone treatment versus last serum potassium concentrations.

Results

The median age of the participants was 36.5 years. The cohort was predominantly non-Hispanic White (32/44). No serum potassium concentration was > 5.5 mmol/L, and all participants had serum creatinine level of < 2 mg/dL. Median duration of treatment was 25 months (range 2–92 months) and 140 potassium measurements were available. The mean potassium concentration (3.87 mmol/L) before the initiation of spironolactone was lower than the mean potassium concentration (4.03 mmol/L) while on spironolactone (mean difference, 0.16 mmol/L, P = .013). The regression β, that is, the average change in potassium concentration per 1 additional month of treatment duration, was -.001 (95% CI [-.004, .001]; p = 0.255) signifying no relation between treatment duration and spironolactone use.

Conclusion

No participant had laboratory evidence of significant hyperkalemia (K > 5.5 mmol/L) after initiation of spironolactone. Frequent measurement of potassium concentrations might be unnecessary in transgender women taking spironolactone in patients with serum creatinine levels of < 2 mg/dL.

The reported efficacy of various treatments for alopecia is difficult to compare based on a general lack of consideration in case reports/series and clinical trials of the spontaneous regrowth or baseline prognostic factors seen in alopecia areata and a general lack of quantification of hair growth. This report will give both the investigator and clinician guidelines for clinical trial design that will take into account variables known to effect efficacy results such as baseline severity, pattern, and duration of hair loss, age of the subject, and concomitant conditions that may impact on potential regrowth. Reliable methods of assessment of efficacy and response criteria that will enable direct comparison of results between agents will also be discussed.

### The hirsute woman: challenges in evaluation and management [^117Ah3uj]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic approach, and management of hirsutism.

Methods

We discuss the clinical course of hirsutism and provide our recommendations on the various treatment options available.

Results

Hirsutism is a common clinical problem characterized by the presence of increased terminal hair growth in androgen-dependent areas of the skin. The development of hirsutism depends on the presence of the pilosebaceous unit, which is genetically determined, as well as the presence of the androgen receptor and intracellular 5α-reductase activity, which converts testosterone to its more active metabolite, dihydrotestosterone. A detailed history and physical examination and the following laboratory tests can diagnose most causes of hirsutism: early-morning follicular phase measurement of total testosterone, testosterone not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, prolactin, and thyrotropin levels. Oral contraceptive preparations may be effective monotherapy for mild hirsutism. For the treatment of more severe hirsutism, oral contraceptive pills combined with spironolactone are as effective as oral contraceptive pills containing cyproterone acetate, which are not available in the United States. Because of teratogenicity, spironolactone should be used with caution in premenopausal women when it is administered without an oral contraceptive pill. Metformin is an alternative therapy for hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who have other indications for metformin use. Metformin is not as effective as antiandrogens for the management of hirsutism. The use of glucocorticoids, finasteride, or flutamide is not recommended.

Conclusions

Hirsutism can be evaluated with a detailed history and physical examination and a limited number of hormonal tests. Serious disorders presenting as hirsutism are rare and can be excluded with the recommended evaluation. Treatment is targeted at reducing the production and bioavailability of testosterone, as well as blocking target tissue androgen action.

### Estrogen hormone therapy stabilizes lateral hairline in transfeminine patients: implications for facial feminization surgery [^1173DRuu]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although several studies report on the suppressing effects of estrogen therapy on facial and body hair in transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) individuals, few studies have elucidated its effects on hairline stability on the scalp. In this study, we assessed the influence of estrogen therapy on forehead length.

Methods

All TGNB patients, aged 30 years or older, assigned male at birth (AMAB) seeking facial feminization surgery were included in the study. Central and forehead lengths were collected at the initial consultation visits. Variables, including age, duration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), presence of spironolactone, and presence of other hair treatments, such as finasteride, dutasteride, or minoxidil, that potentially influence hair growth were collected by chart review. Multivariable linear regressions were constructed with relevant predictor variables while also incorporating global health scores as a proxy for psychological effects on hair loss.

Results

Overall, 171 patients were included in this study, with a median age of 36.0 (interquartile range (IQR) 32.0–46.0) years and median HRT duration of 2.0 (IQR 1.0–6.0) years. Multivariable linear regressions revealed no significant predictors for central forehead length. However, lateral forehead length was positively predicted by age (B = 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.03–0.08], p < 0.001) and hair treatment (B = 0.66, 95% CI [0.14–1.18], p = 0.01), but negatively predicted by HRT duration (B = -0.07, 95% CI [-0.10 to -0.04], p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Although older age is a predictor of lateral hairline recession in TGNB AMAB individuals, lateral forehead length was also predicted to decrease by 0.07 cm with each year of feminizing hormone therapy in patients over 30 years of age.

### Permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia presenting with erosive pustular dermatosis-like retention hyperkeratosis [^1176gbJu]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical features of pCIA typically include nonscarring alopecia with diffuse hair thinning, often with a pattern similar to androgenetic alopecia, and eyelash, eyebrow, axillary, and pubic hair loss. Histopathologic findings of pCIA include reduction in hair density, miniaturization, and end-stage fibrous tracts. To our knowledge, thick plate-like scaling with an erosive scalp has not been reported previously as an associated clinical finding of PCIA. The etiology of EPD and retention hyperkeratosis are not fully known and may be triggered by trauma. Chemotherapy could trigger EPD or retention hyperkeratosis, but this does not explain the patient's single episode, which usually follows a chronic recurrent course.

pCIA can be distressing, with negative impact on quality of life and self-esteem. Prevention with scalp cooling, prompt diagnosis, and early treatment may help reduce morbidity. There are currently no guidelines for the treatment of pCIA, in part due to its incompletely understood pathogenesis. One hypothesis is that chemotherapies unmask underlying androgenetic alopecia in women, so this patient was treated with spironolactone, an androgen receptor antagonist. The patient was also treated with topical minoxidil 5%, a common treatment for CIA that has shown mixed results for pCIA. Oral minoxidil and platelet rich plasma may be considered as future treatments.

In conclusion, rare presentations of pCIA may include thick plate-like scaling resembling EPD. Repeat biopsy after clearance of lesions may allow for prompt diagnosis, and treatment for pCIA requires further research.

In 1 study, "27 women with acne were treated with a COC containing drospirenone 3 mg and ethinyl estradiol 30 μg and spironolactone 100 mg each day", and "There were no significant elevations of serum potassium and there were no additional side effects significant enough to discontinue treatment".

Best-Corrected Visual Acuity

In the treatment group, the mean BCVA significantly improved from 0.47 logMAR at baseline to 0.38 logMAR at 6 months (p < 0.05). The mean BCVA improved from 0.27 logMAR at baseline to 0.24 logMAR at 6 months in the control group, but this improvement did not have statistical significance (p = 0.23) (Table 3 and Figure 3). The percentage of eyes with BCVA improvement was observed in 47.62% of the treatment group and 29.27% in the control group. Moreover, the 2-line and 3-line BCVA gain in the treatment group was much more than those in the control group. However, the overall BCVA change did not demonstrate a statistical significance (p = 0.39) (Table 4).

Many prognostic factors were analyzed including age, history of steroid use, duration of disease, baseline BCVA, SRF, CMT and lesion size, presence of serous PED, SRF resolved at 3 months and FFA patterns. Table 5 demonstrates that duration of disease less than 6 months, SRF resolved at 3 months and expansile dot pattern of dye leakage on FFA were associated with the success of treatment at 6 months with statistically significant difference. During the 6-month follow-up period, moreover, the recurrence of SRF after complete resolution was observed in 4/12 eyes (33.33%) in the treatment group and 4/13 eyes (30.76%) in the control group. No patient experienced any side effects including the anti-androgenic effect such as gynecomastia, which might be adverse drug reactions from using spironolactone.

### Endocrine treatment of gender-dysphoric / gender-incongruent persons: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115JjJm4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Transgender females — estrogen regimens and adjuncts are outlined: the hormone regimen for transgender females is more complex than the transgender male regimen; treatment with physiologic doses of estrogen alone is insufficient to suppress testosterone into the normal female range and most published clinical studies report the need for adjunctive therapy; adjunctive options include progestins with antiandrogen activity and GnRH agonists, with spironolactone blocking androgens during their interaction with the androgen receptor and possibly having estrogenic activity, and cyproterone acetate widely used in Europe; 5α-Reductase inhibitors do not reduce testosterone levels and have adverse effects; monthly GnRH agonist goserelin acetate in combination with estrogen was effective in reducing testosterone with a low incidence of adverse reactions in 60 transgender females, and leuprolide and transdermal estrogen were as effective as cyproterone and transdermal estrogen in a comparative retrospective study; patients can take estrogen as oral conjugated estrogens, oral 17β-estradiol, or transdermal 17β-estradiol, and among estrogen options the increased risk of thromboembolic events is most concerning with ethinyl estradiol, "which is why we specifically suggest that it not be used in any transgender treatment plan", with additional notes that oral routes may be more thrombogenic due to the "first pass effect" than transdermal and parenteral routes and that thromboembolic risk is dose-dependent.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^1171T8Jy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1.3 Female Pattern Hair‐Loss (FPHL)

Scalp hair‐loss in women is relatively common, and its prevalence increases with age, affecting ~50% of women over the age of 80 years. Depending on whether it occurs before or after the menopause, it may be considered as either early‐ or late‐onset. The term FPHL is now more widely adopted than 'androgenic alopecia' in recognition of the fact that factors other than androgens may contribute to its pathophysiology. Nevertheless, androgen excess remains an important cause of FPHL, and may cause distinct patterns of alopecia, including hair‐loss with frontal accentuation or central expansion of hair‐loss with frontal hairline preservation.

5.1.4 Menstrual History

Although PCOS is the most common cause of androgen excess, other primary causes of hyperandrogenism can also result in menstrual irregularity via PCOS‐independent mechanisms, either because of the underlying disease process (e.g. hypogonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to Cushing's disease) or due to disruption of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis by elevated androgens of any cause. The menstrual cycle history should include age of menarche, frequency of menstrual cycles (oligomenorrhoea, typically defined as average menstrual cycle length > 35 days or fewer than eight cycles per year) and, where relevant, age of menopause and last menstrual bleed.

Case 2

A healthy 16-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented with a 10-month history of diffuse scalp pruritus and Ludwig Scale Grade I. She previously took biotin 10 mg daily with no improvement. Family history was significant for a father with AGA. (Fig 2, A). A 4 mm punch biopsy was taken from the right anterior scalp which showed decreased terminal folliculosebaceous units and few vellus hair follicles, consistent with AGA. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and K+ levels were within normal limits, ferritin 46 ng/ml. She was started on ferrous sulfate/gluconate 325 mg daily for 1 week, and increased to 3 times daily, spironolactone 50 mg twice daily and a topical combination foam (minoxidil 12%, levocetirizine 1%, finasteride 0.25%) applied once daily to scalp. After 3 weeks of this regimen, it was augmented with PRP treatments. Patient completed monthly PRP injections for 4 consecutive months. By treatment 4, the patient had overall improved hair density attributed to PRP, topical and oral medications (Fig 2, B). This patient tolerated PRP treatments well, experiencing 5/10 initial injection site pain, 5/10 injection site pain 4 hours after, and 3/10 injection site pain 24 hours after the procedure (Table II).

### Topical ruxolitinib in combination with oral minoxidil results in hair regrowth in a patient with central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia and concomitant traction alopecia [^115znJXn]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old female presented in February 2023 with complaints of hair loss for several years. She reported using topical minoxidil and oral spironolactone 50 mg daily due to a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome without response. Physical examination revealed hair loss on the vertex and frontal scalp with a positive fringe sign (Fig 1, A-E). She was diagnosed with CCCA and TA and treated with oral minoxidil 2.5 mg daily. She was also continued on spironolactone by endocrinology for hair loss that was favored to be related to polycystic ovarian syndrome. Two months later, there was minimal improvement in hair loss, and she was treated with fluocinonide 0.05% solution daily for 2 weeks alongside oral minoxidil. Triamcinolone 0.1% lotion was added a month later due to the patient's perceived lack of response to treatment. In February 2024, the patient presented to our clinic with little improvement in hair loss after over a year on this treatment regimen and was prescribed ruxolitinib 1.5% cream twice daily in combination with oral minoxidil. Spironolactone, fluocinonide, and triamcinolone were discontinued. Due to the presence of a TA component, she was also counseled on hair care practices to reduce hair loss, including avoiding tight hairstyles, excessive heat styling, and trauma to the scalp. After 6 months of therapy, there was significant improvement in hair loss, with regrowth in both the vertex and bilateral temporal regions of TA (Fig 1, B-F) and no reported adverse effects from ruxolitinib. We attribute our patient's hair regrowth primarily to the use of topical ruxolitinib, as our patient had been on oral minoxidil for the prior 1.5 years.

### Spironolactone for people age 70 years and older with osteoarthritic knee pain: a proof-of-concept trial [^114NtyR9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Possibly the 25‐mg dose of spironolactone was insufficient. However this dose was used in our previous trial, which significantly improved quality of life (using the same EQ‐5D 3L tool) 6, and the same dose is used to prolong life in heart failure 12; the 25‐mg dose in heart failure has been shown to both increase cortisol levels 13 and reduce markers of collagen turnover 14. A larger dose would have increased the likelihood of adverse effects, including raised potassium and creatinine levels, and of gynecomastia in men. The 12‐week duration of treatment was selected for practical and pragmatic reasons. A longer duration of therapy may have been necessary, but the lack of any signal of efficacy in the current study does not lend support to this idea. Furthermore, in our original trial a signal of change in EQ‐5D 3L score was evident after 10 weeks of spironolactone, when the between‐group difference in change from baseline was 0.04 (−0.03 to 1.11; P = 0.22) 6. The major difference between the 2 study populations was self‐reported physical disability in the former study, and specific selection for symptomatic OA of the knee in this study. Study populations in both trials were similar in terms of baseline age, sex, weight, social deprivation, EQ‐5D utility score, and EQ‐5D VAS score.

The study has a number of strengths. Recruitment strategies were efficient, with the target number of 86 participants randomized in the preplanned target 12‐month period. Adherence was exemplary, the dropout rate was low, and treatment was well tolerated. This study confirms the safety of 25 mg spironolactone daily in this specific older population with OA. The mean age of participants was 77 years, and there was no upper age limit; this lack of a limit contrasts with around 25% of OA‐related trials, which did impose upper age limits 15, a practice that is increasingly untenable. As most older people are multimorbid, the prospect of a safe, established medication with pleiotropic therapeutic effects is an attractive one. Spironolactone improves outcomes in heart failure and has effects on many cell types, independent of its binding to mineralocorticoid receptors. One drug that could safely treat more than one condition would be a major advance in reducing treatment burden. This proof‐of‐concept study found no evidence to support the further evaluation of spironolactone for older people with knee pain due to OA.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116fKFjS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — justification for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist selection emphasizes that, despite legitimate concerns about spironolactone tolerability, there is no scientific basis from efficacy studies to recommend an alternative MRA as first-line therapy to replace spironolactone, while shared decision making allows for use of a non-spironolactone MRA where desired.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115rjoFX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) medical therapy — mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) selection: In individuals with primary aldosteronism (PA) receiving PA-specific medical therapy, we suggest spironolactone over other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) due to its low cost and widespread availability (2 | ⊕⊕OO). The recommendation is supported by evidence that a systematic review identified 7 randomized controlled trials (n = 229) and 1 comparative observational study (n = 188); meta-analysis concluded that eplerenone, compared with spironolactone, was associated with a higher number and dosage of antihypertensive agents, with no statistically significant differences in achieving BP control, control of hypokalemia, and SBP level. Regarding tolerability, spironolactone has far greater ability to block androgen action and affect progesterone action than eplerenone, and indirect data show male gynecomastia incidence 7.9% vs 0.6% among placebo users (OR: 8.39 [5.02–13.99]) and relative odds for male gynecomastia of 8.44 (3.9–18.2) for spironolactone vs 0.77 (0.31–1.88) for eplerenone.

### An anti-hair loss treatment in the management of mild androgenetic alopecia: results from a large, international observational study [^115XeVfr]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

Detailed demographic and baseline data are provided in Table 1. Overall, questionnaires from 527 subjects were collected. Only data from 357 subjects who did not use concomitantly other products to treat their AGA were evaluable for the statistical analysis of clinical efficacy. This was to assess the clinical efficacy of AC 5 alone. Data from the remaining subjects were not considered for analysis purposes. The main reasons for this were concomitant treatment of hair loss, insufficient treatment duration, and alopecia scores higher than I on the Ludwig scale or higher than four on the Hamilton‐Nordwood scale for men; moreover, for 14 subjects, questionnaires were incomplete. Other reasons were missing alopecia severity, inverted use of alopecia scales, wrong prescription; three subjects were aged less than 18 years. Overall, 59.9% (214/357) of subjects were women; the overall mean age was 33.6 ± 8.7 years. Duration of hair loss was 1.16 ± 1.70 years in women and 2.32 ± 2.73 years in men; overall mean duration was 1.62 ± 2.24 years. In total, 71.3% (176/247) of women had a Ludwig score of 1 and 40.8% (71/174) of men had a Hamilton Norwood score of 2. At inclusion, alopecia was progressive in 70.7% (251/355) of subjects more in men (83.3%, 115/138) than in women (62.7%, 136/217). Subjects applied AC5 for 82.9 ± 17.5 days; 94.8% (398/420) applied AC5 once daily while 5.2% (22/413) used it twice a day. Overall compliance was 95.9 ± 6.6%, with no notable difference between women and men. Dermatologists considered that hair loss had improved in 89.0% (315/354, CI95% [85.7; 92.2]) of subjects; it was somewhat better in women (92.5%, 196/212, CI95% [88.9; 96.0]) than in men (83.8%, 119/142, CI95% [77.7; 89.9]). The impact of AC5 on the subjects' hair quality was rated by the investigators as satisfactory or highly satisfactory for 92.4% (329/356, CI95% [89.7; 95.2]) of all subjects. It was slightly higher in women (94.4%, 202/214, CI95% [91.3; 97.5]) than in men (89.4%, 127/142, CI95% [84.4; 94.5]). Overall, 96.7% (59/61) of the investigators were satisfied with the benefit of AC5 in reducing the subjects' hair loss; all were satisfied with AC5 in daily clinical practice. A total of 98.4% (60/61) recommended AC5 for further use. AC5 met the subject's expectations in 89.0% (315/354, CI95% [85.7; 92.2]) with slightly more women (91.0%, 193/212, CI95% [87.2; 94.9]) than men (85.9%; 122/142; CI95% [80.2; 91.6]). Detailed results for subject rating are provided in Figure 1. The mean subject satisfaction score on the VAS scale was 7.9 ± 1.7; the difference to the average value (5 on the scale from 0 to 10) was significant (p < 0.0001). Mean satisfaction was slightly higher in women (8.0 ± 1.7, p < 0.0001) than in men (7.8 ± 1.7, p < 0.0001). Tolerability was rated good to very good by 98.6% (502/509, CI95% [97.6; 99.6]) of all subjects.

### Hypertension: sex-related differences in drug treatment, prevalence and blood pressure control in primary care [^114oUztp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Mineral-receptor antagonists

Mineral-receptor antagonists (MRA) do not constitute a first-line treatment in hypertension, but are important therapeutic tools in resistant hypertension, primary aldosteronism, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and in the potassium-wasting tubulopathies of Bartter and Gitelman syndromes. Hypertension guidelines recommend MRA in resistant hypertension, where they provide twice the systolic blood pressure reduction of alpha blockers and beta blockers.

The antiandrogenic effects of spironolactone can also be harnessed in women with androgen-dependent conditions like acne and hirsutism in polycystic ovary syndrome and androgenetic alopecia, when combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives do not suffice. Spironolactone is also used in high doses to suppress testosterone secretion in the treatment of transgender women (male-to-female). Gynecomastia may occur in men treated with spironolactone, due to its antiandrogenic effects. The risk is dose-dependent and virtually all men treated with high doses of spironolactone per day will develop gynecomastia. Eplerenone, which is not antiandrogenic, can be used instead. In pregnancy it is advisable to avoid spironolactone, which may cause feminization of a male fetus, and opt for the safer eplerenone, if an MRA is considered necessary.

Beta blockers

Despite not being a first-line treatment in hypertension, beta blockers are frequently used in patients with hypertension. In part, perhaps, because of tradition but also because of their important role in treating manifest, hypertension-related heart diseases such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation. Beta blockers are less effective in preventing stroke than the first-line drugs. In the absence of ischemic heart disease, heart failure or atrial fibrillation, consequently, beta blockers are recommended only when blood pressure targets are not attained using first-line antihypertensive drugs and MRA. The antihypertensive effect of beta blockers in resistant hypertension is less than half than that of MRA.

Beta blockers also constitute a first-line, preventive treatment of episodic migraine. Labetalol, a combined alpha and beta blocker, is considered a safe treatment option when treating pregnancy-related hypertension. Beta blockers are associated with a slight increase in sexual dysfunction in both sexes and with erectile dysfunction in men.

14.2 Hypertension

Studies of the treatment of hypertension were conducted with a formulation of spironolactone that is not therapeutically equivalent to spironolactone oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In a study in 24 patients with essential hypertension, of which only eight completed study assessments, the average BP systolic lowering was 10 mmHg and 20 mmHg for the 25 mg and 100 mg doses of spironolactone, respectively. Doses > 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

Spironolactone and PATHWAY-2

In patients with resistant hypertension, the option of adding a fourth antihypertensive drug has been investigated. The crossover trial PATHWAY-2 recently showed spironolactone to be superior to placebo as an add-on in patients with resistant hypertension who had been identified by renin profiling as potential responders to the therapy. Despite the positive results from PATHWAY-2, the Expert Group has discussed whether these results should prompt adding spironolactone as a fourth line treatment in the management of resistant hypertension to define a trial population for device-based proof of concept studies. In the PATHWAY-2 trial, patients were on a low-dose of bendroflumethiazide, a drug less effective than chlorthalidone or indapamide, which may have favoured the BP response to spironolactone; BP response was not analysed per aldosterone levels, body mass index or BP at baseline; the short time (6 weeks) of exposure to the maximum dose of spironolactone (50 mg/d) was insufficient for an accurate assessment of the long-term tolerability of this drug; and there are no data on efficacy and safety in patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 since they were excluded from the trial. Moreover, in clinical practise spironolactone has a challenging tolerability profile with higher rates of intolerance than in PATHWAY-2, including gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction, which may cause treatment interruption or termination at the request of the healthcare provider or patient. Indeed, an unexpectedly low rate of side effects occurred in the PATHWAY-2 study, possibly because of the relatively short treatment duration.

Based on these reservations, the European Expert Group felt that there is no need to mandate failure to control BP on spironolactone as an inclusion criteria for resistant hypertension patients in a proof-of-concept trial of device-based hypertension therapies.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112BdEua]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Clinical hyperandrogenism — evaluation and assessment specify that the presence of hirsutism alone should be considered predictive of biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults, while healthcare professionals could recognize that female pattern hair loss and acne in isolation (without hirsutism) are relatively weak predictors of biochemical hyperandrogenism. A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism, and healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact and should consider the reporting of unwanted excess hair growth and/or female pattern hair loss as being important. A modified Ferriman Gallwey score (mFG) of 4–6 should be used to detect hirsutism, and healthcare professionals should consider that the severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity but the prevalence appears similar across ethnicities. For clinical scoring, healthcare professionals should be aware that standardized visual scales are preferred when assessing hirsutism and should consider the Ludwig or Olsen visual scales for female pattern hair loss; they should note that only terminal hairs need to be considered in defining hirsutism and these can reach > 5 mm if untreated, and note that new-onset severe or worsening hyperandrogenism requires further investigation and that clinical signs should be monitored for improvement or treatment adjustment during therapy.

### Finasteride (Propecia) [^112YF5uZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients who switched from placebo to PROPECIA (n = 425) had a decrease in hair count at the end of the initial 12-month placebo period, followed by an increase in hair count after 1 year of treatment with PROPECIA. This increase in hair count was less (56 hairs above original baseline) than the increase (91 hairs above original baseline) observed after 1 year of treatment in men initially randomized to PROPECIA. Although the increase in hair count, relative to when therapy was initiated, was comparable between these two groups, a higher absolute hair count was achieved in patients who were started on treatment with PROPECIA in the initial study. This advantage was maintained through the remaining 3 years of the studies. A change of treatment from PROPECIA to placebo (n = 48) at the end of the initial 12 months resulted in reversal of the increase in hair count 12 months later, at 24 months (see Figure 1 below).

At 12 months, 58% of men in the placebo group had further hair loss (defined as any decrease in hair count from baseline), compared with 14% of men treated with PROPECIA. In men treated for up to 2 years, 72% of men in the placebo group demonstrated hair loss, compared with 17% of men treated with PROPECIA. At 5 years, 100% of men in the placebo group demonstrated hair loss, compared with 35% of men treated with PROPECIA.

### Effect of spironolactone on blood pressure in subjects with resistant hypertension [^1118jLbr]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is recommended as fourth-line therapy for essential hypertension despite few supporting data for this indication. We evaluated the effect among 1411 participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm who received spironolactone mainly as a fourth-line antihypertensive agent for uncontrolled blood pressure and who had valid BP measurements before and during spironolactone treatment. Among those who received spironolactone, the mean age was 63 years (SD: ± 8 years), 77% were men, and 40% had diabetes. Spironolactone was initiated a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range: 2.0 to 4.4 years) after randomization and added to a mean of 2.9 (SD: ± 0.9) other antihypertensive drugs. The median duration of spironolactone treatment was 1.3 years (interquartile range: 0.6 to 2.6 years). The median dose of spironolactone was 25 mg (interquartile range: 25 to 50 mg) at both the start and end of the observation period. During spironolactone therapy, mean blood pressure fell from 156.9/85.3 mm Hg (SD: ± 18.0/11.5 mm Hg) by 21.9/9.5 mm Hg (95% CI: 20.8 to 23.0/9.0 to 10.1 mm Hg; P < 0.001); the BP reduction was largely unaffected by age, sex, smoking, and diabetic status. Spironolactone was generally well tolerated; 6% of participants discontinued the drug because of adverse effects. The most frequent adverse events were gynecomastia or breast discomfort and biochemical abnormalities (principally hyperkaliemia), which were recorded as adverse events in 6% and 2% of participants, respectively. In conclusion, spironolactone effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension uncontrolled by a mean of approximately 3 other drugs. Although nonrandomized and not placebo controlled, these data support the use of spironolactone in uncontrolled hypertension.

### Female pattern hair loss and androgen excess: a report from the multidisciplinary androgen excess and PCOS committee [^114R2EjR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the current state of knowledge and provide evidence-based recommendations that could be valid for all specialists taking care of female pattern hair loss (FPHL), a common form of hair loss in women that is characterized by the reduction of hair density in the central area of the scalp, whereas the frontal hairline is generally well conserved.

Participants

An expert task force appointed by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, which included specialists from dermatology, endocrinology, and reproductive endocrinology.

Design

Levels of evidence were assessed and graded from A to D. Peer-reviewed studies evaluating FPHL published through December 2017 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion/exclusion of the published papers were agreed on by at least two reviewers in each area and arbitrated by a third when necessary.

Conclusions

(i) The term "female pattern hair loss" should be used, avoiding the previous terms of alopecia or androgenetic alopecia. (ii) The two typical patterns of hair loss in FPHL are centrifugal expansion in the mid scalp, and a frontal accentuation or Christmas tree pattern. (iii) Isolated FPHL should not be considered a sign of hyperandrogenism when androgen levels are normal. (iv) The assessment of patients with FPHL is primarily clinical. (v) In all patients with FPHL, assessment of a possible androgen excess is mandatory. Measurement of vitamin D, iron, zinc, thyroid hormones, and prolactin are optional but recommended. (vi) Treatment of FPHL should start with minoxidil (5%), adding 5α-reductase inhibitors or antiandrogens when there is severe hair loss or hyperandrogenism.

### Finasteride treatment of female pattern hair loss… [^116m3vu8]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective To evaluate the efficacy of oral finasteride therapy associated with an oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in premenopausal women with female pattern hair loss. Setting Outpatient consultation for hair disorders at the Department of Dermatology, University of Bologna. Patients and Intervention. Thirty-seven women with female pattern hair loss were treated with oral finasteride, 2. 5 mg/d, while taking an oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using global photography and the hair density score from videodermoscopy. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess patient evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Results At 12-month follow-up, 23 of the 37 patients were rated as improved using global photography. No improvement was recorded in 13 patients.

One patient experienced worsening of the condition. There was a statistically significant increase in the hair density score in 12 patients. No adverse reactions to the drug were reported. Conclusions Sixty-two percent of the patients demonstrated some improvement of their hair loss with the use of finasteride, 2. 5 mg/d, while taking the oral contraceptive. It is unclear whether the success was due to a higher dosage of finasteride or to its association with the oral contraceptive containing drospirenone, which has an antiandrogenic effect. Further studies are necessary to understand which patterns of female pattern hair loss respond better to this treatment. Female pattern hair loss, the most common form of hair loss, affects up to 50% of women during their life.

1 Although hair thinning in women with FPHL may be diffuse, 3 different clinical patterns have been described: the Christmas tree pattern, 2 the Ludwig pattern, 3 and the Hamilton pattern. 4 Patients who experience hair thinning complain of social anxiety and embarrassment. If left untreated, FPHL may be rapidly progressive. A controlled 12-month randomized trial9 compared the effects of cyproterone acetate, 52 mg/d, with 2% topical minoxidil in FPHL. All the patients took oral contraceptives. After 6 months of treatment, minoxidil was effective in women with a low body mass index and the absence of hyperandrogenism. Cyproterone was effective when other signs of hyperandrogenism were present and when body mass index was high. In a recent study, 10 treatment with oral antiandrogens produced hair regrowth in 35 of 80 women with FPHL.

This study showed no relationship between response to treatment and patient age, menopausal status, and serum hormone levels. Spironolactone and cyproterone acetate produced similar results. In a small 12-month randomized trial, 11 flutamide was reported to be effective at 250 mg/d and was better than cyproterone acetate, 50 mg/d, and finasteride, 5 mg/d. We report herein our experience with finasteride, 2. 5 mg/d, taken with an oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in 37 premenopausal women with FPHL. After providing informed consent, patients were prescribed finasteride, 2. 5 mg/d, and an oral contraceptive containing drospirenone, 3 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 30 μg. All 37 women had refused to apply topical minoxidil. No improvement was recorded in 13 patients. One patient experienced worsening of the condition despite treatment.

### Hair loss: common causes and treatment | AAFP… [^116rT5Jn]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

5 Women typically present with diffuse hair thinning of the vertex with sparing of the frontal hairline. Some women experience thinning over the lateral scalp. Common conditions that mimic androgenetic alopecia include thyroid disease, iron deficiency anemia, and malnutrition. Treatment is based on patient preference. Topical minoxidil is approved for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men. Hair regrowth is more robust at the vertex than in the frontal area, and will take six to 12 months to improve. 5 Treatment should continue indefinitely because hair loss reoccurs when treatment is discontinued. Minoxidil 2% solution is recommended for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in women. 6 Adverse effects include irritant and contact dermatitis. Finasteride, 1 mg per day orally, is approved to treat androgenetic alopecia in men for whom topical minoxidil has been ineffective.

Adverse effects of finasteride include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia. 7 Minoxidil and oral finasteride are the only treatments currently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia. Both of these drugs stimulate hair regrowth in some men, but are more effective in preventing progression of hair loss. Although there are a number of other treatments listed in various texts, there is not good evidence to support their use.
8. Figure 4 4). Nail pitting is also associated with alopecia areata. Treatment for adults with less than 50% of scalp involvement is intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injected intradermally using a 0. 5-inch, 30-gauge needle. Maximal volume is 3 mL per session. 11 Treatment may be repeated every four to six weeks until resolution or for a maximum of six months. Local adverse effects include transient atrophy and telangiectasia.

Other therapies for the treatment of alopecia areata include topical mid- to high-potency corticosteroids, minoxidil, anthralin, immunotherapy, and systemic corticosteroids. 12 Currently available therapies often yield unsatisfactory results, and some clinicians rely on the high rate of spontaneous remission or recommend a hairpiece or wig if remission does not occur.
13. Tinea capitis requires systemic treatment; topical antifungal agents do not penetrate hair follicles. If the causative agent is a. Trichophyton species, treatment options include oral terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole, and griseofulvin. 15 These agents have similar efficacy rates and potential adverse effects, but griseofulvin requires a longer treatment course. Griseofulvin is the preferred treatment for infections caused by Microsporum species, but definitive studies are lacking.

15, 16 There are limited data about empiric treatment before culture results are available. Because griseofulvin may have lower cure rates in the treatment of T. tonsurans infections, it may not be as effective when used empirically. 15 All close contacts of patients with tinea capitis should be examined for signs of infection and treated, if necessary. Causative medications include retinoids, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, beta blockers, and antithyroid medications; discontinuation of oral contraceptive agents is another possible cause. 17 Patients with telogen effluvium may have symptoms of an underlying condition, but are often asymptomatic. They often notice clumps of hair coming out in the shower or in their hairbrush. They should be asked to recall any potential trigger two to five months before the onset of the condition. Examination of the scalp in patients with telogen effluvium typically shows uniform hair thinning.

### Alopecia in women… [^113Uvqpv]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

TREATMENT Minoxidil The currently preferred treatment for androgenetic alopecia is topically administered 2 percent minoxidil. 6, 8, 9 Minoxidil appears to affect the hair follicle in three ways: it increases the length of time follicles spend in anagen, it "wakes up" follicles that are in catagen, and it enlarges the actual follicles. The mechanism by which minoxidil effects these changes is not known. Vellus hairs enlarge and are converted to terminal hairs. In addition, shedding is reduced. In a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving 550 women 18 to 45 years of age, treatment with 2 percent minoxidil solution resulted in a higher hair count compared with placebo. 10 In another study, 11 50 percent of women treated with 2 percent minoxidil had at least minimal hair regrowth, and 13 percent had moderate regrowth.

No significantly increased benefit has been shown for the 5 percent minoxidil solution compared with the 2 percent solution. The primary side effect of topical minoxidil therapy is hypertrichosis. The hair growth is most often noted above the eyebrows, in the malar region, and on the lateral cheeks. It occasionally occurs above the upper lip and on the chin. Facial hypertrichosis has been reported to affect 3 to 5 percent of women treated with the 2 percent solution and more than 5 percent of women treated with the 5 percent solution. 8 Hypertrichosis disappears after a year, even with continued use of minoxidil, and remits within one to six months if treatment is stopped. 8 Bleaching of longer, darker hair is helpful cosmetically. Hair removal procedures are seldom necessary.

Explanations for the occurrence of this side effect include local intravascular spread of minoxidil, inadvertent manual transfer of the drug to the face, and transmission of residual minoxidil from pillows.
8. Spironolactone This drug is a weak competitive inhibitor of androgen binding to androgen receptors. It also decreases the synthesis of testosterone. For these reasons, orally administered spironolactone has been tried in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia, although questions remain about its usefulness. Spironolactone can be beneficial in women who also have hirsuitism. 13 However, the FDA has not labeled this drug for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia. TREATMENT Immunomodulating agents used in the treatment of alopecia areata include corticosteroids, 5 percent minoxidil, and anthralin cream. Topical immunotherapeutic agents are also used, although management regimens for these potent agents are challenging. Dermatology consultation or referral may be necessary. All of these agents stimulate hair growth but do not prevent hair loss. Moreover, they probably do not influence the course of the disease. Unless alopecia areata is mild and easily masked, psychologic distress can be extreme. Therefore, most physicians feel obliged to offer some form of treatment to affected patients. 17 A 0. 5-inch-long 30-gauge needle is used, and
0. 1 mL is injected into each site. Hair growth usually becomes apparent in four weeks. Treatment can be repeated every four to six weeks. Local skin atrophy, the predominant side effect, can be minimized by taking care to inject into the mid-dermis, rather than into the more superficial epidermis or the subdermal fat.
