## Question

Blood pressure is 127/72. Do I need ACE?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a blood pressure of 127/72 mmHg means they need to start an ACE inhibitor and, if not, what the appropriate management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify this blood pressure value against current guideline thresholds. Then, I should verify whether any compelling indications exist that would override usual thresholds. Next, I will review the evidence base for initiating pharmacotherapy at this level. Finally, I will outline the recommended next steps, including lifestyle measures, monitoring, and when medication would be indicated if the pressure rises or risk is high.

> Let me first confirm the classification. A reading of 127/72 mmHg is below the diagnostic threshold for hypertension in major contemporary guidelines. ACC/AHA 2017 and 2025 updates define hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg, so 127/72 mmHg is not hypertensive, though it sits in the "elevated" category rather than "normal" (< 120/80 mmHg), which still warrants lifestyle attention rather than drug therapy [^113BerDh].

> Wait, let me verify the staging nuance. I initially thought 127/72 might meet stage 1 criteria, but that would be incorrect. Stage 1 hypertension begins at 130/80 mmHg, so 127/72 mmHg is below stage 1 and does not meet criteria for pharmacologic treatment based on blood pressure alone in the absence of compelling indications [^113BerDh].

> Next, I should review whether any compelling indications would push me to start an ACE inhibitor anyway. Hold on, I should verify the classic scenarios: diabetes with albuminuria, chronic kidney disease with albuminuria, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and post–myocardial infarction are settings where ACE inhibitors confer outcome benefits beyond blood pressure lowering. However, none of those are described here, and the question is framed around an otherwise healthy adult with 127/72 mmHg, so there is no indication to start an ACE inhibitor on the basis of comorbidity in this case [^112V7dMV] [^116UzEA7] [^114BoJ5f] [^1156g94y].

> I will now examine the evidence base for pharmacotherapy at this level. The randomized data informing treatment decisions largely enrolls patients with baseline pressures ≥ 140/90 mmHg, and meta-analyses of ACE inhibitors demonstrate meaningful benefits in that hypertensive range; there is no evidence that starting an ACE inhibitor at 127/72 mmHg improves cardiovascular outcomes, and the balance of benefit versus risk is unfavorable in low-risk, nonhypertensive individuals [^115FQHjS] [^113VAgxz].

> Let me consider the risk continuum. I should confirm that while cardiovascular risk rises continuously from 115/75 mmHg upward, pharmacologic treatment thresholds are set where net clinical benefit is demonstrated; at 127/72 mmHg, the absolute risk is typically low to moderate, so the number needed to treat with medication would be very high and adverse effects like cough, hyperkalemia, and renal function changes could outweigh benefits without clear indications [^115mzSSA] [^114BoJ5f].

> Next, I should review what to do now. Lifestyle modification is the appropriate first-line approach at this level: sodium restriction toward < 1,500–2,300 mg/day, weight optimization, regular aerobic activity, moderation of alcohol, and adoption of dietary patterns like DASH; these measures reduce incident hypertension and lower cardiovascular risk even when blood pressure is not yet hypertensive [^113BerDh] [^115kXELK].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence. Out-of-office blood pressure assessment with home monitoring or ambulatory monitoring helps confirm the true baseline and detect white-coat effects; repeating measurements over several visits before labeling someone as hypertensive is standard, and home or ambulatory averages are more predictive of outcomes than isolated clinic readings [^115c9uEN].

> I need to ensure I address when medication would become appropriate. If repeated measurements show persistent ≥ 130/80 mmHg, then stage 1 hypertension is present and treatment decisions should incorporate cardiovascular risk. In higher-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension, initiating a single first-line agent is reasonable, whereas in lower-risk stage 1 patients, a trial of lifestyle therapy for 3–6 months before medication is acceptable, and stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) generally warrants initiation of therapy, often as two complementary agents if ≥ 20/10 mmHg above goal [^113BerDh] [^115GPRbD].

> But wait, what if diabetes or CKD were present? I should double-check that nuance: in diabetes or CKD with albuminuria, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred due to kidney and cardiovascular benefits, and thresholds for treatment are lower in high-risk phenotypes; however, that is not the scenario described here, so it does not change the current recommendation for this 127/72 mmHg case [^112V7dMV] [^116UzEA7].

> Final check and bottom line: 127/72 mmHg is not hypertension and does not meet criteria for starting an ACE inhibitor. The correct course is lifestyle modification and periodic monitoring, with pharmacotherapy considered only if blood pressure persists at or above 130/80 mmHg or if compelling indications emerge, in alignment with ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidance [^113BerDh] [^1175p4Lu].

---

No, a blood pressure of 127/72 mmHg is **not an indication** to start an ACE inhibitor. This reading is below the threshold for hypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg) [^113BerDh], so medication is not recommended unless there is a **compelling indication** such as diabetes with albuminuria, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease [^112V7dMV] [^116UzEA7]. The priority is **lifestyle measures** (DASH, sodium restriction, weight loss, exercise, alcohol moderation) and periodic BP monitoring [^113BerDh]. If BP rises to ≥ 130/80 mmHg or compelling indications arise, then consider pharmacotherapy based on current guidelines [^111kNc8j].

---

## Classification of blood pressure

According to the **2025 AHA/ACC/AANP guidelines**, the following categories apply to adults:

| **Category** | **Systolic bp (mmhg)** | **Diastolic bp (mmhg)** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal | < 120 | and < 80 |
| Elevated | 120–129 | and < 80 |
| Hypertension stage 1 | 130–139 | or 80–89 |
| Hypertension stage 2 | ≥ 140 | or ≥ 90 |

---

A BP of 127/72 mmHg is **classified as elevated** — above normal but below the threshold for hypertension — and does not meet criteria for pharmacologic treatment on the basis of BP alone [^113BerDh].

---

## Indications for ACE inhibitor therapy

ACE inhibitors are **primarily indicated** for the following cardiovascular and renal conditions:

- **Heart failure**: Reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [^114BoJ5f].
- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Especially with albuminuria [^116UB6wg].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: With albuminuria or CKD [^112W9t9b].
- **Post-myocardial infarction**: With left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure [^114BoJ5f].
- **Hypertension**: Particularly when associated with diabetes, CKD, or heart failure [^113Zr8D6].

In the absence of these conditions, ACE inhibitors are **not routinely indicated** for isolated elevated BP without hypertension.

---

## Risks and side effects of ACE inhibitors

ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but they carry potential risks and side effects, including:

- **Cough**: Persistent dry cough in approximately 5–20% of patients [^114BoJ5f].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Elevated potassium levels, particularly in patients with CKD or those taking potassium-sparing diuretics [^1132EAqg].
- **Angioedema**: Rare but potentially life-threatening swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat [^114BoJ5f].
- **Hypotension**: Especially in patients with low baseline BP or those on multiple antihypertensive agents [^114BoJ5f].
- **Renal impairment**: Risk of acute kidney injury, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or bilateral renal artery stenosis [^112YzKiJ].

Given these potential risks, **initiating ACE inhibitor therapy** in a patient with normal or only mildly elevated BP without compelling indications is not justified.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **lifestyle modifications** as the initial management strategy for elevated BP (120–129/ < 80 mmHg) [^113BerDh]. Pharmacologic therapy is **not recommended** unless compelling indications are present or BP progresses to hypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg) [^111kNc8j]. The **2025 AHA/ACC/AANP guidelines** recommend initiating pharmacologic therapy for stage 1 hypertension (130–139/80–89 mmHg) only if the patient has a high cardiovascular risk profile or compelling indications such as diabetes, CKD, or heart failure [^113BerDh]. For stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg), initiation of pharmacologic therapy is recommended for most patients, often with combination therapy [^111kNc8j].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ACE inhibitors may be considered despite normal BP

There are specific clinical scenarios where ACE inhibitors may be beneficial despite normal or mildly elevated BP, including:

- **Diabetes with albuminuria**: ACE inhibitors provide renal protection and reduce proteinuria [^111MARku].
- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: ACE inhibitors slow progression of renal disease, particularly in patients with albuminuria [^116UB6wg].
- **Heart failure**: ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF [^114BoJ5f].
- **Post-myocardial infarction**: ACE inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction [^114BoJ5f].

In these scenarios, the decision to initiate ACE inhibitor therapy is **based on compelling indications** rather than BP alone.

---

## Alternative management strategies

For patients with elevated BP (127/72 mmHg), the following **lifestyle modifications** are recommended:

- **Dietary changes**: Adopt the DASH diet, reduce sodium intake, and limit alcohol consumption [^112pVBce].
- **Physical activity**: Engage in regular aerobic exercise (at least 150 minutes per week) [^notfound].
- **Weight management**: Aim for a healthy body weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²) [^notfound].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended for cardiovascular health [^113QEU4y].
- **Regular monitoring**: Track BP regularly and adjust lifestyle measures as needed [^113BerDh].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

A BP of 127/72 mmHg is **not an indication** to start an ACE inhibitor. Current guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications and regular monitoring as the initial management strategy. ACE inhibitor therapy should be considered only if compelling indications are present — such as diabetes with albuminuria, CKD, heart failure, or post-myocardial infarction — or if BP progresses to hypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg).

Additional antihypertensive considerations in diabetes — continuation of renin–angiotensin system blockade, comparative cardioprotection, β‑blocker role, and need for multiple drugs. In people receiving ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, continuation of those medications as kidney function declines to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m² may provide cardiovascular benefit without significantly increasing the risk of end‑stage kidney disease; in the absence of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have not been found to afford superior cardioprotection compared with thiazide‑like diuretics or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. β‑Blockers are indicated in the setting of prior MI, active angina, or HFrEF but have not been shown to reduce mortality as blood pressure–lowering agents in the absence of these conditions. Multiple‑drug therapy is often required to achieve blood pressure goals, particularly in the setting of CKD in people with diabetes.

Antihypertensive Drugs

RAAS blockers [ACEI (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers)]: ACEI/ARBs remain the mainstay in the treatment of hypertension in a diabetes patient. They are not only beneficial in the prevention of new onset diabetes but also for albuminuria. They protect kidneys by reducing efferent glomerular arteriolar tone and inhibit mesangial growth factors. ARBs are equally efficacious, with fewer side effects, although in real-world settings may be better than ACEI in stroke prevention. On the basis of evidence from ALTITUDE and ONTARGET, the combined use of ACEI/ARB is discouraged. RAAS blockers have benefits beyond BP lowering, and the drug azilsartan, the newest addition to the sartan family, provides superior reduction of BP compared to olmesartan and telmisartan.
Diuretics: Chlorthalidone and indapamide are the two most frequently used diuretics in trials for the treatment of hypertension in diabetes. Their role in preventing heart failure in patients in ALLHAT makes them an important class in this group. They may be used as first-line or as add-on treatment. Concerns are monitoring of electrolytes and glucose.
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs): CCBs may be used as first-line treatment for hypertension in elderly patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. They may also be used in patients with intolerance to RAAS blockers. They may help in preventing stroke, but have lower efficacy than RAAS blockers.
Beta blockers (BB): This class of antihypertensives is used in diabetes patients with heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or tachycardia. Apart from these indications, BB are infrequently prescribed for diabetes patients. Concerns are masking hypoglycemia, impairing insulin sensitivity, weight gain, and deranged lipids.
Alpha blockers: These are used as third- or fourth-line agents, especially with prostate hyperplasia. They have less efficacy for stroke prevention and heart failure compared to other classes.
Aldosterone antagonists: Used in hypertension in diabetes, e.g. spironolactone, effective in low doses, and more effective when serum potassium is less than 4.5 mmol/L. Reduce albuminuria in diabetes patients, and renoprotection is independent of systemic hemodynamic alterations. Concerns are type 4 renal tubular acidosis, hyperkalemia, impotence, and gynecomastia. Finerenone is a newer non-steroidal antimineralocorticoid with a lesser side effect profile.
Combination of antihypertensives: Initiate combination therapy if not at goal or if initial BP is greater than 160/100. Since BP in many patients with hypertension and diabetes is uncontrolled, CCB/diuretics are used as an add-on to therapy. Combining ACEI/ARB with CCB may offer better renoprotection and reduced ankle edema. Patients with volume overload or obesity do well on ACEI/ARB and diuretic combination. Patients uncontrolled on either may benefit from the triple combination of ACEI/ARB plus CCB plus diuretic. Effective combinations may be with alpha blockers and beta blockers in cases of prostatic hyperplasia and heart failure, respectively. Some patients whose BP remains uncontrolled, or with resistant hypertension, may need the further addition of aldosterone antagonists.

### Time in therapeutic range: timely in hypertension therapeutics? [^114aBys8]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure ranks among the most important modifiable risk factors for premature death, and disability from hypertension mediated organ damage in the world. Many studies attest to the value of lifestyle adjustments and pharmacologic therapy in improving outcomes in patients with hypertension. Since blood pressure is a dynamic vitals sign, variability in visit-to-visit measurements is expected. While guidelines recommend a goal blood pressure, increasing attention is centered on how often a patient's blood pressure is found to be not only below the recommended goal value, but also how much of the time the blood pressure is below what is considered a safe lower goal threshold for blood pressure. In this Perspective we review a relatively new technique in addressing adequacy of blood pressure treatment, the time in therapeutic range, and provide examples supporting the clinical relevance of this novel metric.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — diuretics with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in DKD: Diuretics may potentiate the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in hypertensive patients with DKD. (Moderate) Between 60% and 90% of patients in studies of hypertension treatment in DKD used either thiazide-type or loop diuretics in addition to ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and in the ACE-inhibitor group of ALLHAT only 18% received a thiazide diuretic; other studies have shown that combining thiazide diuretics with agents that block the RAS is more effective than either alone for lowering blood pressure, and because most hypertensive patients with DKD require more than 1 antihypertensive agent to reach the target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg, it is the opinion of the Work Group that most of these patients should be treated with a diuretic in combination with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB to reach the target blood pressure.

Introduction

Resistant hypertension, defined as suboptimal blood pressure control despite treatment with at least three blood pressure-lowering drugs, is associated with a poor prognosis. This is caused by organ damage from prolonged exposure to suboptimal blood pressure control, and to the association with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is estimated to be at least 10% of treated hypertensive patients, which would equate to a potential prevalence of about 100 million people globally. There has been a growing perception that controlling blood pressure in resistant hypertension is beyond the reach of existing drug therapies, leading to the emergence of device-based therapies such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

International guidelines have converged on a definition of resistant hypertension as blood pressure that is not controlled to target despite treatment with three recommended blood pressure-lowering drugs at maximum tolerated doses — namely, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB; "A"), plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB; "C"), plus a thiazide-like diuretic ("D") — ie, A + C + D. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane CENTRAL register, for English language publications published up to July, 2015, for randomised controlled trials, and open and observational studies, of the drug treatment of resistant hypertension. This review was cross-referenced to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) hypertension clinical guideline review of drug treatment of resistant hypertension (CG 127) from 2011 and a recently published meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies of drug treatment of resistant hypertension with aldosterone antagonists. The meta-analysis suggested that spironolactone can be an effective blood pressure-lowering treatment for patients with resistant hypertension, however, the NICE review concluded that the quality of existing evidence was low. Three randomised controlled trials, of 135 patients (combined), had shown spironolactone to be superior to the placebo in reducing seated clinic blood pressure, when added to existing treatment for resistant hypertension. But there had been no previous randomised controlled trials comparing spironolactone with other blood pressure-lowering drugs to determine if it is the most effective treatment for resistant hypertension.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116K17V8]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV heart failure with prior guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) often necessitates careful de-escalation or adjustment during stalled or worsening inpatient trajectories: whereas SGLT inhibitors are likely to be widely tolerated and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) tolerated in patients with adequate kidney function, the addition of ARNIs/ACE inhibitors/ARBs or beta-blockers is generally not attempted; decreased dosages or discontinuation of these classes may be required to achieve adequate blood pressure and kidney function, and neurohormonal antagonists are usually discontinued when intravenous inotropic support or pressors are used. In the LIFE trial of high-risk patients with recent class IV symptoms, enrollment required class IV symptoms at screening or within the previous 3 months, with a minimum of 3 months of guideline-directed therapy with RAS inhibitors, beta-blockers, and MRAs or intolerance, plus 1 additional high-risk feature (most commonly recent inotropic therapy, 1 or more heart failure hospitalizations in the past 6 months, or LVEF < 0.25); the mean duration of heart failure before enrollment was 6 years with average LVEF 0.20, inclusion allowed a lower limit of SBP of 95 mm Hg, and patients could be receiving inotropic therapy. Before randomization, an ACE inhibitor or ARB had been taken by 72% of patients; the run-in period was 3 to 7 days at the lowest dose (24–26 mg of sacubitril/valsartan), which 18% of patients did not tolerate, and among randomized patients there was no trend seen for benefit of sacubitril/valsartan to reduce N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide levels, readmission, or death compared to valsartan.

ESC/ESH 2018 — Hypertension treatment in chronic kidney disease (CKD) outlines stepwise drug therapy beginning with dual combination angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) plus calcium channel blocker (CCB), or ACEi or ARB plus diuretic (or loop diuretic), then a triple combination ACEi or ARB + CCB + diuretic (or loop diuretic), and for resistant hypertension to add spironolactone (25–50 mg o.d.) or other diuretic, alpha‑blocker or beta‑blocker; beta‑blockers are to be considered at any treatment step when specifically indicated (e.g., heart failure, angina, post‑MI, atrial fibrillation, or younger women with, or planning, pregnancy). Use loop diuretics when eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.72 m², and note that a reduction in eGFR and rise in serum creatinine is expected with BP‑lowering therapy, but a rise in serum creatinine of > 30% should prompt evaluation for possible renovascular disease; CKD is defined as an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.72 m² and caution is advised regarding hyperkalaemia with spironolactone, especially when eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.72 m² or baseline K ≥ 4.5 mmol/L.

### Seventh report of the Joint National Committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure [^115mzSSA]. Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The National High Blood Pressure Education Program presents the complete Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120–139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80–89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (< 140/90 mm Hg, or < 130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

Initiation of blood pressure-lowering treatment by hypertension grade — it is recommended that in patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension, BP-lowering drug treatment should be initiated alongside lifestyle interventions; in patients with grade 1 hypertension at high risk or with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), drug treatment should also be initiated simultaneously with lifestyle interventions; in lower-risk grade 1 hypertension, drug treatment should be initiated after 3–6 months if BP is not controlled by lifestyle interventions alone; figure-based thresholds/actions include grade 1 hypertension BP 140–159/90–99 mmHg with immediate drug treatment in high or very high risk patients with CVD, renal disease or HMOD and drug treatment in low moderate risk patients without CVD, renal disease or HMOD after 3–6 months of lifestyle intervention if BP not controlled, grade 2 hypertension BP 160–179/100–109 mmHg with immediate drug treatment in all patients and aim for BP control within 3 months, and grade 3 hypertension BP ≥ 180/110 mmHg with immediate drug treatment in all patients and aim for BP control within 3 months.

Practical use of ACE inhibitors — selection, co-therapy, and cautions: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be prescribed to all patients with HF due to LV systolic dysfunction with reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or have been shown to be unable to tolerate these drugs, and treatment with an ACEI should not be delayed until resistance to other drugs is demonstrated. In general, ACEIs are used together with a beta-blocker, and ACEIs should not be prescribed without diuretics in patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention. ACEIs are often preferred over ARBs or direct-acting vasodilators because of the greater experience and weight of evidence in support of their effectiveness. Patients should not be given an ACEI if they have experienced life-threatening adverse reactions (angioedema or anuric renal failure) during previous exposure or if they are pregnant. ACEIs should be taken with caution when very low systemic blood pressure is present (systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), when serum creatinine is markedly increased (greater than 3 mg per dL), with bilateral renal artery stenosis, or when serum potassium is elevated (greater than 5.5 mmol per liter). Treatment with an ACEI should not be initiated in hypotensive patients who are at immediate risk of cardiogenic shock; such patients should first receive other forms of treatment for HF and then be re-evaluated for ACE inhibition once stability has been achieved.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Are there effects of renin-angiotensin system antagonists beyond blood pressure control? [^1136oiqA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recognized to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality, which is primarily attributed to their antihypertensive effects. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease through blood pressure-independent mechanisms mediated by angiotensin II. Thus, inhibiting the RAS with either an ARB or an ACE inhibitor may confer additional benefit in people with advanced nephropathy that cannot be explained totally by reductions in blood pressure. Preclinical evidence suggests that blood pressure lowering is not solely responsible for the organ and tissue protective effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, clinical studies evaluating effects on end organs and surrogate markers have shown that these agents have blood pressure-independent effects. There is also intriguing evidence that agents in the same class may differ in their effects on renal function despite similar blood pressure control. Support for blood pressure-independent effects comes from outcome studies. Agents evaluated in such studies and that appear to have effects independent of blood pressure lowering include irbesartan, losartan, ramipril, and telmisartan. Taken together, this body of evidence indicates that the clinical benefits of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with advanced nephropathy extend beyond blood pressure reduction. Therefore, although antihypertensive efficacy is of primary importance in choosing a treatment to provide cardiovascular and renal protection, consideration should be given to the effects of an agent that extend beyond blood pressure.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure target selection considerations — evidence synthesis and implementation notes state that the evidence to support an SBP goal < 130 mm Hg is strong and there is also evidence for an SBP goal < 120 mm Hg versus < 140 mm Hg, but this is based on a smaller, albeit growing, number of trials; adverse effects of intensive therapy such as hypotension, syncope, injurious falls, electrolyte abnormalities, and a reduction in eGFR are noted but are infrequent and usually mild. Overall, clinical trials provide strong support for an SBP goal < 130 mm Hg and, when feasible, SBP < 120 mm Hg, and generalization to practice underscores the need for careful monitoring of patients receiving intensive antihypertensive therapy. Individualization of the BP target may be required in patients who have difficulty tolerating treatment, have limited life expectancy, or other features warranting a less intensive approach, and clinical judgment and shared decision‑making are appropriate with careful monitoring for adverse consequences. Achievement of target BP should be based on an average of ≥ 2 readings at ≥ 2 visits, not on an individual BP measurement. For adults with hypertension who are not at high risk for CVD, on balance an SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg seems reasonable, and shared decision‑making by clinicians, patients, and caregivers for BP goals should be utilized when the patient has a limited life expectancy or is institutionalized due to high burden of frailty or comorbidity with limited life expectancy. In adults at high risk for CVD, 8 trials compared an SBP target < 130 mm Hg to a higher SBP and a meta‑analysis that included 7 of these trials found significant reductions in CVD and all‑cause mortality with SBP < 130 mm Hg.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: beyond the ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-II receptor blocker combination [^1154tDky]. American Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), an important regulator of blood pressure as well as fluid and electrolyte balance, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Blockade of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II (ANG-II) receptor blockers (ARBs) lowers blood pressure, decreases morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, and decreases proteinuria and the rate of decline in renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although these drugs are highly effective and are widely used in the management of cardiovascular and kidney diseases, current treatment regimens with ACEIs and ARBs may not completely suppress the RAAS. Combinations of ACEIs and ARBs have been shown to be superior to either agent alone for some, but certainly not all, composite cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. With the growing appreciation of the role of aldosterone in the pathogenesis of cardiorenal diseases and the recent approval of the direct renin inhibitor (DRI), aliskiren, additional combination strategies have emerged that may offer novel ways to more fully suppress the RAAS. This review examines what is presently known about ACEI/ARB combination therapy and explores alternative combination strategies that include DRIs and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRBs).

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP < 130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

Resistant hypertension in diabetes — definition, evaluation, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use. "Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite a therapeutic strategy that includes appropriate lifestyle management plus a diuretic and two other antihypertensive drugs with complementary mechanisms of action at adequate doses". "People with diabetes and confirmed resistant hypertension should be evaluated for secondary causes of hypertension, including primary hyperaldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea". Recommendation 10.14 states: "Individuals with hypertension who are not meeting blood pressure goals on three classes of antihypertensive medications (including a diuretic) should be considered for MRA therapy. A" "MRAs, including spironolactone and eplerenone, are effective for managing resistant hypertension after confirming resistance during existing treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, thiazide-like diuretic, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (88)". "In addition, MRAs reduce albuminuria in people with diabetic nephropathy (89–91)". "However, adding an MRA to a treatment plan that includes an ACE inhibitor or ARB may increase the risk for hyperkalemia, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring for serum creatinine and potassium in these individuals, and long-term outcome studies are needed to better evaluate the role of MRAs in blood pressure management".

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — blood pressure (BP) targets and renin–angiotensin system therapy: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and in SPRINT intensive BP treatment with mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg versus standard treatment with mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP < 130 mm Hg. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD when albuminuria is moderate or severe (≥ 30 mg/g) and may be considered for lower level albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) based on expert opinion; these recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD, and ACEI or ARB is also appropriate for less-severe CKD (stage 1 or 2) when moderate or severe albuminuria is present. Supporting data include an analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials finding an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality and a meta-analysis of CKD subsets from 18 trials where more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality; while < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses support SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance benefits and risks. With ACEI/ARB therapy, these agents reduce intraglomerular pressure and may cause a transient dip in eGFR up to 30%; this short-term decline is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEI or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEI or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation; ACEI or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/ min/1.73 m², and the combined use of an ACEI and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Abstract… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. HEART FAILURE ACEIs are associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. ACEIs and ARBs reduce proteinuria and decrease progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with proteinuria.

DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 45 ACEIs or ARBs should be used in patients with proteinuria, including those with diabetes. In patients with diabetes who do not have proteinuria, there is no benefit in using an ACEI or ARB compared with a CCB or thiazide diuretic. 5, 6 A meta-analysis showed that ACEIs — but not ARBs — reduce the incidence of doubling of the serum creatinine level in patients with diabetes, but they do not affect progression to end-stage renal disease. 46 Another meta-analysis showed that ACEIs are superior to ARBs in reducing all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

47 The ACCOMPLISH trial showed that patients with diabetes who are treated with a combined ACEI/CCB have a lower risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events compared with those treated with a combined ACEI/thiazide diuretic.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients on the basis of postulated advantages for the reduction of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence). Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111MARku]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE inhibitors] and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) are widely used and have similar effectiveness as each other and other major drug classes on major cardiovascular events and mortality outcomes; ARBs are associated with significantly lower treatment discontinuation rates for adverse events than those of all other antihypertensive therapies, and similar rates to placebo. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be combined for the treatment of hypertension because there is no added benefit on outcomes and an excess of renal adverse events; dual combination of renin–angiotensin system blockers also led to premature cessation of a trial when aliskiren was combined with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in people with diabetes, and this result halted further research into the clinical utility of aliskiren for BP treatment. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce albuminuria more than other BP-lowering drugs and are effective at delaying the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic CKD.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^114ynicX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renin inhibitors (RIs) reduce blood pressure more than placebo, with the magnitude of this effect thought to be similar to that for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered as a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of RIs compared to ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension is unknown.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to August 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least four weeks follow-up in people with primary hypertension, which compared renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and reported morbidity, mortality, adverse events or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We include 11 RCTs involving 13,627 participants, with a mean baseline age from 51.5 to 74.2 years. Follow-up duration ranged from four weeks to 36.6 months. There was no difference between RIs and ACE inhibitors for the outcomes: all-cause mortality: risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.18; 5 RCTs, 5962 participants; low-certainty evidence; total myocardial infarction: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.39; 2 RCTs, 957 participants; very low-certainty evidence; adverse events: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; serious adverse events: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.64; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants; low-certainty evidence; and withdrawal due to adverse effects: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.06; 10 RTCs, 6008 participants; low-certainty evidence. No data were available for total cardiovascular events, heart failure, stroke, end-stage renal disease or change in heart rate. Low-certainty evidence suggested that RIs reduced systolic blood pressure: mean difference (MD) -1.72, 95% CI -2.47 to -0.97; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants; and diastolic blood pressure: MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.72; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants, to a greater extent than ACE inhibitors, but we judged this to be more likely due to bias than a true effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of hypertension, we have low certainty that renin inhibitors (RI) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors do not differ for all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. We have low to moderate certainty that they do not differ for adverse events. Small reductions in blood pressure with renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors are of low certainty. More independent, large, long-term trials are needed to compare RIs with ACE inhibitors, particularly assessing morbidity and mortality outcomes, but also on blood pressure-lowering effect.

### Management of stage 1 hypertension in adults with a low 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease: filling a guidance gap: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114jixjA]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading cause of worldwide cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Patients and clinicians dealing with hypertension have benefited from the evidence of event-based randomized controlled clinical trials. One result from those trials has been the development of evidence-based guidelines. The commitment to using evidence from these event-based randomized trials has been a cornerstone in the development of guideline treatment recommendations. However, in some situations, evidence from event-based trials is not available to guideline writers or clinicians for assistance in treatment decision making. Such is the case for the management of many patients with stage 1 hypertension. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide information complementary to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for the patient with untreated stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP/diastolic BP, 130–139/80–89 mmHg) with a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease < 10% who fails to meet the systolic BP/diastolic goal (< 130/80 mmHg) after 6 months of guideline-recommended lifestyle therapy. This statement provides evidence from sources other than event-based randomized controlled clinical trials and offers therapy options for consideration by clinicians.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes (type 2 diabetes [T2D]) with hypertension — treatment initiation thresholds, targets, and drug classes are specified as follows: In adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at an SBP of ≥ 130 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 130 mm Hg, with encouragement to achieve an SBP < 120 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. In adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at a DBP of ≥ 80 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 80 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. In adults with T2D and hypertension, all first-line classes of antihypertensive agents (ie, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting CCB, ACEi, and ARB) are useful and effective for BP lowering. In adults with diabetes and hypertension, ACEi or ARB are recommended in the presence of CKD as identified by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/g.

### Hypertension mega-trials with cardiovascular end points: effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [^116rL48k]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has a pivotal role in the short- and long-term regulation of blood pressure through its principal mediator, angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) decrease the deleterious effects of angiotensin II on the vasculature and heart, but have different mechanisms of action. Although the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is equivalent to that of most other antihypertensive agents, emerging data suggest that these drug classes may have a greater effect on decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in specific patient populations.

Methods

We reviewed large (approximately ≥ 5000 patients) hypertension clinical trials using ACE inhibitors and ARBs and with cardiovascular morbidity/mortality end points.

Results

Six trials of ACE inhibitors and 5 trials of ARBs (3 completed, 2 ongoing) were selected for this analysis. Data from these hypertension mega-trials suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy. However, some trials showed important blood-pressure differences and are therefore partly inconclusive for particular drug effects.

Conclusions

Analysis of recently reported and ongoing mega-trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors may support the notion that their vasculoprotective properties confer greater benefit by virtue of their effects beyond blood-pressure reduction. Results from trials that will be completed in the next few years may provide further support of blocking the renin-angiotensin-system in cardiovascular protection in the management of hypertension.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^1179mz9q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

ACE inhibitors are widely prescribed for hypertension so it is essential to determine and compare their effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE).

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related systolic and/or diastolic BP lowering efficacy of ACE inhibitors versus placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2007), EMBASE (1988 to February 2007) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the BP lowering efficacy of fixed-dose monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor compared with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. WDAE information was collected from the trials.

Main Results

Ninety two trials evaluated the dose-related trough BP lowering efficacy of 14 different ACE inhibitors in 12 954 participants with a baseline BP of 157/101 mm Hg. The data do not suggest that any one ACE inhibitor is better or worse at lowering BP. A dose of 1/8 or 1/4 of the manufacturer's maximum recommended daily dose (Max) achieved a BP lowering effect that was 60 to 70% of the BP lowering effect of Max. A dose of 1/2 Max achieved a BP lowering effect that was 90% of Max. ACE inhibitor doses above Max did not significantly lower BP more than Max. Combining the effects of 1/2 Max and higher doses gives an estimate of the average trough BP lowering efficacy for ACE inhibitors as a class of drugs of -8 mm Hg for SBP and -5 mm Hg for DBP. ACE inhibitors reduced BP measured 1 to 12 hours after the dose by about 11/6 mm Hg.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no clinically meaningful BP lowering differences between different ACE inhibitors. The BP lowering effect of ACE inhibitors is modest; the magnitude of trough BP lowering at one-half the manufacturers' maximum recommended dose and above is -8/-5 mm Hg. Furthermore, 60 to 70% of this trough BP lowering effect occurs with recommended starting doses. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with ACE inhibitors because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — supportive evidence and ACEi/ARB monitoring: SPRINT data demonstrated adults with CKD and hypertension can be effectively and safely treated to SBP < 130 mm Hg, and meta-analyses have shown benefit of treating SBP < 130 mm Hg versus higher SBP targets. An analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials found that an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality; a meta-analysis of the CKD subsets from 18 trials reported that more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality. While < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses of trial data support an SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance the benefits of intensive BP-lowering with the risks of adverse events. ACEi or ARB reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may cause a transient decrease, or dip, in eGFR up to 30%, and this short-term decline in eGFR is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEi or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEi or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation. ACEi or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as an RCT found that discontinuation was not associated with a significant difference in long-term decrease in eGFR, and the combined use of an ACEi and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension — targets and renin–angiotensin system therapy: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and intensive BP treatment (mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg) versus standard treatment (mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg) reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP < 130 mm Hg. An ACEi or an ARB is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD in people with moderate or severe albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g) and may be considered for those with lower level albuminuria (< 30 mg/g), and these recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD. Supporting evidence includes analyses in CKD where an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality and a meta-analysis reporting that more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — initiation of treatment according to office blood pressure anchors therapy to hypertension grade, risk, age, and thresholds. Prompt initiation of BP-lowering drug treatment is recommended in patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension at any level of cardiovascular (CV) risk, simultaneous with the initiation of lifestyle changes. In patients with grade 1 hypertension, lifestyle interventions are recommended to determine if this will normalize blood pressure (BP); in patients with grade 1 hypertension at low–moderate-risk and without evidence of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), BP-lowering drug treatment is recommended if the patient remains hypertensive after a period of lifestyle intervention; and in patients with grade 1 hypertension and at high risk or with evidence of HMOD, prompt initiation of drug treatment is recommended simultaneously with lifestyle interventions. In fit older patients with hypertension (even if aged > 80 years), BP-lowering drug treatment and lifestyle intervention are recommended when systolic blood pressure (SBP) is ≥ 160 mmHg, while BP-lowering drug treatment and lifestyle intervention are recommended for fit older patients (> 65 years but not > 80 years) when SBP is in the grade 1 range (140–159 mmHg), provided that treatment is well tolerated. Antihypertensive treatment may also be considered in frail older patients if tolerated, and withdrawal of BP-lowering drug treatment on the basis of age, even when patients attain an age of > 80 years, is not recommended, provided that treatment is well tolerated. In patients with high–normal BP (130–139/85–89 mmHg), lifestyle changes are recommended and drug treatment may be considered when their CV risk is very high due to established cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary artery disease (CAD).

KDOQI commentary — blood pressure targets and renin–angiotensin system blockade in CKD: The guideline notes that the recommended target blood pressure for patients with CKD without albuminuria is ≤ 140/90 mm Hg, and the 2004 KDOQI guideline recommended ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for all patients with CKD, while the blood pressure goal of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for individuals with albuminuria is based on relatively low-quality evidence (2D). It further states that in patients with CKD, JNC 8 recommended initiation of treatment for blood pressures ≥ 140/90 mm Hg for patients of all ages without differentiation of targets by level of proteinuria. Additionally, the KDIGO guideline recommends an ACE inhibitor or ARB for patients with diabetes whose urinary albumin excretion is 30–300 mg/24 h and for all patients, with and without diabetes, whose urinary albumin excretion is > 300 mg/24 h, and it agrees to use an ACE inhibitor or ARB and not the combination due to accumulating evidence of harm with combination therapy.

### Excessive dietary sodium intake and elevated blood pressure: a review of current prevention and management strategies and the emerging role of pharmaconutrigenetics [^1117rxK2]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological interventions to control blood pressure

A common approach to controlling blood pressure is through pharmacological agents, as 76% of hypertensive individuals are taking medication to manage the disease. Most drugs achieve 10–15 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and 8–10 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure when used as monotherapy, although combination therapy has been found to be more effective in achieving target blood pressure control. For first-line antihypertensive agents in the UK, NICE recommends an ACE inhibitor or ARB (angiotensin-receptor blockers) for individuals less than 55 years old and a CCB for blacks or for those 55 years old or older. In the USA, a thiazide-type diuretic, ACE inhibitor, ARB or CCB are first-line antihypertensive agents for non-blacks; and a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB for blacks is recommended.

Despite many pharmacological agents available to help control blood pressure, 60% of hypertensive individuals treated with pharmacological agents do not have their blood pressure controlled adequately. Many factors can lead to this suboptimal control of blood pressure, including the lack of efficacy of antihypertensive agents in 40%–60% of patients. The practice of pharmacogenetics, which attempts to tailor drug therapies based on genetic information, is one way for predicting efficacy and/or prevent adverse outcomes when selecting antihypertensive medications. Currently, there are no validated pharmacogenetic guidelines endorsed by the FDA or the international Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), but there are promising genetic markers associated with specific antihypertensive drug classes and blood pressure response and/or cardiovascular outcomes (online supplementary table 1). Replication is currently needed for these genetic markers to investigate the robustness of the ability for these genetic makers to predict blood pressure response and/or cardiovascular outcomes in the presence of antihypertensive agents before clinical validation is achieved. It has been hypothesised that the model that will guide antihypertensive a gene selection will likely use a combination of genetic variants, with each variant exerting a modest effect size on relevant outcomes, instead of using the traditional model that associates a single genetic marker to an outcome in the presence of a prescribed drug. Therefore, drug prescribing of these agents will depend on the genetic make-up of the patient. The resulting guideline, like other CPIC guidelines, will translate pertinent genetic research into clear directions regarding which agents and doses are recommended based on genetic markers so that clinicians can implement the information directly into the drug prescribing process for their patients.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in patients with coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function ischemia management with accupril post-bypass graft via inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (IMAGINE) compared with the other major trials in coronary artery disease [^1168bkrd]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, independent from its effect on ventricular function and blood pressure, could affect the atherosclerotic process and reduce the incidence of ischemic events and its complications. Several large clinical outcome trials were designed to test this hypothesis: QUIET, HOPE, EUROPA, PEACE, and IMAGINE. The results of the PEACE study were recently reported, leaving the IMAGINE study as the last chapter in our efforts to evaluate the role of ACE inhibition in coronary artery disease with preserved left ventricular function. In this report, we compare these studies with respect to their methodology and patient population and analyze the unique nature of the last ongoing study, IMAGINE. The reported studies show that patients with coronary artery disease who are at low-to-moderate or high risk should receive an ACE inhibitor if tolerated. However, when the absolute risk of a patient decreases, and intensive contemporary management is given, with good control of risk factors, the absolute and perhaps relative benefits of an ACE inhibitor decrease and their routine use in these patients may not be warranted. The role of ACE inhibition started early post-coronary artery bypass graft in patients with preserved left ventricular function, and intensive contemporary management remains to be determined and should get answered by the IMAGINE study. Moreover, the IMAGINE population is not only a lower risk population than those enrolled in HOPE or EUROPA, but also the risk for this population is bimodal in nature (early post-revascularization inflammation and thrombosis vs long-term atherosclerosis progression) and may provide further insight into underlying mechanisms.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^115b7hoZ]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Gauging the Impact of the Recommended Risk-Based Strategy

Echoing, to some extent, the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the AHA Statement categorically exempts individuals with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (stage 2 hypertension) from formal risk assessment. The same exemption is extended to the BP range of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) for those with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or any individual with ongoing antihypertensive therapy. These groups are automatically designated as high risk.

With these exemptions, a formal risk assessment strategy applies to ≈23 million individuals, of whom around 2.5 million (equivalent to 1% of US adults) are projected to exceed the PREVENT risk threshold of > 7.5% for immediate pharmacological intervention (Figure 1). These rates are roughly consistent with the application of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines to European adults, where ≈1% to 4% would be recommended for treatment based on their predicted high cardiovascular risk and moderate BP elevation.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in HFrEF — use, dosing, and safety. The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for patients with prior or current symptoms of chronic HFrEF to reduce morbidity and mortality. ACE inhibitors should be started at low doses and titrated upward to doses shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials, and should be given with caution to patients with low systemic blood pressures, renal insufficiency, or elevated serum potassium (> 5.0 mEq/L). Angioedema occurs in < 1% of patients who take an ACE inhibitor; patients should not be given ACE inhibitors if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. ACE inhibitors also inhibit kininase and increase levels of bradykinin, which can induce cough in up to 20% of patients.

IgA nephropathy — evidence for cyclophosphamide/azathioprine regimens: A single-center trial compared a tapering dose of corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide for 3 months followed by azathioprine for a total of 2 years versus control in high-risk IgAN patients; these patients had a serum creatinine exceeding 1.47 mg/dL and at least a 15% increase within the preceding year, and heavy proteinuria. The active treatment group showed superior kidney survival (72% vs 6%) at 5 years, but there was no corticosteroid group comparison, ACE inhibitor/ARB use was not specified, and the blood pressure goal was high (< 160/90 mm Hg). Two RCTs comparing cyclophosphamide, dipyridamole, and warfarin versus control showed no benefit, and azathioprine combined with intravenous and oral corticosteroids for 6 months showed no benefit versus corticosteroids alone in adults.

Core drug treatment strategy for uncomplicated hypertension — initial therapy uses dual combination "ACEi or ARB + CCB or diuretic"; if further control is needed, step up to the triple combination "ACEi or ARB + CCB + diuretic", and for resistant hypertension add spironolactone (25–50 mg o.d.) or other diuretic, alpha-blocker or beta-blocker, with consideration of referral to a specialist centre for further investigation. Consider monotherapy in low risk grade 1 hypertension (systolic BP < 150mmHg), or in very old (≥ 80 years) or frailer patients. Consider beta-blockers at any treatment step, when there is a specific indication for their use, e.g. heart failure, angina, post-MI, atrial fibrillation, or younger women with, or planning, pregnancy; ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), CCB (calcium channel blocker), and o.d.

In 329 untreated patients aged < 80 years with systolic BP ≥ 150 mmHg, treatment was initiated with drug monotherapy in 32%, two-drug combination in 50%, and three drugs in 18%.

In 2350 treated hypertensives (75% of the overall population), mean systolic/diastolic BP was 140.2 ± 19.1/82.1 ± 11.8 mmHg. Mean duration of hypertension since initial diagnosis was 8.6 ± 6.9 years and treatment included on average 2.0 ± 0.9 antihypertensive drugs. Main drug classes administered in these patients were ARB monotherapy 18%, ARB/CCB 15%, ARB/thiazide 12%, ARB/CCB/thiazide 12%, ACEi monotherapy 7%, ACEi/CCB 4%, ACEi/thiazide (or thiazide-like) 3%, ACEi/CCB/thiazide-like 2%, CCB monotherapy 5%, beta-blocker monotherapy 4%, and other choices 18%. Single pill combinations were used in 85% of patients receiving combination therapy.

Among treated hypertensives aged < 65 years (N = 977), 79% had BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg (systolic and/or diastolic), whereas among those aged ≥ 65 years (N = 1373) 66% had BP ≥ 140/80 mmHg (Fig. 2). Treatment modification (dose increase, drug addition, use of fixed combinations, switch of drug to another within the same or other class) was decided in 53% of the treated hypertensives aged < 65 years with BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg, and in 62% of those ≥ 65 years with BP ≥ 140/80 mmHg. There were no significant differences in the types of treatment decisions per care of setting (primary care versus hospital centers).

Hypertension/Blood Pressure Control

Screening and diagnosis

Blood pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit. Patients found to have systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg should have blood pressure confirmed on a separate day. Repeat systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg confirms a diagnosis of hypertension. (C)

Goals

Patients with diabetes should be treated to a systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg. (C)
Patients with diabetes should be treated to a diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg. (B)

Treatment

Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mmHg may be given lifestyle therapy alone for a maximum of 3 months and then, if targets are not achieved, treated with addition of pharmacological agents. (E)
Patients with more severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) at diagnosis or follow-up should receive pharmacologic therapy in addition to lifestyle therapy. (A)
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². (C)
Multiple drug therapy (two or more agents at maximal doses) is generally required to achieve blood pressure targets. (B)
If ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, kidney function and serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. (E)
In pregnant patients with diabetes and chronic hypertension, blood pressure target goals of 110–129/65–79 mmHg are suggested in the interest of long-term maternal health and minimizing impaired fetal growth. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated during pregnancy. (E)

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — thresholds for initiating BP‑lowering drugs specify that pharmacological treatment is recommended for grade 2 or 3 hypertension at any cardiovascular (CV) risk level with lifestyle changes, while grade 1 hypertension management depends on risk, HMOD, and response to lifestyle; guidance also addresses older adults and high–normal BP. Drug treatments are recommended for grade 2 or 3 hypertension at any CV risk; for grade 1, lifestyle interventions are recommended to see if BP normalizes, drug treatment is recommended if low‑moderate risk without HMOD remains hypertensive after lifestyle, and prompt initiation with lifestyle is recommended when high risk or with HMOD; in fit older patients with hypertension, including those aged > 80 years, drugs and lifestyle are recommended when systolic BP (SBP) is ≥ 160 mmHg; in fit older patients > 65 years but not > 80 years, drugs and lifestyle are recommended when SBP is 140–159 mmHg if well tolerated; for high–normal BP (130–139/85–89 mmHg), lifestyle changes are recommended; withdrawal of drug treatment solely due to age, even at ≥ 80 years, is not recommended if treatment is well tolerated.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

Box 4 Hypertension

Recommendation 4.1

All children at risk of or diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) should have their blood pressure measured at least once a year (that is, at the same interval as healthy children) (evidence level C; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 4.2

Twenty-four-hour blood pressure on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is the preferred method for defining hypertension in children aged 5 years and older (evidence level C; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 4.3

In children with confirmed ADPKD, ABPM should be performed at least once from age 5 years (evidence level B; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 4.4

For children with ADPKD on antihypertensive medication, we suggest monitoring blood pressure control by regular home blood pressure measurements (evidence level C; recommendation level weak).

Recommendation 4.5

We suggest that children with ADPKD receive antihypertensive treatment if their blood pressure repeatedly exceeds the ninetieth percentile or is > 130/85 mmHg if age > 16 years (evidence level D; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 4.6

For treatment of hypertensive children with ADPKD, we suggest a target blood pressure below the seventy-fifth percentile or < 125/72 mmHg if age > 16 years (evidence level C; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 4.7

Lowering blood pressure below the fiftieth percentile or < 120/70 mmHg if age > 16 years may provide additional long-term benefit for hypertensive children with ADPKD (evidence level D; recommendation level weak).

Recommendation 4.8

We recommend using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers as first-line antihypertensive treatment in children with ADPKD who have hypertension and albuminuria (evidence level B; recommendation level moderate).

Recommendation 4.9

We suggest using ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers as first-line antihypertensive treatment in children with ADPKD who have hypertension without albuminuria (evidence level C; recommendation level moderate).

### Blood pressure in heart failure management and prevention [^1131i9rM]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a leading cause of heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases. Its role in the pathogenesis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) differs from that in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Moreover, rigorous blood pressure control may reduce the incidence of heart failure. However, once heart failure develops, prognosis is affected by blood pressure, which may differ between patients with and without heart failure. Therefore, the association between guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure and its uptitration must be considered for blood pressure management and should not be overlooked. Heart failure medications affect the blood pressure and efficacy per baseline blood pressure value. This review discusses the potential mechanisms by which hypertension leads to HFrEF or HFpEF, the impact of hypertension on incident heart failure, and the recommended approaches for blood pressure management in patients with heart failure. Comparison between patients with and without heart failure regarding blood pressure The association between CV events and SBP is linear in patients without heart failure; however, it becomes J-shaped or inverse linear in those with heart failure. The management of BP, including optimal BP or pharmacotherapy, differs between the two populations.

FIXED DRUG COMBINATION BENEFITS

More recently, the ACCOMPLISH trial provided overwhelming evidence that a combination of benazepril (ACE inhibitor) and amlodipine (calcium antagonist) was superior to a fixed combination of benazepril and hydrochlorthiazide in nondiabetic and diabetic patients, in spite of similar blood pressure reduction. The study was prematurely ended due to a pronounced difference in the composite end point of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (risk ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.72–0.90). The results resemble the benefit that was achieved with a similar ACE inhibitor/calcium antagonist therapy in the ASCOT trial.

For implementation, the work group notes it is "necessary to prescribe the highest tolerated, approved dose of ACEI or ARB therapy", and KDIGO "recommends monitoring for changes in serum creatinine and potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiation and escalation of therapy and discontinuing therapy if the creatinine increases by more than 30%", and also "recommends considering reduction or discontinuation of therapy in those with symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, and uremic symptoms". Additionally, "most patients with CKD require triple antihypertensive therapy with an ACEI or ARB in addition to a CCB and diuretic, as a single pill combination or as individual pills".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension — prevalence, targets, and treatment: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and despite this risk a majority of people with CKD have uncontrolled BP. As demonstrated in SPRINT, intensive BP treatment (mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg) versus standard treatment (mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg) reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP < 130 mm Hg and balances the benefits of intensive BP lowering with risks of adverse events. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD due to long-term kidney and CVD benefits in people with moderate or severe albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g) and may be considered for those with lower level albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) based on expert opinion. These recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD given limited data in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and ACEi or ARB is also appropriate for less-severe CKD (stage 1 or 2) when moderate or severe albuminuria is present.

ACEI indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

The second change is a target of < 140 over 90 mm Hg (instead of < 130 over 80 mm Hg) in patients with DM or chronic kidney disease. This change was based on multiple studies, including the ACtion to COntrol Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) BP trial, which demonstrated no significant benefit in the primary composite end point among patients treated to a SBP goal < 120 mm Hg compared with < 140 mm Hg, despite significant reductions in stroke. –

Patients diagnosed with hypertension should be encouraged to implement lifestyle changes including regular exercise, dietary sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol consumption, and weight loss, regardless of whether pharmacotherapy is needed. When initiating medical therapy, patients without chronic kidney disease can be started on an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker, a thiazide diuretic, or a calcium channel blocker. Alternatives for nonblack patients and those with chronic kidney disease include an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker; however, the combined use of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker should be avoided.

Most patients will require at least 2 medications to adequately control their BP. The JNC 8 committee recommends 3 strategies to help achieve BP goals: (1) maximize the dose of the initial medication, (2) add a second medication before reaching the maximal dose of the initial medication, or (3) simultaneously start 2 antihypertensive medications from different classes. Because it is important to achieve and maintain the BP goal, patients should be evaluated regularly, with adjustment and addition of medications as needed. If patients remain hypertensive despite adequate treatment with 3 medications or if there is a contraindication to treatment with any of the recommended first‐line antihypertensive agents, then medications from other classes can be used (eg, beta blocker or aldosterone antagonist) or the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist.

Because the JNC 8 recommendations do not address prehypertension, resistant hypertension, or secondary hypertension, it is reasonable to follow the prior JNC 7 guidelines or those from other international organizations.–

### Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^112HdZPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important.

Objectives

To compare the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs), in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a head-to-head manner, and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been the same in both study arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Nine studies with 11,007 participants were included. Of the included studies, five reported data on total mortality, three reported data on total cardiovascular events, and four reported data on cardiovascular mortality. No study separately reported cardiovascular morbidity. In contrast, eight studies contributed data on WDAE. Included studies were of good to moderate quality. There was no evidence of a difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.10), total cardiovascular events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19), or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13). Conversely, a high level of evidence indicated a slightly lower incidence of WDAE for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.8%, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 55 over 4.1 years), mainly attributable to a higher incidence of dry cough with ACE inhibitors. The quality of the evidence for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes was limited by possible publication bias, in that several studies were initially eligible for inclusion in this review, but had no extractable data available for the hypertension subgroup. To this end, the evidence for total mortality was judged to be moderate, while the evidence for total cardiovascular events was judged to be low by the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Our analyses found no evidence of a difference in total mortality or cardiovascular outcomes for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors, while ARBs caused slightly fewer WDAEs than ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy in these outcomes over placebo, our results cannot be used to extrapolate the same conclusion for ARBs directly, which have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials for hypertension. Thus, the substitution of an ARB for an ACE inhibitor, while supported by evidence on grounds of tolerability, must be made in consideration of the weaker evidence for the efficacy of ARBs regarding mortality and morbidity outcomes compared with ACE inhibitors. Additionally, our data mostly derives from participants with existing clinical sequelae of hypertension, and it would be useful to have data from asymptomatic people to increase the generalizability of this review. Unpublished subgroup data of hypertensive participants in existing trials comparing ACE inhibitors and ARBs needs to be made available for this purpose.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112V7dMV]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Recommendations for the treatment of confirmed hypertension in nonpregnant people with diabetes — initial blood pressure (BP) determines the number of agents and stepwise escalation. Initial BP ≥ 130/80 and < 150/90 mmHg — start one agent, whereas initial BP ≥ 150/90 mmHg — start two agents. One‑agent options include start ACEi or ARB or CCB† or diuretic‡; for two‑drug initiation, options include start two drugs from ACEi or ARB, CCB† or diuretic‡ or start ACEi or ARB and CCB† or diuretic‡. Assess BP management and adverse effects; if not meeting goal, add agent from complementary drug class (ACEi or ARB; CCB†; Diuretic‡), and for adverse effects, consider change to alternative medication (ACEi or ARB; CCB†; Diuretic‡). If not meeting goal on two agents and then not meeting goal or adverse effects using a drug from each of three classes, consider addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and refer to specialist with expertise in BP management; an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is suggested for coronary artery disease (CAD) or urine albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio 30–299 mg/g creatinine and is strongly recommended for urine albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine.

### Prehypertension – prevalence, health risks, and management strategies [^115kXELK]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Prehypertension (blood pressure 120–139/80–89 mmHg) affects ~25–50% of adults worldwide, and increases the risk of incident hypertension. The relative risk of incident hypertension declines by ~20% with intensive lifestyle intervention, and by 34–66% with single antihypertensive medications. To prevent one case of incident hypertension in adults with prehypertension and a 50% 5-year risk of hypertension, 10 individuals would need to receive intensive lifestyle intervention, and four to six patients would need to be treated with antihypertensive medication. The relative risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) is greater with 'stage 2' (130–139/85–89 mmHg) than 'stage 1' (120–129/80–84 mmHg) prehypertension; only stage 2 prehypertension increases cardiovascular mortality. Among individuals with prehypertension, the 10-year absolute CVD risk for middle-aged adults without diabetes mellitus or CVD is ~10%, and ~40% for middle-aged and older individuals with either or both comorbidities. Antihypertensive medications reduce the relative risk of CVD and death by ~15% in secondary-prevention studies of prehypertension. Data on primary prevention of CVD with pharmacotherapy in prehypertension are lacking. Risk-stratified, patient-centred, comparative-effectiveness research is needed in prehypertension to inform an acceptable, safe, and effective balance of lifestyle and medication interventions to prevent incident hypertension and CVD.

### New horizons for stroke prevention: PROGRESS and HOPE [^115eNWLX]. The Lancet: Neurology (2002). Medium credibility.

Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) act by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is catalysed by this enzyme. ACE inhibitors also prevent the breakdown of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor agent, and prevent the effects of angiotensin II, which include increase in blood pressure, peripheral vasoconstriction, and stimulation of aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex. Physiological and pathological studies have shown that ACE inhibitors have beneficial effects, such as increasing vascular compliance, regression of periarteriolar collagen area, improvement of coronary reserve, and regression of resistance-artery structure and left-ventricular hypertrophy. Information about the role of ACE inhibitors in stroke prevention has been limited. This review explores the epidemiological evidence for hypertension as a risk factor for stroke, a national guideline for blood-pressure control to reduce the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular disease, the findings of two recently published clinical trials on prevention of stroke and cardiovascular disease after administration of ACE inhibitors (PROGRESS and HOPE), and the implications of the findings for redefinition of future management of blood-pressure control for individuals at high risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. The PROGRESS and HOPE trials have shown that ACE inhibitors have an important role in the prevention of stroke and cardiovascular-disease events.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg) are recommended to start two first-line agents of different classes, ideally as a single-pill combination (SPC), to improve blood pressure control and adherence. In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiating therapy with a single first-line drug is reasonable with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve control. In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes hypertension targets and treatment recommend that AACE has set a specific BP goal for the majority of adults with T2D as < 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP goal of < 80 mm Hg, with a lower target considered for persons with micro- or macroalbuminuria, moderate/high risk for or with established ASCVD, peripheral vascular disease, or retinopathy, and recognition that some persons with T2D may not tolerate a goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Lifestyle therapy is part of initial management, as exercise several times per week is important because there are reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP with endurance and dynamic resistance training, and Mediterranean diets have been demonstrated to lower BP. Pharmacologic therapy specifies that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line therapies for HTN in persons with T2D, particularly in those with DKD; there is no additional benefit for coadministration of an ACEI and an ARB together, and combination may cause harm, an ARB can substitute for ACEI intolerance, and if the initial BP is > 150/100 mm Hg, dual therapy may need to be used at the outset.

In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm (3: Harm A). Pharmacologically, most patients require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control.

Classification and management of blood pressure for adults aged 18 years or older detail categories, lifestyle modification, and initial drug therapy. Normal is defined as systolic < 120 mm Hg and diastolic < 80 mm Hg with lifestyle modification to encourage. Prehypertension is 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications no antihypertensive drug is indicated. Stage 1 hypertension is 140–159 mm Hg systolic or 90–99 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is thiazide-type diuretics for most; may consider ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB, or combination. Stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is a 2-drug combination for most (usually thiazide-type diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB or β-blocker or CCB). With compelling indications, use drug(s) for the compelling indications, with other antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB) as needed. Treatment is determined by highest BP category. Treat patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes to BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Initial combined therapy should be used cautiously in those at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

Limited Evidence on Treatment Effects in Very Low-Risk Individuals

Another issue with the AHA statement is the extension of pharmacological treatment to those with an estimated 10-year risk of ≤ 7.5. The evidence for this recommendation is largely based on meta-analyses of BP-lowering trials, which have shown similar relative effects across a range of predicted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, in the referenced studies, the lowest risk category still had a 10-year CVD risk of about 10%. Direct evidence on the beneficial or harmful effects of BP-lowering therapy on clinical outcomes in low-risk individuals is currently lacking. Although the AHA/ACC Committee acknowledges this lack of evidence with a weaker recommendation for medical treatment (class 2b), it still raises a question around treatment efficiency. Treatment thresholds are most effectively set to target those with clear net clinical benefit, which will involve more intensive treatments being provided to those at higher risk. Treating low-risk individuals will inevitably result in smaller absolute risk reductions and higher numbers needed to treat, with potential implications for health care costs and patient motivation. This is illustrated in Figure 2 for hypothetical patients with differing predicted CVD risk, baseline BP, and expected BP reduction following therapy. In one scenario, an individual with stage 1 hypertension and a predicted CVD risk of 5% would, under the new guidelines, be recommended pharmacological treatment after 3 to 6 months of lifestyle modification. For such an individual, even with intensive BP-lowering therapy reducing systolic BP from 135 to 120 mm Hg, the numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 CVD event would be ≈70. A more modest BP reduction to 130 mm Hg would result in a numbers needed to treat of around 200. This illustrates that stratifying treatment decisions by both predicted risk and the anticipated intensity of BP reduction could facilitate more targeted identification of individuals most likely to benefit from therapy.

### Examining therapeutic goals: population versus individual-based approaches [^114A5eJG]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

In the individual patient, the goal of antihypertensive treatment is to lower the blood pressure (BP) to a level that minimizes the patient's risk of cardiovascular complications. However, most of our knowledge regarding what this level of BP should be is derived from population studies and large clinical trials. Population studies have shown that elevated BP is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and renal failure. Cardiovascular risk begins to increase when BP exceeds 115/75 mm Hg and doubles with each increment of 20 mm Hg in systolic BP and 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP. The clinical benefit of BP reduction in patients with hypertension is well established. Thus, patients with less severe elevations in BP (high-normal) are at increased risk. Patients with diabetes or proteinuria benefit from even more aggressive reductions in BP. Despite the well-established benefits of BP reduction, hypertension is still not well treated, underscoring the need for more aggressive detection and better management. Although data from large clinical trials have provided valuable information to help guide treatment, application of clinical trial results to individual patients is limited by the heterogeneity of patient populations with respect to patient risk, comorbidities, and differences in genetic and environmental background. Ultimately, the treatment decisions should be tailored to each patient, integrating as much information as possible concerning the patient's history, risk, pathophysiology, and lifestyle.

### What is normal blood pressure? [^115DwSgx]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Given the continuous relations of blood pressure to cardiovascular risk, any definition of high blood pressure is arbitrary, and based on thresholds at which there is clear evidence that treatment benefits outweigh potential risks. This review examines what constitutes optimal blood pressure.

Recent Findings

A recent report raised the possibility of an age- and sex-dependent threshold for risk associated with systolic blood pressure, questioning the use of a single threshold (such as 140/90 mmHg) for defining hypertension. Several subsequent studies have questioned this notion and reemphasized that lower blood pressure levels are associated with less morbidity and mortality even within the nonhypertensive range. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that a blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg is associated with minimal vascular mortality and likely constitutes optimal blood pressure. Such blood pressure levels are infrequent in westernized societies. The target blood pressure goal for treated hypertensives is higher at 140/90 mmHg but is infrequently achieved. Select individuals at high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease events and/or with specific conditions (notably diabetes, renal insufficiency and prior vascular disease) may benefit from blood pressure lowering below this threshold.

Summary

At a population level, a blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg seems optimal because it is associated with minimal vascular risk. Over half of all hypertensives do not have their blood pressure controlled underscoring the challenges facing health care providers. Efforts should be strengthened for the primary prevention of hypertension and the promotion of optimal blood pressure through lifestyle measures.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^114v3BKG]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines revising the diagnosis threshold for hypertension and goal BP to 130/80 mm Hg among high-risk patientsadds to the importance of identifying and addressing elevated BP in the ED, particularly for ED patients without access other sources of care. While there is considerable evidence linked to long-term outcomes that guide non-ED assessment and management of nonemergent BP elevations, evidence to inform ED care is still evolving. The 2013 ACEP clinical policy writing group articulated this noting significant gaps in evidence regarding ED hypertension screening, management of nonemergent elevated BP, antihypertensive medication initiation or titration, and timing of follow-up to improve short- and long-term outcomes while minimizing risks of adverse events.

While the ACC/AHA guidelines have traction in the United States, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines have noted differences in defining hypertension and targets for treatment. The ESC/ESH guidelines define hypertension as ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and target treatment based on age and risk. For patients with BP 130–139/85–89 mm Hg, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend lifestyle change and consideration of drug treatment, particularly if patients have high cardiovascular risk. For patients ≤ 80 years who have BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, drug treatment is indicated. For patients > 80 years, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend drug treatment for SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg. If patients tolerate treatment to maintain BP < 140/90 mm Hg, further lowering targets a DBP < 80 mm Hg and SBP based on age (SBP target 120–129 mm Hg if age < 65 years, 130–139 mm Hg if 65–79 years, and 130–139 mm Hg as tolerated in those > 80 years). For patients with known coronary artery disease, therapy is targeted to maintain BP < 130/80 mm Hg. Both guidelines have similar recommendations for BP measurement, lifestyle modifications, and recommended medications. Both recommend strong consideration for single-pill combination antihypertensive medications.
