## Question

Penicillin allergy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a reported penicillin allergy, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved and enhanced. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and risk stratification. Then, I should verify how to classify low, moderate, and high-risk phenotypes. Next, I will review testing strategies tailored to risk, including direct oral challenge versus skin testing. After that, I need to check cross-reactivity and safe beta-lactam choices. Then, I will consider special populations and scenarios like pregnancy, pediatrics, and surgical prophylaxis. Finally, I should confirm documentation, communication, and follow-up plans, and close with a concise decision algorithm summary.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and why this matters, because I need to ensure we are not overcalling allergy. Approximately 10% of patients report penicillin allergy, but fewer than 5% have clinically significant IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, and over 90% tolerate penicillins when formally evaluated, which means most labels are inaccurate and drive suboptimal care, resistance, and costs [^115Y2pUS] [^115qYXBM] [^116d4RpN].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical consequences of leaving an unverified label in place. Patients with a penicillin allergy label have higher risks of MRSA, VRE, and C. difficile, longer hospital stays, more surgical site infections, and increased mortality, and they incur substantially higher costs due to alternative antibiotics, so delabeling is both a safety and stewardship imperative [^115Y2pUS] [^115qYXBM] [^112MusQz].

> I will now examine the initial history elements I must capture, and I should double-check that I do not miss nonallergic mimics. I need the index drug, timing of reaction, latency from dose to onset, specific symptoms with organ involvement, severity and need for treatment, and any subsequent beta-lactam exposures, while remembering that isolated GI upset, headache, or a family history alone are not allergic and should prompt delabeling without testing [^1178kGzw] [^117RcH4t] [^111jm6JH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how to risk stratify. Low-risk features include remote nonpruritic rashes, pruritus without rash, GI symptoms only, or unknown reactions more than 10 years ago; moderate-risk includes urticaria or pruritic rashes without anaphylaxis; high-risk includes anaphylaxis, positive penicillin skin testing, recurrent reactions, or multiple beta-lactam allergies, and tools like PEN-FAST can help quantify risk in adults [^115Y2pUS] [^112n11XW] [^113KScE8].

> Let me consider the low-risk pathway next, and I should verify current guidance on direct oral challenge. For low-risk patients, a direct observed amoxicillin challenge without prior skin testing is recommended; severe reactions occur in about 0.5% and are manageable, and randomized data show no difference in reaction rates between direct challenge and skin testing followed by challenge, supporting the efficiency of direct delabeling in this group [^1178UoNA] [^113KScE8] [^116UN2Gf].

> Next, I should review the moderate-risk pathway, and I need to ensure I do not overuse direct challenge here. For moderate-risk histories, penicillin skin testing with major and minor determinants is appropriate; the negative predictive value exceeds 95% and approaches 100% when followed by an amoxicillin challenge, and if skin testing is negative, a supervised oral challenge confirms tolerance and enables delabeling [^115Y2pUS] [^111WoAJA] [^111J8725].

> I will now examine the high-risk pathway, and I should confirm that I am not suggesting unnecessary testing. Patients with a history of anaphylaxis or severe cutaneous adverse reactions should not undergo direct challenge in ambulatory settings; instead, refer to allergy for specialist evaluation, consider penicillin skin testing if appropriate, and reserve desensitization for situations where penicillin is essential and no suitable alternative exists, such as syphilis in pregnancy or neurosyphilis [^1178kGzw] [^1137JD8s] [^115oD9G6].

> But wait, what if the patient needs a beta-lactam now and cannot wait for formal testing; I should double-check options. For urgent needs, a graded challenge or test-dose strategy can be used in selected inpatients with nonanaphylactic histories, and structured programs show improved beta-lactam use without increased adverse reactions, though this requires protocols, monitoring, and access to epinephrine [^1155cqDA].

> Let me think about cross-reactivity, because outdated teaching often overstates risk. Modern data indicate penicillin–cephalosporin cross-reactivity is about 2% and largely driven by shared R1 side chains; thus, cefazolin and most later-generation cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains can generally be used even in patients with unverified nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, and in those with prior penicillin anaphylaxis, cefazolin is often acceptable without prior testing due to its unique side chain [^115Y2pUS] [^1147vrz6] [^116GdV5n].

> I should confirm carbapenem guidance, and I need to ensure I am aligned with current parameters. Carbapenems can be administered without prior testing in patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy histories, given extremely low cross-reactivity, though some clinicians may prefer a graded challenge in highly allergic patients or those with multiple drug allergies [^115cAsWQ] [^114YP4n6] [^113xhrcn].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pregnancy, and I must verify safety. Penicillin allergy evaluation is safe and effective in pregnancy, with high delabeling rates and no increase in adverse obstetric outcomes; this enables guideline-concordant GBS prophylaxis with penicillin or cefazolin and reduces reliance on inferior alternatives like clindamycin or vancomycin, which are less effective for neonatal GBS prevention [^1157TKDX] [^1177a8eK] [^114wMQR6].

> For pediatrics, let me reconsider whether skin testing is ever needed in low-risk children. Current guidance supports direct amoxicillin challenge without prior skin testing for low-risk pediatric histories, and structured history tools and education improve recognition of low-risk features and reduce unnecessary avoidance of first-line beta-lactams for common infections like acute otitis media [^1178UoNA] [^116xienQ] [^113UpHvh].

> For surgical prophylaxis, I should confirm that cefazolin remains first-line when feasible. Patients with penicillin allergy labels are frequently denied cefazolin despite its favorable profile and low cross-reactivity, leading to higher surgical site infection rates; stewardship interventions that risk-stratify and permit cefazolin use in appropriate patients reduce SSIs and improve adherence to best practice [^116JDHPU] [^112szDKe] [^113o9UXs].

> I need to ensure documentation and communication are addressed, because delabeling fails if the record is not updated. After a negative evaluation, I should remove the penicillin allergy from the EHR, provide the patient with a delabeling letter and wallet card, and communicate results to all clinicians and pharmacies; standardized protocols and patient education materials improve understanding and sustained behavior change [^114cLGfu] [^117VmycM] [^112Nsec1].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and when to retest. Most patients who delabel remain tolerant, but resensitization can rarely occur, particularly after parenteral therapy; in patients with severe prior reactions who require repeated parenteral beta-lactams, consider repeat skin testing or cautious rechallenges, balancing risk and necessity [^111J8725] [^111WoAJA].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway, and I should double-check it aligns with guidelines. If the history is inconsistent with allergy, delabel by history alone; if low-risk, perform direct amoxicillin challenge; if moderate-risk, perform penicillin skin testing followed by challenge if negative; if high-risk, refer to allergy and reserve desensitization for essential penicillin indications; throughout, prioritize beta-lactams with dissimilar side chains when alternatives are needed and embed stewardship and documentation into routine workflows [^1178kGzw] [^115Y2pUS] [^1147vrz6].

> Finally, I should confirm that this approach is not just safe but also cost-effective and operationally feasible. Proactive delabeling programs reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use, decrease C. difficile and resistant infections, shorten lengths of stay, and save money, and they can be scaled using nurse- and pharmacist-led protocols, non-allergist direct challenges, and EMR prompts to sustain gains [^115qYXBM] [^1153SEnk] [^1163G74v].

Penicillin allergy is **overreported and often misclassified** [^115Y2pUS], with only ~2% of patients having a confirmed IgE-mediated allergy [^115Y2pUS]. Most patients labeled as allergic are not truly allergic [^116d4RpN], and **risk stratification plus direct oral challenge or skin testing** enables safe delabeling and restores first-line β-lactam therapy [^1178kGzw] [^112n11XW]. Penicillin allergy increases risks of resistant infections, C. difficile, longer stays, and higher costs [^115wKYFd]; delabeling improves outcomes and is a key stewardship goal [^1136cv2U] [^115wKYFd].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical significance

- **Prevalence**: ~10% of patients report penicillin allergy, but < 2% are truly allergic [^115Y2pUS] [^113mHoGr].
- **Overreporting**: Most labels reflect non-allergic reactions or misclassification [^116d4RpN].
- **Consequences**: Labels drive broader-spectrum antibiotics, increasing MRSA, VRE, C. difficile, longer stays, readmissions, and costs [^112MusQz].

---

## Pathophysiology and classification

Immediate reactions are **IgE-mediated** and occur within 1 hour (e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema) [^114DTxXu], whereas **delayed reactions** are T-cell–mediated and occur after 1 hour (e.g. maculopapular rash, DRESS, SJS/TEN) [^116UN2Gf].

---

## Clinical manifestations

| **Reaction type** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Immediate (IgE-mediated) | - Anaphylaxis <br/> - Urticaria <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - Bronchospasm <br/> - Hypotension [^115Y2pUS] |
| Delayed (T-cell mediated) | - Maculopapular rash <br/> - DRESS <br/> - SJS/TEN <br/> - Serum sickness <br/> - Interstitial nephritis [^111jm6JH] |

---

## Risk stratification and evaluation

Risk stratification guides testing: **low-risk** histories (e.g. remote non-urticarial rash, GI upset) can proceed to direct oral challenge; **moderate-risk** histories (e.g. urticaria without anaphylaxis) warrant skin testing followed by challenge; and **high-risk** histories (e.g. anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous reactions) require specialist evaluation and desensitization if penicillin is essential [^112n11XW] [^1178kGzw]. The **PEN-FAST score** helps identify low-risk patients suitable for direct challenge [^113KScE8].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Skin testing**: Major/minor determinants; negative predictive value > 95% [^111WoAJA] [^115Y2pUS].
- **Oral challenge**: Diagnostic gold standard after negative skin test or in low-risk patients [^111J8725] [^1178kGzw].
- **Serum IgE**: Limited utility due to low sensitivity/specificity [^112ASbvX].

---

## Management strategies

- **Delabeling**: Direct oral challenge or skin testing plus challenge for low/moderate risk; restores first-line β-lactam use [^1178kGzw] [^112n11XW].
- **Desensitization**: For high-risk patients when penicillin is essential (e.g. syphilis in pregnancy) [^1137JD8s] [^115oD9G6].
- **Alternative antibiotics**: Cephalosporins, carbapenems, or monobactams based on risk and side-chain considerations [^1147vrz6] [^116GdV5n].

---

## Impact on clinical outcomes and healthcare costs

Patients with penicillin allergy labels experience **higher rates of resistant infections, C. difficile, longer stays, readmissions, and higher costs** [^115qYXBM] [^112MusQz]. Delabeling reduces broad-spectrum use, improves outcomes, and is cost-effective [^113SAAeH] [^115wKYFd].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidance emphasizes **proactive delabeling** with risk stratification and direct challenges for low-risk patients [^117MJekD] [^1178kGzw]. Allergy specialists should be engaged for high-risk patients and complex cases [^114W7GrB], and stewardship programs should incorporate allergy assessment to optimize β-lactam use [^1153SEnk].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In pregnancy, **testing and delabeling are safe and recommended** to enable first-line GBS prophylaxis [^1157TKDX] [^1177a8eK]. In pediatrics, **direct amoxicillin challenge is preferred** for low-risk histories [^1178UoNA]. In surgical prophylaxis, **cefazolin is preferred** when appropriate, even in many patients with penicillin allergy labels [^113o9UXs] [^112szDKe].

---

Penicillin allergy is **overreported and often misclassified** [^115Y2pUS]; structured risk stratification with direct challenge or skin testing enables safe delabeling, restores first-line β-lactam therapy, and improves outcomes while reducing costs [^1178kGzw] [^115wKYFd].

### Management of children with reported penicillin allergies [^116xienQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported medication allergy. Reported allergy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Risk categorization tools can help determine the optimal testing strategies to delabel patients with reported allergy. Approaches to allergy removal include oral challenge in low-risk patients and skin testing in high-risk patients. Many different locations may be used to test for allergy, including ambulatory care clinics, inpatient units, and emergency departments. Interventions (eg, use of the electronic medical record) are needed to ensure that once the allergy is removed, this information is effectively transmitted to the patient and appropriate providers.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to β-lactam antibiotics [^117LPCsj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet for those who truly have allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews current management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Management of a surgical patient with a label of penicillin allergy: narrative review and consensus recommendations [^1133xNNw]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Unsubstantiated penicillin-allergy labels are common in surgical patients, and can lead to significant harm through avoidance of best first-line prophylaxis of surgical site infections and increased infection with resistant bacterial strains. Up to 98% of penicillin-allergy labels are incorrect when tested. Because of the scarcity of trained allergists in all healthcare systems, only a minority of surgical patients have the opportunity to undergo testing and de-labelling before surgery. Testing pathways can be modified and shortened in selected patients. A variety of healthcare professionals can, with appropriate training and in collaboration with allergists, provide testing for selected patients. We review how patients might be assessed, the appropriate testing strategies that can be used, and the minimum standards of safe testing.

Background

True allergy to penicillin is rare, despite the high frequency with which it is reported. While most patients reporting penicillin allergy are not prone to anaphylaxis, it is not currently known what percentage of these patients will tolerate dose challenges of penicillin-based antibiotics. This review aims to determine the rate of tolerance in patients reporting penicillin allergy when challenged with penicillin-based antibiotics.

Methods

We searched MedLine, Embase, and Cochrane Library for publications with English language translations between the years 2000 and 2017. We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and observational studies of participants reporting penicillin allergy who received at least one systemic dose of a penicillin in the form of a drug challenge. At least 2 independent reviewers extracted data from included studies and assessed the quality of each included study. To generate primary outcome data, we calculated a summary estimate rate of penicillin tolerance from a pooled proportion of participants receiving penicillin with no adverse effects.

Results

Initial literature search yielded 2945 studies, of which 23 studies were ultimately included in our review; 5056 study participants with reported history of penicillin allergy were challenged with a penicillin. After weighting for study sample size, a pooled average of 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 93.7%-95%) of participants tolerated the dose challenge without any adverse reaction.

Conclusion

Misrepresented penicillin allergy drives unnecessary use of alternative antibiotics, which may be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive than using penicillin. In addressing the problem of penicillin allergy over-diagnosis, evaluation should go beyond risk for type 1 hypersensitivity. Our data suggest that 94.4% of 5056 participants with reported penicillin allergy determined to be clinically appropriate for allergy evaluation tolerated repeat administration of penicillin-based antibiotics without any adverse reactions. This review generates meaningful information useful to clinical predictive analytics, in evaluating and managing patients with a reported history of penicillin allergy.

### Evaluation and management of penicillin allergy: a review [^115Y2pUS]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

β-Lactam antibiotics are among the safest and most effective antibiotics. Many patients report allergies to these drugs that limit their use, resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events.

Observations

Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the β-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon (< 5%). Currently, the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing, potentially due to a decreased use of parenteral penicillins, and because severe anaphylactic reactions to oral amoxicillin are rare. IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade. Cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporin drugs occurs in about 2% of cases, less than the 8% reported previously. Some patients have a medical history that suggests they are at a low risk for developing an allergic reaction to penicillin. Low-risk histories include patients having isolated nonallergic symptoms, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, or patients solely with a family history of a penicillin allergy, symptoms of pruritus without rash, or remote (> 10 years) unknown reactions without features suggestive of an IgE-mediated reaction. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated reactions. A high-risk history includes patients who have had anaphylaxis, positive penicillin skin testing, recurrent penicillin reactions, or hypersensitivities to multiple β-lactam antibiotics. The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are undermined when reported allergy to penicillin leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including increased risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents also increase the risk of developing Clostridium difficile (also known as Clostridioides difficile) infection. Direct amoxicillin challenge is appropriate for patients with low-risk allergy histories. Moderate-risk patients can be evaluated with penicillin skin testing, which carries a negative predictive value that exceeds 95% and approaches 100% when combined with amoxicillin challenge. Clinicians performing penicillin allergy evaluation need to identify what methods are supported by their available resources.

Conclusions and Relevance

Many patients report they are allergic to penicillin but few have clinically significant reactions. Evaluation of penicillin allergy before deciding not to use penicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics is an important tool for antimicrobial stewardship.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^116UN2Gf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

PENICILLINS

Patient-reported penicillin reactions lead to increased medication errors, poor health delivery, and medical costs. The prevalence of penicillin allergy labels varies from less than 1% to more than 20%, depending on the population and geographical region. –

Among patients presenting with a suspected penicillin allergy, the most common symptoms are urticaria and maculopapular rashes, followed by angioedema, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea). However, benign, nonimmediate reactions (occurring > 1 hour after exposure) to β-lactams are more commonly described than immediate reactions. –

Risk stratification approach

Motivated by the declining rate of confirmed, immediate penicillin allergy in some centers(from > 10% to < 5%), the safety of drug challenges performed by allergists — severe reactions occurred in just 0.06% across 26,595 patients in 112 observational studies — and the resource and logistical hurdles associated with performing skin tests, direct amoxicillin challenges were implemented initially by allergists in healthy individuals with low-risk histories. Today, direct drug challenges for low-risk β-lactam allergies, including penicillin, have been increasingly used in outpatient specialist settings, with 96% to 99% of low-risk penicillin allergies removed by an oral challenge. Depending on the settings and definitions, low-risk patients comprise 29% to 70% of patients with penicillin allergy labels that indicate a possible hypersensitivity (Figure 1).

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112q6WhX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy — persistence of sensitization and need for evaluation: Many reported allergies do not persist long term; "Approximately 90% to 95% of patients with a reported penicillin allergy can tolerate a rechallenge after an appropriate allergy evaluation has been performed", and "after 20 years fewer than 1% of patients with initial clinical symptoms compatible with an allergic reaction continue to maintain their sensitivity". Consequently, "a formal allergy evaluation is recommended by both North American and European guidelines to optimize patient management".

---

### Penicillin allergy evaluation should be performed proactively in patients with a penicillin allergy label [^116pcNYG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Penicillin allergy is the most common drug allergy in the US population. A penicillin allergy label is associated with poor patient outcomes including increased hospital length of stay, increased perioperative infections, and overall increased mortality. A penicillin allergy evaluation accurately identifies approximately 9 of 10 patients who, despite reporting a history of penicillin allergy, can receive penicillins safely. Penicillin allergy evaluations should be offered proactively to healthy patients during routine visits, including children and pregnant women, in advance of antibiotic need.

### Ethics of antibiotic allergy [^113euDiN]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic allergies are commonly reported among patients, but most do not experience reactions on rechallenge with the same agents. These reported allergies complicate management of infections in patients labelled as having penicillin allergy, including serious infections where penicillin-based antibiotics are the first-line (most effective and least toxic) treatment option. Allergy labels are rarely questioned in clinical practice, with many clinicians opting for inferior second-line antibiotics to avoid a perceived risk of allergy. Reported allergies thereby can have significant impacts on patients and public health, and present major ethical challenges. Antibiotic allergy testing has been described as a strategy to circumvent this dilemma, but it carries limitations that often make it less feasible in patients with acute infections or in community settings that lack access to allergy testing. This article provides an empirically informed ethical analysis of key considerations in this clinical dilemma, using Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in patients with penicillin allergies as a case study. We argue that prescribing first-line penicillin-based antibiotics to patients with reported allergies may often present a more favourable ratio of benefits to risks, and may therefore be more ethically appropriate than using second-line drugs. We recommend changes to policy-making, clinical research and medical education, in order to promote more ethically acceptable responses to antibiotic allergies than the status quo.

### Penicillin allergy impact and management [^116j53Sr]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

There is international evidence that penicillin allergies are associated with inferior prescribing and patient outcomes. A host of tools now exist from assessment (risk assessment tools, clinical decision rules) to delabeling (the removal of a beta-lactam allergy via testing or medical reconciliation) to reduce the impact of these "labels" in the hospital and community setting, as a primary antimicrobial stewardship intervention.

### BSACI guideline for the set-up of penicillin allergy de-labelling services by non-allergists working in a hospital setting [^114ew5K4]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and a committee of experts and key stakeholders have developed this guideline for the evaluation and testing of patients with an unsubstantiated label of penicillin allergy. The guideline is intended for UK clinicians who are not trained in allergy or immunology, but who wish to develop a penicillin allergy de-labelling service for their patients. It is intended to supplement the BSACI 2015 guideline "Management of allergy to penicillin and other beta-lactams" and therefore does not detail the epidemiology or aetiology of penicillin allergy, as this is covered extensively in the 2015 guideline (1). The guideline is intended for use only in patients with a label of penicillin allergy and does not apply to other beta-lactam allergies. The recommendations include a checklist to identify patients at low risk of allergy and a framework for the conduct of drug provocation testing by non-allergists. There are separate sections for adults and paediatrics within the guideline, in recognition of the common differences in reported allergy history and likelihood of true allergy.

### Penicillin allergy evaluation should be performed proactively in patients with a penicillin allergy label [^116dHqXG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy delabeling yield and clinician roles — A penicillin allergy evaluation accurately identifies the approximately 9 of 10 patients who report a history of penicillin allergy but can receive penicillins without allergic reaction. Efforts to delabel can and should be performed by all clinicians, especially for those with low-risk histories, and for clinicians not comfortable performing delabeling procedures, referral to Allergy and Immunology is an appropriate alternative.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^111Q8k9u]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Antimicrobial agents — penicillins general epidemiology reports that penicillins are commonly used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%, and the reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%. Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receive alternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense.

### The rational clinical examination. is this patient allergic to penicillin? An evidence-based analysis of the likelihood of penicillin allergy [^113PW5yR]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinicians frequently withhold antibiotics that contain penicillin based on patients' self-reported clinical history of an adverse reaction to penicillin and the clinicians' own misunderstandings about the characteristics of a true penicillin allergy.

Objectives

To determine the likelihood of true penicillin allergy with consideration of clinical history and to evaluate the diagnostic value added by appropriate skin testing.

Data Sources

MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles dated 1966 to October 2000. Bibliographies were searched to identify additional articles.

Study Selection

We included original studies describing the precision of skin testing in diagnosis of penicillin allergy. We excluded studies that did not use both minor and major determinants, provide an explicit definition of penicillin allergy, or list the specific criteria necessary for a positive skin test result. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Three authors independently reviewed and abstracted data from all articles and reached consensus about any discrepancies.

Data Synthesis

Patients' self-reported history has low accuracy for diagnosis of true penicillin allergy. By evaluating studies comparing clinical history to the skin test for penicillin allergy among patients with and without a positive history for penicillin allergy, positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated. History of penicillin allergy had a positive likelihood ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–2.5), while absence of history of penicillin allergy had a negative likelihood ratio of 0.5 (95% CI, 0.4–0.6).

Conclusions

Only 10% to 20% of patients reporting a history of penicillin allergy are truly allergic when assessed by skin testing. Taking a detailed history of a patient's reaction to penicillin may allow clinicians to exclude true penicillin allergy, allowing these patients to receive penicillin. Patients with a concerning history of type I penicillin allergy who have a compelling need for a drug containing penicillin should undergo skin testing. Virtually all patients with a negative skin test result can take penicillin without serious sequelae.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure. The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than is the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered, if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### Penicillin allergy-getting the label right [^114Ergdr]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Penicillin i allergy is a potentially serious adverse reaction that impacts on antibacterial treatment options. Although it is commonly reported and recorded in medical records, only a minority of patients with a label of penicillin allergy actually have the condition confirmed. The term 'allergy' may be incorrectly applied to adverse reactions that do not have an immunological basis and inappropriate labelling of penicillin allergy can lead to the unnecessary avoidance of penicillins and other beta-lactam antibacterials. Here, we discuss key features that help to distinguish patients at low or high risk of having a true penicillin allergy, summarise what is known about the risk of allergic reactions to other beta-lactam antibacterials in patients with penicillin allergy and discuss the steps to consider when assessing a label of penicillin allergy.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and an expert panel have prepared this guidance for the management of immediate and non-immediate allergic reactions to penicillins and other beta-lactams. The guideline is intended for UK specialists in both adult and paediatric allergy and for other clinicians practising allergy in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence based, but where evidence is lacking, the panel reached consensus. During the development of the guideline, all BSACI members were consulted using a Web-based process and all comments carefully considered. Included in the guideline are epidemiology of allergic reactions to beta-lactams, molecular structure, formulations available in the UK and a description of known beta-lactam antigenic determinants. Sections on the value and limitations of clinical history, skin testing and laboratory investigations for both penicillins and cephalosporins are included. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is discussed in detail. Recommendations on oral provocation and desensitization procedures have been made. Guidance for beta-lactam allergy in children is given in a separate section. An algorithm to help the clinician in the diagnosis of patients with a history of penicillin allergy has also been included.

Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy

Penicillin and other ß-lactam antibiotics have a crucial role in treating STIs. Penicillin is recommended for all clinical stages of syphilis, and no proven alternatives exist for treating neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis during pregnancy. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is recommended for gonorrhea treatment. For extragenital site infections, especially pharyngeal, failure rates of nonceftriaxone regimens can be substantial. In most clinical settings, patients who report a penicillin allergy are not treated with ß-lactam antimicrobials. For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and a concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often avoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin allergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low.

Prevalence of reported allergy to penicillin is approximately 10% among the U.S. population and higher among hospital inpatients and residents in health care–related facilities. One large study in an STI clinic revealed that 8.3% of patients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy. Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the majority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate the medication. The prevalence of reported penicillin allergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited data indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently reported antibiotic allergies.

Patients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin and are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. The presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces prescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin allergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective drugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer length of hospital stay and increased risk for infection. Multiple studies have described that persons with reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical-site infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, and higher medical care usage (,–).

The overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is secondary to imprecise use of the term "allergy" by families and clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, drug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can occur days after exposure. Approximately 80% of patients with a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have lost the sensitivity after 10 years. Thus, patients with recent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients with remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions in the distant past might no longer be reactive.

### Penicillin allergy evaluation should be performed proactively in patients with a penicillin allergy label [^112Nsec1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Proactive penicillin allergy evaluation implementation — Penicillin allergy evaluations should be offered proactively to patients during routine visits, in advance of antibiotic need, including to children and pregnant women. Specific programs have successfully targeted patients likely to require antibiotics, such as inpatients, ICU patients, oncology patients, pre-operative patients, and patients planning for organ transplantation. Importantly, penicillin allergy evaluation by any means has been shown to be a cost-saving intervention, while inappropriate re-labeling in the electronic health record remains a challenge and efforts are underway to combat it, making accurate communication of results to delabeled patients and their care team paramount.

Management — high-risk patients with demonstrated sensitivity to penicillin should avoid the responsible drug and potentially cross-reactive agents; it is reasonable to repeat skin testing if many years have passed, and if there are no reasonable alternatives, both oral and intravenous desensitization protocols have been well established; for low-risk patients (eg, itching without urticaria or mild maculopapular rash of less than 1-week duration), a drug challenge test may be considered without the use of skin testing.

### Reported knowledge and management of potential penicillin allergy in children [^1143kauk]. Academic Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) and primary care provider (PCP) providers are the most likely physicians to initially label a child as allergic to penicillin. Differences in knowledge and management of reported penicillin allergy between these 2 groups have not been well characterized.

Methods

A cross-sectional, 20-question survey was administered to PEM and PCPs to ascertain differential knowledge and management of penicillin allergy. Knowledge regarding high- and low-risk symptoms for true allergy and extent of history taking regarding allergy were compared between the 2 groups using t tests, Chi-square, and Wilcoxon tests.

Results

In total, 182 PEM and 54 PCPs completed the survey. PEM and PCPs reported that 74.1 ± 19.5% and 69.0 ± 23.8% of patients with remote low-risk symptoms of allergy could tolerate penicillin without an allergic reaction. PEM and PCPs incorrectly identified low-risk symptoms of allergy as high-risk, including vomiting with medication administration and delayed skin rash. PCPs took more detailed allergy histories when compared with PEM providers. In total, 143 (78.5%) of PEM providers and 51 (94.4%) PCPs were interested in using a penicillin allergy questionnaire to segregate children into high- or low-risk categories.

Conclusions

Most pediatric providers believe that children with a remote history of low-risk allergy symptoms could tolerate penicillin without an allergic reaction; however, this is infrequently acted upon. Both PEM and PCP providers were likely to classify low-risk symptoms as high-risk and infrequently referred children for further detailed allergy assessment. Both groups were receptive to decision support measures to facilitate improved penicillin allergy classification and labeling and support antibiotic appropriateness in their patients.

### The cost of self-reported penicillin allergy: a systematic review [^112MusQz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who report a penicillin (PCN) allergy receive suboptimal antibiotic therapy compared with patients not reporting an allergy. However, a majority of patients who report PCN allergy are not truly allergic on confirmatory testing. Ruling out PCN allergy by testing may improve clinical and economic outcomes for patients with reported allergies requiring antibiotic therapy.

Objective

The objective of this study was to summarize clinical and economic outcomes associated with PCN allergy and provide recommendations for future cost-effectiveness analyses for PCN allergy testing.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed, including all articles published any date through April 25, 2017 (PROSPERO Registration number 42017064112). A total of 1518 abstracts were found during the initial search with 96 duplicates, for a total of 1422 articles for screening. Thirty articles were included for qualitative synthesis and full data extraction.

Results

The majority of the studies included had an observational design focusing on inpatient admissions. The most frequently measured outcome in the context of PCN allergy was optimizing antibiotic therapy. Patients with PCN allergy were found to have direct drug costs during inpatient admission ranging from no difference to an additional $609/patient compared with patients without PCN allergy. Outpatient prescription costs were estimated from $14 to $193/patient higher for PCN allergic patients. Total inpatient costs were less for patients without PCN allergy with average savings from $1145 to $4254/patient.

Conclusions

Evaluations of clinical and economic outcomes of PCN allergy are primarily observational and focus on inpatient populations. Long-term relationships between PCN allergy and clinical and economic outcomes are unknown.

### Antibiotic allergy [^116d4RpN]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Antibiotics are the commonest cause of life-threatening immune-mediated drug reactions that are considered off-target, including anaphylaxis, and organ-specific and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. However, many antibiotic reactions documented as allergies were unknown or not remembered by the patient, cutaneous reactions unrelated to drug hypersensitivity, drug-infection interactions, or drug intolerances. Although such reactions pose negligible risk to patients, they currently represent a global threat to public health. Antibiotic allergy labels result in displacement of first-line therapies for antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. A penicillin allergy label, in particular, is associated with increased use of broad-spectrum and non-β-lactam antibiotics, which results in increased adverse events and antibiotic resistance. Most patients labelled as allergic to penicillins are not allergic when appropriately stratified for risk, tested, and re-challenged. Given the public health importance of penicillin allergy, this Review provides a global update on antibiotic allergy epidemiology, classification, mechanisms, and management.

Penicillin skin testing — indications and post-test management — Penicillin skin testing is indicated in patients who have a reaction history consistent with a possible IgE-mediated mechanism, and immediate-type penicillin allergy cannot be accurately diagnosed by history alone. Penicillin skin test–negative patients (as determined by testing with major and minor determinants) may receive penicillin, and depending on which reagents are used and the reaction history, the first dose may need to be given via a test challenge with a lower dose under observation.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^113KScE8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical models have found that the absence of anaphylaxis, an unknown name of the index drug, a reaction occurring over a 1 year prior, and a reaction not being immediate (> 1 hour from exposure) are associated with a lower risk. PEN-FAST was also derived using a regression model. In patients with a reported penicillin allergy (PEN), based on 4 allergy history criteria (time since reaction ≤ 5 years (F), anaphylaxis or angioedema (A), severe cutaneous adverse reaction (S), or whether pharmacologic treatment (T) was required for reaction), a PEN-FAST score of < 3 is associated with 96.3% negative predictive value (NPV) (95% confidence interval, 94.1%–97.8%).

In a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) across 6 outpatient specialized centers,382 low-risk patients, defined by low PEN-FAST score, were assigned to either a direct oral challenge with penicillin (intervention arm) or penicillin skin testing followed by an oral challenge with penicillin for those who have negative skin tests (standard-of-care). The primary outcome of a physician-verified positive immune-mediated oral penicillin challenge was not different in the intervention group 1/187 (0.5%) compared with the control group 1/190 (0.5%). This trial further demonstrated that, in patients with a low-risk history, a direct oral penicillin challenge is a safe procedure to facilitate the removal of a penicillin allergy label.

### Penicillin allergy evaluation should be performed proactively in patients with a penicillin allergy label [^115wKYFd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) position statement — penicillin allergy label epidemiology and consequences — notes that penicillin allergy is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the population and up to 15% of hospitalized patients are labeled with a penicillin allergy, yet when evaluation is performed in those reporting a history, the overwhelming majority tolerate penicillins and the allergy label can be removed and the patient can be delabeled. A penicillin allergy label is associated with poor patient outcomes including increased hospital length of stay, increased perioperative infections, and overall increased mortality, and use of alternative antibiotics can be associated with higher costs, inferior efficacy and/or greater risk for untoward effects including antibiotic resistance, Clostridium difficile, and side effects. Penicillin allergy testing is associated with significantly less health care utilization over the next several years and greater use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics, and has a very favorable cost-benefit ratio for the incremental cost of testing versus future health care utilization.

### Overview of penicillin allergy [^116UuVNH]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Allergy to penicillin is the most commonly reported antibiotic allergy. However, most patients who report a positive history of a prior reaction to penicillin are not found to be allergic to penicillin upon skin testing. Often, this history is vague or based on a parent's recollection of an event that occurred in the distant past. Avoidance of penicillin based on self-reported allergic history alone often leads to the use of an alternate antibiotic with greater cost or side effect profile. Patients with a negative skin test to both major and minor determinants may generally be given penicillin, with a statistical risk of developing an allergic reaction similar to that observed in the general population. A more cautious approach in these cases where the degree of suspicion is low, an allergic etiology is unproven, or there is a negative skin test, is to do a graded challenge. If the skin test is positive, an alternate antibiotic should be used. If, however, an alternate antibiotic is not available, then desensitization may be performed, but there are limitations to desensitization as well, and tolerance is not permanent. Avoidance of cephalosporins may be recommended in cases of penicillin allergy, but newer generation cephalosporins have demonstrate less cross-reactivity to penicillin than earlier generation ones. Desensitization protocols for cephalosporins are available but not standardized. The mechanisms of antibiotic sensitization are not clearly understood.

### Inpatient β-lactam test-dose protocol and antimicrobial stewardship in patients with a history of penicillin allergy [^1155cqDA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy in hospitalized patients, resulting in increased second-line antibiotic use, nosocomial infections, and health care use. Given that most patients are not truly allergic, a safe strategy that empowers the admitting physician is needed.

Objective

To assess the effect on antibiotic prescribing practices for hospitalized patients with penicillin allergy using a validated intervention.

Methods

An intervention was implemented to educate health care professionals on management of patients with penicillin allergy using a validated risk stratification algorithm to guide testing and antibiotic use. Thirty days of control data using current standard of care was compared with 60 days of postintervention data measuring documentation of penicillin allergy history and antibiotic selection.

Results

The relative use of cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics increased by 121.2% (P = 0.03) and 256% (P = 0.04), respectively, without an increase in adverse drug reactions. There was a decrease in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin, 67.2% (P = 0.04); quinolones, 33.3% (P = 0.31); carbapenems, 81.9% (P = 0.08); and aztreonam, 73.8% (P = 0.18).

Conclusion

The antibiotic choice in patients admitted to the hospital with a reported penicillin allergy can be improved by better evaluation of the allergy history and the use of a risk stratification guideline.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^111J8725]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Penicillin immediate hypersensitivity — skin testing, challenge, and retesting: The negative predictive value for penicillin skin testing is reported as greater than 95% in North American studies, and drug challenge is described as the diagnostic criterion standard recommended after allergy evaluation when the patient is deemed unlikely to be allergic to the given drug. After a negative penicillin skin test result, amoxicillin is typically used for drug challenge, often as a single full dose, or as 1/10th of the final dose followed by the final dose. Resensitization after re‑treatment is noted as uncommon but can develop in up to 20% of patients; repeat skin testing may be considered for patients with severe immediate reactions, especially after parenteral administration, even when a prior therapeutic course has been tolerated. Most patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have negative skin testing and challenge may subsequently receive penicillins without a significantly increased risk compared with the general population, and a retrospective series of 32 patients with negative skin testing reported that repeated intravenous penicillin administration appears safe.

### Penicillin allergy testing and delabeling for patients who are prescribed penicillin: a systematic review for a World Health Organization guideline [^115GobMm]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

People who self-report as penicillin allergic based on unspecific reactions in the past, and in the absence of confirmatory testing, frequently do not have a true penicillin allergy. Removing incorrect penicillin allergy labels (i.e. penicillin allergy delabeling) is of importance to improve antimicrobial stewardship practices worldwide. Delabeling can be done through oral administration of a low-dose penicillin in low-risk penicillin allergy patients, and, on some occasions, may be done directly by clinical history taking alone. The latter approach can also be followed in e-consults, obliviating the need for any further workup, namely when the reported reactions are clearly nonimmunologic (e.g. nausea, headache, or fatigue).

We aimed to assess the role for (i) routine penicillin allergy testing and the (ii) safety of penicillin allergy delabeling approaches in individuals prescribed with penicillin or with a suspected or reported penicillin allergy.

### Narrative review of recent developments and the future of penicillin allergy de-labelling by non-allergists [^113vEbQU]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

The rising challenge of multiple antibiotic allergies

Patients with labels of penicillin and other antibiotic allergy are an increasing problem that can limit therapeutic options, especially in critical care and surgical prophylaxis; they also increase healthcare costs due to the use of broader-spectrum/ more expensive antibiotics. Addressing the issue of multiple antibiotic allergies requires study of the mechanisms (including immunological) behind these allergies as well as diagnostic and management strategies.

Diagnosing allergies to multiple antibiotics is complex. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as skin testing and specific IgE measurements, may not be sufficiently sensitive or specific, particularly for delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Structured patient interviews, skin testing, and DPTs are effective strategies for de-labelling. These methods have been successful in confirming the absence of true allergies in many patients previously labelled as multi-drug allergic. DPTs are underutilized but crucial in the definitive diagnosis of drug allergies. However, concerns about patient safety, especially in cases with a history of severe reactions, limit their widespread use.

Personalised medicine, including genetic testing and detailed immunological profiling, may offer new avenues for diagnosing and managing suspected true multiple antibiotic allergies. This approach could lead to more targeted and effective allergy assessments. Enhanced diagnostic accuracy, effective de-labelling strategies, and continued research are essential for better management of these patients and for improving overall antibiotic stewardship.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: a retrospective study of a health system intervention [^113o9UXs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Reported penicillin allergies affect 10% to 15% of patients and are a threat to appropriate administration of first-line surgical-site infection (SSI) antimicrobial prophylaxis. The scope of this impact is enormous: SSIs are the most common and costly health care–associated infections, affecting 2% to 5% of surgeries in the United States. The aims of administering first-line surgical antibiotic prophylaxis are to prevent SSI, lower the risk of multi–drug-resistant organisms, and reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Cefazolin is the medication of choice for most procedures because of its desirable spectrum of activity, favorable safety profile, and low cost. The presence of a penicillin allergy label alone is associated with a 50% increased risk of SSI, likely mediated by reduction in use of first-line antibiotics (most often cefazolin). When alternative antibiotics are used for surgical prophylaxis, there are demonstrably higher rates of SSIs, prosthetic joint infections, surgical revisions, and multi–drug-resistant infections across a broad range of surgical specialties and procedures.,

Although reported penicillin allergies commonly affect prescribing decisions, there is good evidence that most are inaccurate: more than 95% of these patients can tolerate penicillin safely and even more can tolerate cephalosporins. Patients are often inaccurately labeled because either a patient was mislabeled at the time of the inciting event or because, in cases of true allergy, most cases will be outgrown within 10 years. For this reason, such patients are referred to as having penicillin allergy labels, termed to connote the common mislabel. Moreover, a plethora of research now suggests that even in true IgE-mediated penicillin allergies, there is limited cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, especially cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 side chains. In congruence with this understanding, the Joint Task Force of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology released updated drug allergy practice parameters in 2022, suggesting that patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin can be given cephalosporins with structurally dissimilar R1 side chains, such as cefazolin. However, other national infectious disease, anesthesiology, and surgical guidelines have not been updated to this effect, and this has not yet been implemented in many surgical centers.

### Improving routine prenatal penicillin allergy testing for reported penicillin allergy [^115AhzNz]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Patient-reported antibiotic allergies directly impact patient care by limiting options for antibiotic selection. Patients with self-reported antibiotic allergies have a higher cost of care, more frequent infections with resistant bacteria and worse health outcomes than patients without antibiotic allergies. Given that penicillin allergies are the most commonly reported antibiotic allergy, pursuing penicillin allergy testing for pregnant patients with a self-identified penicillin allergy directly impacts pregnancy care because of routine testing for GBS colonisation. Because patients who were colonised with GBS in one pregnancy have a 50% likelihood of colonisation in subsequent pregnancies, the benefits of pursuing penicillin allergy testing during pregnancy extend beyond a single episode of care. The negative predictive value of a penicillin allergy test is reported to be 98%, making the risk of a reaction in test- negative patients about the same as in the general population. While the positive predictive value is only about 50%, it is appropriate to seek alternatives to penicillin for those with positive penicillin allergy testing.

Recent publications on this topic include retrospective reviews of pregnant patients receiving penicillin skin testing followed by an oral challenge to confirm tolerance of penicillin, and a systematic literature review positing that desensitisation should be used more frequently in the pregnant population to mitigate the sequelae of unverified penicillin allergies. Our findings align with the conclusions of other papers: penicillin skin testing can be safely performed in pregnancy and a negative test allows providers to safely follow guideline-driven antimicrobial therapy and use first-line antibiotics in labour and delivery for GBS-positive patients. In addition, our publication provides a structured way to approach this evaluation in pregnant patients.

We recognise there are limitations of our project relating to both patient acceptance of penicillin allergy testing recommendations and some systematic inconsistency in implementation of the nursing protocol for those who did not initiate their prenatal care within our practice. During the project time, we made serial overtures to providers and nurses to overcome barriers to implementation. Several influencing factors were identified in the population eligible for penicillin allergy testing but who ultimately declined testing. Some patients expressed concern about the cost of testing, and providers were not able to persuade them that a negative test might represent long-term healthcare cost savings and reduce their future risk of developing infections that are resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics. A group of patients cared for remotely early during the COVID-19 pandemic were reluctant to come to the office for allergy testing. Thus, both timing of the project during the pandemic and the cost of the intervention limited uptake in this population.

### Immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics [^114vnTkQ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotics are the most commonly reported drug allergy in adults and children. More than 95% of those with reported allergy labels to beta lactams are not confirmed when subjected to allergy testing. Beta lactam antibiotics are associated with a wide spectrum of immediate and delayed drug hypersensitivity reactions. The latency period to symptoms and clinical presentation aids in the causality assessment. Risk stratification based on diagnosis and timing then allows for appropriate management and evaluation. Skin prick testing, intradermal testing and oral challenge are well established for evaluation of immediate reactions. Delayed intradermal testing, patch testing and oral challenge can also be considered for evaluation of mild to moderate delayed reactions. Cross-reactivity between beta-lactams appears to be driven most commonly by a shared R1 side-chain. Standardized algorithms, protocols and pathways are needed for widespread implementation of a pragmatic and effective approach to patients reporting beta lactam allergy.

### What do I need to know about penicillin antibiotics? [^114hnQA5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

The penicillins remain the class of antibiotics most commonly prescribed to children worldwide. In an era when the risks posed by antimicrobial resistance are growing, an understanding of antibiotic pharmacology and how to apply these principles in clinical practice is increasingly important. This paper provides an overview of the pharmacology of penicillins, focusing on those aspects of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity that are clinically relevant in paediatric prescribing. Penicillin allergy is frequently reported but a detailed history of suspected adverse reactions is essential to identify whether a clinically relevant hypersensitivity reaction is likely or not. The importance of additional factors such as antibiotic palatability, concordance and stewardship are also discussed, highlighting their relevance to optimal prescribing of the penicillins for children.

### Penicillin allergy testing and delabeling for patients who are prescribed penicillin: a systematic review for a World Health Organization guideline [^1127iwQK]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

During the WHO Guideline Committee in April 2023 on presenting these findings, there was a discussion on the prevalence of penicillin allergy labels, and how to approach these patients in areas of high prevalence of ARF/RHD when considered for penicillin treatment (or an alternative antibiotic if found to be truly penicillin allergic), as allergy testing may not be routinely available. According to WHO guidance, this subgroup of patients (i.e. patients requiring penicillin of other antibiotics and labeled as allergic) should be carefully examined and their antibiotic risk level should be determined, hence they cannot be assessed using the original PICO which included "doing nothing" as the comparator. Discussion in the April meeting covered the role of PST, and potential alternatives, as low-dose direct DC, for confirming or removing a penicillin allergy label. To address this specific sub-group that would not be addressed by the initial PICO question, we ran a simple search strategy on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 7 of 12, July 2023), PubMed, and Embase on 31st of July 2023 using the expression: "penicillin allergy" AND "trial". The aim was to understand in patients with suspected penicillin allergy what is the safest method to delabel a penicillin allergy or to confirm a diagnosis. Studies were identified using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, but the PICO had changes to the population and comparator:
Population: patients with suspected penicillin allergy (self-reported by the patient or their guardian, or patient history);
Intervention: as before (laboratory investigations, PST, or direct DC).
Comparator: different approach to the one used in the intervention group.
Outcomes: as before (primary endpoint: allergic reactions to penicillin; secondary endpoints: anaphylactic shocks, vasovagal reactions, arrhythmias, treatment adherence, acceptability and adverse events).

### Multifaceted implementation strategy to improve the evaluation of penicillin allergies in perioperative patients: a pre-post feasibility implementation study [^113dnxwA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 32 million adults in the U.S. report an allergy to penicillin and formal penicillin allergy testing reveals only 5% of patients who report a penicillin allergy have a true allergy to penicillin. Patients reporting a penicillin allergy receive less effective and more costly antibiotic treatment, and are at increased risk for the development of Clostridioides difficile infection and infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Penicillin allergies are particularly consequential among patients undergoing surgery. Surgical patients with a documented penicillin allergy versus those without a documented penicillin allergy are more likely to receive less-effective, second-line, prophylactic antibiotic treatments that increase their risk for mortality, surgical site infections, and longer hospital stays. Comprehensive penicillin allergy histories enable the risk-stratification and appropriate management of reported penicillin allergies. Yet, up to 40% of documented penicillin allergy histories lack descriptions of the index reaction, which impedes risk stratification and perpetuates the unnecessary avoidance of penicillins and cephalosporins.

In 2019, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Core Elements for Hospital Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs specified that nurses may play an important role in stewardship by improving the evaluation of reported penicillin allergies. We developed a multifaceted implementation strategy (actions to facilitate the adoption of evidence-based interventions) to amplify facilitators and minimize barriers to nurses' evaluation of reported penicillin allergies. – Our development of the implementation strategy was guided by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation Model for Behavior Change (COM-B) model of behavior change that specifies behavior results from three interacting components, ie, Capability (nurses' knowledge and skill to evaluate penicillin allergies), Opportunity (external factors that influence nurses' ability to evaluate penicillin allergies), and Motivation (nurses' emotional responses and analytic decisions to evaluating penicillin allergies). We defined nurses' evaluation of reported penicillin allergies as nurses' implementation of two interventions: 1) documenting penicillin allergies using the STORY mnemonic (Symptoms of allergy, Timing of allergy, Onset of symptoms, Resolution, and Yet again use of penicillin)and 2) notifying prescribers of patients with low-risk symptoms of reported penicillin allergy. We provide a rationale for and description for interventions in Supplemental Materials, Appendix.

American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) position statement — low-risk penicillin allergy delabeling — states that since the last AAAAI penicillin allergy position statement, direct oral challenge without preceding skin testing has been recommended as the preferred approach in low-risk pediatric patients and as a consideration in low-risk adult patients, and defines low risk patients as those with a remote history (> 5 years) of cutaneous-only reactions such as itching or morbilliform drug eruptions (MDE). Delabeling penicillin allergy is an important component of antibiotic stewardship and is endorsed by many professional organizations and public health bodies, and a penicillin allergy evaluation is not necessary for patients with a family history of penicillin allergy only or a side effect such as headache or nausea; these patients may simply be delabeled by history alone.

### Safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation: a systematic review [^1157TKDX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Approximately 8–13% of pregnant patients report penicillin allergy. Penicillins and other beta-lactams are widely used in pregnancy but often avoided in these patients, resulting in suboptimal therapy, antimicrobial resistance, higher costs, and increased morbidity for patients and neonates. True penicillin allergy is rare and 95% of unverified penicillin allergies are delabelled on evaluation. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is safe and recommended for pregnant patients, few are assessed. Research concerning antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation is accelerating, and we undertook a systematic review to summarize this growing body of evidence for obstetric providers.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed ahead-of-print and non-Medline, and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted in collaboration with a medical information specialist. There was no restriction on study language, date, or design.

Study Eligibility Criteria

All peer-reviewed studies of pregnant people reporting unverified penicillin allergy undergoing penicillin allergy evaluation with ≥ 5 participants were included. Case reports, non-peer-reviewed sources, and studies regarding desensitization of verified penicillin-allergic patients were excluded.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Title/abstract review, full text review, and data extraction were completed independently by two authors. Conflicts were resolved by a third author. Studies were evaluated using validated quality assessment tools.

Results

Nineteen studies (N = 2085) were eligible for inclusion. In total 1956 (93.81%) participants were delabelled through various approaches: direct oral challenge (18.61%), penicillin skin test and oral challenge (51.12%), penicillin skin test and intravenous challenge (2.97%), penicillin skin test alone (18.00%), history review (1.94%), and methods not specified (7.41%). Acceptance of penicillin allergy evaluation was 60.88%. Overall, 17 mild and 8 mild-delayed allergy-related adverse reactions occurred, requiring minimal intervention. There were 3 severe allergy-related adverse reactions: 2 participants experiencing anaphylaxis (managed with intramuscular epinephrine and observation); and 1 patient with a mild drug-induced hepatitis (resolved with observation). No hospital transfers were required. No adverse antenatal events were recorded.

Conclusion

Penicillin allergy evaluation in pregnancy is safe, effective and acceptable to patients. The case is strong for expanding access to optimize antimicrobial therapy, reduce antibiotic resistance, and improve outcomes for pregnant people and neonates.

### Penicillin allergy delabeling: a multidisciplinary opportunity [^117RLo8v]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The penicillin allergy label has been consistently linked with deleterious effects that span the health care spectrum, including suboptimal clinical outcomes, the emergence of bacterial resistance, and increased health care expenditures. These risks have recently motivated professional organizations and public health institutes to advocate for the implementation of penicillin allergy delabeling initiatives; however, the burden of delabeling millions of patients is too expansive for any one discipline to bear alone. This review presents the unique perspectives and roles of various stakeholder groups involved in penicillin allergy diagnosis, assessment, and delabeling; we emphasize opportunities, barriers, and promising areas of innovation. We summarize penicillin allergy methods and tools that have proven successful in delabeling efforts. A multidisciplinary approach to delabeling patients with reported penicillin allergy, bolstered by evidence-based clinical practices, is recommended to reduce the risks that associate with the penicillin allergy label.

### Antibiotic stewardship interventions improve choice of antibiotic prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty in patients with reported penicillin allergies [^112szDKe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most patients who report a penicillin allergy can tolerate cefazolin, the preferred prophylaxis in a total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Regardless, patients with a reported penicillin allergy are less likely to receive first-line perioperative antibiotics as a result of inaccurate penicillin allergy documentation and misconceptions regarding cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporins. The over-reporting of penicillin allergies and the safety of cephalosporins in patients with reported penicillin allergies have been well established throughout the evidence [13].

Questions/Purposes

The study sought to answer two questions: (1) Do antibiotic stewardship interventions improve adherence to appropriate prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with a documented penicillin allergy undergoing primary TJA? (2) What is the risk of allergic or adverse reactions secondary to cefazolin use in patients with a documented penicillin allergy?

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of orthopaedic patients older than 18 years who underwent a primary elective TJA at a 261-bed community hospital. The study had two periods: the preintervention period ran from March 1, 2017 to August 30, 2017 and the postintervention period was from March 1, 2019 to August 30, 2019. A total of 396 patients with a history of a documented penicillin allergy underwent a THA or TKA during the study periods. After reviewing every fourth patient with a history of a documented penicillin allergy who met study inclusion criteria and excluding those patients who had a codocumented cephalosporin allergy, a total of 180 patients with a documented penicillin allergy were evaluated (90 patients in the preintervention group and 90 patients in the postintervention group). To answer our first study question, regarding whether antibiotic stewardship interventions improve adherence to appropriate prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with a documented penicillin allergy undergoing primary TJA, we evaluated appropriate antibiotic usage pre- and postintervention. To answer our second study question, concerning the risk of allergic or adverse reactions secondary to cefazolin use in patients with a documented penicillin allergy, we reviewed signs of allergic reactions in patients who received cefazolin for a primary TJA and had a documented penicillin allergy.

Results

Postintervention antibiotic use was more appropriate (91% [82 of 90] versus 54% [49 of 90], risk ratio 1.67 [95% confidence interval 1.37 to 2.04]; p < 0.01), particularly in patients with nonsevere allergy (preintervention: 47% [36 of 76] versus postintervention: 96% [76 of 79]; p < 0.01). No patients had signs of an allergic reaction related to cefazolin, including eight patients with severe penicillin allergy.

Conclusion

A multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention increased the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis in elective primary TJA. Patients with nonsevere penicillin allergies, even those reporting hives or local swelling, tolerated cefazolin. Antibiotic stewardship interventions can be implemented across institutions to expand cephalosporin use in patients with a reported penicillin allergy within orthopaedic TJA patients.

Beta-lactam class alternatives — carbapenem use with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergy: guidance on administration of carbapenems to patients with penicillin allergy has also changed since the last drug allergy practice parameter update, and we now suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional precautions regardless of whether the reaction was anaphylactic.

### Penicillin skin testing in the evaluation and management of penicillin allergy [^111WoAJA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

to review the role of penicillin skin testing in the evaluation and management of penicillin allergy mediated by IgE.

Data Sources

PubMed and OVID search of English-language articles regarding penicillin allergy, penicillin allergy testing, and management of penicillin allergy.

Study Selection

articles pertinent to the subject matter were selected and reviewed.

Results

the major determinant (benzylpenicillin polylysine) detects the greatest number of penicillin allergic patients during skin testing, and the minor determinants of penicillin increase the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing. Penicillin skin testing to the major and minor determinants was found to have a negative predictive value of 97% to 99%. The incidence of systemic adverse reaction to penicillin skin testing is less than 1%.

Conclusion

a detailed history of the prior reaction to penicillin is an integral part of the evaluation, but it is not accurate in predicting a positive penicillin skin test result. A patient with a negative penicillin skin test result to the major and minor determinants is at a low risk of an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin. Patients with a positive skin test result should undergo desensitization to penicillin or an alternative antibiotic should be considered.

### Recommendations for the management of β-lactam intolerance [^111NEp1z]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Beta-lactam intolerance, most of which is not IgE or even immunologically mediated even though it is commonly called an "allergy", can be safely managed using the following seven steps: 1. Avoid testing, re-challenging, or desensitizing individuals with histories of beta-lactam associated toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, severe hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, or hemolytic anemia. 2. Avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, especially in the setting of viral infections. 3. Expect new intolerances to be reported after 0.5 to 4% of all antibiotic utilizations, dependent on gender and the specific antibiotic used. 4. Expect a higher incidence of new intolerances in individuals with three or more medication intolerances already noted in their medical records. 5. For individuals with an appropriate penicillin class antibiotic intolerance based on a history of anaphylaxis, urticaria, macular papular rashes, unknown symptoms, or symptoms not excluded in step one, proceed with penicillin skin testing. Skin test with penicilloyl-poly-lysine and native penicillin. If skin test is negative, proceed with an oral amoxicillin challenge. If skin test and oral challenge are negative, penicillin class antibiotics may be used. If skin test or oral challenge is positive, avoid penicillin class antibiotics. If skin test or oral challenge is positive, non-penicillin-beta-lactams may be used, unless there is a history of intolerance to a specific non-penicillin-beta-lactam, then avoid that specific non-penicillin-beta-lactam. If there is life-threatening infection that can only be treated with a penicillin class antibiotic, proceed with oral penicillin desensitization prior to any oral or parenteral penicillin use. 6. For individuals with an appropriate non-penicillin-beta-lactam intolerance, avoid re-exposure to the beta-lactam implicated. An alternative beta-lactam may be used, ideally with different side chains. Penicillin allergy testing is not useful in the management of non-penicillin-beta-lactam intolerance. Non-penicillin-beta-lactam skin testing is not clinically useful and should not be done outside of a research setting. If the non-penicillin-beta-lactam implicated is needed to treat a life-threatening infection, proceed with desensitization. 7. Be ready to treat anaphylaxis with all parenteral beta-lactam use.

### Survey of obstetric providers to assess the knowledge and management of a reported penicillin allergy in pregnant women [^112y6W6d]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy in the United States; however, less than 10% of individuals labeled with a penicillin allergy are truly allergic. A reported penicillin allergy in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Despite recommendations for penicillin allergy testing in pregnancy, limited literature regarding obstetric providers' comfort and knowledge in addressing penicillin allergy and referral patterns exists. The objective of this study is to survey obstetric providers to assess their clinical practice patterns and baseline penicillin allergy knowledge, identify potential knowledge gaps in the management of pregnant patients with reported penicillin allergy, and measure the impact of an educational intervention on provider knowledge and practice patterns.

Study Design

An anonymous, electronic 23-question survey administered to all obstetric providers at a single academic medical center assessed obstetric provider characteristics, self-reported antibiotic practice patterns, and antibiotic allergy knowledge before (June 19, 2020) and after (September 16, 2020) a penicillin allergy educational intervention, which consisted of multiple small-group educational sessions and a culminating departmental educational session. Discrete knowledge comparison by provider type and experience level of pre- and postintervention was performed using chi-square tests.

Results

Of 277 obstetric providers invited, 124 (45%) responded preintervention and 62 (22%) postintervention. In total, 27% correctly identified the percentage of patients labeled penicillin allergic who would tolerate penicillins, 45% identified cephalosporin cross-reactivity, 59% understood penicillin allergies can wane, and 54% identified penicillin skin testing (PST) as a valid allergy verification tool. Among 48 respondents who attended educational sessions and responded postintervention, their knowledge of penicillin allergy waning (79% preeducation vs. 98% posteducation, p < 0.01) and PST as a valid tool for penicillin allergy verification (50% preeducation vs. 83% posteducation, p < 0.01) improved.

Conclusion

Knowledge gaps related to penicillin allergy exist among obstetric providers. Educational initiatives may improve provider knowledge, help in the identification of patients requiring penicillin allergy evaluation, and reduce referral barriers.

Key Points

· Obstetric providers lack adequate knowledge of penicillin allergy. · Educational interventions can improve discrete knowledge. · Limited knowledge is a barrier to allergy referral for penicillin allergy delabeling.

### Understanding penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity, and antibiotic selection in the preoperative setting [^115uPo2Y]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Penicillin allergies are reported by 8% to 15% of the US population, but up to 95% of these allergies do not correspond to a true allergy when tested. Recent studies have demonstrated that having a penicillin allergy label (PAL) results in a 50% increased odds of surgical site infection among patients reporting a penicillin allergy entirely attributable to the use of a beta-lactam alternative antibiotic (primarily clindamycin or vancomycin). This study provides a review of the prevalence of PAL, the cross-reactivity with cefazolin, immunogenic components of cefazolin and penicillin, and current guidelines for preoperative antibiotic selection in patients with PALs. On understanding these principles, a new set of guidelines and a risk stratification tool are proposed for assessing allergies and determining appropriate antibiotic choice, dosage, and timing in the orthopaedic preoperative setting.

### Improving routine prenatal penicillin allergy testing for reported penicillin allergy [^1177a8eK]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Because most pregnant patients have decades of future life expectancy, the value of penicillin allergy testing and de-labelling during pregnancy may manifest across many years. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends routine performance of penicillin allergy testing for patients with a history of penicillin allergy, in part to promote antibiotic stewardship and also to encourage adherence to guideline-directed optimal antibiotic therapy for GBS prophylaxis in pregnancy. In our patient population, 93% (94/101) of patients who completed penicillin allergy testing were subsequently de-labelled as allergic. Among these 94 patients, the subset of 17 who tested positive for GBS were able to be treated with penicillin in accordance with current guidelines. Our results support the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of routine penicillin allergy testing in pregnancy. Further research is needed to examine cost-effectiveness of this approach, the impact of testing over the lifetime of the patient and to identify strategies to maximise uptake of testing among eligible populations.

### Standardized testing and written communication improve patient understanding of β-lactam allergy testing outcomes: a multicenter, prospective study [^114cLGfu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Eighteen to 25% of hospital inpatients report an antibiotic allergy. Such patients have longer hospital stays, more Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci infections, and a greater chance of intensive care admission and in-hospital mortality, and incur higher costs than do patients without an antibiotic allergy label. Up to 54% of reported antibiotic allergies are to the beta-lactams, commonly referred to as "penicillin allergy".

Delabeling refers to the assessment and testing required to disprove a patient has an immune-mediated reaction to a medication. Antibiotic allergy delabeling can be time and resource-intensive, and requires dedicated challenge clinics and specialized health care staff trained in skin prick and intradermal testing techniques and interpretation and in the management of anaphylaxis. Although many expert consensus guidelines exist, there are no current standardized methods for assessing risk before proceeding to an antibiotic challenge, no standardized testing protocols, and no standards for communicating results to patients and other clinicians to ensure uptake of recommendations.

Antibiotic allergy testing generally results in 80% to 90% of patients being delabeled. However, a recent survey of Australian hospital specialists and pharmacists identified significant barriers to testing, including 42% of respondents who were either unaware of, or did not have access to, antibiotic allergy testing services. Furthermore, there are no published data to demonstrate effectiveness and long-term safety of allergy label removal. A retrospective study with telephone follow-up in Western Australia found that only 50% of delabeled patients were following posttesting recommendations, mainly due to ongoing patient or general practitioner reservations despite the negative testing.

We hypothesized that implementation of an evidence-based, standardized protocol with accurate result dissemination for beta-lactam allergy delabeling would improve testing practices, the proportion of patients appropriately delabeled, and patient understanding 8 weeks after testing.

### Effectiveness and safety of algorithm for treating pregnant women with syphilis and history of immediate allergy to penicillin [^115oD9G6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment should begin immediately after a positive syphilis diagnosis in pregnant women, unless the patient has recently received appropriate treatment, which must be documented in writing. The only proven effective therapy for gestational syphilis is benzathine penicillin, as its bioavailability ensures adequate treatment for both the mother and the fetus, thereby safeguarding them.

Anaphylaxis, a medical emergency with rising incidence and prevalence, poses a risk of fatal outcomes. During pregnancy, the most common cause of anaphylaxis is antibiotic administration, particularly penicillin, followed by anesthetic medications. According to European data, the reported incidence of anaphylaxis during pregnancy and childbirth ranges from 1.44 to 2.7 cases per 100,000 births. The estimated maternal mortality rate due to anaphylaxis in pregnancy is 0.09 per 100,000 live births.

However, there is an overdiagnosis of penicillin allergy, and a label of penicillin allergy should be considered and addressed as a threat to both the individual and to public health. Therefore, clinical histories of immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHRs) to the drug should be thoroughly evaluated and investigated. This approach ensures that pregnant women with a history of syphilis and reported penicillin allergy receive appropriate management of their condition. Patients should be assessed for risk of reexposure to the drug, and if necessary, they should either undergo desensitization for treatment or be delabeled through drug provocation testing.

Rapid drug desensitization is a therapeutic procedure that temporarily suppresses hypersensitivity responses, enabling patients to safely receive a medication that previously triggered an IHR. This is accomplished by gradually increasing the drug dose until the full therapeutic dose of the involved medication is established, minimizing the risk of severe or life-threatening reactions. The primary objectives of rapid drug desensitization are to successfully administer the full therapeutic dose of the involved drug and to complete the procedure without breakthrough reactions, a process referred to as silent desensitization.

We recently conducted a study demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a structured algorithm for guiding penicillin reexposure in pregnant women with syphilis and a reported history of IHR to penicillin. We found that our algorithm was too conservative when assessing clinical history to determine the risk of patients experiencing a reaction on reexposure to penicillin, so we refined the risk stratification criteria that were based on clinical history, increased the number of patients, and conducted a new interventional study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the modified algorithm for guiding penicillin reexposure in this population.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^114YP4n6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Carbapenems — patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy: We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional precautions (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Certainty of Evidence: Moderate). The overall reported incidence of carbapenem allergy is 0.3%-3.7%. In a systematic review including 838 patients with proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, carbapenem reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients (95% CI: 3.1%-5.9%), and among those with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295) only 1 (0.3%; 95% CI: 0.006%-1.9%) reacted. Another meta-analysis of 11 observational studies (1127 patients) found cross-reactivity to any carbapenem as 0.87% (95% CI: 0.32%-2.32%), and in a prospective study of 211 patients with skin test–confirmed penicillin allergy all tolerated carbapenems. Patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy histories, as long as it is not a severe delayed cutaneous or organ-involved reaction, can receive carbapenems without prior testing, though in certain situations such as multiple drug allergy or significant patient anxiety a graded drug challenge might be preferred.

### Antibiotic choice for group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114wMQR6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vertical transmission of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is the most common cause of early onset neonatal sepsis and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in the newborn. To date, the only effective strategy to reduce the risk of early onset neonatal GBS disease is intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis in mothers who are known or suspected to be colonized with GBS. Implementation of national guidelines has led to a drastic decline of early onset neonatal GBS sepsis, with a nearly 8-fold decrease since 1990. Beta-lactam antibiotics, specifically penicillin and cephalosporins, are considered first-line for GBS prophylaxis because they are highly effective, have a narrow spectrum of activity, and are less likely to result in antibiotic-related complications. Unfortunately, a penicillin allergy is commonly reported with roughly 10% of the U.S. population reporting a history of a penicillin allergy, although most are unverified. The existing literature shows that there is significant variability in appropriate antibiotic selection for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis, particularly for pregnant individuals who report a penicillin allergy. Alternative antibiotics, such as clindamycin and vancomycin, are often used for patients who report a penicillin allergy even though most have a low-risk allergy or do not have a confirmed true allergy. Inappropriate use of beta-lactam alternatives has been associated with worse outcomes for non-pregnant patients and increased healthcare utilization costs. In pregnant patients, being labeled with a penicillin allergy has been associated with increased maternal morbidities and longer length of hospital stay. However, less is known about the impact of a maternal beta-lactam allergy label on the neonate in the setting of GBS prophylaxis.

While studies have shown that alternative antibiotics such as clindamycin and vancomycin can reach therapeutic levels in the fetus, they have not been demonstrated to effectively prevent neonatal GBS disease and may in fact be associated with increased rates of neonatal early-onset GBS disease. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not consider these antibiotics to be adequate prophylaxis. If a pregnant mother receives alternative antibiotics and then experiences any risk factors for neonatal GBS infection, such as fever, preterm labor or prolonged rupture of membranes, the neonate must be considered at higher risk of early onset GBS infection. During the time of our data collection (2005–2018), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that this subset of higher risk infants should undergo laboratory testing to assess for infection, with some of these infants going on to receive empiric antibiotics if labs were abnormal.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for preventing surgical site infection [^116JDHPU]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy (PA) evaluation for surgical prophylaxis — patients who report a PA may be evaluated for true hypersensitivity and high-risk reactions, and delabeling a penicillin-allergic patient can facilitate appropriate use of a preoperative prophylactic beta-lactam antibiotic and improve outcomes (Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence). PA labels are common ("8% to 25%"), yet in a test-dose study 40 of 1046 patients (3.8%) had confirmed beta-lactam hypersensitivity and only 3 had a severe reaction. PA reporting has been associated with increased SSI risk (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02–2.22) and with less cefazolin use (12% vs 92%; p < 0.001) and more clindamycin (49% vs 3%; p < 0.001), vancomycin (35% vs 3%; p < 0.001), and gentamicin (24% vs 3%; p < 0.001). Another study found higher SSI among those reporting PA versus those without penicillin or cephalosporin allergy (OR 3.26; 95% CI, 2.71–3.93), underscoring the importance of delabeling.

### Penicillin and beta-lactam hypersensitivity [^113SAAeH]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Ten percent of patients report penicillin allergy, but more than 90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillins. Skin testing remains the optimal method for evaluation of possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy and is recommended by professional societies, as the harms for alternative antibiotics include antimicrobial resistance, prolonged hospitalizations, readmissions, and increased costs. Removal of penicillin allergy leads to decreased utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There is minimal allergic cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins. IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins is usually side-chain specific and may warrant graded challenge with cephalosporins containing dissimilar R1 or R2 group side chains.

### Diagnosis and management of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins [^1142FnYh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Cephalosporins are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of antibiotics. Immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with use of a specific cephalosporin, as a cross-reaction between different cephalosporins or as a cross-reaction to other β-lactam antibiotics, namely, penicillin. Historically, frequent reports of anaphylaxis following administration of first- and second-generation cephalosporins to patients with a history of penicillin allergy led to the belief of a high degree of allergic cross-reactivity. More recent evidence reveals a significantly lower risk of cross-reactivity between penicillins and the newer-generation cephalosporins. The current thought is that a shared side chain, rather than the β-lactam ring structure, is the determining factor in immunologic cross-reactivity. Understanding the chemical structure of these agents has allowed us to identify the allergenic determinants for penicillin; however, the exact allergenic determinants of cephalosporins are less well understood. For this reason, standardized diagnostic skin testing is not available for cephalosporins as it is for penicillin. Nevertheless, skin testing to the cephalosporin in question, using a nonirritating concentration, provides additional information, which can further guide the work-up of a patient suspected of having an allergy to that drug. Together, the history and the skin test results can assist the allergist in the decision to recommend continued drug avoidance or to perform a graded challenge versus an induction of tolerance procedure.

Penicillin allergy evaluation — absence of validated reagents (Summary Statement 213): In the absence of validated skin test reagents, the approach to patients with a history of penicillin allergy relies on management options in which therapeutic options include (1) prescribing an alternative antibiotic, (2) performing a graded challenge, and (3) performing penicillin desensitization (D), recognizing that penicilloyl-polylysine, the major determinant of penicillin, is not commercially available and that testing without the major determinant fails to identify most penicillin allergic patients; selection between graded challenge and desensitization is based on the reaction description, time since reaction, and comorbid conditions.

### Addressing inpatient beta-lactam allergies: a multihospital implementation [^1163G74v]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Addressing inaccurate penicillin allergies is encouraged as part of antibiotic stewardship in the inpatient setting. However, implementing interventions targeted at the 10% to 15% of inpatients reporting a previous penicillin allergy can pose substantial logistic challenges. We implemented a computerized guideline for patients with reported beta-lactam allergy at 5 hospitals within a single health care system in the Boston area. In this article, we describe our implementation roadmap, including both successes achieved and challenges faced. We explain key implementation steps, including assembling a team, stakeholder engagement, developing or selecting an approach, spreading the change, establishing measures, and measuring impact. The objective was to detail the lessons learned while empowering others to be part of this important, multidisciplinary work to improve the care of patients with reported beta-lactam allergies.

Limitations and challenges in the diagnosis of penicillin allergy

There are several diagnostic challenges associated with penA diagnosis. Although detection of penicillin-specific IgE antibodies can be helpful in patients with genuine penA, low sensitivity and low specificity limit it's utility to specialist settings. Integrated methods, combining clinical history, laboratory testing, and drug provocation tests, are advocated for accurate penA diagnosis in high-risk patients, but there are variations in sensitivities, specificities, safety profiles, and patient outcomes between serum IgE testing and skin testing. In low-risk patients, the predictive value of skin testing diminishes, and it is not uncommon to have positive serum penicillin specific IgE tests in a patient with a history not suggestive of an IgE-mediated allergy. This discrepancy raises questions about the predictive value of these tests in patients with low-risk penA histories and complicate clinical decision-making, with drug provocation tests (DPTs) the gold standard test to rule out penA.

Penicillin allergy testing in low-risk patients: a call for a consensus

There is broad agreement on the need to risk stratify patients with a penA label to ensure only those with a very low risk of a serious reaction to penicillin are tested outside specialist settings. There is also agreement that such patients can receive a direct DPT without the need for prior skin testing and serum penicillin specific IgE. Beyond these broad principles there is heterogeneity in guidance and practice that hampers implementation and assessment of the effectiveness of interventions –. The differences reflect variation in the definitions used and in the general approach to risk; some approaches reflecting highly risk averse practice while others are more pragmatic. Studies differ in their inclusion of patients who report urticarial rashes, their definitions of 'benign' rashes, and the time period since reactions occurred that constitutes a low risk. Most, but surprisingly not all, exclude patients with a history consistent with anaphylaxis. Exclusion criteria for oral challenge testing based on comorbidities and current medication vary widely. To assess safety and effectiveness of penA assessment pathways more robustly, it would seem sensible to define a standard - against which future developments could be evaluated. There are now several published national and international PADL guidelines with consensus statements for some of the key elements of penicillin allergy de-labelling informed by recent research data and expert opinion. These might be improved further by undertaking a Delphi consensus or similar process to reach consensus on current issues where there remain inconsistencies between guidance and develop international guidelines.

Beta-lactams — initial evaluation and delabeling (CBS 4–7) — We recommend that a proactive effort should be made to delabel patients with reported penicillin allergy, if appropriate. We recommend against any testing in patients with a history inconsistent with penicillin allergy (such as headache, family history of penicillin allergy, or diarrhea), but a 1-step amoxicillin challenge may be offered to patients who are anxious or request additional reassurance to accept the removal of a penicillin allergy label. We suggest penicillin skin testing for patients with a history of anaphylaxis or a recent reaction suspected to be IgE-mediated. We recommend against the routine use of multiple-day challenges in the evaluation of penicillin allergy.

### Penicillin allergy evaluation should be performed proactively in patients with a penicillin allergy label [^112n11XW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy risk stratification and testing approaches — The PEN-FAST rule is a validated tool for clinicians to aid risk stratification of adults with a penicillin allergy label, and directly challenging low risk patients without prior skin testing demonstrates a low reaction rate from 4–10%. Penicillin skin testing (PST) is reserved for patients with a history of anaphylaxis or a recent reaction suspected to be IgE-mediated, and PST may also be preferred for patients with multiple drug allergies and higher risk conditions. PST carries minimal risk and, with education and training, can be performed by non-allergist physicians, pharmacists, and advanced practice providers (APPs), while the new option of employing direct oral challenges improves the accessibility of penicillin evaluations with great promise to increase delabeling. Contraindications to evaluation via PST or direct oral challenge include a history of severe cutaneous adverse reactions to beta-lactams, such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Allergy history-based evaluation and risk stratification tools can assess patients across all common drug allergy classes. Given the high prevalence of drug allergy labels and low rate of drug hypersensitivity confirmation, it is essential to identify those who are low-risk, as these individuals may be able to continue their care without an allergy specialist evaluation with the use of standardized collaborative protocols for rechallenge or desensitization. We recommend that all hospitals and ambulatory centers work with allergy specialists to consider low-risk approaches for each drug category to optimize the quality and safety of care (Figure 1). Low-risk patients and patients with non — immune-mediated reactions could be evaluated outside the allergy setting or with telehealth (e-consults) guiding care. Then, allergists could focus on the patients reporting moderate/high-risk reactions (eg, PEN-FAST more than 3) or higher-risk hosts (eg, patients with cystic fibrosis on home oxygen, pregnancy, pending bypass surgery, and hemodynamically unstable).

Any collaborative approach that includes nonallergists should include clear protocols, informed consent training, allergy record documentation training, and anaphylaxis training. All clinical sites where drug challenges or desensitizations are supervised should be equipped to diagnose and treat anaphylaxis. Finally, standardized recommendations for patients should be provided regarding the risk of reactions in the future. Patients with a reaction after delabeling should be instructed to document their reaction and seek evaluation by allergy/immunology.

There has been a recent paradigm shift in drug allergy, whereby allergy specialist assessment may not be necessary for all low-risk drug allergy patients, particularly for the low-risk penicillin allergyelabeled patient. Additional work is required to identify the best approach for non — β-lactam antibiotics, NSAIDs, contrast agents, and chemotherapeutics.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to β-lactam antibiotics [^11649gzS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians commonly encounter patients with a history of allergy to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, since about 10% of the population reports such an allergy. At the same time, it is known that about 90% of these patients are not truly allergic and could safely receive beta-lactam antibiotics. Instead, these patients are treated unnecessarily with alternate broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increases costs and contributes to the development and spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria. In the case of penicillin, relevant allergenic determinants that elicit immune responses are known. Hence, validated diagnostic skin testing to detect the presence of drug-specific IgE antibodies is available. For non-penicillin beta-lactams, the immunogenic determinants that are produced by degradation are unknown, and diagnostic skin testing is of more limited value. Ideally, patients with a history of penicillin allergy should be evaluated when they are well and not in immediate need of antibiotic therapy. Patients who are found to be penicillin skin test-negative may be safely treated with all beta-lactam antibiotics. Penicillin skin test-positive patients should only receive a penicillin-class antibiotic via rapid desensitization, and only in cases when an alternative agent cannot be substituted. Penicillin skin test-positive patients may be safely treated with monobactams. The extent of allergic cross-reactivity between penicillin arid cephalosporins/carbapenems is uncertain; therefore penicillin skin test-positive patients should only receive these antibiotics via cautious graded challenge or desensitization. Identification of patients who erroneously carry a label of beta-lactam allergy leads to improved utilization of antibiotics and slows the spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria.

Beta-lactam cross-reactivity — management of penicillin and cephalosporin allergy: several studies indicate that the risk of cross-reactivity among beta-lactams is lower than previous reports suggested, and for management approaches, we suggest stratifying patients based on anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories as well as verified versus unverified (unconfirmed) penicillin allergy. We suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be administered routinely without testing or additional precautions; for example, patients with a history of urticaria to a penicillin can receive any cephalosporin routinely without prior testing; in contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a penicillin, we suggest a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin (eg, cefazolin) can be administered routinely without prior testing. For patients with a primary allergy to cephalosporin, we suggest a similar approach: stratifying patients based on anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories, as well as verified versus unverified cephalosporin allergy; we suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a penicillin can be administered without testing or additional precautions, for example, patients with a prior history of urticaria to cephalexin can receive amoxicillin without prior testing; in contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a cephalosporin, we suggest penicillin skin testing and drug challenge be performed prior to administration of penicillin therapy.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of drug allergies in obstetrics and gynecology: an expert review [^1134Chrr]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug allergies, specifically antibiotic allergies, are frequently encountered in obstetrics and gynecology, with 10% of the US population reporting a penicillin allergy. This poses a particular challenge to the obstetrician-gynecologist, as beta-lactam antibiotics are indicated as first-line therapy for the treatment and prevention of most specialty-specific infections. Alternative antibiotic use in the setting of a reported allergy is not benign and has been associated with increased cesarean delivery, endometritis, wound complication, length of hospital stay in pregnant patients, Group B Streptococcus sepsis, neonatal length of stay, neonatal laboratory draw in neonates born to patients with allergies, and surgical site infection in gynecologic patients. Furthermore, alternative antibiotic use leads to increased antibiotic resistance, toxicity, and healthcare cost. In addition, the administration of antibiotics in a patient with a history of type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction poses a risk of anaphylaxis with repeat exposure. Fortunately, > 90% of patients who report a penicillin allergy are not truly allergic and would tolerate penicillins if administered. This can be due to either mislabeling of the index reaction as an allergy (when it was due to a drug intolerance or a viral exanthem) or waning immunoglobulin E-mediated immunity over time. Given this, allergy evaluation is widely recommended, even in pregnancy. Allergy evaluation involves detailed patient history and allergy testing with skin testing and/or oral challenge, as appropriate. These tools have been found to be safe and effective in gravid and nongravid individuals and to result in increased use of first-line antibiotics when used appropriately. Furthermore, even in the setting of a true penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity with cephalosporins is extremely low and estimated at 2% to 3% among patients with a verified penicillin allergy and considerably lower than this among patients with an unverified penicillin allergy. Guidelines support the routine use of cephalosporins without testing or additional precautions in patients with an unverified nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy and the routine use of structurally dissimilar cephalosporins (specifically Ancef) even in patients with an anaphylactic penicillin allergy. In cases in which there is no appropriate alternative antibiotic than that for which the patient is allergic, such as syphilis in a pregnant patient with penicillin allergy, desensitization can be performed. This process involves temporary induction of drug tolerance through exposure to small amounts of the allergen until a therapeutic dose is achieved and has been safely performed in pregnancy. Desensitization requires expert supervision and is most often performed in the intensive care setting with a multidisciplinary team. The other 2 most common antibiotic allergies encountered in the field of obstetrics and gynecology are cephalosporin and metronidazole allergies. Cephalosporin allergies are managed similarly to penicillin allergies with readily available skin testing and oral challenge. Skin testing for metronidazole allergy lacks sensitivity and specificity, and thus, oral challenge or desensitization procedure is the preferred approach for low-risk and high-risk patients, respectively. When it comes to drug allergies, specifically antibiotic allergies, the role of the obstetrician-gynecologist is to identify patients with reported allergies and to refer patients to a specialist for further evaluation as soon as possible. Allergy evaluation using a detailed patient history and allergy testing (skin testing and/or oral challenge) when indicated has been shown to be safe and effective and is an important part of antibiotic stewardship.

Validating Penicillin or Another ß-Lactam Antibiotic Allergy

Evaluating a patient who reports a penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy involves three steps: 1) obtaining a thorough medical history, including previous exposures to penicillin or other ß-lactam antibiotics; 2) performing a skin test evaluation by using the penicillin major and minor determinants; and 3) among those who have a negative penicillin skin test, performing an observed oral challenge with 250 mg amoxicillin before proceeding directly to treatment with the indicated ß-lactam therapy.

For persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin (either to the major or minor determinants), treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used. For persons among whom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic (e.g. a patient with neurosyphilis or a pregnant woman with syphilis) and among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction of penicillin tolerance (also referred to as desensitization) is required. Desensitization protocols to penicillin should be performed by allergists, and they require a monitored inpatient environment.

### Antibiotic choice for group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114mFugh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study showed that most individuals in our cohort with a documented penicillin allergy received alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their neonates were more likely to have laboratory blood draws (deviation from routine clinical care) compared to those of mothers without a documented penicillin allergy. Most individuals with documented penicillin allergy should be able to safely receive penicillin or cefazolin, unless specifically deemed to be at high risk for anaphylaxis. Determining why medical providers disproportionately choose vancomycin or clindamycin over cefazolin will be important going forward to improve adherence to current best-practice GBS prophylaxis guidelines. There is a clear need for implementing healthcare provider education regarding antibiotic selection in penicillin allergic patients and the role of penicillin testing in pregnancy to improve appropriate and targeted antibiotic choice and impact on newborn infants born to GBS positive mothers. Over 90% of patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are not truly allergic. As such, in August 2019 (notably after our study data was collected), the ACOG Committee Opinion on the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in newborns was updated and now "encourages the expansion of the use [of penicillin allergy skin testing] in obstetric patients", as verification of a reported penicillin allergy among pregnant individuals. Penicillin testing during pregnancy remains underutilized, yet our data suggests that there is deviation from routine clinical care and potential adverse impact to neonates born to individuals with penicillin allergy who are treated with alternate GBS intrapartum prophylaxis antibiotics. Provider education and incorporation of screening and testing for penicillin allergy should be considered as part of routine prenatal care to optimize care of the mother-infant dyad.

### Patient-related factors impact the implementation of inpatient antibiotic allergy delabeling [^117VmycM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

We recommend verification of reported antibiotic allergy as contemporaneously as possible to the index reaction, and adherence to quality practices to prevent relabeling. including documentation in medical records, communication with other health providers, and patient counseling. Thereafter, targeting, systematically, patients in the preoperative stages of elective surgical planning, and in the early "workup" stages of cancer or chronic disease management, the value of doing this has been demonstrated. Reducing prevalent AAL requires a concerted multidisciplinary effort. Commonly, medication discrepancies are found at the time of hospital admission or discharge. Nurses could, while completing admission documentation, ensure escalation of patient-reported antibiotic allergy for clinical action, working with pharmacists who are required to conduct medication reconciliations at the end of the next calendar day following the day of admission. If the label is not evaluated at the current admission, then discharge documentation should communicate the patient's status with clear recommendations for clinical action. Importantly, documentation must be accurate and precise to prevent incorrect clinical information in perpetuity. Although studies point to the cost-effectiveness of adopting a systematic approach to tackling the high rate of AAL in hospitals and we acknowledge that delabeling patients at point of care appears expedient, we argue that earlier, multifaceted intervention is required. Although outpatient assessment of high-risk patients remains appropriate, evaluation of putative and low-risk penicillin allergies, including those in children, could be carried out in community settings by primary physicians. In effect this is where most antibiotics are prescribed, and where individual and societal benefits can accrue across the lifespan.

Conclusion

This study highlights the complexity of antibiotic allergy delabeling in the acute care context, and provides recommendations to reduce the prevalence of spurious labels, and recurrence of relabeling.

Clinical implications

This article is a cautionary tale highlighting the barriers, health costs, and complexities associated with inpatient antibiotic allergy delabeling in the context of acute care medicine.

How Studies Were Selected Based on Titles and Abstracts/Full Papers

The search results were imported into EndNote 20, and the duplicates were removed. The remaining records were then imported into Rayyan for double-blind screening by two reviewers. The blinding was inactivated when the screening was finished to resolve the conflicts.

Data Extraction

We used Microsoft Excel and Review Manager 5.4 (RevMan) for data management and analysis.

A reviewer extracted the data, and another independently double-checked the extracted and analyzed data from all studies.

Quality Assessment

Risk of Bias Assessment

For randomized controlled trials, we planned to use the default data extraction and risk of bias assessment tool embedded within RevMan. The first version of the Risk of Bias tool was used due to concerns regarding the difficulty of version 2, even for experienced users, which may result in delays in publication. This tool consists of seven domains and allows three levels of judgements (low, unclear, or high):
Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Other biases

For non-randomized controlled studies, we planned to use the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP), which assesses eight categories of bias and assigns three levels of strong, moderate, and weak to each of these bias areas:
Selection bias
Study design
Confounders
Blinding
Data collection methods
Withdrawals and drop-outs
Intervention integrity
Analyses

Assessment of Reporting Biases

We planned that if this review includes 10 or more studies, we create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible small‐study biases for the primary outcomes. We also planned to perform a formal statistical test for asymmetry in this case. Since there was only a small number of included studies, the ability to detect publication bias was diminished, so other sources of asymmetry, such as other dissemination biases, differences in the quality of smaller studies, the existence of true heterogeneity, and chance, were considered.

### Reported penicillin allergy in Israel: clinical outcomes and antibiotic costs in a nationwide population-based cohort study [^117P6GeA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

It should be stressed that previous works reported an adverse role of the PA label in specific infectious episodes, as clearly shown in patients with pneumonia. Our work, however, aimed to delineate the burden of the PA label on a large population that is nationally covered by a health maintenance organization.

The key strength of this study lies in its uniquely large community-based sample with nationwide representation. This work provides an exclusive overview of the outpatient setting, whereas a large proportion of previously published data refer to in-hospital patients. On the basis of these data, we have initiated a large-scale campaign of protocol-driven PA delabeling in collaboration with the MHS. Direct oral challenges will be administered by nonallergist physicians to low-risk subjects in emergency medicine centers across the country. The main limitation of our study is that the allergy is documented under the title of drug reactions in EHR allergy modules. Common side effects, intolerances, and immune-mediated hypersensitivities are often documented similarly and without confirmation by diagnostic tests. In addition, the quality of allergy reporting can vary on the basis of clinician expertise and interpretation, producing inconsistent or nonspecific data. Another limitation is inherent to the retrospective design, which relies on existing medical records and may not accurately capture all relevant clinical information.

Conclusion

This study highlights the epidemiological, clinical, and economic implications of recorded PA in the community on a national level. The increased medical expenses and administration of non–beta-lactam agents associated with PA underscore the need for accurate allergy identification and management. Our data will be useful for devising a delabeling strategy that could reduce the harms of erroneous PA diagnosis.

Clinical implications

This account of the multiple aspects of PA-associated burden on the health care system may provide justification and a basis for a future large-scale delabeling project.

### Penicillin skin testing… [^112vP8gX]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Thus, patients with recent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients with remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions in the distant past might no longer be reactive. In a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only 7. 1% of the patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another ß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin allergy, treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used. For persons among whom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic and among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction of penicillin tolerance is required.

Desensitization protocols to penicillin should be performed by allergists, and they require a monitored inpatient environment. Because the remaining 1%–10% of penicillin-allergic patients who are not captured by this penicillin skin test are due to minor determinants IgE antibodies, the standard practice is to follow skin testing with an observed oral challenge of amoxicillin 250 mg with 1 hour of observation. If the skin test and oral challenge are both negative, the risk for IgE-mediated anaphylaxis approaches zero and is equivalent to that of a person who has never reported an allergy to penicillin. Persons with high-risk symptom histories should not be administered penicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting.

Furthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should not receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge in an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation. High-risk symptom histories include development of the following after penicillin or ß-lactam administration: anaphylaxis within 6 hours or severe adverse cutaneous reaction, and other severe non-IgE-mediated reactions.

1requires signs or symptoms in at least two of the following systems:

- **Skin**: Hives, flushing, itching, and/or angioedema
- **Respiratory**: Cough, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheeze, sensation of throat closure or choking, and/or change in voice-quality
- **Cardiovascular**: Hypotension, faintness, tachycardia or less commonly bradycardia, tunnel vision, chest pain, sense of impending doom, and/or loss of consciousness. antibiotics. Based on the patient history and physical exam, additional tests may be needed to confirm a penicillin allergy. Penicillin skin testing and challenge doses are reliable and useful methods for evaluating for IgE-mediated penicillin allergy. 5 A positive result means the patient is likely to have a penicillin allergy. If negative, the skin test is usually followed by an oral penicillin class challenge to safely rule out an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy. 1, 7.
- The current standard of care is to perform a skin test with the major determinant penicilloylpolylysine and commercially-available penicillin G.
- To rule out penicillin allergy, an oral challenge dose can be done after skin testing. The negative predictive value of skin testing with the major and minor determinants is more than 95%, but approaches 100% when followed by a challenge dose.

Patients with other severe hypersensitivity syndromes — like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, serum sickness, acute interstitial nephritis, hemolytic anemia, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms — should not use the offending drug in the future.
