## Question

Why would you use a thiazide diuretic for hypernatremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why a thiazide diuretic would be used for hypernatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of hypernatremia and whether thiazides worsen or improve it. Then, I should verify the paradoxical antidiuretic effect of thiazides in diabetes insipidus and whether that translates into clinical utility for hypernatremia. Next, I will review the evidence base and guideline positions. After that, I need to check safety, monitoring, and alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded recommendation with dosing and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology of hypernatremia. Hypernatremia reflects a net water deficit relative to total body sodium, driven by impaired water intake or excessive water loss, often with impaired urinary concentrating ability; thiazides classically increase renal sodium and water excretion, which would seem to risk worsening hypernatremia by further water loss, so I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions here [^116t7LQg] [^115ZW11r].

> Wait, let me verify the paradoxical effect in diabetes insipidus. In central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thiazides can reduce urine output and increase urine osmolality via volume contraction, which enhances proximal reabsorption and reduces distal delivery of water, thereby decreasing free-water clearance; this is precisely the mechanism that can help prevent or mitigate hypernatremia in polyuric DI states, and it is described in stroke and endocrine sources as well as pediatric DI cohorts [^1127Bs5k] [^111LyQha].

> Hold on, I should confirm the clinical contexts where this is used. The most defensible scenario is adjunctive therapy in diabetes insipidus, particularly when desmopressin is not fully effective, contraindicated, or impractical, and in infants or toddlers with central DI where thiazides have been used safely to reduce polyuria and stabilize sodium, albeit with close monitoring and recognition that some patients will outgrow response or develop hypernatremia if fluids are not matched to ongoing losses [^111LyQha] [^1127Bs5k].

> I need to check the strength of evidence. High-quality randomized data are limited; much of the support comes from observational pediatric series, case-based literature, and pathophysiologic reasoning, so expectations should be modest and individualized, with careful attention to fluid balance and sodium trends rather than assuming a robust, guideline-endorsed indication outside DI contexts [^111LyQha] [^1127Bs5k].

> But wait, what about safety and monitoring. Thiazides can cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and volume depletion, and in older adults or those with impaired thirst or access to water, they may theoretically worsen hypernatremia if fluid losses are not replaced; thus, if used for DI, they should be paired with explicit fluid orders, frequent electrolyte checks, and education to avoid overly rapid correction of chronic hypernatremia, which itself carries neurologic risk [^115HxQeX] [^111MuVEz] [^115YQeus].

> Let me consider alternatives and when thiazides are inappropriate. Desmopressin remains first-line for central DI, and in hypervolemic hypernatremia, thiazides would be contraindicated because they can promote natriuresis and worsen volume depletion; in those settings, management focuses on stopping sodium sources, providing free water, and, if needed, using loop diuretics to facilitate aquaresis while replacing water, rather than thiazides [^113nPcfZ] [^1127Bs5k].

> I should double-check dosing pragmatics. In infants with central DI, typical thiazide dosing has used chlorothiazide 5–10 mg/kg/day or hydrochlorothiazide 1–2 mg/kg/day, with therapy continued until response wanes or desmopressin is initiated; in adults, there is no standardized regimen, so any off-label use would require cautious initiation, low starting doses, and close follow-up of urine output, serum sodium, and potassium, recognizing that the effect is modest and variable [^111LyQha].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: thiazides are not used to treat hypernatremia per se. Rather, they are used to reduce polyuria and free-water clearance in diabetes insipidus, thereby helping prevent recurrent hypernatremia in patients who cannot maintain water balance, with the trade-offs of electrolyte disturbances and the need for vigilant monitoring and fluid management [^1127Bs5k] [^111LyQha].

Thiazide diuretics are **not used to treat hypernatremia**; they are used to manage diabetes insipidus (DI) by reducing urine output and increasing urine osmolality, which helps prevent hypernatremia in DI patients [^1127Bs5k] [^114nfz1w]. Thiazides cause a paradoxical antidiuretic effect in DI by inducing mild volume contraction, increasing proximal tubular reabsorption, and reducing distal water delivery, thereby decreasing polyuria and stabilizing sodium [^1127Bs5k]. They are not indicated for other causes of hypernatremia, and their use should be carefully monitored due to risks of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and volume depletion [^115HxQeX] [^1127Bs5k].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to hypernatremia

Thiazide diuretics inhibit the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, increasing sodium and chloride excretion and promoting diuresis [^11332v2Q]. Initially, this would seem to worsen hypernatremia by increasing water loss; however, in diabetes insipidus, thiazides have a **paradoxical antidiuretic effect** [^1127Bs5k]. This effect arises from mild volume contraction, which increases proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, reducing distal delivery and thereby decreasing urine output and increasing urine osmolality [^1127Bs5k].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting thiazide use in hypernatremia

Thiazides are primarily used to manage diabetes insipidus, a condition characterized by excessive urine output and risk of hypernatremia due to impaired water conservation [^114nfz1w]. Clinical studies and guidelines support thiazide use in DI to reduce polyuria and stabilize sodium levels:

- **Pediatric DI management**: Thiazides have been shown to reduce urine output and increase urine osmolality in infants and toddlers with central diabetes insipidus, helping prevent hypernatremia [^111LyQha].
- **Adult DI management**: Thiazides are recommended as part of the management strategy for diabetes insipidus, particularly when desmopressin is not fully effective or contraindicated [^1127Bs5k].
- **Nephrogenic DI**: Thiazides, often combined with amiloride or NSAIDs, are used to reduce polyuria and manage hypernatremia risk in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^114nfz1w].

---

## Limitations and risks of thiazide use in hypernatremia

While thiazides can be beneficial in diabetes insipidus, their use is associated with several risks and limitations:

- **Hyponatremia**: Thiazides can cause hyponatremia, particularly in elderly patients or those with impaired renal function, necessitating careful monitoring of serum sodium levels [^111oUoRs] [^111CrsJb].
- **Hypokalemia**: Thiazides increase renal potassium excretion, leading to hypokalemia, which may require potassium supplementation or the use of potassium-sparing diuretics [^115HxQeX] [^116F4oYW].
- **Volume depletion**: Thiazides can cause volume depletion, especially in patients with limited access to water or impaired thirst mechanisms, potentially exacerbating hypernatremia if not adequately managed [^115HxQeX] [^115wJxPT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the role of thiazides in managing diabetes insipidus-related hypernatremia but do not recommend their use for other causes of hypernatremia. The Society for Endocrinology recommends thiazides as part of the management strategy for central diabetes insipidus, particularly in pediatric patients [^notfound]. Similarly, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association recommend thiazides for managing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, often in combination with other agents such as amiloride or NSAIDs [^notfound].

---

## Alternative treatments for hypernatremia

For hypernatremia not related to diabetes insipidus, management focuses on correcting the underlying cause and carefully replacing water deficits. Alternative treatments include:

- **Fluid replacement**: Careful administration of water or hypotonic fluids to correct hypernatremia, with close monitoring of serum sodium levels to avoid rapid correction [^111MuVEz] [^115YQeus].
- **Desmopressin**: For central diabetes insipidus, desmopressin (DDAVP) is the primary treatment to reduce urine output and prevent hypernatremia [^113nPcfZ].
- **Loop diuretics**: In hypervolemic hypernatremia, loop diuretics may be used to promote aquaresis and reduce sodium load, although careful monitoring is required [^1127Bs5k].

---

Thiazide diuretics are **not used to treat hypernatremia directly** but are used to manage diabetes insipidus by reducing urine output and increasing urine osmolality, thereby helping prevent hypernatremia in DI patients [^1127Bs5k]. Their use should be carefully monitored due to risks of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and volume depletion [^115HxQeX]. For other causes of hypernatremia, management focuses on correcting the underlying cause and carefully replacing water deficits [^111Jhniq].

While thiazide diuretics decrease efficacy as GFR worsens, several, including chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide appear to remain effective at GFRs < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m², and loop diuretics are often effective at lower GFRs (i.e., < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m²).

THE INTRODUCTION of potent orally administered diuretics has been one of the most significant therapeutic milestones of this century. It has had numerous unanticipated benefits, not the least of which is their key role in the management of hypertension. As with all potent agents, rational and safe use of these drugs is predicated on an understanding of their pharmacologic action and their potential side effects. DIURETIC AGENTS Thiazide and Related Compounds All of the diuretics in Table 1 are sulfonamide derivatives although not all have the benzothiadiazine nucleus. Nevertheless, their pharmacologic properties and their effects on electrolyte excretion are so similar that they will be grouped together under the term "thiazide" for the purposes of this discussion. They inhibit sodium reabsorption in the cortical portion of the ascending tubule and in the distal convoluted tubule, where less than 10% of filtered sodium is reabsorbed. Consequently they are not as potent. Gifford RW.

### Developing prediction models for electrolyte abnormalities in patients indicated for antihypertensive therapy: evidence-based treatment and monitoring recommendations [^117KhcAc]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Various classes of antihypertensive medications are used for blood pressure management, with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, and calcium channel blockers being the most commonly recommended options. Our risk prediction models provide individualized estimates of the risk of developing hyperkalaemia and hyponatraemia, adverse events which are commonly associated with specific antihypertensive drug classes. These models could therefore be useful in clinical decision making regarding which antihypertensive medication class to prescribe. For example, for patients at a high risk of hyperkalaemia but low-average risk of hyponatremia initiating or switching to a thiazide-type diuretic rather than ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers is recommended. Moreover, clinical guidelines for the management of hypertension often recommend combination therapy where monotherapy and lifestyle modifications fail to achieve adequate blood pressure control. In such cases, to reduce potential harm, prescribing combination therapy, such as adding loop diuretics to current prescription in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (avoiding RAAS medications) may also be effective.

Current clinical guidelines recommend monitoring serum electrolytes 1–2 weeks after initiating an RAAS medication, after each increase in dose, and regularly throughout treatment. Similarly, it is advised to measure serum electrolytes before starting a thiazide-type diuretics treatment and regular throughout treatment. In our study, over 44 and 24% of patients with a high risk of CVD also had a high risk of hyponatraemia or hyperkalaemia, respectively. Nearly 40% of patients were not at a high risk of CVD or electrolyte abnormalities. The present clinical prediction models could help target closer monitoring of serum electrolytes for individuals at a higher risk of electrolyte abnormalities after initiating treatment, where resources are limited.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^117AiwWk]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As all monogenic forms of hypertension have sodium retention as the main mechanism of the increase in blood pressure, increasing urinary sodium excretion is a logical and fundamental part of treatment of hypertension. Consistent with this understanding, thiazide diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line antihypertensive options alongside calcium channel blockers and blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, randomized control trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that when compared with placebo or no treatment, blood pressure lowering by these antihypertensive drug classes is accompanied by significant reductions of stroke and major cardiovascular events. In order to differentiate between the three options, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles. Multiple meta-analyses, for instance, have documented concerns that treatment with diuretics could lead to disruptions in electrolyte levels, to unfavorable metabolic effects, and to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. These data, though important, have generated a perhaps disproportionate fear of the side effects that can be associated with diuretic treatment.

### Physiologic approach to diuresis in de-resuscitation phase in intensive care [^112UcXvE]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Lal et al. comments on combination diuretic therapy and electrolyte disturbances are pertinent, but it is prudent to understand that our protocol is intended for the broad intensive care unit population, not only those presenting with acute decompensated heart failure. Such patients represent a small portion of the critically ill population, noted by the 6.6–11.1% incidence of chronic loop diuretic usage and only 2.2–3.3% of admissions secondary to cardiac procedures in our study. Predominate evidence for utilization of hypertonic saline (HTS) as a diuretic adjunct is restricted to patients presenting with heart failure, and current evidence would advise against such in the general critically ill population given that chloride is directly, rather than inversely, associated with mortality while the correlation with sodium may be biphasic. Until further data are available, HTS remains unlikely a feasible addition to broad protocolized approaches at this time. We agree that in patients with chronic exposure to loop diuretics, initial or early combination therapy including thiazides should be considered, particularly given the incidence of hypernatremia in our study.

### Salt and water: a review of hypernatremia [^116t7LQg]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum sodium disorders are generally a marker of water balance in the body. Thus, hypernatremia is most often caused by an overall deficit of total body water. Other unique circumstances may lead to excess salt, without an impact on the body's total water volume. Hypernatremia is commonly acquired in both the hospital and community. As hypernatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, treatment should be initiated promptly. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology and management of the main types of hypernatremia, which can be categorized as either a loss of water or gain of sodium that can be mediated by renal or extrarenal mechanisms.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^116sKgzC]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

SELECTING THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY: DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF ACTION

Historically, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were grouped together as they target the same segment of the distal convoluted tubule. It was thought that the targeting of the sodium-chloride transporter in this part of the kidney tubule mediated the decreases in blood pressure and cardiac output by causing volume loss. The mechanism of action for the blood pressure-lowering effect of diuretics is, in fact, more complex. Only the initial blood pressure reduction (1–2 weeks) is mediated by the kidney: the hypovolemia rapidly stimulates the activation of RAS, which stalls the decrease in blood pressure and results in volume and cardiac output returning almost to baseline. It is the second phase, during which the diuretic treatment targets peripheral vascular resistance and vasodilation that mediates the bulk of the ongoing (4–8 weeks) and long-term blood pressure reduction.

### Understanding hypernatremia [^114itjBg]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Understanding hypernatremia is at times difficult for many clinicians. However, hypernatremia can often be deciphered easily with some basic understanding of water and sodium balance. Here, the basic pathophysiological abnormalities underlying the development of sodium disorders are reviewed, and case examples are given. Hypernatremia often arises in the hospital, especially in the intensive care units due to the combination of (1) not being able to drink water; (2) inability to concentrate the urine (most often from having kidney failure); (3) osmotic diuresis from having high serum urea concentrations, and (4) large urine or stool outputs.

### Severe hyponatremia associated with thiazide diuretic use [^112smTo7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide diuretics are commonly used as first-line antihypertensive agents. Hyponatremia is a reported, though uncommon, complication of thiazide use. Although the exact mechanism of thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH) is unclear, it can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

Case Report

We report a 69-year-old man with generalized weakness beginning 2 weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Evaluation revealed a serum sodium level of 120 mmol/L. The patient was admitted and successfully treated with free water restriction and discontinuation of the HCTZ. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Hyponatremia is an uncommon complication of thiazide diuretic use, which frequently presents with nonspecific symptoms. Identification of TIH is crucial to prevent its potentially life-threatening complications.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^115mohmS]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line treatment options. In order to differentiate between antihypertensives, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles and as a result, has created a perhaps disproportionate fear of the metabolic effects that can be associated with diuretics. Data, however, show that the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is very low, whereas the benefits of volume control and natriuresis are high and the reductions in morbidity and mortality are clinically significant. Moreover, as clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy profiles exist among diuretics, several international guidelines have started making a distinction between thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-like (chlorthalidone, indapamide) diuretics; and some of them now recommend longer acting thiazide-like diuretics. In time, pending more data, chlorthalidone and indapamide may need to be subdivided further into separate classifications.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertension is the most prevalent chronic health condition and the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although antihypertensive treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and death in all ages up to 85 years, it is also associated with potential harms, such as hypotension, syncope, falls, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte abnormalities. Previous studies have been shown that antihypertensive medication prescription is associated with common electrolyte abnormalities, including hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, and hypercalcaemia. In particular, thiazide-type diuretics, beta-blockers, and blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are thought to be more likely to cause these complications.

Although these electrolyte abnormalities are often asymptomatic, they are relatively common, particularly in older people and patients with comorbidities such as renal disease and diabetes. If left undetected, they can lead to serious complications. For example, hyperkalaemia, defined as a serum potassium concentration exceeding 5.5 mmol/l, is associated with prescription of RAAS medications and has been shown to increase the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/l, is the most frequently observed electrolyte abnormality in clinical practice, affecting 5–35% of the adult population. Mild chronic hyponatraemia is associated with an increased rate of syncope, falls, and fractures, while severe acute hyponatraemia is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, risk of hospitalization, and length of hospital stay. Certain medications, especially thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, are more likely to cause hyponatraemia.

Strategies to prevent these drug-induced electrolyte abnormalities involve careful consideration of risk factors along with clinical and laboratory evaluation before initiation and during treatment. For individuals at a high risk of hyperkalaemia or hyponatraemia, it may not be appropriate to prescribe specific antihypertensive medications. For those already undergoing treatment, transitioning to an alternative class may be considered. To enable optimal treatment choice, clinicians must understand an individual's underlying risk of these electrolyte abnormalities.

Therefore, the present study aimed to develop and externally validate two new prediction models for the risk of hyperkalaemia and hyponatraemia, taking into account the competing risk of death from other causes.

These blood pressure-independent effects are likely to be fundamental contributors to the differences in long-term endpoints between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. They are also likely to be the result of pleiotropic effects that are not governed by the targeting of the kidney.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with central diabetes insipidus, SE 2018 guidelines recommend to administer IV or IM vasopressin 1–2 mcg in patients with known central diabetes insipidus and excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output, with close observation of the clinical and biochemical response. Consider administering further doses of desmopressin when production of higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine returns to avoid the development of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia through the combination of high fluid loads together with the obligate antidiuresis of exogenous desmopressin.

### Impact of diuretic therapy-associated electrolyte disorders present on admission to the emergency department: a cross-sectional analysis [^113DKwEq]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hypernatremia was more common in patients taking diuretic medication (2.2% vs 1.6%, P = 0.03). As with hyponatremia, the prevalence of hypernatremia rose with the number of diuretic drugs taken (P = 0.02). Loop diuretics were associated with a significantly higher prevalence of hypernatremia than no diuretic treatment (P = 0.0023). There was no significant difference for all other types of diuretic agent (P > 0.05). Use of loop diuretics was an independent risk factor for the presence of hypernatremia after correction for age, sex and eGFR as calculated by MDRD (OR 1.68, P = 0.0232).

Hypokalemia was significantly more common in patients under diuretic therapy (17% vs 11%, P < 0.0001). In patients taking loop diuretics (P = 0.0337), thiazide diuretics (P < 0.0001) and potassium-sparing diuretics (P < 0.0001), hypokalemia was more common than in patients on no diuretic therapy. No difference was seen for aldosterone antagonists (P = 0.7) or carboanhydrase inhibitors (P = 0.9). In the multivariable regression model, loop diuretics (OR 1.27, P = 0.0316), thiazide diuretics (OR 2.18, P < 0.0001) and potassium-sparing diuretics (OR 2.13, P = 0.0038) were associated with the presence of hypokalemia. Male sex (OR 0.61, P < 0.0001) was also associated with a lower risk for hypokalemia.

### A clinical approach to the treatment of chronic hypernatremia [^111Jhniq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypernatremia is a commonly encountered electrolyte disorder occurring in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Community-acquired hypernatremia typically occurs at the extremes of age, whereas hospital-acquired hypernatremia affects patients of all age groups. Serum sodium concentration is linked to water homeostasis, which is dependent on the thirst mechanism, arginine vasopressin, and kidney function. Because both hypernatremia and the rate of correction of hypernatremia are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, prompt effective treatment is crucial. Chronic hypernatremia can be classified into 3 broad categories, hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic forms, with each form having unique treatment considerations. In this teaching case, we provide a clinically based quantitative approach to the treatment of both hypervolemic and hypovolemic hypernatremia, which occurred in the same patient during the course of a prolonged illness.

CONCLUSION

In clinical practice, there is a tendency to consider all molecules in a therapeutic class as equivalent. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. The data presented herein support a clear distinction between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. Indapamide and chlorthalidone are sufficiently structurally and mechanistically distinct from HCTZ to warrant a separate classification and clinical data underscore the importance of distinguishing between these molecules in clinical practice.

Overall, the long-term risk:benefit ratio of thiazides is less favorable than that of thiazide-like diuretics; and an overwhelming amount of data describing HCTZ and its potential metabolic effects has skewed our understanding of treatment options away from diuretics in general. When thiazide-like diuretics are considered alone, for the many patients, for whom volume control is essential, the risk:benefit ratio shifts in favor of the diuretic treatment. In such patients, the benefits of volume control, blood pressure reduction, and long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality prevention exceed the risk of adverse events.

Looking forward, as most guidelines now recommend combination treatments, comparisons of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics should probably be made in the context of combinations with a RAS inhibitor. More studies and more single-pill combinations that include thiazide-like diuretics are needed.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia: clinical manifestations and pathophysiology [^111oUoRs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia can complicate thiazide use in a minority of susceptible individuals and can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Risk factors for thiazide-associated hyponatremia include age, female sex, and possibly low body mass. A genetic susceptibility has recently been uncovered. Although frequently developing early after thiazide treatment initiation, many cases of hyponatremia present after months or years of use. Many cases are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, but seizures and/or coma may develop, especially in those with acute onset. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood and includes some combination of excessive fluid intake, cation (sodium and potassium) depletion, osmotic inactivation of sodium, and reduced ability to excrete free water. Reduced distal delivery of filtrate, reduced solute load (urea), direct inhibition of the sodium-chloride cotransporter, and increased collecting duct permeability to water mediated by some combination of antidiuretic hormone, prostaglandins, and thiazides themselves may contribute to this diluting defect. The predominant pathophysiologic mechanism(s) varies from patient to patient. The cornerstone of therapy is cessation of thiazide use, cation repletion, and oral fluid restriction. If severely symptomatic, 3% saline solution may be indicated. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia must be avoided in all cases.

### Diuretics in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111Wa9xM]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Diuretic drugs act on electrolyte transporters in the kidney to induce diuresis and are often used in chronic kidney disease (CKD), given that nephron loss creates a deficit in the ability to excrete dietary sodium, which promotes an increase in plasma volume. This rise in plasma volume is exacerbated by CKD-induced systemic and intra-renal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, which further limits urinary sodium excretion. In the absence of a compensatory decrease in systemic vascular resistance, increases in plasma volume induced by sodium retention can manifest as a rise in systemic arterial blood pressure. Management of sodium and volume overload in patients with CKD is therefore typically based on restriction of dietary sodium intake and the use of diuretic agents to enhance urinary sodium excretion. Thiazide and thiazide-type diuretics are foundational therapies for the management of hypertension, whereas loop diuretics are often needed for volume overload, which might also require combination therapies. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have an important role in the management of diuretic-resistant volume overload or treatment-resistant hypertension. Additionally, diuretics can be used for the diagnosis of kidney diseases and in the management of hyperkalaemia or hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^1127Bs5k]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with hypervolaemic hypernatraemia present a different therapeutic challenge as the volume expansion in these patients inhibits the release of AVP, thereby promoting water excretion in the urine. Cessation of the inciting factors and administration of water is usually the initial step. Treatment with loop diuretics would enhance more aquaresis than natriuresis, thereby exacerbating the hypertonicity. Infusing dextrose 5% water would address the hypertonicity, but might worsen the volume overload state. Simultaneous use of intravenous dextrose 5% water and loop diuretics can be used to lower the serum sodium in addition to achieving a net negative total body water balance. Rarely, haemodialysis has been used, especially in cases where hydration with or without diuresis have failed to bring the sodium level down to the desired target or in patients with worsening renal function in whom there are indications for renal replacement therapy.

For patients with DI, DDAVP treatment can be administered orally, intranasally, subcutaneously or intravenously. Thiazide diuretics rarely can be considered as it decreases urine volume and increase urine osmolality. The mechanism of the paradoxical antidiuretic effect of thiazides in DI is thought to be related to volume contraction, leading to an increase in proximal tubular reabsorption of water and sodium thereby decreasing distal delivery of water and subsequent excretion.

Despite the paucity of data, hyperosmolar agents (eg, mannitol and hypertonic 3% saline) are still used by some clinicians in patients who had an acute stroke to induce hypernatraemia in order to decrease raised intracranial pressure and to prevent cerebral oedema. As there are currently no accepted consensus guidelines regarding optimal serum sodium levels in patients who had an acute stroke, we recommend that hyperosmolar agents be used cautiously in bolus form only to selected patients (those without risk factors, eg, alcoholism, liver disease, renal disease and previous strokes that would suggest a poorer prognosis) and closely monitor serum sodium levels targeting levels to not exceed 145 mmol/L. Box 3 summarises our recommendations for management of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia in patients who had an acute stroke.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Loop diuretics (alternative agents) include bumetanide 0.5–2 mg/d (daily frequency 2), furosemide 20–80 mg/d (daily frequency 2), and torsemide 5–10 mg/d (daily frequency 1). These are preferred diuretics in patients with symptomatic HF. They are preferred over thiazide-type diuretics in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eg, GFR < 30 mL/min). The longer-acting choice of torsemide is preferred for treatment of hypertension. A loop diuretic is an option for patients who develop thiazide-type diuretic associated hyponatremia.

### Renal considerations in the treatment of hypertension [^114eZqGc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

There are renal implications when employing intensive blood pressure control strategies. While this approach provides cardiovascular benefit in patients with and without chronic kidney disease, the impact on renal disease progression differs according to the pattern of underlying renal injury. In the setting of proteinuria, stringent blood pressure control has generally conferred a protective effect on renal disease progression, but in the absence of proteinuria, this benefit tends to be much less impressive. Thiazide diuretics are frequently part of the regimen to achieve intensive blood pressure control. These drugs can cause hyponatremia and present with biochemical evidence mimicking the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Altered prostaglandin transport may explain the unique susceptibility to this complication observed in some patients. Hyperkalemia is also a complication of intensive blood pressure lowering particularly in the setting of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade. There are strategies and new drugs now available that can allow use of these blockers and at the same time ensure a normal plasma potassium concentration.

### Thiazide diuretics in the management of young children with central diabetes insipidus [^111LyQha]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To report our experience in treating infants and toddlers with central diabetes insipidus (DI) with thiazide diuretics.

Study Design

A retrospective chart review of all infants and toddlers who were treated with thiazide diuretics for central DI at the Mayo Clinic between 1996 and 2014.

Results

Our cohort consisted of 13 patients. The median age at the start of therapy was 6 months (IQR, 1–14 months). Eight patients were given chlorothiazide at a starting dose of 5–10 mg/kg/day, and 5 patients were treated with hydrochlorothiazide at a starting dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day. The median age at the cessation of thiazide therapy was 18 months (IQR, 11.5–39 months). The main reason for stopping was the lack of continued response, in addition to hypernatremia. There was no hospitalization secondary to hyponatremia and only 1 hospitalization secondary to hypernatremia while receiving thiazide therapy. Calcium was checked periodically in 7 of the 13 patients, and 2 of these 7 patients had persistent hypercalcemia.

Conclusion

Thiazide diuretics appear to be safe and effective in treating infants with central DI. They can be continued after the introduction of solid food, and until a lack of response is observed.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^113bhJ14]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Data Source, Measurements, and Variables

Data were obtained using MDClone, a query tool that provides comprehensive patient-level data of wide-ranging variables in a defined timeframe around an index event. Extracted data included age, gender, comorbidities included in the Charlson comorbidity index, and up to 10 consecutive serum sodium measurements following the first documentation of severe hypernatremia. Serum glucose, magnesium, potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bicarbonate, albumin, calcium, and phosphorous concomitant with severe hypernatremia were also extracted. We also collected data regarding diuretic medications potentially related to dehydration, including furosemide, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. Vital status was ascertained through the patient's health maintenance organization.

In order to identify potential central nervous system complications of an overly rapid correction of severe hypernatremia, we searched for diagnoses of cerebral edema (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 348.5), altered mental status (ICD-9-CM code 780), seizures (ICD-9-CM code 780.39), or epilepsy (ICD-9-CM code 345.9). The electronic health records of all patients with 1 of these diagnoses were examined by 1 of the authors (E.F.) to ascertain the associations between hypernatremia and central nervous system complications. Complications were deemed related to hypernatremia if the association was clinically plausible to the treating physicians or if no other reasonable explanation was present upon examination of the patient's medical record by the investigators.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment; a basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension and 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of diuretics, ACEi, ARB, and MRA. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics, especially when used in combination or in chronic kidney disease; ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Mitigation strategies include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combining medications with complementary electrolyte effects (for example, ACEi plus a thiazide-type or loop diuretic); treatment of hyperkalemia can include initiation of potassium-lowering drugs including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, with emphasis on taking them mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Impact of diuretic therapy-associated electrolyte disorders present on admission to the emergency department: a cross-sectional analysis [^115CUniW]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Over a 2-year period, more than 20,000 patients seen in our ER at a large tertiary care hospital for different reasons had serum sodium measurements, which was the prime variable for inclusion in our study. A total of 11% of these patients were taking diuretic agents, and 3% were taking more than one diuretic agent.

Serum sodium levels were significantly lower in patients under diuretic treatment and significantly more patients with hyponatremia were taking a diuretic on admission. Interestingly, potassium levels were significantly higher in patients under diuretic therapy than in those without diuretics. Hypokalemia, however, was significantly more often seen in patients on diuretic agents. Loop diuretics were an independent risk factor for hypernatremia and hypokalemia and thiazide use was associated with the presence of hyponatremia and hypokalemia while they were protective against hyperkalemia. The use of aldosterone antagonists was an independent risk factor for the presence of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. In a Cox regression model, all forms of dysnatremia and dyskalemia were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the associations between all types of diuretic and electrolyte levels in a large group of patients presenting to the ER of a major teaching hospital. Our finding of an association between thiazide diuretic and hyponatremia and hypokalemia confirms the results of previous studies. The association between hypernatremia and loop diuretic use is explained by the mechanism of action of loop diuretics where the excretion of electrolyte-free water exceeds the increased natriuresis. The mechanism of action of aldosterone antagonists explains their association with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in the present study.

We found that hyponatremia and hypernatremia on admission are associated with increased mortality and this supports results from previous studies by our group. A recent study in patients with myocardial infarction also found increased mortality in patients with hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, supporting our findings on the untoward effects of dyskalemias on outcome.

### Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: a comprehensive overview [^114nfz1w]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability to concentrate urine that results in polyuria and polydipsia, despite having normal or elevated plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP). In this study, we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various etiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments. NDI has different clinical manifestations and approaches according to the etiology. Hereditary forms of NDI are mainly caused by mutations in the genes that encode key proteins in the AVP signaling pathway, while acquired causes are normally associated with specific drug exposure, especially lithium, and hydroelectrolytic disorders. Clinical manifestations of the disease vary according to the degree of dehydration and hyperosmolality, being worse when renal water losses cannot be properly compensated by fluid intake. Regarding the diagnosis of NDI, it is important to consider the symptoms of the patient and the diagnostic tests, including the water deprivation test and the baseline plasma copeptin measurement, a stable surrogate biomarker of AVP release. Without proper treatment, patients may developcomplications leading to high morbidity and mortality, such as severe dehydration and hypernatremia. In that sense, the treatment of NDI consists in decreasing the urine output, while allowing appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia, and ensuring an acceptable quality of life. Therefore, therapeutic options include nonpharmacological interventions, including sufficient water intake and a low-sodium diet, and pharmacological treatment. The main medications used for NDI are thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and amiloride, used isolated or in combination.

### Current prescriptions for the correction of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia: are they too simple? [^115n9Lnh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Hypo- and hypernatraemic (dysnatraemic) disorders are among the most common electrolyte disorders encountered by primary care providers and nephrologists. They represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and inappropriate management can result in serious sequelae. Several formulas addressing the fluid prescription for dysnatraemic patients have been introduced. Many authors stress the importance of considering output as well as input in formulating a treatment plan for the dysnatraemic patient. However, currently available formulas fail to account for ongoing renal and extrarenal fluid and electrolyte losses. We propose a novel, versatile formula based on established principles governing the distribution of Na(+) in body fluids. The formula can be used in a simplified form for a quick but accurate estimate of the change in serum [Na(+)] for any infused fluid, while simultaneously accounting for renal losses. The formula can also be expanded to include more complex losses if desired. Importantly, it forces the caregiver to consider both output and input when formulating a prescription for the dysnatraemic patient.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112hA3jW]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretics and decongestion strategies in patients with HF — In patients with HF who have fluid retention, diuretics are recommended to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, and prevent worsening HF. For patients with HF and congestive symptoms, addition of a thiazide (eg, metolazone) to treatment with a loop diuretic should be reserved for patients who do not respond to moderate- or high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte abnormalities. Loop diuretics are the preferred diuretic agents for use in most patients with HF, while thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide may be considered in patients with hypertension and HF and mild fluid retention. Metolazone or chlorothiazide may be added to loop diuretics in patients with refractory edema unresponsive to loop diuretics alone. Diuretics should be prescribed to patients who have evidence of congestion or fluid retention, and in any patient with a history of congestion, maintenance diuretics should be considered to avoid recurrent symptoms. The treatment goal of diuretic use is to eliminate clinical evidence of fluid retention, using the lowest dose possible to maintain euvolemia. With the exception of MRAs, the effects of diuretics on morbidity and mortality are uncertain, and diuretics should not be used in isolation but always combined with other GDMT for HF that reduces hospitalizations and prolongs survival. Hyponatremia complicates HF management.

### Amiloride hydrochloride [^116F4oYW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amiloride HCl is indicated as adjunctive treatment with thiazide diuretics or other kaliuretic-diuretic agents in congestive heart failure or hypertension to:

a. help restore normal serum potassium levels in patients who develop hypokalemia on the kaliuretic diuretic.

b. prevent development of hypokalemia in patients who would be exposed to particular risk if hypokalemia were to develop, e.g., digitalized patients or patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias.

The use of potassium-conserving agents is often unnecessary in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension when such patients have a normal diet. Amiloride HCl has little additive diuretic or antihypertensive effect when added to a thiazide diuretic.

Amiloride HCl should rarely be used alone. It has weak (compared with thiazides) diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Used as single agents, potassium sparing diuretics, including amiloride HCl, result in an increased risk of hyperkalemia (approximately 10% with amiloride). Amiloride HCl should be used alone only when persistent hypokalemia has been documented and only with careful titration of the dose and close monitoring of serum electrolytes.

### Diuretic use in renal disease [^114GoXVx]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are agents commonly used in diseases characterized by excess extracellular fluid, including chronic kidney disease, the nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis and heart failure. Multiple diuretic classes, including thiazide-type diuretics, loop diuretics and K(+)-sparing diuretics, are used to treat patients with these diseases, either individually or as combination therapies. An understanding of what determines a patient's response to a diuretic is a prerequisite to the correct use of these drugs. The response of patients with these diseases to diuretics, which is related to the dose, is best described by a sigmoid curve whose contour can become distorted by any of the several sodium-retaining states that are directly or indirectly associated with renal disease. Diuretic actions are of considerable importance to patients who have renal disease, as their effective use assists in extracellular fluid volume control, reducing excretion of protein in urine and lessening the risk of developing hyperkalemia. Diuretic-related adverse events that involve the uric acid, Na(+) and K(+) axes are not uncommon; therefore the clinician must be vigilant in looking for biochemical disturbances. As a result of diuretic-related adverse events, clinicians must be resourceful in the dose amount and frequency of dosing.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116dV2Et]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Our recommendations about tolvaptan use

We recommend individualising treatment of SIAD, based on a benefit–risk analysis for each patient and several individual factors, including chronicity of hyponatraemia, aetiology of SIAD, comorbidities, symptoms and biochemical parameters.

We promote the use tolvaptan as the main pharmacotherapy for SIAD for the following reasons:

Tolvaptan is, undoubtedly, highly efficacious in correcting hyponatraemia. Evidence that tolvaptan improves hard clinical outcomes is currently lacking, but this applies to all treatment options for SIAD. Therefore, using our clinical judgement on a case-by-case basis, we decide whether each individual is likely to benefit from increasing serum sodium levels.
Tolvaptan is the sole treatment modality licenced for the treatment of SIAD in the United States and Europe, having undergone stringent review of risk–benefit balance by the regulatory authorities and based on high-quality evidence basis for efficacy and safety. On the contrary, the use of other agents is supported by low-quality data, derived primarily from retrospective uncontrolled studies and case series.
Regarding concerns about tolvaptan-related overly rapid hyponatraemia correction, greater effectiveness is associated with a higher risk for too rapid correction. However, it can be substantially reduced, provided patients undergo rigorous monitoring at frequent intervals and specific measures are implemented, when need arises, to prevent, or even reverse, overly rapid correction.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment and monitoring: A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension, including primary or secondary Aldosteronism and other endocrine causes, and a basic metabolic panel should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, ACEi (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), and MRA (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist). Common lab disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide‑type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium‑sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of CKD. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide‑type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide‑type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia, other than emergency treatment for life‑threatening hyperkalemia, can also be managed with initiation of potassium‑lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid‑day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life‑threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Combination of loop diuretics with thiazide-type diuretics in heart failure [^115vRMwt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Volume overload is an important clinical target in heart failure management, typically addressed using loop diuretics. An important and challenging subset of heart failure patients exhibit fluid overload despite significant doses of loop diuretics. One approach to overcome loop diuretic resistance is the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic to produce diuretic synergy via "sequential nephron blockade", first described more than 40 years ago. Although potentially able to induce diuresis in patients otherwise resistant to high doses of loop diuretics, this strategy has not been subjected to large-scale clinical trials to establish safety and clinical efficacy. We summarize the existing literature evaluating the combination of loop and thiazide diuretics in patients with heart failure in order to describe the possible benefits and hazards associated with this therapy. Combination diuretic therapy using any of several thiazide-type diuretics can more than double daily urine sodium excretion to induce weight loss and edema resolution, at the risk of inducing severe hypokalemia in addition to hyponatremia, hypotension, and worsening renal function. We provide considerations about prudent use of this therapy and review potential misconceptions about this long-used diuretic approach. Finally, we seek to highlight the need for pragmatic clinical trials for this commonly used therapy.

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^112UGAbo]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease. There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; current societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored. Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.

Hyperkalemia contributors and diet strategies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — non-dietary factors and when diet restriction applies are outlined. Medications, metabolic acidosis, hyperosmosis due to hyperglycemia, hypernatremia or uremia, and constipation are more likely to explain plasma potassium abnormalities than diet. Although short-term dietary restriction of the foods highest in potassium is a valid strategy to treat acute hyperkalemia, restriction of foods highest in bioavailable potassium may be a supportive prevention strategy for people with a history of hyperkalemia or during periods in which hyperkalemia risk is a concern.

### Poor weight gain, hypernatremia, and jaundice in a 2-month-old male [^113xcnhx]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Inadequate intake is the most common reason for poor weight gain. Up to 90% of poor or inadequate weight gain will have no underlying medical reason apart from insufficient calorie intake on further workup. However, insufficient calories did not explain our patient's presentation since his mother demonstrated appropriate formula preparation, and his caloric intake was adequate for his age. Further workup was indicated to evaluate his poor weight gain. Hypernatremia is most commonly associated with dehydration; however, when signs of clinical dehydration are present in the context of adequate intake, disruption of antidiuretic hormone should be considered.DI was suspected due to persistent hypernatremia, elevated serum osmolality, low urine osmolality, and specific gravity in the setting of increased urine output. In addition, our patient presented with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which should always be investigated for underlying pathology. Biliary atresia is one of the most common causes of neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and timely diagnosis with intervention are necessary to ensure an optimal outcome. Other important causes to consider include genetic, endocrine, and metabolic abnormalities. Once the diagnosis of central DI was established, brain imaging was indicated to assess for further abnormalities, as idiopathic central DI is rare.

Management of SOD involves a multidisciplinary approach including Endocrine, Neurology, Ophthalmology, Early Intervention, and Genetics consultation. Close monitoring from these specialties ensures that appropriate interventions can be implemented in a timely manner. Our patient was started on daily desmopressin injections, a low sodium formula, as well as growth hormone and hydrocortisone replacements. Some studies suggest treatment with thiazide diuretic as another option in this age group and may be ideal given the ease of administration in oral form. However, no studies show a difference in effectiveness comparing desmopressin to thiazides. Parents received extensive education on medication administration prior to discharge, including administering steroid stress doses for periods of illness, which is an important aspect to the long-term care of these patients.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^112DmYrd]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Understanding the place of diuretics in the treatment of hypertension is complicated by the fact that in many countries, diuretics are more commonly used in combination with other classes rather than alone as a first-line therapy. In fact, the emphasis of guidelines on combination treatments and single-pill combinations continues to increase. In addition, historically, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics have been grouped under the single heading 'thiazide'. More and more evidence, however, suggest that thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics need to be considered separately as they have different mechanisms of action, safety profiles, and possibly different efficacy profiles.

In this review, we will reaffirm the place of diuretics as essential initial treatments in hypertension and discuss, which patient populations benefit most from diuretics. We will then focus on the need to differentiate between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. We will use the term 'thiazide' for diuretics with a bi-cyclic benzothiadiazine backbone [such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and bendroflumethiazide] and 'thiazide-like' for diuretics that also target the early segment of the distal convoluted tubule, but lack the bi-cyclic benzothiadiazine backbone (such as chlorthalidone, indapamide, and metolazone). We will focus, whenever possible, on HCTZ (12.5–50 mg), chlorthalidone (12.5–50 mg), and indapamide (sustained release 1.5 mg and immediate release 1.25–2.5 mg). Lastly, we will explore the differences within the thiazide-like group.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy. Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Risk of thiazide-induced hyponatremia in patients with hypertension [^111CrsJb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although hyponatremia is a well-recognized complication of treatment with thiazide diuretics, the risk of thiazide-induced hyponatremia remains uncertain in routine care.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a multicenter clinical research registry to identify 2613 adult outpatients that were newly treated for hypertension between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005 at 2 teaching hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, and followed them for up to 10 years.

Results

Two hundred twenty patients exposed to ongoing thiazide therapy were compared with 2393 patients who were not exposed. In the exposed group, 66 (30%) developed hyponatremia (sodium ≤ 130 mmol/L). The adjusted incidence rate of hyponatremia was 140 cases per 1000 person-years for patients treated with thiazides, compared with 87 cases per 1000 person-years in those without thiazides. Patients exposed to thiazides were more likely to develop hyponatremia (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–2.25). There was no significant difference in the risk of hospitalizations associated with hyponatremia (adjusted rate ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.46–2.32) or mortality (adjusted rate ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.12–1.42). The number needed to harm (to result in one excess case of incident hyponatremia in 5 years) was 15.02 (95% CI, 7.88–160.30).

Conclusions

Approximately 3 in 10 patients exposed to thiazides who continue to take them develop hyponatremia.

### Thiazide and the thiazide-like diuretics: review of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and indapamide [^117XP6yg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogenous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure-the thiazide-type (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)-and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring-the thiazide-like (e.g., chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use. Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients, and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent blood pressure reduction occurs. Thiazides remain underutilized, with only about one-third of hypertensive patients receiving them. For many patients, however, a thiazide is an indispensable component of their regimen to achieve adequate blood pressure control.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^115eEJTN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

An alternative approach that has been proposed is "proactive DDAVP", that is, early empirical coadministration both of desmopressin (DDAVP) and hypertonic saline. The rationale is that overcorrection is frequently the result of a spontaneous water diuresis following resolution of transient SIAD, interruption of polydipsia, or cessation of a causative medication. This spontaneous water clearance can be prevented with preemptive desmopressin. The advantage of this approach would be that the rate of correction can be more precisely controlled with hypertonic saline alone (bolus or infusion), without variable outputs to contend with. However, by potentiating SIAD through the administration of an AVP analogue before overcorrection occurs or appears imminent, this approach risks exacerbation or prolonging of hyponatremia symptoms — especially in the presence of ongoing fluid input. In patients with a chronic cause of SIAD (eg, paraneoplastic SIAD), desmopressin is unlikely to have any effect as the underlying cause of antidiuresis is likely to continue. The only data for this proactive approach stem from an uncontrolled observational study in 24 patients with pNa less than 120 mmol/L, predominantly secondary to thiazide diuretics, treated with desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours and weight-based hypertonic saline titrated to achieve a pNa increase of 6 mmol/L in 24 hours. Overall, participants had a mean increase in serum sodium 5.8 mmol/L over 24 hours, 2 patients experienced a decline in serum sodium by 1 to 2 mmol/L after 4 hours, and 2 patients had an above-target increase in serum sodium greater than 10 mmol/L at 24 hours, but no adverse effects were reported. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support this strategy, and instead we endorse a "reactive" or "rescue" approach to desmopressin therapy, in keeping with current guidelines.

Discussion

Diuretics have been used as the control drug in many large hypertension studies, but have rarely in the past 10 years been the main target of interest or studied in maximally efficacious doses. Our study provides answers to several questions about diuretics that had not been previously investigated or resolved. We showed that, after 24 weeks of treatment, a potassium-sparing diuretic reduces blood pressure as efficaciously as high-dose thiazide without inducing adverse effects on blood glucose concentrations. Furthermore, a combination of half the conventional doses of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was not associated with increased 2 h glucose concentrations compared with hydrochlorothiazide treatment alone but produced significantly larger reductions in blood pressure than full doses of either diuretic given alone. Amiloride monotherapy did not cause clinically significant hyperkalaemia, and the amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide combination did not significantly affect potassium concentrations.

Hitherto, the mechanism and prospects for prevention of thiazide-induced glucose intolerance were uncertain; the role of potassium in this problem was also unclear. A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working party in 2008 identified potassium as "perhaps the most attractive variable" in developing a hypothesis for the mechanism of the thiazide response, and called for studies of potassium-sparing diuretics, among others. Amiloride has been licensed for hypertension for almost as long as hydrochlorothiazide, but has rarely been used or studied in doses that lower blood pressure as effectively as high-dose thiazides or other diuretic classes. That matched doses of thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics, with similar efficacy on blood pressure, could neutralise the undesirable effects of each class while synergising to enhance reduction of blood pressure was an attractive hypothesis, but there were many unknowns, such as whether amiloride — in the context of blockade of the RAS in most patients — could be safely used at a dose large enough to match the blood pressure reduction of hydrochlorothiazide without causing hazardous electrolyte abnormalities.

### Impact of diuretic therapy-associated electrolyte disorders present on admission to the emergency department: a cross-sectional analysis [^1174zTPK]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diuretics are among the most commonly prescribed medications and, due to their mechanisms of action, electrolyte disorders are common side effects of their use. In the present work we investigated the associations between diuretics being taken and the prevalence of electrolyte disorders on admission as well as the impact of electrolyte disorders on patient outcome.

Methods

In this cross sectional analysis, all patients presenting between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011 to the emergency room (ER) of the Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, Switzerland were included. Data on diuretic medication, baseline characteristics and laboratory data including electrolytes and renal function parameters were obtained from all patients. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the impact of factors on electrolyte disorders and patient outcome.

Results

A total of 8.5% of patients presenting to the ER used one diuretic, 2.5% two, and 0.4% three or four. In all, 4% had hyponatremia on admission and 12% hypernatremia. Hypokalemia was present in 11% and hyperkalemia in 4%. All forms of dysnatremia and dyskalemia were more common in patients taking diuretics. Loop diuretics were an independent risk factor for hypernatremia and hypokalemia, while thiazide diuretics were associated with the presence of hyponatremia and hypokalemia. In the Cox regression model, all forms of dysnatremia and dyskalemia were independent risk factors for in hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Existing diuretic treatment on admission to the ER was associated with an increased prevalence of electrolyte disorders. Diuretic therapy itself and disorders of serum sodium and potassium were risk factors for an adverse outcome.

### Revisiting diuretic choice in chronic kidney disease [^1123ZWMM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Existing guidelines offer little direction about the use of thiazide and loop diuretics in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review summarizes recent studies impacting indications and safety considerations for these agents in patients with CKD.

Recent Findings

Chlorthalidone reduces blood pressure compared to placebo in patients with advanced CKD, challenging the belief that thiazide diuretics lose efficacy at lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR). Existing studies show no clear impact of thiazide or loop diuretic use on kidney or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD. Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have diuretic effects, but concomitant use of a diuretic does not diminish the preventive benefits of these agents against acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite theoretical concerns, thiazide diuretics likely do not worsen circulating vasopressin levels or cyst progression in polycystic kidney disease and may be useful for alleviating polyuria from tolvaptan. Diuretics cause multiple adverse effects, including electrolyte abnormalities, hemodynamic-mediated decrease in estimated GFR, and AKI.

Summary

Recent evidence supports expanded indications for diuretics in patients with kidney disease, including chlorthalidone for hypertension in advanced CKD. Monitoring electrolytes and estimated GFR is critical to ensure patient safety when prescribing these agents for patients with CKD.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^117CHGVN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Loop Diuretics

Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase urinary salt and water excretion via inhibition of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the Henle loop to reduce reabsorption of these solutes. They are listed in the European guidelines as a second-line therapy for SIAD in combination with salt tablets (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), but are not endorsed in the international expert panel recommendations. The guideline recommendation was made on the strength of several case series, though only 1 of these included patients with SIAD rather than patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, and that report from 1973 included only 5 patients.

Loop diuretics are useful in the treatment of hypervolemia; however, in the absence of volume excess, natriuresis may cause volume depletion, which stimulates AVP release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. The randomized trial discussed earlier that evaluated FR with and without furosemide and salt tablets to prevent hypovolemia in SIAD found no significant benefit to the addition of frusemide 20 to 40 mg daily compared with FR alone, but in fact observed increased rates of acute kidney injury and hypokalemia. Furosemide increases urinary potassium excretion, which can be potentiated by increased sodium in the distal nephron. Because of this recent evidence, we do not recommend loop diuretics for euvolemic hyponatremia.

The clinical implications of these disorders in water excretion are discussed in the setting of optimal water intake as kidney disease progresses. This review emphasizes the management of patients with chronic kidney disease who have marked abnormalities in serum sodium concentrations and gives specific recommendations for modifications in renal replacement therapy prescription in hyponatremic patients with end-stage renal disease.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia, report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^115zTKGG]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a frequent and potentially life-threatening adverse side effect of thiazide diuretics. This sub-analysis of the Hyponatremia Registry database focuses on current management practices of thiazide-associated hyponatremia (TAH) and compares differences between TAH and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

Methods

We analyzed 477 patients from 225 US and EU sites with euvolemic hyponatremia ([Na⁺] ≤ 130 mEq/L) who were receiving a thiazide diuretic. Of these, 118 met criteria for true thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH).

Results

Thiazide was withdrawn immediately after hyponatremia was diagnosed only in 57% of TAH; in these patients, the median rate of [Na+] change (Δdaily[Na⁺]) was significantly higher than those with continued thiazide treatment (3.8 [interquartile range: 4.0] vs. 1.7 [3.8] mEq/L/day). The most frequently employed therapies were isotonic saline (29.6%), fluid restriction (19.9%), the combination of these two (8.2%), and hypertonic saline (5.2%). Hypertonic saline produced the greatest Δdaily[Na⁺] (8.0[6.4] mEq/L/day) followed by a combination of fluid restriction and normal saline (4.5 [3.8] mEq/L/day) and normal saline alone (3.6 [3.5] mEq/L/day). Fluid restriction was markedly less effective (2.7 [2.7] mEq/L/day). Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia occurred in 3.1% overall, but in up to 21.4% given hypertonic saline. Although there are highly significant differences in the biochemical profiles between TIH and SIADH, no predictive diagnostic test could be derived.

Conclusions

Despite its high incidence and potential risks, the management of TAH is often poor. Immediate withdrawal of the thiazide is crucial for treatment success. Hypertonic saline is most effective in correcting hyponatremia but associated with a high rate of overly rapid correction. We could not establish a diagnostic laboratory-based test to differentiate TIH from SIADH.

Antihypertensive drug classes in CKD — diuretics and adverse effects: Thiazide diuretics lose efficacy in diuresis and BP lowering as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) worsens, but several, including chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide appear to remain effective at GFRs < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2; loop diuretics are often effective at lower GFRs (i.e., < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and when combined with a loop diuretic, thiazides are particularly effective in inducing diuresis, but they often lead to hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The most common side effects in CKD include hyperkalemia and AKI with ACEi or ARBs, edema with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), constipation and bradyarrhythmias with non-dihydropyridine CCBs used with beta-blockers, cough with ACEi, fatigue with beta-blockers, somnolence or dry mouth with central alpha-agonists, rebound hypertension if clonidine is stopped without taper, dizziness with alpha-blockers, hyperkalemia with MRA, headache with hydralazine, and edema and hirsutism with minoxidil.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^1113fNgY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Suspicion

Patients who have symptoms of polyuria, nocturia, or polydipsia are candidates for further evaluation of a possible arginine vasopressin-related polyuria (AVP-D or AVP-R). However, before embarking on more complex pathways of investigation, it is important to exclude common causes of polyuria and polydipsia, including hypokalemia and hypercalcemia. Certain scenarios are suggestive of a solute diuresis, for example uncontrolled hyperglycemia, high protein intake from parenteral or enteral feeding, tissue catabolism from high-dose glucocorticoids, resolving kidney injury including relief of urinary obstruction, use of diuretics and SGLT-2 inhibitors, administration of mannitol or high volumes of isotonic NaCl. The presence of nocturia without daytime polyuria suggests nocturnal polyuria (production of 20%-33% of total urine volume during sleep). In the absence of such obvious causes of symptomatic polyuria, possible AVP-related disorders should be evaluated. The first step is measurement of plasma osmolality and/or serum sodium concentration. Although these are within normal ranges in most patients with polyuria due to the ability of thirst and renal water excretion to maintain osmotic homeostasis, hypernatremia strongly suggests AVP-D or AVP-R, and hyponatremia strongly suggests PP as the most likely causes of polyuria. If the plasma osmolality and serum sodium are normal, the next step is confirming the presence of hypotonic polyuria. Because patients' estimations of both fluid intake and urine output are not always reliable, this should be assessed via measurement of a 24-hour urine. It is notable that there is no universally accepted definition of polyuria. Past studies have used an absolute urine volume (eg, ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m²/24 hours in children), and others have used a weight-based urine volume (eg, > 40 mL/kg/24 hours or > 50 mL/kg/24 hours). Consequently, clinical judgment and experience should be used to identify patients requiring further evaluation, but the least stringent criteria would be either a urine volume ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m²/24 hours in children, or > 40 mL/kg/24 hours. If these minimal criteria are not met, the patient should undergo urological evaluation for causes of increased urine frequency or nocturnal polyuria. Once polyuria is established, the second step is to confirm hypotonicity via measurement of osmolality in the 24 hours urine sample. A urine osmolality ≤ 300 mOsm/kg H₂O confirms a hypotonic urine, and a urine osmolality ≥ 800 mOsm/kg H₂O indicates a solute diuresis (due to glucose, sodium, urea, or administered diuretics such as mannitol). Urine osmolalities between 300 and 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O can be seen with partial AVP-D or AVP-R, so in such cases further evaluation is necessary. Once hypotonic polyuria is confirmed, additional testing is necessary to identify the cause (Table 1).

Evidence grading and benefit–harm assessment for ACEI/ARB combinations — The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation; therefore, it is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was Low. The benefits of using an ACEI or ARB in combination with a thiazide diuretic or CCB, including improved BP control and reduced risk of MACE, outweigh the potential harm of side effects, such as increased risk for gout, hypokalemia, diabetes, edema, and hyponatremia.

Combination antihypertensive therapy — drug classes to avoid and allowed exceptions: High-quality RCT reports demonstrate that simultaneous administration of RAS blockers (ie, an ACEi combined with an ARB or an ACEi or ARB combined with the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren) increases the risk of CVD, kidney disease, and hyperkalemia, and drug combinations with agents that have similar mechanisms of action or clinical effects should be avoided; for example, 2 drugs from the same class should not be administered together (eg, 2 different BB, ACEi, or dihydropyridine CCB), and 2 drugs from classes that target the same BP control system are less effective and potentially harmful when used together (eg, ACEi and ARB). Exceptions include concomitant use of thiazide-type and potassium-sparing diuretics, and thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine CCB can be combined for additional BP-lowering in selected patients.

### Risk of electrolyte disorders, syncope, and falls in patients taking thiazide diuretics: results of a cross-sectional study [^114vGtgW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Thiazide diuretics are a mainstay in the management of hypertension and often associated with dyselectrolytemias. We investigated the prevalence of and risk factors for hyponatremia and hypokalemia in thiazide users, substance-specific differences, and the association of thiazides with syncope and falls.

Methods

In this cross-sectional analysis all patients admitted to an interdisciplinary emergency department in Switzerland between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, with measurements of serum sodium and potassium were included. Data regarding serum electrolytes and creatinine were analyzed to classify for dysnatremias, dyskalemias, and acute kidney injury. Chart reviews were performed to screen for syncope or falls.

Results

A total of 1604 patients (7.9%) took thiazides. Acute kidney injury was significantly more common in thiazide users (22.1 vs 7%, P < .0001). Hyponatremia (22.1 vs 9.8%, P < .0001) and hypokalemia (19 vs 11%, P < .0001) were more frequent with thiazides. Thiazide use together with higher age and female sex were independent predictors of hyponatremia and hypokalemia. A dose-dependent effect was found for electrolyte disorders, and there was a variance in risk between the investigated substances with chlorthalidone bearing the highest and hydrochlorothiazide the lowest risk. Patients taking thiazide diuretics had significantly more episodes of syncope and falls.

Conclusions

Thiazide use is a clear risk factor for hyponatremia and hypokalemia. The effect appears to be dose-dependent and highly variable depending on the substance. Syncope and falls seem to be causally related to thiazide use. Especially in patients who are elderly, female, and prone to falls, the use of thiazide diuretics should be thoroughly questioned.

Resistant hypertension — spironolactone add-on therapy: For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant HTN, and in patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function, spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^115wJxPT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding age, in our study, patients who developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia were older compared with patients with normonatremia. However, age was less important in the multivariable model after accounting for CKD status. It is well known that hypernatremia mostly results from net water loss reflecting pure water or hypotonic fluid loss, while thirst provides the ultimate defense against developing hypernatremia assuming the ability to access water. Therefore, hypernatremia in adults largely occurs in older patients with infirmity, cognitive deficits, or altered mental status who depend on others for their water requirements. Thirst is also suppressed in older patients. However, hypernatremia can result from hypertonic sodium gainduring hospitalization as well and may be iatrogenic. A recent study showed that a greater volume of free water prescription was associated with progression to severe hospital-acquired hypernatremia. The prescribed amount of free water was considered inadequate in the context of ongoing use of sodium-rich solutions and lower total volumes during progression of hypernatremia. Finally, hypernatremia is frequently associated with increased extracellular fluid volume, even outside intensive care units.

ADPKD — thiazide diuretics or metformin to mitigate tolvaptan-induced aquaresis: short-term signals exist, but use is not advised. Tolvaptan "causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, resulting in substantial polyuria", and hydrochlorothiazide "is an established therapy for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, as it is able to decrease urine output by around 30%"; metformin "has been shown to decrease urine output by almost 50% in tolvaptan-treated rats". In two small crossover trials, short-term regimens "reduced urine volume, as measured in a 24-hour time, by 21%–25%, and improved QoL", but "the long-term effect of these interventions… is not known", and "A planned trial will evaluate this question (NCT05373264, comprising 300 participants)". Accordingly, "we advise against using a thiazide diuretic or other concomitant medication to mitigate aquaresis".

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder.

### Thiazide diuretics vs. other antihypertensive drug classes… [^111wHKdC]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics more effective than other first-line antihypertensive drug classes in reducing mortality or cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. Evidence-Based Answer There is no mortality benefit in using thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics compared with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes; however, these diuretics most likely reduce cardiovascular events and heart failure compared with calcium channel blockers. 1 Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics reduce stroke risk compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thiazides are associated with fewer withdrawals and drug discontinuations due to adverse effects compared with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha blockers.

### Severe hyponatremia as a result of thiazide diuretic… [^116LCRTB]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

to the editor: A 40-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with the gradual onset of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and weakness progressively becoming worse over several months. The patient also reported anorexia and disequilibrium, with falls resulting in extensive bruising. The patient's wife reported slowing of his speech, and witnessed two seizures, 10 and five days before admission, with tonic clonic activity and unresponsiveness. Serum osmolality was reduced at 208 mOsm per kg of water, cortisol level was high at 26. 6 μg per dL; and urine was dilute with a specific gravity of

1. 010 but low urinary sodium at less than 10 mEq per L.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and received normal saline with thiamine, folate, magnesium and potassium supplementation to cautiously correct electrolyte abnormalities. The diuretic was discontinued. During a five-day hospital stay, the patient demonstrated improved cognition and strength. Follow-up, outpatient electrolyte monitoring revealed continued resolution of the hyponatremia. Hyponatremia associated with low plasma osmolality and decreased extracellular fluid volume can be caused by diuretic therapy and vomiting. Additional causes of hyponatremia include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, polydipsia, and medications including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In the absence of other causes, this patient's profound hyponatremia is believed to be a result of diuretic therapy. Thiazide diuretics work at the site of the distal tubule by inhibiting uptake of sodium and chloride.

While cases of thiazide-induced hyponatremia are well documented, this severity of hyponatremia is unusual. Antihypertensive therapy choice is a chief concern for family physicians. First-line therapy in patients who are hypertensive is frequently a diuretic or beta blocker. 1 Family physicians must be aware of the potential for thiazide diuretics to induce hyponatremia.

### Use of diuretics to treat hypertension in diabetic persons… [^112zhQcD]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

I am aware of the guidelines on offering diuretics as first-line therapy. However, I must take issue with the authors' assertion that diuretics should be the first or second drug administered for the control of hypertension in patients who have diabetes. It has been long established that diuretics, especially thiazide diuretics, adversely affect glucose metabolism. Although lower doses of these medications have less of an adverse effect, many of these patients have more severe hypertension that requires maximal dosing of treatment strategies. 2 The use of this class of medications can worsen glucose control unnecessarily because other treatment options exist. in reply: Dr. Hood raises an excellent point regarding thiazide diuretics and blood glucose control. This is an area of much controversy. The recommendations of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.

1 and the American Diabetes Association 2 advocate the use of thiazide diuretics in patients who have hypertension and diabetes. The highest dosages of thiazide diuretics used in the 16 major clinical trials published since 1990 were 25 mg of chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide. 3 In a meta-analysis, 4 an average 1 percent elevation in blood glucose levels was seen in patients taking thiazide diuretics at these dosages; this does not represent a clinically significant increase in most patients with diabetes. 4 Dosages above 25 mg appear to contribute only to increases in adverse effects such as hypokalemia, and not to further improvements in blood pressure control.

In terms of efficacy, thiazide diuretics have demonstrated the same or greater benefits on long-term outcomes of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in patients with diabetes as in those who do not have diabetes, reflecting the higher cardiovascular risk seen in patients with diabetes. 2, 5 In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, patients who had diabetes had fewer cardiovascular events with diuretic treatment than with ACE inhibitor treatment. With the current dosages of thiazide diuretics being used in practice, the negative effect of the small increases in blood glucose levels is overshadowed by the beneficial effects seen in clinical trials using thiazides as part of the multidrug regimen that is required to achieve blood pressure control in most patients with diabetes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Dysnatremias in emergency patients with acute kidney injury: a cross-sectional analysis [^116x2Lbw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to investigate the prevalence, risk factors and outcome of hypo- and hypernatremia in emergency patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).

Methods

In this cross-sectional analysis all emergency patients between January 1st 2017 and December 31st 2018 with measurements of creatinine and sodium were included. Baseline characteristics, medication and laboratory data were gathered. Chart reviews were performed to identify patients with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to extract baseline creatinine. For all other patients the ADQI backformula was used to calculate baseline creatinine. AKI was graduated using creatinine criteria of the acute kidney injury network. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for appearance of dysnatremias and outcome.

Results

AKI was found in 8% of patients. 392 patients (23.16%) had hyponatremia, 24 (1.4%) had hypernatremia. Use of potassium sparing diuretics, a medical cause for emergency referral, use of thiazide diuretics and AKI stage were the strongest risk factors for hyponatremia. Loop diuretics, a medical cause for emergency referral and AKI stage were risk factors for hypernatremia. In patients with all classes of hyponatremia, length of hospital stay was significantly longer compared to patients with a normal serum sodium. In the binary logistic regression analysis with death as outcome, hyponatremia as well as severe hypernatremia were independent risk factors for mortality.

Conclusions

Dysnatremias are common in emergency patients with AKI. Diuretic medication is a major risk factor for hypo- and hypernatremia. Both hyponatremia and severe hypernatremia were independent risk factors for adverse outcome.

### Reduced risk for hospitalization due to hyponatraemia in lithium treated patients: a Swedish population-based case-control study [^115enogC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first population-based study reporting on lithium therapy and hyponatraemia. The association with hyponatraemia requiring hospitalization was halved in individuals treated with lithium.

The mechanism of lithium-induced protection against hyponatraemia is most likely its nephrogenic diabetes insipidus potential. In cell models, lithium has been shown to downregulate aquaporin-2 transcription and to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus independent of adenylyl cyclase activity. This results in aquaresis without loss of sodium or other electrolytes, manifesting as weight loss and hypernatraemia if fluid intake is insufficient to compensate for urinary losses. Development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus takes time, usually many years, most likely explaining why the reduced risk of severe hyponatraemia is apparent only in individuals with ongoing lithium therapy. However, due to the small number of individuals with newly initiated treatment, the conclusion is uncertain in this regard. In contrast, thiazide diuretics, which also increase diuresis, are linked to hyponatraemia, partly due to increased urinary sodium losses, demonstrating that increased urinary output can have opposite effects on plasma sodium concentrations.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^113kU6z3]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

SELECTING THIAZIDE-LIKE DIURETICS OVER THIAZIDE DIURETICS

A number of recent guidelines, though not the most recent 2018 ESC/ESH hypertension guidelines, recommend the 'preferred' use of thiazide-like diuretics rather than thiazide diuretics (Table 1). The decision of certain guidelines to favor treatment with thiazide-like diuretics centers mainly around duration of action data, the ability to lower blood pressure, and long-term cardiovascular endpoint reduction data. Hypertension Canada, United Kingdom National Clinical Guideline Centre, and ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines currently give preference to longer acting thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone and/or indapamide). In 2017, the ACC/AHA singled out chlorthalidone as the preferred diuretic treatment because of proven cardiovascular risk reduction and recommended substituting HCTZ treatment by indapamide or chlorthalidone treatment in patients with resistant hypertension. For hypertensive patients with diabetes, the American Diabetes Association gives preference to thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone and indapamide) because they are longer acting diuretics that have a proven effect on cardiovascular event reduction. Differences in mechanism of action, pleiotropic effects, metabolic profiles, and subclinical markers are also cited in some guidelines. Lastly, though the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines give equal weight in their recommendations to thiazide-like and thiazide diuretics because of a lack of head-to-head randomized controlled trials, guidelines do note that this recommendation was influenced by the fact that many of the approved single-pill combinations are based on HCTZ. These guidelines also underscore the fact that chlorthalidone and indapamide are more potent per milligram than HCTZ for blood pressure reduction.

### Rationale and design of the "Safety and efficacy of the combination of loop with thiazide-type diuretics in patients with decompensated heart failure (CLOROTIC) trial: " A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine the effect of combined diuretic therapy (loop diuretics with thiazide-type diuretics) among patients with decompensated heart failure [^113QthY3]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid overload refractory to loop diuretic therapy can complicate acute or chronic heart failure (HF) management. The Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of Loop with Thiazide-type Diuretics in Patients with Decompensated Heart Failure (CLOROTIC) trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01647932) will test the hypothesis that blocking distal tubule sodium reabsorption with hydrochlorothiazide can antagonize the renal adaptation to chronic loop diuretic therapy and improve diuretic resistance.

Methods

CLOROTIC is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Three hundred and four patients with decompensated HF will be randomly assigned to receive hydrochlorothiazide or placebo in addition to a furosemide regimen. The main inclusion criteria are: age ≥ 18 years, history of chronic HF (irrespective of etiology and/or ejection fraction), admission for acute decompensation, and previous treatment with an oral loop diuretic for at least 1 month before randomization. The 2 coprimary endpoints are changes in body weight and changes in patient-reported dyspnea during hospital admission. Morbidity, mortality, and safety aspects will also be addressed.

Conclusions

CLOROTIC is the first large-scale trial to evaluate whether the addition of a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) to a loop diuretic (furosemide) is a safe and effective strategy for improving congestive symptoms resulting from HF. This trial will provide important information and will therefore have a major impact on treatment strategies and future trials in these patients.

### Copeptin levels and commonly used laboratory parameters in hospitalised patients with severe hypernatraemia-the "Co-MED study" [^1144WUJD]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Most patients had undergone numerous drug treatments before developing hypernatraemia (either at home or in hospital). Thirty-eight patients (41%) were receiving a medication with loop diuretics, 11 patients (12%) were treated with thiazide diuretics and 10 patients (11%) were treated with potassium-sparing diuretics. Other frequently used medications were opioids (n = 21 [23%]) and neuroleptics (n = 15 [16%]). Co-morbidities and current medications of the study population are listed in Table 3.

Differential diagnosis of hypernatraemia

Median copeptin levels were different in patients with central diabetes insipidus (3.39 pmol/L, IQR 1.99–3.90), salt overload (53.19 pmol/L, IQR 34.39–85.95) and dehydration-induced hypernatraemia (54.95 pmol/L, IQR 35.01–71.70) (P = 0.001). In a post hoc group comparison, copeptin levels in patients with central diabetes insipidus were significantly lower than in patients with salt overload or dehydration-induced hypernatraemia (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Copeptin levels did not differ between patients with dehydration-induced hypernatraemia and salt overload (P = 0.64). Patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus had the highest median copeptin levels (77.75 pmol/L) (see Fig. 1).

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^111erFDU]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study plan

The study design has been described previously in detail. Briefly, patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic HN were enrolled from 146 US sites and patients with euvolemic HN were enrolled from 79 EU sites. We excluded patients with hypovolemic HN because this disorder should respond readily and completely to treatment of volume deficits, and it therefore poses no therapeutic dilemma. We excluded patient with hypervolemic HN from the EU study centers because tolvaptan is only approved in the EU for euvolemic patients. Inclusion of hypervolemic patients treated with tolvaptan would have created a regulatory burden for the sponsor. At each site, approval was sought from the appropriate research ethics review boards as required. After informed consent, absent a waiver, investigators prospectively recorded patient data. To ascertain patients, some centers systematically reviewed hospital laboratory-generated lists of patients with HN. Others enrolled only patients referred to or managed by the investigator personally. The study was exclusively observational; no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols were imposed. Investigators simply recorded the choices made by the physicians responsible for the patient's hospital care.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To assure that HN was clinically significant, the study required an entry [Na⁺] ≤ 130 mEq/l. Patients were excluded if < 18 years old, hypovolemic, hypervolemic (EU only), using an investigational agent or device, or if hyperglycemic enough to interfere with assessment of [Na⁺] or receiving renal replacement therapy while hyponatremic. As indicated in Supplementary Table S3 online, euvolemia was defined as the absence of clinical and historical evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion or sequestration, and the absence of edema and ascites, or on the basis of the treating physician's diagnosis of SIADH. Hypervolemia was defined as excess extracellular fluid volume manifesting as dependent edema or ascites. Although not a specified exclusion criterion originally, we subsequently decided to exclude any patient who was receiving a thiazide at the time the treating physician made a diagnosis of SIADH. It would be difficult to assure that such patients were not in fact hypovolemic, and diuretic use is generally considered to be an exclusion to the proper diagnosis of SIADH. This decision was made prior to data analysis. A complete listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as published previously, is provided as Supplementary Table S3 online.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among elderly Taiwanese patients [^112JyF2x]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a common chronic disease in the elderly and thiazide diuretics are frequently used as a first-line treatment. Thiazides, a current class of diuretics, competitively antagonize the sodium chloride co-transport protein on the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium chloride and achieve diuresis.

Treatment guidelines often classify hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone as thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics, and these drugs are the most commonly used thiazide diuretics in major clinical trials. National guidelines from the US recommended thiazide diuretics as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, primarily because of their efficacy to reduce cardiovascular complications in major outcome trials such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) and Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). Most recent US, Canadian, and European guidelines also recommend thiazide diuretics as first-line drugs for patients with hypertension. However, in the UK, thiazide-type diuretics are not approved as a first-line treatment for patients with hypertension, and thiazide-like diuretics are recommended instead. Thus, there is a knowledge gap related to the efficacy and side effects of these treatments.

Hyponatremia, the most common electrolyte disorder observed in clinical practice, is often difficult to recognize in the early stages, and is a reported side effect of thiazides. Recent research has noted that the incidence of thiazide-associated hyponatremia (TAH) has increased, and may even be as high as 30%. Although hyponatremia frequently develops rapidly after initiation of thiazide diuretics, many cases of hyponatremia occur after a few months or years of use of thiazide diuretics. A review found that the mean time to TAH after the initiation of therapy was 19 days, and the mean serum sodium level of patients with hyponatremia was 116 mmol/L. While many cases of hyponatremia are asymptomatic or mild, patients with acute onset can develop seizures or coma, and TAH can result in serious morbidity and even mortality in hospitalized patients.

### Structural bases for Na-clcotransporter inhibition by thiazide diuretic drugs and activation by kinases [^11332v2Q]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, so categorized because the former bears a thiazide ring whereas the latter does not, were first developed more than six decades ago. They remain cornerstones of the clinical management of hypertension and fluid overload conditions due to, for example, congestive heart diseases, nephrotic syndrome, and liver cirrhosis; there are more than 80 million combined prescriptions each year in the United States. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics promote salt loss and diuresis by inhibiting Na + - Cl − cotransporter (NCC)-mediated salt (and obligatory water) retention in the kidney. These diuretic drugs, however, do have notable limitations. These include off-target inhibition of carbonic anhydrases that underlies insulin insensitivity and diabetes in some patients, moderate potencies, the presence of a sulfur atom which causes allergy in ∼3–8% of patients, and photosensitivity associated with an increased risk of skin cancers in patients who need chronic management of their blood pressure. An atomic-level understanding of how these diuretic drugs bind to their receptor sites and antagonize NCC would catalyze a rational approach to develop the next generation of diuretic therapeutics with improved specificity and potency as well as a more favorable side-effect profile. A recent NCC/polythiazide co-structure greatly enhanced our understanding of the pharmacology of thiazide diuretics, but how thiazide-like diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide), which are anecdotally superior for preventing cardiovascular events, act on and inhibit NCC remains mysterious. Moreover, hydrochlorothiazide is the most prescribed thiazide diuretic in the United States in the form of monotherapy or a single-pill combination with other medications, but we have yet to elucidate its site and mechanism of action.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^1113MHef]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Edema management in nephrotic syndrome (NS) — Use loop diuretics as first-line therapy for treatment of edema in the nephrotic syndrome, with twice daily dosing preferred over once daily dosing; daily dosing may be acceptable for reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and increase dose of loop diuretic to cause clinically significant diuresis or until maximally effective dose has been reached; switch to longer acting loop diuretic such as bumetanide or torsemide/torasemide if concerned about treatment failure with furosemide, or if concerned about oral drug bioavailability. Restrict dietary sodium to < 2.0 g/d (< 90 mmol/d). Use loop diuretics with other mechanistically different diuretics as synergistic treatment of resistant edema in the nephrotic syndrome; all thiazide-like diuretics in high doses are equally effective and none is preferred, and thiazide diuretics, administered with an oral or i.v. loop diuretic, will impair distal sodium reabsorption and improve diuretic response; amiloride may provide improvement in edema/hypertension, and counter hypokalemia from loop or thiazide diuretics; acetazolamide may be helpful for the metabolic alkalosis of diuresis; spironolactone may provide improvement in edema/hypertension, and counter hypokalemia from loop or thiazide diuretics. Monitor for adverse effects of diuretics including hyponatremia with thiazide diuretics, hypokalemia with thiazide and loop diuretics, impaired GFR, volume depletion especially in pediatric/elderly patients, and hyperkalemia with spironolactone and eplerenone especially if combined with RAS blockade. For the diuretic-resistant patient, strategies include amiloride, acetazolamide, i.v. loop diuretics (bolus or infusion) alone, i.v. loop diuretics in combination with i.v. albumin, ultrafiltration, hemodialysis, and note that amiloride may reduce potassium loss and improve diuresis while acetazolamide may help to treat metabolic alkalosis but is a weak diuretic.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1127MVUu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — Recommendation 10 advises that for individuals with primary aldosteronism receiving PA-specific medical therapy, we suggest using mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) rather than epithelial sodium-channel (ENaC) inhibitors (amiloride, triamterene) (2 | ⊕⊕OO), with the technical remark that this does not apply when spironolactone is contraindicated (eg, hyperkalemia, advanced renal impairment, or pregnancy) or if a non-spironolactone MRA is indicated for another non-PA condition (eg, heart failure).
