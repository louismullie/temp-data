## Question

What is the significance of b2 glycoprotein

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of beta-2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic biology and normal function of β2GPI. Then, I should verify its role as the principal antigenic target in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Next, I will examine the clinical significance of anti-β2GPI antibodies, including isotypes, domain specificity, and risk stratification. After that, I need to check the strength and limitations of the evidence base, including assay issues. Finally, I will consider special contexts like sepsis and pregnancy, and synthesize practical clinical implications and uncertainties that remain.

> Let me first confirm the basic biology. β2GPI is a plasma glycoprotein present at high concentration, historically enigmatic but now recognized to have physiologic roles in innate immunity and thromboregulation, including scavenging of anionic cellular debris and lipopolysaccharide, and modulation of platelet–von Willebrand factor interactions; it circulates in different conformations, which affects its immunogenicity and function [^7c0bd07d] [^c1b420a4].

> Wait, let me verify the antigenic role in APS. The pathogenic autoantibodies in APS are directed primarily against β2GPI rather than phospholipids per se, with β2GPI serving as the dominant antigenic target; this is why anti-β2GPI antibodies are included in the classification criteria alongside lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, and why persistent positivity on repeat testing is required for diagnosis [^a1dcce60] [^24d4c393].

> I will now examine the clinical significance of anti-β2GPI antibodies. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the association with thrombosis is real but variable across studies. Meta-analytic and prospective data suggest a weak independent association of IgG anti-β2GPI with thrombosis, with odds ratios around 2–4 in some cohorts, and a stronger signal when combined with other aPLs or when considering high-avidity or domain I–specific antibodies; isolated IgG anti-β2GPI positivity is less reliably predictive of events [^e532d1e1] [^0b3783f1] [^c97649e9].

> Let me consider isotypes and domain specificity. IgG anti-β2GPI carries the strongest clinical association with thrombosis, whereas IgM may be less specific and, in some SLE cohorts, has even been associated with protective effects against lupus nephritis; antibodies targeting domain I of β2GPI appear more pathogenic and correlate with higher thrombotic risk, though assays are not yet standardized for routine use, which limits clinical adoption [^d29a02f1] [^3495893d] [^384a0088] [^fbb6b499].

> Next, I should review risk stratification. Triple positivity for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2GPI confers the highest thrombotic risk, with annual event rates around 5% in high-risk populations; EULAR guidance explicitly uses antibody profiles and titers to stratify risk, and emerging data suggest that anti–domain I positivity may refine risk further, though this remains investigational in many settings [^431bac2f] [^4709b709] [^384a0088].

> But wait, what if the evidence quality is limited? I need to check that. Systematic reviews consistently rate the quality of evidence for isolated IgG anti-β2GPI as very low, largely due to heterogeneity in populations, assays, and cutoffs; lack of standardization across platforms, variable epitope exposure, and discordant results between in-house and commercial assays complicate interpretation and likely attenuate true associations, underscoring the need for prospective, harmonized studies [^e532d1e1] [^64054fb1] [^fbb6b499].

> Let me think about special contexts. In sepsis, lower plasma β2GPI levels correlate with infection and shock, and higher baseline β2GPI associates with fewer subsequent infections, suggesting a protective role, though this is distinct from the autoantibody-mediated pathology of APS; in pregnancy, anti-β2GPI is included in RPL workups and APS screening, but associations with preeclampsia are inconsistent, reinforcing that antibody profiles and clinical context must guide management [^8ffa6329] [^a4806810] [^0d5a5c5f].

> I should double-check the practical clinical implications. Current guidelines recommend including anti-β2GPI in the initial aPL panel alongside lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, with results confirmed on repeat testing at least 12 weeks apart; in patients with SLE or suggestive clinical phenotypes, testing is recommended at baseline and when clinically indicated, and results should be interpreted in the context of overall risk and antibody profile rather than in isolation [^8e92b4ec] [^29fbb13b] [^431bac2f].

> Hold on, I should verify the key uncertainties. The field still lacks definitive prospective data on isolated anti-β2GPI as an independent predictor, domain I assays require standardization before routine use, and the pathogenic heterogeneity of anti-β2GPI subtypes means that not all positivity confers equal risk; thus, clinical decisions should integrate antibody profile, titers, persistence, and patient-level risk factors rather than relying on a single assay result [^f1d99e20] [^fbb6b499] [^431bac2f].

> In summary, β2GPI is a physiologically active plasma protein that becomes the central antigenic target in APS; anti-β2GPI antibodies, particularly IgG and especially those directed to domain I, are clinically meaningful risk markers for thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity, but their predictive value is modest in isolation and strongest when integrated into a multi-assay profile with attention to persistence and titers, which is how they should be used in current practice [^a1dcce60] [^431bac2f] [^e532d1e1].

Beta-2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) is a **key antigen** in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) [^a1dcce60], where autoantibodies against it drive thrombosis and pregnancy complications [^264eec7d]. Anti-β2GPI antibodies are part of the **APS classification criteria** [^24d4c393] and are especially predictive when persistent, at high titer, or targeting domain I [^384a0088] [^431bac2f]. β2GPI also has physiologic roles in coagulation and innate immunity, and low levels in sepsis correlate with infection risk [^8ffa6329]. Testing for anti-β2GPI (IgG/IgM) is recommended in thrombosis, recurrent pregnancy loss, and SLE, with results interpreted in clinical context and confirmed on repeat testing [^8e92b4ec] [^29fbb13b] [^a4806810].

---

## Structure and physiological functions

β2GPI is a **326-amino acid glycoprotein** with five domains (DI–DV); DI contains the main pathogenic epitope [^10dc953e]. It circulates at ~200 µg/mL and has roles in:

- **Coagulation**: Inhibits intrinsic pathway activation and platelet aggregation [^c1b420a4].
- **Innate immunity**: Binds LPS and apoptotic debris, aiding clearance [^7c0bd07d].
- **Lipid metabolism**: Associates with lipoproteins and may influence atherogenesis [^af5e8c67].

---

## Clinical significance: antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)

APS is defined by vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity with persistent aPLs, including anti-β2GPI [^24d4c393]. Anti-β2GPI antibodies are a **core laboratory criterion** for APS classification [^24d4c393].

---

### Pathogenic mechanisms

Anti-β2GPI antibodies promote thrombosis via:

- **Endothelial activation**: Inducing TF expression and inflammation [^a1dcce60].
- **Platelet activation**: Enhancing aggregation and thrombus formation [^09f6f886].
- **Impaired fibrinolysis**: Inhibiting protein C/S and TF pathway inhibitor [^09f6f886].

---

### Clinical manifestations

Anti-β2GPI antibodies are associated with:

| **Clinical domain** | **Manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Thrombotic | - Venous thromboembolism <br/> - Arterial thrombosis (stroke, MI) <br/> - Microvascular thrombosis [^a1dcce60] |
| Obstetric | - Recurrent pregnancy loss <br/> - Early delivery <br/> - Severe preeclampsia <br/> - HELLP syndrome [^cffc9ef9] |
| Other | - Thrombocytopenia <br/> - Livedo reticularis <br/> - Cardiac valve disease [^aa7bc31b] |

---

### Risk stratification

Risk varies with antibody profile: **triple positivity** (LA, aCL, anti-β2GPI) confers the highest thrombotic risk [^431bac2f], whereas **isolated low-titer anti-β2GPI** carries lower risk [^431bac2f]. Anti-domain I antibodies are more strongly linked to thrombosis and pregnancy complications [^384a0088].

---

## Diagnostic testing and interpretation

Testing should be **standardized** and repeated at ≥ 12-week intervals to confirm persistence [^24d4c393] [^509706e4]:

- **Assays**: ELISA for IgG/IgM anti-β2GPI; LA for functional aPLs [^fe2e63c6].
- **Cutoffs**: Positivity is typically > 99th percentile or > 40 GPL/MPL [^431bac2f].
- **Clinical correlation**: Interpret results with clinical context; transient positives can occur [^4709b709].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend testing in:

- **Thrombosis**: Unprovoked VTE/ATE, especially in young patients [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Recurrent pregnancy loss or late pregnancy complications [^a4806810].
- **SLE**: Baseline aPL testing and repeat if events occur [^29fbb13b].

Management is guided by risk stratification, with **anticoagulation** for thrombotic APS and **prophylaxis** considered for high-risk obstetric or surgical settings [^431bac2f].

---

## Emerging research and controversies

- **Domain I antibodies**: May improve risk prediction but need standardization [^fbb6b499].
- **IgA anti-β2GPI**: Associated with thrombosis in some cohorts; not yet in classification criteria [^cb255c1f].
- **Non-criteria antibodies**: Anti-PS/PT and others may aid diagnosis in seronegative APS [^798a29ce].

---

## Non-APS clinical significance

Low β2GPI levels in sepsis correlate with **infection risk** and may reflect consumption or altered synthesis [^8ffa6329]. Genetic polymorphisms (e.g. Val247Leu) associate with anti-β2GPI production and APS risk [^91680ae3].

---

β2GPI is central to APS pathogenesis, and anti-β2GPI antibodies are key for diagnosis and risk stratification; testing should be **standardized and interpreted in clinical context**, with ongoing research refining domain-specific assays and expanding the role of non-criteria antibodies.

### Autoantibodies to domain 1 of beta 2 glycoprotein 1: a promising candidate biomarker for risk management in antiphospholipid syndrome [^07866032]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by frequent clotting in arteries and veins and/or miscarriages. Autoantibodies to phospholipids and to beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (β(2)GP1) play an important role in the pathogenesis of APS. Antibodies to the domain 1 of β(2)GP1 (β(2)GP1-D1) have been suggested as a risk marker for thrombosis and to a lesser extent for pregnancy complications in patients suffering from APS. Despite significant interest in anti-β(2)GP1-D1 antibodies and a considerable research history, the number of studies is still limited and acceptance of the clinical significance of this biomarker is still evolving. The present review summarizes the current knowledge of anti-β(2)GP1-D1 antibodies and provides insights on recent discoveries. Moreover, we present a suggested guideline for future studies to better understand and verify the clinical utility of anti-β(2)GP1-D1 antibodies.

### The significance of autoantibodies against β ₂-glycoprotein I [^b2b0d02d]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by the persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with a history of thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity, including fetal loss. APS is an autoimmune disease with a confusing name because the pathologic auto-antibodies are shown to be directed against the plasma protein β(2)-glycoprotein I and not against phospholipids. In fact, auto-antibodies that recognize phospholipids themselves are not associated with thrombosis but with infectious diseases. One of the intriguing questions is why autoantibodies against β(2)-glycoprotein I are so commonly found in both patients and the healthy. Several potential mechanisms have been suggested to explain the increased thrombotic risk in patients with these autoantibodies. In this overview, we will summarize our knowledge on the etiology of the autoantibodies, and we will discuss the evidence that identify autoantibodies against β(2)-glycoprotein I as the culprit of APS.

### A systematic review of the association between anti-β-2 glycoprotein I antibodies and APS manifestations [^f1d99e20]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, we could not find evidence that isolated IgG anti-B2GPI positivity predicts clinical events. The available evidence is of very low quality. A prospective study examining the natural history of patients with persistent anti-B2GPI positivity regardless of prior aPL testing or clinical history is needed to elucidate the clinical relevance of B2GPI and/or anti-B2GPI antibodies. However, such a study would be difficult to execute given the lack of standardized testing and the low rates of isolated anti-B2GPI positivity. We conclude that there is little or no currently available high-quality evidence to support an independent association between isolated IgG anti-B2GPI positivity and the risk of clinical events, such as thrombosis or obstetric complications.

### Β (2)-glycoprotein I: evolution, structure and function [^7c0bd07d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

β(2) -Glycoprotein I (β(2) -GPI) is a protein that circulates in blood at high concentrations. The function of β(2) -GPI has long been an enigma. More than 20 years ago, it was discovered that β(2) -GPI is the major antigen for the circulating antibodies in the antiphospholipid syndrome. However, this knowledge has not advanced our understanding of the physiologic role of the protein. In recent years, new insights have suggested an important function of this protein in innate immunity. β(2) -GPI was found to scavenge lipopolysaccharide and was able to clear unwanted anionic cellular remnants such as microparticles from the circulation. The function of β(2) -GPI seems to depend on the structural conformation of the protein, and it has been established that β(2) -GPI can exist in at least two conformations. In this review, we will highlight and summarize the current knowledge on this protein.

Introduction

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thrombotic or obstetric complications in patients with persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). The major antigenic target of these antibodies is thought to be β-2 glycoprotein I (B2GPI), which was first identified in 1990 as the cofactor for anticardiolipin (aCL) binding. Anti-β-2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-B2GPI) have been observed to increase thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner in rodent modelsand mediate thrombosis through suppression of tissue factor pathway inhibitor type I, platelet and neutrophil activation, and inhibition of protein C and antithrombin activity.

Although anti-B2GPI are shown to promote thrombosis based on in vitro and animal experiments, their clinical significance as detected by current laboratory methods remains uncertain. Existing literature consists primarily of retrospective studies that attempt to correlate the presence of anti-B2GPI with prior clinical events. Results vary widely, as do the patient populations, isotypes of anti-B2GPI, and type of clinical manifestations examined. In general, anti-B2GPI is reported to correlate with thrombosis, but some studies find an association only with the immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype, whereas others find a significant link with IgM isotypes as well. However, some show that neither isotype is associated with thrombosis, and in 1 study, IgM anti-B2GPI was actually associated with a reduced risk of stroke. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with aPL without SLE, Reynaud and colleaguesreported that anti-B2GPI was associated with increased risk of arterial events only and not venous thromboembolism (VTE). The reported association between anti-B2GPI and obstetric events is similarly variable, with some studies noting an association, whereas others find no association.

Therefore, although anti-B2GPI is often cited as the major pathogenically relevant antibody in APS, understanding of its clinical relevance remains elusive. In contrast, lupus anticoagulants (LAs) (and to a lesser extent, aCL) are generally thought to correlate with clinical APS manifestations. Determining whether (and the degree to which) anti-B2GPI positivity is independently associated with clinical outcomes is important because isolated anti-B2GPI positivity is occasionally encountered during evaluation for APS. To this end, we performed a systematic review to identify if IgG anti-β-2 glycoprotein I positivity was independently associated with thrombotic and/or obstetric manifestations of APS.

### A systematic review of the association between anti-β-2 glycoprotein I antibodies and APS manifestations [^e532d1e1]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Anti-β-2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-B2GPI) are often cited as the major pathogenically relevant antibody in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), but it is unclear if there is clinical evidence to support this theory. We performed a systematic review to determine if immunoglobulin G anti-B2GPI positivity was independently associated with thrombotic and/or obstetric manifestations of APS. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov electronic databases through April 2020 for prospective studies that met prespecified design criteria. Of 4758 articles identified through computer-assisted search, 4 studies examining obstetric outcomes and 2 studies examining thrombotic outcomes were included for qualitative assessment. The presence of anti-B2GPI had only a weak independent association with thrombosis and was, at best, inconsistently associated with obstetric complications. A quantitative assessment could not be performed because of study heterogeneity. The overall quality of the evidence was very low. Although anti-B2GPI are commonly thought to mediate APS manifestations, clinical evidence is lacking with very low-quality data to support a weak association with thrombosis.

### Post-translational oxidative modification of β ₂-glycoprotein I and its role in the pathophysiology of the antiphospholipid syndrome [^29535ec8]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Vascular thrombosis and/or recurrent miscarriages are the main characteristics defining Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). Currently there is no well-defined clinical features and/or laboratory tests that predicts the risk of adverse prognostic outcomes in APS. In this short review, we report the importance of posttranslational modification of beta2 glycoprotein I, the major autoantigen in the APS beta2 glycoprotein I that may, in part, explain possible mechanisms for the generation of auto antibodies to beta2 glycoprotein I. A specific ELISA measuring the level of oxidised beta2 glycoprotein I could be used as a potential new laboratory test - along with other laboratory tests - to more accurately predict the risk of having a clinical event in patients with APS.

### Anti-beta (2)-glycoprotein I antibodies and the antiphospholipid syndrome [^4b14940a]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The mechanism of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) development is still not completely understood. Accumulating evidence indicates that beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI), is the major target antigen for antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune condition. Knowledge about the molecular structure, biological characteristics and function of beta(2)GPI has been expanding in recent years. In this review, we have focused on some recent important findings on beta(2)GPI and anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies in patients and animal models with APS.

### Laboratory methods to detect antiphospholipid antibodies [^fe2e63c6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

This chapter reviews several important themes pertaining to the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), including a description of the clinical features, a discussion of the main autoantigen, beta 2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI), and insights into the characteristics of the pathogenic anti-β2GPI autoantibodies. Evidence-based considerations for when to test for APS are explored, along with the clinical significance of patients testing positive on multiple APS assays, so-called triple positivity. A detailed review of recently published laboratory guidelines for the detection of lupus anticoagulant and the solid-phase anticardiolipin and anti-β2GPI ELISAs is undertaken. Finally, a brief review of nonclassification criteria laboratory assays with potential future diagnostic utility is presented.

Second, differences in the patient populations may obscure any true effect specific to anti-B2GPI. The 3 studies that reported a significant relationship between IgG anti-B2GPI positivity and clinical outcomes involved patients who were tested for aPL because of a clinical history suggestive of APS. In contrast, the 1 report studying healthy pregnant women reported low rates of IgG anti-B2GPI positivity and no association with clinical outcomes. It has been well documented that aPL positivity may be transiently seen in various conditions, including HIV, syphilis, malaria, leprosy, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and celiac disease. There is also increasing evidence that the anti-B2GPI detected in APS is directed toward domain 1 (D1). This raises the question of whether studies including patients with a history suggestive of APS and aPL positivity are more likely to capture clinically relevant anti-B2GPI, whereas unselected patient populations may express a heterogeneous group of antibodies directed at other subunits of the B2GPI molecule. Indeed, 2 prospective studies identified in this review looked specifically at the clinical relevance of anti-B2GPI D1 positivity and reported a significant association with rates of thrombosis. Further progress to standardize anti-B2GPI D1 testing and, ultimately, to clarify its clinical relevance is needed.

Finally, as with any systematic review or meta-analysis, the search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria may have impacted our findings. In this review, we sought to include the best available evidence by examining only prospective studies where anti-B2GPI status was defined by Sydney criteria thresholds. It is possible that less restrictive criteria for article inclusion may have yielded a different result.

Prior prospective studies have identified LA as an independent risk factor for thrombosis among aPL carriersand that the risk of first thromboembolic event among high-risk subjects who were triple positive for LA, aCL, and anti-B2GPI was particularly elevated at 5.3% per year. By contrast, although anti-B2GPI is often cited as the most pathogenically relevant of the aPLs, we identified only 1 study in which the association between anti-B2GPI and thrombotic outcomes was independent of LA and aCL positivity. There is no convincing evidence to support a clear association with obstetric complications.

### The clinical relevance of IgA anticardiolipin and IgA anti-β ₂ glycoprotein I antiphospholipid antibodies: a systematic review [^b1688825]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is diagnosed in patients with thromboembolic events and/or pregnancy loss in the presence of persistent laboratory evidence for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Diagnostic tests for the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies include laboratory assays that detect anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, and anti-β(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies. Most studies on aPL have mainly focused on the estimation of the IgG and IgM isotypes, with only a few studies reporting on the pathogenic significance of IgA aPL. In this review we aimed to summarize and analyze the evidence published in the literature on the prevalence and the clinical significance of IgA aPL.

### Molecular pathophysiology of the antiphospholipid syndrome: the role of oxidative post-translational modification of beta 2 glycoprotein I [^e7fa75fd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

It has been well established that antiphospholipid antibodies and specifically those directed against beta 2 glycoprotein I (β2GPI) are pathogenic for the development of thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Several groups have shown that anti-β2GPI antibodies, in complex with β2GPI, elicit effects on blood cells and coagulation-fibrinolysis proteins, which prime the arterial and venous vasculature for the development of thrombosis. However, much less is known about the mechanism initiating the production of autoantibodies against β2GPI, a physiological abundant protein of blood. In the current review, novel findings are presented regarding the structure and oxidative post-translational modifications of β2GPI, which trigger the immune response. The majority of circulating β2GPI exists in a form containing unpaired cysteines (free thiols), which constitutes the reduced form of β2GPI. The free thiols exposed on β2GPI are involved in the interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. We propose that this abundant pool of free thiols may serve as an antioxidant reservoir protecting cells or critical molecules from oxidative stress. Oxidation of β2GPI confers an increase in its immunogenicity through a Th1 immunological mechanism. The clinical significance of these observations is that serum from patients with APS, assessed by a novel ELISA assay, have a significant increase in oxidised β2GPI. These findings hold promise, not only for the delineation of the role of β2GPI as an immunological target, but also for the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic assays for APS.

### Beta2-glycoprotein I and LDL-receptor family members [^88221013]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in plasma is a risk factor for thrombo-embolic complications. In vitro, however, the same antibodies can prolong clotting times in coagulation assays, a classic marker for a bleeding tendency. For years this contradiction puzzles many scientists. We now know that the term antiphospholipid antibodies comprises a heterogeneous population of antibodies and there is growing evidence that only subpopulations of antiphospholipid antibodies are relevant for the clinical complication. In combination with new information on the complex interaction between antiphospholipid antibodies, the protein beta2-Glycoprotein I, and cellular surfaces have opened new avenues for the understanding of the pathology of this syndrome.

### Discordance between anti-beta2-glycoprotein-I and anti-cardiolipin antibodies in patients with clinical criteria of antiphospholipid syndrome [^a8104d49]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clinical and immunological features of patients with clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with anti-beta2-glycoprotein-I antibodies (anti-beta2-GP-I) but without anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) or any other autoimmune condition are not well documented. We sought to determine the clinical significance of positive anti-beta2-GP-I with negative aCL.

Methods

From July 2002 through July 2003, 1,179 serum samples obtained in our hospital from the Community of Madrid were tested for anti-beta2-GP-I and aCL by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical records of patients with discordant anti-beta2-GP-I and aCL were retrospectively analysed.

Results

A total of 56 patients with discordant anti-beta2-GP-I and aCL were identified. By logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex and risk factors of thrombosis, the risk for developing APS criteria associated with anti-beta2-GP-I was significant [odds ratio 3.88; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05–14.27; p = 0.04). 15 out of 56 patients (26.8%) had positive anti-beta2-GP-I and negative aCL. 5 out of 15 anti-beta2-GP-I-positive patients had clinical APS without serological nor clinical evidence of any autoimmune disease.

Conclusion

Determination of anti-beta2-GP-I should be considered in individual cases with clinical manifestations of primary APS and repeated negative results on conventional antiphospholipid antibody test.

### Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies – when and how should they be measured? [^c238ef6a]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

The biological criteria of the antiphospholipid syndrome defined at the Sapporo meeting in 1998 included the presence of lupus anticoagulant (LA) and/or anticardiolipin antibodies at medium and high titers. During the 48th SSC meeting held in Boston July 2002, it was proposed to modify these criteria. Four patient groups were defined, the first one comprising LA and anti-beta2glycoprotein I antibodies (abeta2GPI), the second one LA only, the third one abeta2GPI only and the fourth one other antiphospholipid antibodies such as antiprothrombin, anticardiolipin, antiphosphatidylethanolamine, etc. This proposition raised the issue of the association of abeta2GPI with APS clinical criteria (thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity). In some studies, a strong association between IgG abeta2GPI and thrombosis was found, whereas in others this association could not be demonstrated. In the obstetrical field, few studies are available and no clear conclusion can be drawn yet. However, for thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity, it has been shown that in up to 10% of patients, abeta2GPI are the sole antibodies present and therefore the diagnosis of APS would be missed in these patients. In addition, some studies suggest that the severity of disease is dependent on the number of positive tests and on their titers. We recommend abeta2GPI assays to be included in the panel of antiphospholipid screening tests. However, the standardisation of abeta2GPI assays has to be improved in order to ensure better comparability between the studies.

### Clinical significance of anti-domain 1 β ₂-glycoprotein I antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome [^bd6fcc65]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity. In APS patients anti-domain 1 β2-glycoprotein I (anti-D1 β2GPI) IgG antibodies correlate strongly with thrombosis and to the lesser extent, with pregnancy complications. The aim of this study was to assess clinical utility of the anti-D1 β2GPI antibodies in the diagnosis and risk stratification of antiphospholipid syndrome.

Patients/Methods

In this retrospective study 202 autoimmune patients were studied (primary APS - 58, secondary - 45 SLE - 99). Anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β 2 GPI (aβ 2 GPI antibodies) (IgG and IgM class) together with anti-D1 IgG were tested with QUANTA Flash chemiluminescent immunoassay and lupus anticoagulant (LA) with coagulometric methods.

Results

The highest anti-D1 values were observed in triple positive patients as compared to patients with other antiphospholipid antibody profiles. A strong correlation was found between levels of anti-D1 IgG and a β2GPI IgG antibodies for all patients analyzed (Spearman's ρ = 0.87; p < 0.0001). Anti-D1 IgG antibodies increase specificity resulting from classic aPL positivity but at the expense of sensitivity. Anti-D1 test does not add accuracy in predicting APS thrombotic complications on the top of accuracy offered by classic aPL tests and their profiles.

Conclusions

Anti-D1 IgG antibodies did not add diagnostic power to the standard laboratory aPL tests as assessed by this retrospective study. A true clinical significance of anti-D1 antibodies in thrombotic risk stratification of aPL positive patients will require a properly designed clinical prospective trials.

### Oxidation of LDL and its clinical implication [^af5e8c67]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is one of the earliest events in atherosclerosis. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) represents a variety of modification of both lipid and apolipoprotein B (apoB) components by lipid peroxidation. This promotes atherosclerosis through inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms that lead to the formation of macrophage foam cells. Recent findings also suggest that oxLDL forms complexes with beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) within atherosclerotic lesions and that these complexes appear in the circulation. Autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against oxLDL/beta(2)GPI complexes occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). These autoantibodies significantly correlate with arterial thrombosis. IgG auto-Abs having similar specificity emerge spontaneously in NZWxBXSB F1 mice, which generally are considered to be an animal model of APS, and these mice produce a monoclonal IgG auto-Ab (WB-CAL-1) against oxLDL/beta(2)GPI complexes. WB-CAL-1 significantly increased the in vitro uptake of oxLDL/beta(2)GPI complexes by macrophages, which suggests that such IgG auto-Abs are pro-atherogenic. In contrast, IgM anti-oxLDL natural Abs found in the atherosclerosis-prone mice have been proposed to be protective. The presence of such Abs in humans has been documented in many publications but their exact pathophysiological significance remains unclear. In this article, we review recent progress in our understanding of the clinical significance of oxidation of LDL, formation of oxLDL complexes, and Abs in atherosclerotic and/or autoimmune disease.

### Novel insights into associations of antibodies against cardiolipin and beta2-glycoprotein I with clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome [^9384e821]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a clinical autoimmune disorder characterized by arterial and/or venous thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity, associated with the persistence of lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies. Accumulating evidence indicates that phospholipid binding protein, beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) represents the major target antigen for antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies and plays a role in the pathogenesis of APS. It is widely accepted that aPL antibodies detected by conventional solid phase assays in patients with APS are mainly directed against a complex of aCL and anti-beta2GPI, although antibodies against beta2GPI protein can now also be detected by specific ELISA using purified proteins in solid phase. Despite the fact that these antibodies are not listed in the new diagnostic criteria, a high specificity of anti-beta2GPI assay for the clinical features of APS was established. During the last decade, numerous studies have investigated the clinical link between aCL and/or anti-beta2GPI antibodies and diverse features of APS. This manuscript reviews the current studies published recently in this field and discusses the relationship between the existence of aCL and anti-beta2GPI antibodies and the main and unusual manifestations of APS.

### International consensus statement on an update of the classification criteria for definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) [^24d4c393]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Classification criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (Sydney criteria)" for antiphospholipid syndrome and recurrent pregnancy loss.

The Classification Criteria for Antiphospholipid Syndrome, also known as the Sydney Criteria, is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The primary components of the Sydney Criteria are divided into laboratory, thrombotic, and obstetrical criteria.

The laboratory criteria require the presence of at least one of the following on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart: positive lupus anticoagulant, elevated anticardiolipin antibodies, or elevated anti-beta-2-glycoprotein antibodies.

The thrombotic criteria include arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, or small vessel thrombosis.

The obstetrical criteria include three or more unexplained miscarriages at less than 10 weeks gestation, one or more unexplained fetal deaths after 10 weeks gestation, or one or more preterm births before the 34th week of gestation due to preeclampsia or placental insufficiency.

The diagnostic criteria for APS are met if at least one laboratory criterion is present in conjunction with either one thrombotic criterion or one obstetrical criterion. If these conditions are not met, the diagnostic criteria for APS are not fulfilled according to the Sydney Criteria.

The Sydney Criteria's clinical utility lies in its ability to standardize the diagnosis of APS, a condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and guide appropriate treatment strategies.

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) classification criteria tool assesses whether an individual meets the international Sydney criteria for diagnosing APS. The tool requires input in three areas: laboratory findings, thrombotic events, and obstetrical history.

The user must respond to three input categories:

- Laboratory criteria involve detecting certain antibodies, with options including:

- Positive lupus anticoagulant
- Elevated anticardiolipin antibodies
- Elevated anti-beta-2-glycoprotein antibodies

- **Thrombotic criteria consider types of clotting events, which include**:
- Arterial thrombosis
- Venous thrombosis
- Small vessel thrombosis

- **Obstetrical criteria focus on pregnancy-related complications, such as**:
- Three or more unexplained miscarriages at less than 10 weeks gestation
- One or more unexplained fetal deaths after 10 weeks gestation
- One or more preterm births before the 34th week due to preeclampsia or placental insufficiency

To determine if the diagnostic criteria are met, at least one laboratory criterion must be present. Additionally, there must be either a history of thrombotic events or specific obstetrical complications. The logic is straightforward:

If any laboratory criterion is selected and there is at least one thrombotic or obstetrical criterion present, the tool concludes that the diagnostic criteria are met for APS. Otherwise, these criteria are not met. This evaluation ensures the broad criteria established in the Sydney guidelines are covered by confirming both laboratory and clinical manifestations.

Effectively, this method verifies whether the combination of laboratory and clinical data suffices to diagnose APS according to established standards. The outcome provides a clear indication of whether the criteria are satisfied based on the supplied data.

### Pathophysiology of the antiphospholipid syndrome [^d04de4fa]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome is a distinct disorder with the clinical features of recurrent thrombosis in the venous or arterial circulation and fetal losses. Its serological marker is the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood of these patients. The relation between the presence of antibodies against anionic phospholipids and thromboembolic complications is well established over the last 25 years but the pathophysiology of the syndrome is largely unclear. Even after all these years, there is a persisting debate about the specificity and sensitivity of the assays for the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies. We now accept that antibodies to beta2-glycoprotein I rather than to anionic phospholipids are the major pathological antibodies, although there is no clear consensus on how the presence of these antibodies correlates with the different clinical manifestations of the syndrome. In this review, we discuss the current methods of detection of the antibodies and our insight into the pathobiology of the syndrome. We propose a mechanism for describing how the presence of anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies relates to the different clinical manifestations observed.

### A systematic review of the association between anti-β-2 glycoprotein I antibodies and APS manifestations [^20b9182f]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Literature search

A comprehensive search was performed using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov electronic databases. The keywords (MeSH terms) used were as follows: (1) "beta 2-Glycoprotein I," (2) "Glycoproteins," (3) "Antiphospholipid Syndrome," (4) "Phospholipids," (5) "Antibodies, Antiphospholipid." The databases were searched from inception to April 15, 2020.

Titles and abstracts of all publications identified by the search were extracted and reviewed for relevance to the study by 1 author (D.J.). Articles were excluded if they dealt with an unrelated topic, were not available in the English language, or examined a pediatric population. We excluded reviews, case reports, editorials, commentaries, and conference abstracts. Studies that prospectively evaluated APS manifestations among patients identified for anti-B2GPI status were included for full manuscript review by 2 authors (D.J. reviewed all articles and M.C. D.G. and W.L. each reviewed one-third of the articles). All included articles were extracted for first author's name, year of publication, stated objective, patient population, number of subjects, length of follow-up, thrombotic and obstetric outcomes, and aPL testing characteristics, including type of assay used, positivity threshold, units of measurement, and number of controls used to establish reference ranges. When critical information was not reported, authors of the original publications were contacted. All articles wherein there was a discrepancy between the 2 reviewers were discussed among the group for a consensus on inclusion or exclusion.

### A systematic review of the association between anti-β-2 glycoprotein I antibodies and APS manifestations [^64054fb1]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based on our systematic review, IgG anti-B2GPI has a weak independent association with thrombosis. There does not appear to be a significant impact on the risk of fetal loss, placental abruption, intrauterine growth restriction, or composite obstetric complications, and studies examining an association between IgG anti-B2GPI and preeclampsia/eclampsia have yielded inconsistent results. There is no evidence that isolated IgG anti-B2GPI positivity predicts clinical events. Despite the prospective methodology, the overall quality of evidence is very low, and a quantitative assessment could not be performed given the heterogeneity in the patient populations and outcomes examined in the studies.

Several challenges exist in interpreting this literature. First, there is a lack of standardization among anti-B2GPI testing, which may be done via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescence, immunoassays using fluorescence, or multiplex flow. Assays may be performed using a commercial kit or, more commonly, developed in-house. Furthermore, although aCL is typically reported in IgG phospholipid and IgM phospholipid units, no convention exists for anti-B2GPI, which may be expressed as units per milliliter, micrograms per milliliter, optical density value, IgG phospholipid, or IgM phospholipid. Several studies included in this analysis reported anti-B2GPI level by percentile or standard deviation from the mean, although this is not recommended by the International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies. Interassay correlation is variable, and some studies have reported that as many as 40% of patients referred for aPL were discovered to have negative results upon retesting at a central laboratory. Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity of these assays have improved over time, making older reports examining aPL less reliable.

### Avidity of anti-β-2-glycoprotein I antibodies [^4bddda17]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

The terms affinity and avidity are often used indiscriminately, despite clearly differing. Since affinity refers to monovalent binding of antibodies to a monovalent epitope, the majority of data on the binding of anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI) characterized their avidity rather than affinity. Anti-beta2-GPI were generally believed to be of low avidity, but heterogeneous avidity of patients' IgG anti-beta2-GPI has been demonstrated. High avidity anti-beta2-GPI monoclonals were reported to possess higher pathogenicity than low avidity anti-beta2-GPI. Polyclonal high avidity anti-beta2-GPI were found to be more common in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and associated with thrombosis. Some conformational changes of beta2-GPI are required for the binding of polyclonal anti-beta2-GPI to the antigen: neither high density of the antigen nor high avidity of the anti-beta2-GPI alone is sufficient for the recognition. Avidity of anti-beta2-GPI should be considered in any attempt of inter-laboratory standardisation and/or evaluation of anti-beta2-GPI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

### Is the determination of anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies useful in patients with venous thromboembolism without the antiphospholipid syndrome? [^27a78418]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) antibodies are frequently found in patients with lupus anticoagulant (LA). To investigate the prevalence of antibeta2GPI antibodies and their clinical impact in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) without LA/anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), we studied 503 patients [128 (36.2%) men, median age 41 years (interquartile range, IQR 28–54 years)] with previous thrombosis. A group of 113 individuals without VTE [43 (38.1%) men, age 46.7 years (IQR 38–52 years)] served as a control group. Among 418 patients without LA/ACA, anti-beta2GPI-IgG levels were elevated in seven (1.7%), -IgM in 15 (3.6%) and -IgA in 14 (3.3%) cases; in 58 patients with ACA, anti-beta2GPI-IgG levels were elevated in two (3.4%), six (10.3%) and three (5.2%), and in 27 with LA, they were elevated in 18 (66.7%), 19 (70.4%) and 10 (37%) respectively. Thus, the prevalence of elevated anti-beta2GPI antibodies was not increased in patients without LA/ACA but was strongly associated with LA. Patients without ACA/LA who had a recurrent event did not have higher prevalence of elevated anti-beta2GPI-IgG, -IgM or -IgA antibodies than those without a recurrent event. Thus, elevated antibeta2GPI antibodies are not likely to be a predictor of recurrent events in patients without LA. We conclude that determination of anti-beta2GPI antibodies does not improve the clinical management of patients with a history of VTE without LA/ACA.

### Current concepts on the pathogenesis of the antiphospholipid syndrome [^264eec7d]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an important cause of acquired thrombophilia. It is characterized by the core clinical manifestations of thrombosis, either venous or arterial, and in women it can also be associated with recurrent fetal loss. The detection of persistently elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL Abs) is a requisite laboratory feature for the diagnosis to be made. The dominant antigenic targets in APS are beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) and prothrombin. There is an accumulating body of experimental evidence that suggests that specific subgroups of aPL Abs may directly contribute to disease pathogenesis. This review critically examines the experimental evidence underlying the various propositions made to explain how these antibodies may predispose to disease in humans. Furthermore, it also examines the evidence relating to the immunologic mechanisms that may contribute to the breakage of peripheral tolerance in this disorder. Delineating the strengths and limitations of the experimental evidence accumulated thus far will hopefully stimulate further experimentation toward achieving the ultimate goal of precisely defining the dominant pathogenic mechanisms operational in APS. This may pave the way for the development of improved therapies.

### Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^509706e4]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid antibodies are directed against phospholipid-protein complexes and include lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I antibodies. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a common cause of acquired thrombophilia and is characterized by venous or arterial thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Antibodies should be demonstrable on at least 2 occasions separated by 12 weeks. Heterogeneity of the autoantibodies and absence of gold standard assays makes interpretation of laboratory results a challenge for both laboratorians and clinicians. This review discusses the key laboratory and clinical aspects of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Particular focus is given to lupus anticoagulant detection, in view of recently updated laboratory guidelines.

### Value of autoantibodies to beta (2)-glycoprotein 1 in the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome [^9814439c]. Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To define the specificity and positive predictive value of anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein 1 (anti-beta(2)GP1) antibodies for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

Methods

We determined the presence of anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein 1 (anti-beta(2)GP1) immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM in 191 consecutive sera from 191 patients and reviewed clinical data separately. aCL IgG and IgM were detected separately using commercial ELISA kits. Anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies were detected with an in-house ELISA using beta(2)GP1.

Results

Seven patients were diagnosed as having APS and 184 as having other diseases. Thirty-six patients were aCL-positive and 12 were anti-beta(2)GP1-positive, seven of these 12 were APS patients. The specificity for anti-beta(2)GP1 in our population was 97%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 58%. Among the aCL-positive patients, specificity was 90% and PPV 70–87%.

Conclusions

This study shows that anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies have a higher specificity and PPV than aCL for APS. The PPV of anti-beta(2)GP1 was greater in aCL-positive than in all patients. We conclude that screening for anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies in aCL-positive patients increases the specificity and the PPV of aCL testing. In addition, we show that there is no need to screen for anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies in the absence of aCL antibodies and in the absence of strong clinical suspicion of APS.

### The clinical value of assays detecting antibodies against domain I of β ₂-glycoprotein I in the antiphospholipid syndrome [^fbb6b499]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

As the clinical symptoms of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) frequently occur irrespective of the syndrome, diagnosis predominantly depends on the laboratory assays measuring the level or function of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) is increasingly accepted as the most important target of aPLs. Anti-β2GPI antibodies constitute a heterogeneous population, but current in vivo and in vitro evidence show that especially the first domain (DI) of β2GPI contains an important pathogenic epitope. This epitope containing Glycine40-Arginine43 (G40-R43) has proven to be cryptic and only exposed when β2GPI is in its open conformation. A previous study demonstrated a highly variable exposure of the cryptic epitope in commercial anti-β2GPI assays, with implications on correct patient classification. Unexpectedly, recent unpublished data revealed impaired exposure of the pathogenic epitope in the commercially available anti-DI chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) assay detecting specific antibodies directed to DI. In this review we summarize the laboratory and clinical performance characteristics of the different anti-DI assays in published data and conclude with inconsistent results for both the correlation of anti-DI antibodies with clinical symptoms and the added value of anti-DI antibodies in the classification criteria of APS. Additionally, we hypothesize on possible explanations for the observed discrepancies. Finally, we highly advise manufacturers to use normal pooled plasma spiked with the monoclonal anti-DI antibodies to verify correct exposure of the cryptic epitope.

Baseline characteristic comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney U, chi-square, or Kruskal-Wallis tests for skewed variables and Student's T test or chi-square test for normal distributed variables. ✱ p < 0.05

We found that B2GPI levels were significantly lower in patients with sepsis compared with patients without sepsis. Patients with a septic shock had lower B2GPI levels compared with patients with solely sepsis (Fig. 1 a). Patients with an infection had lower levels of B2GPI (Fig. 1 b). Patients within the highest tertile of B2GPI levels developed 44% fewer infections compared with the lowest tertile (P = 0.007, Fig. 1 d) in the 10-day follow-up. There was no significant difference in B2GPI levels between survivors and non-survivors (Fig. 1 c) and between gram-positive and gram-negative sepsis (162 [IQR 87–275] vs 131 [IQR 96–221]).

The cohort was divided into three equal tertiles based on the B2GPI level. The relation between the development of infection and the different tertiles was calculated by applying the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical differences between survival curves were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Highest levels of B2GPI differ significantly from the lowest levels of B2GPI (P = 0.007)

Results

Study selection

A computer-assisted database search identified 4758 articles (Figure 1). An additional 5 articles were identified through review of references cited. After removal of duplicates, 3988 works were screened for relevancy by abstract and title. Among 245 potentially eligible articles, 35 were identified based on title and abstract screen as prospective studies and reviewed in full.

Figure 1.
Literature search results. Flow diagram of study selection process for systematic review.

Description of studies

In total, 6 of the 35 prospective studies are included. The most common reasons for exclusion of prospective studies were that the study design was, upon full-text review, deemed to be retrospective, the cutoff value for anti-B2GPI positivity was below Sydney criteria threshold, the relationship between anti-B2GPI and clinical manifestations was not reported, and outcomes were not assessed for their relationship to individual isotypes of anti-B2GPI, but rather as a composite of IgG and IgM.

Among the 6 included studies, 4 looked primarily at obstetric outcomes (Table 1), and 2 looked at thrombotic outcomes (Table 2). The numbers of included anti-B2GPI + patients tended to be small, ranging from 7 to 64. All studies used in-house assays for antibody detection with reference ranges derived from 20 to 200 normal controls. Positivity for anti-B2GPI was defined by percentile in 3 studies, number of standard deviations from the mean in 1, and units per milliliter in 2.

Obstetric events

Among the 4 studies that evaluated for obstetric complications, 1 studied healthy pregnant women who were tested for aPL and then followed for obstetric events; 2 followed a cohort of known aPL-positive pregnant women, and 1 examined outcomes of a second pregnancy among women who had a history of prior embryonic loss and aPL positivity. Three of the 4 found no association between anti-B2GPI positivity and adverse pregnancy outcome. One reported that anti-B2GPI was independently associated with preeclampsia, but not with fetal loss, placental abruption, or intrauterine fetal growth restriction.

### Does the anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibody provide additional information in patients with thrombosis? [^f206ed11]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether the anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I (anti-beta(2)GPI) antibody may provide additional information in patients with thrombosis in conjunction with the lupus anticoagulant (LAC) or anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody.

Methods

We selected 235 patients whose plasma were tested for the presence of all three antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies (LAC, aCL, and anti-beta(2)GPI) and were positive for at least one aPL antibody from January 2000 to December 2001. The LAC test was performed using dilute activated thromboplastin time reagent (dAPTT) and dilute Russell viper venom time reagent (dRVVT). ACL (IgG/IgM) and anti-beta(2)GPI (IgG/IgM) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Clinical data were collected and analysed in all patients with aPL antibody.

Results

Of the 235 patients with aPL, thrombosis was detected in 76 patients (28.0%). Of the 76 patients with thrombosis, 29 were positive for LAC, 9 for aCL, 7 for anti-beta(2)GPI, 3 for LAC+aCL, 9 for aCL+anti-beta(2)GPI, 11 for LAC+anti-beta(2)GPI, and 8 for LAC+aCL+anti-beta(2)GPI. The rate of thrombosis was significantly different (p = 0.01) among single positive patients (45/163, 27.6%), double positive patients (23/60, 38.3%), and triple positive patients (8/12, 66.7%). In single positive patients, the rate of thrombosis was highest in LAC positive patients (29/85, 34.1%). In double positive patients, the LAC+anti-beta(2)GPI positive group (11/24, 45.8%) and aCL+anti-beta(2)GPI positive group (9/22, 40.9%) had higher rates of thrombosis than the LAC+aCL positive group (3/14, 21.4%).

Conclusion

Single positivity for anti-beta(2)GPI explained 9.2% of thrombotic events in the absence of LAC or aCL. Double or triple positivity for aPLs were associated with a higher rate of thrombosis than single positivity for aPL. Our results suggest that anti-beta(2)GPI provides additional information in patients with thrombosis in conjunction with LAC or aCL.

### Clinical relevance of multiple antibody specificity testing in anti-phospholipid syndrome and recurrent pregnancy loss [^87e2f5e0]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

We wanted to evaluate whether testing for anti-phosholipid antibodies other than anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I (abeta2GPI) immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM identifies patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) who may be positive for anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). In a cross-sectional study comprising 62 patients with APS, 66 women with RPL, 50 healthy blood donors and 24 women with a history of successful pregnancies, we tested IgM and IgG antibodies to phosphatidic acid, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl inositol and phosphatidyl serine with and without beta-2 glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) from a single manufacturer as well as aCL and abeta2GPI antibodies. Diagnostic accuracies of individual and combined anti-phospholipid (aPL) assays were assessed by computing sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values and negative predictive values together with their 95% confidence intervals. There was a general trend for increased sensitivities in the presence of beta2GPI co-factor with significant effect for certain specificities. The overall combined sensitivity of the non-recommended aPL assays was not significantly higher than that of the aCL and aB2GPI tests. Multiple aPL specificities in RPL group is not significantly different from controls and therefore of no clinical significance.

### Association of β-2-microglobulin and cardiovascular events and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4c279329]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) first discovered in 1964 is a 100-amino acid protein (11.8 kDa) encoded by a gene in chromosome 15 in humans. B2M is an important component of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule that is expressed on the surface of almost all nucleated cells. B2M is necessary for the cell surface expression and structural stability of the MHC-I molecule, which plays key roles in antigen presentation and processing, inflammation, the complement cascade, and stress response. B2M also complexes with many non-classical MHC-I like molecules such as CD1, MR1, HLA-E, –F, -G and neonatal Fc receptor that are involved in mucosal immunity, tumour surveillance, immunoglobulin and albumin homeostasis. Moreover, B2M is constantly secreted into circulation from cell surfaces or intracellular release (0–3 mg/L concentration in plasma or serum) and is eliminated from blood predominantly by the kidneys under normal physiological conditions, and has particularly been studied as a biomarker of renal function.

In view of the high morbidity and mortality burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), there is great interest in discovering novel biomarkers that distinguish individuals at a higher risk of CVD. Circulating B2M may be a potential biomarker given the associations of elevated B2M with inflammatory responses and declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR), together with the involvement of inflammation and impaired GFR in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. Recent epidemiological studies have suggested higher B2M levels associated with higher CVD risk both in general populations studies, and in individuals with renal conditions. However, the association between B2M and CVD has not yet been systematically assessed.

To address the above uncertainties, we conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies to primarily quantify the observational association of B2M and CVD outcomes, both in general populations and in renal patients; and investigated the associations of B2M with non-cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the same cohorts.

### Mechanisms of anti-phospholipid antibody formation and action [^aba7c02a]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterised by the clinical features of recurrent thrombosis in the venous or arterial circulation and foetal losses in combination with circulating anti-phospholipid antibodies in the blood of the afflicted patients. Over the last 25 years numerous studies have established the correlation between the presence of antibodies against anionic phospholipids and thrombo-embolic manifestations but how these antibodies cause thrombosis is still unclear. Most scientists now accept the fact that only a subset of the antiphospholipid antibodies has clinical relevance. Not antibodies to anionic phospholipids but rather antibodies to β2-glycoprotein I are thought to be the major cause for the pathological manifestations. β2-Glycoprotein I is a plasma protein without a known function and persons lacking β2-Glycoprotein I are completely healthy. Our challenge is to understand why auto-antibodies against such a dispensable protein are so common and how antibodies directed against a protein without obvious function can induce the severe clinical manifestations observed in this syndrome.

### Beta2-glycoprotein I-dependent lupus anticoagulant highly correlates with thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome [^953dcd46]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in plasma of patients with thromboembolic complications. A major problem in defining the syndrome is that serologic assays to detect antiphospholipid antibodies have a low specificity. We recently published a method that specifically detects lupus anticoagulant (LAC) caused by anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies. Here, we studied the clinical relevance of detecting beta(2)-glycoprotein I-dependent LAC. Plasma samples were collected from 198 patients with autoimmune diseases. In those samples with a positive partial thromboplastin time-lupus anticoagulant (PTT-LA), a modified activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based LAC test was performed with cardiolipin as confirming agent. Twenty-five of 58 patients with an aPTT-based LAC were dependent on the presence of anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies. Presence of beta(2)-glycoprotein I-dependent LAC was almost completely associated with a history of thromboembolic complications (odds ratio, 42.3; 95% confidence interval, 194.3–9.9). An increased frequency of thrombosis was not found in 33 patients with LAC independent of anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.9–0.8). The use of an LAC assay with cardiolipin as confirming agent strongly improves the detection of patients at risk of thrombosis. Our findings suggest that anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies with LAC activity are antibodies that are responsible for the thromboembolic complications in the antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Guidelines on the investigation and management of antiphospholipid syndrome [^8e92b4ec]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to initial laboratory testing, BSH 2012 guidelines recommend to obtain lupus anticoagulant testing and testing for IgG antibodies to β-2-glycoprotein I (either IgG anticardiolipin ELISA or an IgG anti-β-2-glycoprotein I ELISA). An anticardiolipin ELISA may detect antibodies to other phospholipid binding proteins as well as anti-β-2-glycoprotein I.

### Antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis: do test patterns identify the patients' risk? [^308b100f]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

We retrospectively analyzed the antiphospholipid profile of 103 lupus anticoagulant-positive patients to investigate whether laboratory patterns emerged for their association with arterial and venous thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome. Anticardiolipin, anti- < beta > 2-glycoprotein I and antiprothrombin antibodies were combined with coagulation tests in different patterns, which included from 2 to 5 laboratory variables. Overall, 22 out of 180 available associations reached significance: 14 with any type of thrombosis and eight with venous thrombosis. In all but two cases, anticardiolipin antibodies > 40 units were present in the laboratory patterns that reached significance. Anti- < beta > 2-glycoprotein I antibodies were present in 11 significant patterns, and antiprothrombin antibodies in seven cases. Increasing the number of variables of the laboratory patterns did not increase the odds ratio (OR) towards thrombosis. In conclusion, this analysis confirmed that the presence of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies at medium to high titres, either alone or in various combinations with other tests, is clinically useful to establish the patients' risk of thrombosis. The role of the other antiphospholipid antibodies is less clear.

### Beta2-glycoprotein I and annexin A5 phospholipid interactions: artificial and cell membranes [^2dafd178]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this report was an overview of beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI)- and annexin A5 (AnxA5)-phospholipid interactions including candidate beta2-GPI receptors, and their relevance to the investigation of physiological/pathological processes. Both beta2-GPI and AnxA5 have thrombomodulatory functions in vivo and their antigenicity is particularly important for thrombotic manifestations and pregnancy complications in antiphospholipid syndrome. Specific elements of beta2-GPI- and AnxA5-phospholipid interactions are different. The crucial elements for beta2-GPI are conformational change and dimerization, both of which are also required and necessary for receptor signaling, leading to the prothombotic state. AnxA5 differs in its ability to crystallize into a protective shield, the disruption of which seems to be the major prothrombotic mechanism. These differences may explain some of the functional consequences of both molecules seen in the pathological conditions. Future alternative therapies of antiphospholipid syndrome are proposed to be based on the expanding knowledge of beta2-GPI- and AnxA5-phospholipid interactions, specifically antagonizing beta2-GPI receptors, as well as inhibiting their signaling pathways.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome: a comprehensive review of a complex and multisystemic disease [^445f9d19]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired thombophilia, which is characterized by one or more thrombotic episodes and obstetric complications in the presence of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies (Abs). APL Abs are detected by laboratory tests such as lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-Beta2-glycoprotein I (Beta2GPI) Abs. This article reviews the most current aspects of APS with emphasis on the pathophysiology of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and current modalities of treatment.

### Pathogenic anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies recognize domain I of beta2-glycoprotein I only after a conformational change [^10dc953e]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Recently, we published the existence of 2 populations of anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) IgG antibodies. Type A antibodies recognize epitope G40-R43 in domain I of beta2-GPI and are strongly associated with thrombosis. Type B antibodies recognize other parts of beta2-GPI and are not associated with thrombosis. In this study we demonstrate that type A antibodies only recognize plasma-purified beta2-GPI when coated onto a negatively charged surface and not when coated onto a neutrally charged surface. The affinity of type B antibodies toward plasma-purified beta2-GPI was independent of the charge of the surface to which beta2-GPI was coated. Type A antibodies did not recognize plasma-purified beta2-GPI in solution, whereas they did recognize recombinant beta2-GPI both in solution and coated onto a neutrally charged plate. When the carbohydrate chains were removed from plasma-purified beta2-GPI, we found that type A antibodies did recognize the protein in solution. This supports the hypothesis that the difference in recognition of plasma-purified and recombinant beta2-GPI is caused by the difference in glycosylation and that epitope G40-R43 of plasma-purified beta2-GPI is covered by a carbohydrate chain. Type A anti-beta2-GPI antibodies can only recognize this epitope when this carbohydrate chain is displaced as a result of a conformational change. This finding has major implications both for the detection of pathogenic anti-beta2-GPI antibodies and the comprehension of the pathophysiology of the antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Clinical significance of antiphospholipid protein antibodies. receiver operating characteristics plot analysis [^12426127]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the utility of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in determining the strength of association between various antiphospholipid and anti-protein cofactor antibodies (aPA) and thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity, and thrombocytopenia.

Methods

Clinical and laboratory variables were retrospectively studied in 204 patients: 160 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 22 with lupus-like syndrome (SLE-LS), and 22 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Laboratory evaluation included detection of lupus anticoagulant (LAC) and measurement of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL), antiphosphatidylserine (aPS), antiphosphatidylinositol (aPI), anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (a beta 2GPI), and antiprothrombin (aPT) antibodies. ROC plot analysis was used to determine the clinical accuracy of aPA tests, and calculate cut-off values which best associate with clinical symptoms typical for APS.

Results

The LAC was associated with a history of thrombosis [odds ratio (OR): 3.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5–6.2] and even more strongly with recurrent fetal loss (OR: 8.7; 95%CI: 2.8–26.7). ROC plot analysis revealed that the most accurate test for thrombosis was aCL IgG (ROC-derived cutoff value > 17.2 GPL; OR: 3.69; 95% CI: 1.8–7.4), for recurrent fetal loss, aPI IgG [> 22.1 theoretical units (TU); OR: 6.21; 95%CI: 2.1–18.5], closely followed by aCL IgG and a beta 2GPI IgG, and for thrombocytopenia aPS IgM (> 6.7 TU; OR: 1.9; 95%CI: 1.04–3.4). Among 182 autoimmune patients (SLE + SLE-LS), 6.6% presented clinical symptoms of APS without classic aPA (LAC and/or aCL), but with elevated levels of antibodies against other phospholipids, mainly aPI IgM.

Conclusion

A laboratory that evaluates APS patients should establish its own threshold values for aPA tests. We suggest that ROC plot analysis is a valuable tool in establishing cutoff values. LAC and aCL determinations seem sufficient for the majority of laboratories. However, in specialized centers other tests should be available to detect those patients with clinical symptoms for APS but who are positive for antiphospholipid antibodies other than aCL and the LAC.

### Contribution of β-2 microglobulin levels to the prognostic stratification of survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [^068cd365]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Prospective analysis of the importance of the plasma levels of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) in 553 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) found that B2M is an independent prognostic variable for survival with weighted significance second only to the karyotype. The incorporation of the B2M covariate into risk assessment of MDS patients added significantly to the power of the IPSS to stratify MDS patients into risk categories. Our results further document that the 2 objectively measured covariates that display the highest power to predict survival, that is, karyotype and B2M, can alone be used for risk stratification. While the results must be verified in an independent and comparable population, our data strongly recommend routine measurement of B2M in patients with MDS.

### IgA anti-β ₂ glycoprotein I antibodies: experience from a large center [^6489e7e7]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

IgG and IgM antibodies directed at β2-glycoprotein I are included in the classification criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) while the IgA antibodies against β2-glycoprotein I (IgA aβ2GPI) are not. Conflicting data about the significance of IgA aβ2GPI and APS manifestation can be found and more studies are necessary in order to define the diagnostic value of IgA aβ2GPI. In the present article, we investigated the possible role of IgA aβ2GPI as marker of APS.

Methods

A cohort of 314 patients with APS and systemic autoimmune disease was investigated for the presence of IgA aβ2GPI and its association with clinical manifestation of APS.

Results

Eighty-nine patients presented IgA aβ2GPI, 68 cases associated with others antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and in 21 cases being the only aPL present. In primary APS IgA aβ2GPI are highly coincidental with other aPL (92,2%) while most of the isolated IgA aβ2GPI were present in the SLE group (16/21). No association between IgA aβ2GPI and APS manifestations: thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity was found, while a positive association between IgA aβ2GPI and the presence of anti-nDNA, anti-RNP, anti-Sm, anti-SSA, anti-SSB antibodies was encountered.

Conclusion

Our study does not show association between IgA aβ2GPI and APS manifestations and does not support the inclusion of IgA aβ2GPI as a classification criteria for APS.

### Pathogenesis of the antiphospholipid syndrome revisited: time to challenge the dogma [^c6df1aa2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

For more than a decade the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) has been reported to be caused mainly by antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), which are not directed against phospholipids but against a complex of phospholipids and phospholipid binding proteins, so called cofactors (e.g. β2-glycoprotein I [β2GPI]). In fact, many researchers propose that the only relevant antigens in the APS are the cofactors themselves, with β2GPI being the most important. Antibodies that bind to phospholipids in a cofactor-independent manner are considered insignificant for the pathogenesis of the APS. We review the evidence for this current pathophysiologic concept and argue that it has never been proven and is now clearly no longer tenable. First, there is undisputable evidence that cofactor-independent aPL are pathogenic and present in the blood of APS patients. Second, available epidemiologic and clinical studies do not support a dominant pathogenic role for anti-β2GPI.

### An international multicentre-laboratory evaluation of a new assay to detect specifically lupus anticoagulants dependent on the presence of anti-beta2-glycoprotein autoantibodies [^94a2ba86]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is diagnosed by the simultaneous presence of vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity and detection of antiphospholipid antibodies in plasma.

Objectives

We have shown that prolongation of clotting time by anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) antibodies correlates better with thrombosis than a positive classic lupus anticoagulant (LAC) assay in a single center study. To confirm or falsify this finding we have conducted a multicenter study.

Methods and Results

In 325 LAC-positive samples, we found that the beta2GPI-dependent LAC correlated 2.0 times better with thrombosis than the classic LAC assay. Although significant, this was a minimal improvement compared with the 'classic' LAC. It was published that calcium influences the behavior of anti-beta2GPI antibodies in coagulation assays. To investigate whether calcium plays a role in the present study, we divided the patient population into two groups: (i) blood was collected in 0.109 m sodium citrate and (ii) blood was drawn in 0.129 m sodium citrate as anticoagulant. We found that a positive result with the beta2GPI-dependent LAC assay correlated better with thrombosis [odds ratio (OR): 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9–5.8] when 0.109 m sodium citrate was used compared with 0.129 m sodium citrate (OR: 0.4, 95% CI 0.1–1.1).

Conclusion

We were able to confirm in an international multicenter study that a positive result in a beta2GPI-dependent LAC assay correlates better with thrombosis than the classic LAC assay, but that the assay needs further study as it is sensitive to external factors such as the sodium citrate concentration used as anticoagulant in the test sample.

### Beta2-glycoprotein I inhibits von Willebrand factor dependent platelet adhesion and aggregation [^c1b420a4]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome are characterized by the association of thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity and the presence of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. Particularly, anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein (beta(2) GPI) autoantibodies correlate with thrombosis, suggesting an antibody-induced gain of prothrombotic function and/or an antibody-induced loss of antithrombotic function of beta(2) GPI. In the search for potential antithrombotic properties of beta(2) GPI, we found that beta(2) GPI inhibits von Willebrand factor (VWF)-induced platelet aggregation. In addition, platelet adhesion to a VWF-coated surface was decreased by 50% in the presence of beta(2) GPI (P < .03). beta(2) GPI binds to the A1 domain of VWF but preferably when the A1 domain is in its active glycoprotein Ibalpha-binding conformation. Anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies isolated from a subset of antiphospholipid syndrome patients neutralized the beta(2) GPI-VWF interactions and thus the inhibitory activity of beta(2) GPI. In comparison to healthy individuals, the amounts of active VWF in circulation were increased 1.5-fold (P < .001) in patients positive for lupus anticoagulant (LAC) due to anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies. Thus, beta(2) GPI is a biologically relevant inhibitor of VWF function by interfering with VWF-dependent platelet adhesion. Anti-beta(2) GPI autoantibodies neutralize this inhibitory function and are associated with increased levels of active VWF. This mode of action could contribute to the thrombosis and consumptive thrombocytopenia observed in patients with anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies.

### High avidity anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^c97649e9]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate avidity of IgG anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI) in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in relation to thrombosis, and to demonstrate a possible affinity maturation of IgG anti-beta 2-GPI during the disease course.

Methods

64 sera from 32 patients (18 with primary or secondary APS, 14 with SLE without APS) and their respective IgG fractions or affinity purified anti-beta 2-GPI were studied by anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta 2-GPI enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and by chaotropic assay.

Results

Six, 12, and 14 patients had high, low, and heterogeneous avidity IgG anti-beta 2-GPI, respectively. In 12 patients an increase in antibody avidity was observed over a period of between four and 12 years. More patients with APS were in the high avidity than in the low avidity anti-beta 2-GPI group, while the opposite was observed for SLE alone (both p < 0.05). The most common clinical feature among patients with high avidity anti-beta 2-GPI was thrombosis, mainly venous thrombosis (p < 0.05 and p < 0.02, respectively, v the low avidity anti-beta 2-GPI group).

Conclusions

Patients with APS with or without SLE may have anti-beta2-GPI of high, low, or heterogeneous avidity. High avidity anti-beta 2-GPI appear to be associated with thrombosis and APS, while in pure SLE low avidity anti-beta 2-GPI may prevail. Monitoring of avidity may help elucidate the role of anti-beta 2-GPI affinity maturation in the pathogenesis of APS.

### Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I: prevalence, clinical correlations, and importance of persistent positivity in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [^d29a02f1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Antibodies to beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2-GPI) are found in a large percentage of patients with primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Our aim was to identify the prevalence and clinical correlation of these antibodies in patients with APS and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in comparison to anticardiolipin (aCL) and the lupus anticoagulant (LAC). We investigated whether serial samples improve clinical utility.

Methods

Serum samples for anti-beta2-GPI (IgG, IgM, IgA), aCL (IgG, IgM, IgA), and LAC (by dilute Russell viper venom time; RVVT) were collected from 418 consecutive patients with SLE or APS between October 2002 and March 2003. Clinical and serologic data of these patients were analyzed.

Results

A total of 185 (44.5%) patients were positive for anti-beta2-GPI, 55.3% were positive for aCL, and 31.1% for LAC. Anti-beta2-GPI was more common in Caucasians than in African Americans (p = 0.098). IgM and IgA were the most frequent isotypes of anti-beta2-GPI. aCL and anti-beta2-GPI were highly associated (p < 0.0001 to p = 0.0177, depending on isotype). A positive association was found between the presence of the LAC by dilute RVVT and anti-beta2-GPI IgG (p < 0.0001), IgM (p < 0.0001), and IgA (p = 0.0002) antibodies. Persistent positivity increased the association of venous and arterial thrombosis with anti-beta2-GPI (IgG and IgM isotypes). Pregnancy loss, seizures, and migraines were not associated with anti-beta2-GPI. IgA anti-beta2-GPI was not significantly associated with any manifestation of APS.

Conclusion

The prevalence of anti-beta2-GPI IgM and IgA was very high in our population. Measurement of anti-beta2-GPI IgG is clinically useful in identifying patients with SLE at higher risk for venous and arterial thrombosis. Persistent positivity increased the association of IgG anti-beta2-GPI with venous thrombosis and anti-beta2-GPI IgM with arterial thrombosis. IgA anti-beta2-GPI was not significantly associated with APS manifestations.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy: a comprehensive literature review [^cffc9ef9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic criteria

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), along with the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) outlines specific diagnostic criteria for Antiphospholipid Syndrome. The diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is based on a combination of clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, with classification criteria serving as standardized tools for research and clinical stratification. Historically, the Sapporo criteria (1999) and their 2006 revision in Sydney provided the framework for APS classification. However, the 2023 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria have introduced a more refined, weighted approach to APS, enhancing risk stratification and improving clinical applicability. To accurately diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome, both clinical and serological criteria are essential, requiring the presence of at least one clinical and one laboratory feature.

The 2023 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria refine APS classification using a weighted scoring model that integrates clinical and laboratory findings, enhancing specificity and patient care. A key advancement is the recognition of obstetric complications as critical APS indicators. Severe preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and late pregnancy loss are now explicitly included, distinguishing obstetric APS from its thrombotic counterpart. The updated classification places greater emphasis on pregnancy-related complications, particularly those linked to placental dysfunction. The recognition of placental dysfunction-related complications as APS-related manifestations underscores the necessity for individualized surveillance and targeted anticoagulation therapy in high-risk pregnancies.

While classification criteria are not equivalent to diagnostic criteria, their clinical utility is evident in guiding patient assessment and management. The integration of the 2023 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria into clinical decision-making enables a more standardized, evidence-based approach to APS diagnosis and risk assessment, ultimately enhancing maternal and fetal outcomes.

The criteria also reinforce the importance of confirming persistent antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) positivity through repeat testing at least 12 weeks apart. Lupus anticoagulant remains the most predictive marker, followed by anticardiolipin and anti-β2GPI antibodies, ensuring accurate classification. By offering a structured and evidence-based framework, the updated criteria enhance APS identification, support targeted treatment approaches, and advance research efforts while maintaining a clear distinction between classification and diagnosis.

Sciascia et al. emphasize that precise antiphospholipid antibody testing is essential in APS diagnosis and risk stratification. Key assays include lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I antibodies, which together provide a comprehensive aPL profile. Advances like thrombin generation assays (TGAs) have refined risk assessment by capturing both procoagulant and anticoagulant dynamics.

### The association between circulating antibodies against domain I of beta2-glycoprotein I and thrombosis: an international multicenter study [^384a0088]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is difficult as a result of limited specificity of existing assays for detecting clinically relevant antiphospholipid antibodies. Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) antibodies play a central role in the disease process of APS.

Objectives

We have investigated the relation between antiphospholipid antibodies with specificity for domain I of beta 2GPI and thrombosis/pregnancy morbidity in an international multicenter study.

Patients/Methods

Four hundred and seventy-seven patients derived from nine different centres met the inclusion criterion of having anti-beta 2GPI antibodies in their plasma/serum. Clinical data and results of tests for lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibodies and anti-beta 2GPI antibodies were established at the different centres of inclusion. After being re-tested for the presence of IgG and/or IgM anti-beta 2GPI antibodies, the samples were tested for the presence of IgG-directed against domain I of beta 2GPI and results were correlated with the thrombotic and obstetric history.

Results

Re-testing for the presence of anti-beta 2GPI antibodies resulted in inclusion of 442/477 patients. IgG class anti-domain I antibodies were present in plasma of 243/442 patients (55%). 201/243 (83%) had a history of thrombosis. This resulted in an odds ratio of 3.5 (2.3–5.4, 95% confidence interval) for thrombosis. Anti-domain I IgG antibodies were also significantly correlated with obstetric complications [odds ratio: 2.4 (1.4–4.3, 95% confidence interval)].

Conclusion

In this multicenter study, the detection of IgG antibodies that are directed against domain I of beta 2GPI proved to be more strongly associated with thrombosis and obstetric complications than those detected using the standard anti-beta 2GPI antibody assay.

### Anti-β-glycoprotein I autoantibodies influence thrombin generation parameters via various mechanisms [^30e9685e]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterised by recurrent thrombotic events, pregnancy loss and thrombocytopenia and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APL). The exact pathomechanism of APS is still unknown, thus we investigated the effect of anti-β 2 -glycoprotein I (anti-β 2 GPI) on thrombin generation in different plasma samples.

Methods

For the separation of anti-β 2 GPI IgG, overall 12 APS patients were selected. The criteria were the existence of lupus anticoagulant, and the presence of anti-CL and anti-β 2 GPI, the latter exceeding at least 25 times the upper reference limit. We purified anti-β 2 GPI IgG antibodies from APS patients by affinity chromatography and added the antibodies to normal pooled, and heterozygous forms of inherited thrombophilia plasma samples (prothrombin G20210A, factor V Leiden). To further specify the mechanism of the effect, we also used factor deficient plasmas in the thrombin generation assay.

Results

In normal pooled plasma, the anti-β 2 GPI significantly prolonged Lag Time according to the lupus anticoagulant effect, in contrast, it also elevated Peak Thrombin significantly, which suggests a procoagulant effect. The antibody was also able to exert this multi-faceted effect both in FV Leiden heterozygous plasma and prothrombin G20210A heterozygous polymorphism, however, the prolonging effect was more remarkable in the latter. By using factor deficient plasmas, it was found that FVII is required for the prolongation, while intrinsic factors are needed for the elevation of the Peak Thrombin.

Conclusion

The anti-β 2 GPI autoantibodies exert their effect in both normal and thrombophilic plasmas via various mechanisms.

### Antiphospholipid antibodies: evaluation of the thrombotic risk [^cdf5a96c]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) via antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) tests, including lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anti-cardiolipin (aCL), or anti-beta2 glycoprotein I (aβ2GPI) antibodies remains a challenge. Coagulation tests for LAC as well as solid phase assays for aCL and aβ2GPI have methodological shortcomings, although for LAC large progress have been made in standardization. All assays are associated with clinical APS-criteria (thrombotic and/or pregnancy complications) but with limited specificity. Besides, clinical studies demonstrating the association between the presence of aPL and thrombosis are not always well designed and result in wide ranges of odds ratio with large variation between studies. The best association between thrombotic complications and aPL is found for LAC. The association between thrombosis and aCL or aβ2GPI is at least inconsistent. The inclusion of more specific assays, such as the domain-I-β2GPI.antibodies is too premature and depends on further investigation in large clinical studies and the commercial availability. The search for new assays should proceed to identify patients with aPL with increased risk for thrombosis, preferable in large prospective studies. Meanwhile, with the current available LAC, aCL and aβ2GPI assays it is strongly recommended to make antibody profiles. Multiple positivity of tests seems clinically more relevant. The strengths and weaknesses of the current laboratory criteria for APS are discussed in view of their role in risk stratification of patients with thrombotic events.

### Seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome: refining the value of "non-criteria" antibodies for diagnosis and clinical management [^798a29ce]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial and venous thrombotic manifestations and/or pregnancy-related complications in patients with persistently high antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), the most common being represented by anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti-beta 2 glycoprotein-I (aβ2GPI), and lupus anticoagulant (LAC). A growing number of studies have showed that, in some cases, patients may present with clinical features of APS but with temporary positive or persistently negative titers of aPL. For these patients, the definition of seronegative APS (SN-APS) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the negativity to classic aPL criteria does not imply that other antibodies may be present or involved in the onset of thrombosis. The diagnosis of SN-APS is usually made by exclusion, but its recognition is important to adopt the most appropriate anti-thrombotic strategy to reduce the rate of recurrences. This research is in continuous development as the clinical relevance of these antibodies is far from being completely clarified. The most studied antibodies are those against phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, vimentin/cardiolipin complex, and annexin A5. Moreover, the assays to measure the levels of these antibodies have not yet been standardized. In this review, we will summarize the evidence on the most studied non-criteria aPL, their potential clinical relevance, and the antithrombotic therapeutic strategies available in the setting of APS and SN-APS.

### IgM anti-β ₂ glycoprotein I is protective against lupus nephritis and renal damage in systemic lupus erythematosus [^3495893d]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Antibodies to ß(2) glycoprotein I (IgG and IgM isotypes) have recently been added to the laboratory criteria of the revised antiphospholipid syndrome classification criteria. We investigated whether IgM anti-ß(2)-glycoprotein I (anti-ß(2)-GPI) is associated with clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

Anti-ß(2)-GPI was measured in 796 patients with SLE (93% women, 53% white, 38% African American, mean age 45 yrs). IgM anti-ß(2)-GPI (> 20 phospholipid units) was found in 16%. Associations were determined with clinical manifestations of SLE and with components of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index.

Results

As expected, IgM anti-ß(2)-GPI was highly associated with both the lupus anticoagulant and with anticardiolipin. It was associated with transient ischemic attack (OR 2.64, p = 0.04), but not significantly with venous or arterial thrombosis. IgM anti-ß(2)-GPI was protective against lupus nephritis (OR 0.54, p = 0.049), renal damage (p = 0.019), and hypertension (OR 0.58, p = 0.008). This protective effect remained after adjustment for ethnicity.

Conclusion

In SLE, IgM anti-ß(2)-GPI is not associated with thrombosis but is protective against lupus nephritis and renal damage. "Natural" autoantibodies of the IgM isotype may have a protective effect.

### Prevalence of antibodies to beta2-glycoprotein I in systemic lupus erythematosus and their association with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome criteria: a single center study and literature review [^d9fb2a1f]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to assess their association with and predictive value for the clinical classification criteria of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS).

Methods

One hundred thirty-three consecutive patients with SLE were recruited from 2 lupus clinics in the University of Toronto. Serum and plasma samples were tested for IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), a panel of lupus anticoagulant (LAC) assays, and anti-beta2-GPI (IgG, IgM, IgA). Normal ranges for the assays were established using 129 healthy controls. A literature review from 1992 to 2000 was performed using beta2-GPI, SLE, APS, thrombosis, and recurrent pregnancy loss as key search words.

Results

The distribution of anti-beta2-GPI antibodies (of any isotype) in each group were as follows: all patients with SLE, 36.8%; SLE with clinical features of APS, 40.4%; SLE without clinical features of APS, 34.9%; and healthy controls, 3%. The positive predictive values of prolonged PTT, IgG aCL, and anti-beta2-GPI for at least one clinical feature of APS in SLE were 59.3, 50.0, and 38.8%, respectively. There were 27 patients with SLE who had antibodies to beta2-GPI but a normal PTT and negative aCL and LAC. Six (20.7%) of these had a history of thrombosis and/or recurrent pregnancy loss. Twelve studies (including ours) were identified in which patient groups were similar and the same antibody isotype was measured. No agreement was apparent after reviewing the literature regarding an association of anti-beta2-GPI IgG and clinical features of APS in patients with SLE.

Conclusion

Antibodies to beta2-GPI were frequently seen (35%) in our SLE population. The prevalence of anti-beta2-GPI was similar in those with (19/47) and without (39/86) APS. Anti-beta2-GPI did, however, identify 6 patients with clinical features of APS who were negative for aCL and prolonged PTT. Our results indicate that anti-beta2-GPI may provide additional information for the diagnosis of APS in SLE, but do not supercede other established assays. However, when we attempted to place our results in the context of other reports, the literature review revealed that secondary diagnoses of patient groups and assay techniques are too variable among different investigators to allow useful comparison. Thus, no conclusions could be drawn regarding anti-beta3-GPI and clinical features of secondary APS in SLE.

### Patient-derived anti-β ₂ GP1 antibodies recognize a peptide motif pattern and not a specific sequence of residues [^e1baf77e]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of so-called antiphospholipid antibodies and clinical manifestations such as recurrent thromboembolic or pregnancy complications. Although the main antigenic determinant for antiphospholipid antibodies has been identified as the β-2-glycoprotein 1 (β2GP1), the precise epitope recognized by antiphospholipid antibodies still remains largely unknown. In the study herein, we wanted to identify a sequence in domain I of β2GP1 able to induce the proliferation of CD4 + T cells isolated from antiphospholipid antibody syndrome patients, but not from healthy donors, and to interact with antiphospholipid antibodies. We have characterized a sequence in domain I of β2GP1 that triggers CD4 + T-cell proliferation. A comparison of this sequence with the previously reported binding of antiphospholipid antibodies to discontinuous epitope R39-R43 reveals the presence of an indeterminate motif in β2GP1, in which the polarity determines the characteristics and specificity of antiphospholipid antibodies-interacting motifs. Using point mutations, we characterized the main antiphospholipid antibodies-interacting motif as ϕϕϕζζFxC, but also established ϕϕϕζζFxϕ-related motifs as potential antiphospholipid antibodies epitopes, in which ϕ represents nonpolar residues and ζ polar residues, with charges of the residues not being involved. Of specific importance, these different motifs are present at least once in all antiphospholipid antibodies-related receptors described so far. We have further demonstrated, in vitro, that peptides and domains of β2GP1 containing these motifs were able to interact with antiphospholipid antibodies and inhibit their monocyte activating activity. These results established that the antiphospholipid antibodies-interacting motifs are determined by the polarity, but not by the sequence or charge, of amino acids. These data could also contribute to the future development of more sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome determination and potential peptide- or β2GP1 domain-based clinical therapies.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, BSR 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain antiphospholipid antibodies at baseline in all patients with SLE, especially in patients with an adverse pregnancy history or arterial/venous thrombotic events. Confirm antiphospholipid syndrome with a positive result of lupus anticoagulant, ACL (IgG, IgM) and/or anti-β-2 glycoprotein-1 (IgG, IgM) on two occasions at least 12 weeks apart.

Laboratory tests

Although standardised testing for lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies remains a concern, both influencing research and clinical diagnosis, clear recommendations on best practices for immunoassays for the measurement of aPL (by the three tests) and on the most important requirements for technical and performance characteristics have been published. Today, the complete antibody profile is required for diagnosis and classification of patients with APS, and most importantly for the risk assessment of both pregnancy morbidity and thrombosis. In fact, patients with the so-called 'triple antibody positivity', those with LAC test positivity or those with high IgG aCL/anti-beta2GPI titres are considered at higher risk. The clinical value of IgM aCL/anti-beta2GPI antibodies needs further studies. However, evidence that so-called 'non-criteria' aPL tests may contribute to the diagnosis and risk stratification in APS is building up. For instance, antibodies directed against domain 1 of beta2GPI were shown to correlate with triple positivity and correlate with higher titres of aPL. Furthermore, testing of 'non-criteria' antibodies such as antiphosphatidylserine and antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin complex may be helpful in patients with clinical symptoms comparable with APS, but without positive classical antibodies, so-called seronegative APS. Including these non-criteria antibodies may result in a better identification of patients with APS. However, the clinical value of these antibodies remains to be proven.

Primary prophylaxis

Patients with positive aPL, but without clinical symptoms/events compatible with APS, presumably have a higher thrombotic risk profile, in particular patients who tested triple positive or have persistently high titres of aPL. How to prevent thrombotic events in this group of patients is still being debated. It is not clear if low-dose aspirin may or may not influence thrombotic risk, and the use of hydroxychloroquine for this purpose showed conflicting results. How to identify who to treat, and consequently how to treat, are still unanswered questions.

### Association of IgA anti-beta2 glycoprotein I with clinical and laboratory manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus [^a72167ab]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

IgA isotypes of anticardiolipin and anti-ß(2) glycoprotein I (anti-ß(2)-GPI) are omitted from the revised antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) classification criteria. Multiple studies have found a high prevalence of IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We determined the frequency and associations of IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI in a cohort of patients with SLE.

Methods

anti-ß(2)-GPI was measured in 796 patients with SLE (93% women, 53% white, 38% African American, mean age 45 yrs). IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI (> 20 phospholipid units) was found in 20%. Using a cohort database, associations with cumulative thrombotic and other manifestations were determined.

Results

of patients with SLE who demonstrated IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI positivity, about 6% had transient ischemic attack (p = 0.070), 4% had superficial thrombophlebitis (p = 0.647), 20% had deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.003), 4% had other venous thrombosis (p = 0.827), 12% had stroke (p = 0.050), and 1% had myocardial infarction (p = 0.397).

Conclusion

IgG anti-ß(2)-GPI has the strongest association with thrombosis in SLE. However, IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI was more strongly associated with deep venous thrombosis and with stroke than was IgM. These results indicate that assessment of IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI is associated with thrombosis in SLE, and that the classification criteria for APS should be revised to include IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI in patients with SLE.

### Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic COVID-19 is persistent and critical for survival [^af433d00]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be fatal in a significant proportion of hospitalized Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) patients despite the development of an anti-viral antibody response. Studies in large cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals indicate that antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein appear within the first three weeks from symptoms onset and that IgG and/or IgA seroconversion occurs either sequentially or simultaneously with the appearance of IgM. Using a newly developed Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) assay, we previously detected anti-RBD IgG in 95% of COVID-19 patients by the fourth week from symptom onset and observed that these antibodies increased throughout follow-up until the third month post-hospital discharge. Moreover, the early presence of anti-RBD IgG and anti-spike IgA positively correlated with patient survival and reduced persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in naso-pharyngeal swabs, respectively.

The spike glycoprotein mediates entry into target cells via the ACE2 receptor and clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against its RBD decreased viral load in patients with recently diagnosed mild/moderate COVID-19 –. Furthermore, anti-spike neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) produced by COVID-19 patients can block viral infection of human cells in vitro and counter viral replication in vivo. However, the impact of nAbs on COVID-19 course is still controversial with some studies even suggesting either a detrimental role for nAbs in disease progression, or finding no nAbs differences among hospitalized patients who subsequently experienced varying disease outcomes.

In addition, studies dealing with infections carried out by MERS and SARS-CoV beta coronaviruses, two viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, suggest that the anti-viral humoral immunity, sometimes still detectable more than a year after hospitalization, wanes over time. Whether SARS-CoV-2 nAbs decline at a similar pace is yet to be conclusively established. In light of the current timing of the pandemic, most published serological studies are predominantly cross-sectional or at most include a longitudinal follow-up of few months.

### Diagnosis and management of the antiphospholipid syndrome [^a1dcce60]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on antiphospholipid syndrome:

- **Definition**: APS is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by thrombotic or obstetrical events in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.
- **Pathophysiology**: APS is caused by autoantibodies targeting phospholipid-bound proteins, mainly β-2-glycoprotein I.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the general population is estimated at 1–5%. In the US, the estimated incidence and prevalence of APS are 5 cases per 100,000 person-years and 40–50 persons per 100,000 populations, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The interaction of antiphopholipid autoantibodies with phospholipid-binding plasma proteins (β-2-glycoprotein I, prothrombin, thrombomodulin, kininogens, antithrombin III, annexins, protein C, and protein S) results in activation of monocytes, endothelial cells, platelets, and the complement system, inducing a prothrombotic state that leads to inflammation, vasculopathy, venous/arterial thrombosis, and obstetric complications.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: APS is associated with morbidity related to stroke (13%), myocardial infarction (11%), DVT (9.5%), and pregnancy (6%).

### Anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I and antiphosphatidylserine antibodies are predictors of arterial thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^63f13e16]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

The predictive value (PV) and association of 4 antiphospholipid antibodies with clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were evaluated in 90 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 100 with APS. Patients with APS were classified into arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, and pregnancy morbidity subgroups. IgG, IgM, and IgA anticardiolipin (aCL), antiphosphatidylserine (aPS), anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I (anti-B2GPI), and antiprothrombin (aPT) antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Individually, anti-B2GPI and aPS antibodies had the strongest PV for APS (86.4%-94.1%; P < .001) in patients with SLE. The PV for APS reached 100% when 2 or more antibodies were present. Similarly, anti-B2GPI and aPS antibodies had a stronger PV and association for arterial thrombosis (87%-95%; P < .001) compared with venous thrombosis (80%-92%; P = 0.01). Weak PV and association with pregnancy morbidity were seen with all antibodies. These results suggest an important pathogenic role of anti-B2GPI antibodies in arterial thrombosis. In addition, anti-B2GPI and aPS antibodies seem to provide the best diagnostic value for the laboratory assessment of APS.

IgA antibody isotype anti-β 2 glycoprotein-I and anticardiolipin antibodies

There is a growing body of evidence to suggest a potential usefulness of IgA in the context of APS. Very recent evidence suggested that, while IgG/M isotypes recognize an epitope in domain 1, the epitopes recognized by IgA are the domains 3, 4 and 5. However, as reported by the 13 th International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies, testing for IgA-aβ2GPI should be considered only in patients negative for IgG and IgM isotypes with APS symptoms.

Studies investigating the prevalence of IgA aPL reported a variable prevalence ranging from 14% to 72% according to different reports; however, these studies have a retrospective design, used different assays to measure IgA aPL, and used different cut-off values to define aPL positivi-ty.

A large study including 5,892 patients (803 with SLE and 5,089 from the Antiphospholipid Standardization Laboratory sent for evaluation for APS) found that IgA aβ2GPI isotype was positive in 255 (4.3%) patients, in 198 cases in association with other aPL, while only aPL was detectable in 57. Isolated IgA aβ2GPI positivity was associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis (P < 0.001), venous thrombosis (P = 0.015), and all thrombosis (P < 0.001).

A second study evaluated, in addition to IgM and IgG, the positivity and predictivity of IgA aCL and IgA aβ2GPI in 430 patients: 111 with APS, 119 with SLE, and 200 healthy controls. Positivity for IgA aCL was 38%; IgA aβ2GPI was 46% in patients with APS. All three antibody isotypes (IgM, IgG and IgA) were significantly associated with a diagnosis of APS, with high specificity but not good sensitivity, based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Looking at likely hazard ratios, the IgA aβ2GPI (HR 33.9, 95%CI: 10.5–109.5) was similarly associated to APS as compared to IgG aβ2GPI (HR 33.4, 95%CI: 13.0–86.1), but showed a higher association compared to IgM aβ2GPI (HR 9.2, 95%CI: 4.6–18.4) and was associated with thrombotic but not obstetric complications in patients with APS.

### Anti-beta (2)-glycoprotein-I and anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies in women with spontaneous pregnancy loss [^594a4bf6]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-I (anti-beta(2)GPI-ab) and anti-phosphatidylserine (aPS-ab) antibodies as a risk factor in both recurrent miscarriage (RM) and unexplained fetal losses (UFL).

Design

Retrospective, cohort study.

Setting

Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.

Patient(S)

122 pregnant women divided in two groups: study group of 54 women with RM and/or UFL and control group of 68 pregnant without RM history.

Intervention(S)

Analysis of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta(2)GP1 and aPS antibodies.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Comparison of aPL antibody between groups.

Result(S)

The prevalence of aPL positive results was 8 out of 54 (14.8%) in the study group and 3 out of 68 (4.41%) in the controls. In the RM subgroup, the prevalence was 3 out of 25 (12%) versus 3 out of 68 (4.4%), and 7 out of 34 (20.6%) versus 3 out of 68 (4.4%) in UFL subgroup. As a whole, the prevalence of anti-beta(2)GP1-ab in the RM/UFL group showed a difference compared with controls but not aPS-ab. In the RM women, anti-beta(2)GP1-ab was positive in 3 out of 25 (12%) versus 1 out of 68 (1.5%) in controls and in 4 out of 34 versus 0 out of 68 cases in women with UFL. In the RM subgroup, aPS-ab was positive in 1 out of 25 (4%) versus 2 out of 68 (2.9%) in control group and in 3 out of 34 versus 2 out of 68 cases in women with UFL.

Conclusion(S)

Our results suggest that anti-beta(2)GP1-ab but not aPS-ab is related to RM/UFL and should be considered as a pregnancy-loss risk factor.

### Genetic risk factors of thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome [^91680ae3]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The possibility of a genetic predisposition to develop antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and to produce anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant has been addressed by family studies and population studies. Various studies suggest a familial occurrence of anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant, with or without clinical evidence of APS. This familial tendency could be genetically determined. Multiple human leucocyte antigen-DR or -DQ associations with antiphospholipid antibodies have been described. Genetic studies of a representative antigen, beta2-glycoprotein-I (beta(2)GPI), have been carried-out and a particular valine(247)/leucine polymorphism could be a genetic risk for presenting anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies and APS. Many other thrombosis-related genetic factors have been investigated in APS, but no additional risk for thrombosis has been indicated in affected patients. Although the mechanisms and pathophysiology of thrombosis in APS are highly heterogeneous and multifactorial, different genes and acquired factors seem to be involved. In this review, we will focus on those genetic variants that could contribute to the development of thrombosis in APS.

Forastiero and colleaguesstudied 194 patients who were persistently positive for LA or aCL and reported that the presence of IgG anti-B2GPI was independently associated with increased risk of arterial or venous thrombosis, with a multivariate hazard ratio of 2.97.

### Disruption of the beta2-integrin CD11d (alphaDbeta2) gene fails to protect against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [^55912ae8]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2007). Low credibility.

The fourth member of the beta(2)-integrin family of adhesion molecules, CD11d (alpha(D)beta(2)), is expressed on a wide variety of immune cells, however its function in autoimmune diseases, including EAE remains unknown. We induced EAE in wild-type and CD11d(-/-) C57BL/6 mice using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35–55)) peptide. The clinical course and histopathology of EAE were identical in both groups of mice throughout the disease course. There were no significant differences in the infiltration of leukocyte subsets into the central nervous system or in the production of cytokines from T cells isolated from the spleen or spinal cord from both groups of mice. Our data demonstrate that CD11d is not required for the development of EAE and, to date, is the only beta(2)-integrin molecule whose deletion does not result in attenuated disease.

### Lupus anticoagulant and antiprothrombin antibodies: embracing the future [^f804df12]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) is a well-known laboratory test used to explore potential reasons for the prolongation of phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests. An extended clotting time in a coagulation test typically suggests a bleeding tendency, as the plasma takes longer to clot. However, a positive LAC result, defined as normalization of prolonged clotting time by adding anionic phospholipids in the system, does not necessarily imply this. In fact, quite the opposite is true: a positive LAC often strongly correlates with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Therefore, despite being conceptually counterintuitive, LAC remains extremely valuable in routine clinical practice for identifying individuals at risk for thromboembolic events. Over the years, various factors have been recognized as potential inducers of LAC, with antiphospholipid antibodies associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) playing a significant role. Today, research indicates that, among antiphospholipid antibodies, those targeting plasma proteins β 2 -glycoprotein I and prothrombin are central to LAC. This article offers a historical perspective on LAC, emphasizing recent developments in antiprothrombin antibodies, their connection to LAC, and novel detection methods. Our premise is that a deeper understanding of how antiprothrombin antibodies contribute to LAC and the identification of subpopulations of these antibodies potentially responsible for it in thrombotic APS patients could lead to transformative advancements, offering new strategies for risk stratification and personalized treatments for patients with APS and beyond.

### Clinical characterization of antiphospholipid syndrome by detection of IgG antibodies against β ₂-glycoprotein I domain 1 and domain 4 / 5: ratio of anti-domain 1 to anti-domain 4 / 5 as a useful new biomarker for antiphospholipid syndrome [^a01e3a8f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

It has been suggested that only antibodies against domain 1 (D1) of β2 -glycoprotein I (β2 GPI) are pathogenic and diagnostic. The role of antibodies against other β2 GPI domains is still debated. This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical relevance of domain specificity profiling of anti-β2 GPI IgG antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients and in control groups of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases and in asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) carriers.

Methods

We evaluated 159 subjects with persistently positive, medium or high-titer anti-β2 GPI IgG, including 56 patients with thrombotic (obstetric or nonobstetric) primary APS, 31 women with obstetric primary APS, 42 aPL-positive patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and 30 asymptomatic aPL carriers. One hundred healthy donors were included. Anti-β2 GPI D1 and D4/5 IgG were tested on research enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays containing recombinant β2 GPI domains.

Results

As compared to other groups, aPL carriers displayed higher frequency/titer of anti-D4/5 IgG. Unlike anti-D4/5, anti-D1 IgG antibodies were more frequent and at higher titer in triple than in single or double aPL-positive subjects. An anti-D1 to anti-D4/5 ratio of ≥ 1.5 was predictive of systemic autoimmunity (odds ratio 3.25 [95% confidence interval 1.45–7.49], P = 0.005). Neither anti-D1 nor anti-D4/5 antibodies were associated with APS clinical criteria.

Conclusion

Anti-D1 IgG is the preferential specificity not only in vascular and obstetric primary APS, but also in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease with no clinical features of APS. Conversely, aPL carriers do not have a polarized profile toward D1. Combined testing for anti-β2 GPI IgG with different domain specificity allows a more accurate aPL profiling, with polarization toward anti-D1 IgG as a possible fingerprint of systemic autoimmunity.

### A prospective study of antibodies to beta2-glycoprotein I and prothrombin, and risk of thrombosis [^5e6037a9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a clinical autoimmune disorder characterized by thrombosis/pregnancy morbidity associated with the persistence of lupus anticoagulant (LA) and/or anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies. We assessed the contribution of antibodies to beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI) and prothrombin (anti-PT) to the thrombotic risk in a cohort of 194 consecutive patients with persistent LA and/or aCL. Median follow-up was 45 months. A total of 39 patients (20.1%) had one documented episode of thrombosis during follow-up. Eleven of these patients had no previous thrombosis before enrollment in the study and 28 had recurrences of thrombosis. There were 21 venous and 18 arterial thrombotic events and the overall incidence of thrombosis was 5.6% per patient-year. After multivariate analysis, the male sex (P = 0.025), a previous thrombosis (P < 0.01), the presence of anti-beta2GPI (P = 0.001), and the presence of anti-PT (P = 0.03) remained as independent risk factors for recurrent thrombosis. Only IgG anti-beta2GPI and anti-PT were associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (P < 0.01 and P = 0.005). Patients testing positive for anti-beta2GPI had a higher rate of thrombosis than did antiphospholipid patients without anti-beta2GPI (8.0% vs. 3.1% per patient-year). Similarly, a higher rate of thrombosis was found in patients with positive anti-PT compared with patients without anti-PT (8.6% vs. 3.5% per patient-year). Considering only the group of 142 LA positive patients, the highest incidence of thrombosis was found in LA patients positive for both anti-beta2GPI and anti-PT (8.4% per patient-year). In conclusion, the presence of IgG anti-beta2GPI and anti-PT in patients with LA and/or aCL and mainly in those with LA predicts a higher risk of thromboembolic events.

### EULAR recommendations for the management of antiphospholipid syndrome in adults [^431bac2f]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, EULAR 2019 guidelines recommend to stratify patients with APS into high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk phenotypes:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|High-risk|- Multiple antiphospholipid antibodies < br > - Lupus anticoagulant or persistently high antiphospholipid antibody titers < br > - History of thrombotic and/or obstetric APS < br > - Coexistence of other systemic autoimmune diseases such as SLE < br > - And presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors|
|Medium-risk|- Anticardiolipin antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma present in titers > 40 IgG phospholipid units or > 40 IgM phospholipid units, or > the 99th percentile, measured by a standardised ELISA < br > - Anti-β-2-glycoprotein I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma in titer > the 99th percentile, measured by a standardised ELISA|
|Low-risk|- Isolated anticardiolipin antibody or anti-β-2-glycoprotein I antibodies at low-medium titers, particularly if transiently positive.|

### Domain and residue mapping of autoantibodies to β ₂ GPI reveals differences among antiphospholipid syndrome phenotypes [^5e9f9051]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Antiphospholipid antibodies targeting b2-glycoprotein I (b2GPI) are a hallmark of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. Among these, antibodies targeting Domain I (DI) are common in individuals at higher risk; however, their epitopes and prevalence among APS phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we employ a large collection of 29 structurally and functionally validated b2GPI variants to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of autoantibody recognition in APS. Using the prototypic human-derived monoclonal anti-DI antibody MBB2, we identified positively charged residue R39 as the key driver for MBB2 binding, followed by residues R43, N56, and T57. Structural analyses revealed that, while R39 is solvent-exposed, R43 is not, as it is caged by residues N56 and T57. The narrow epitope footprint explains why MBB2 exhibits a modest affinity for soluble b2GPI. The cage structure accounts for the epitope being conformational rather than linear. Mutational analyses of IgG anti-b2GPI antibodies from 52 triple-positive APS patients, 37 with a history of thrombosis and 15 non-vascular obstetric patients, confirmed significant reactivity against DI and showed signatures of two conformational epitopes: one similar to MBB2 (epitope I), in which the presence of R39 is essential, and another that does not require R39 (epitope II). While less frequent than epitope-II in our cohort, epitope-I reactivity was notably enriched in thrombotic obstetric patients. Varying epitope specificities for DI may therefore aid in identifying different APS phenotypes and predicting clinical outcomes.

### The presence of IgG antibodies against beta2-glycoprotein I predicts the risk of thrombosis in patients with the lupus anticoagulant [^db154568]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Lupus anticoagulant (LA) is a strong risk factor of thrombosis. However, a subgroup of patients positive for LA is unaffected by thrombosis and currently no predictive markers are available to identify patients positive for LA at increased risk for thrombosis.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate whether anti-beta-2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI) or anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis in patients persistently positive for LA.

Patients and Methods

A cohort of 87 consecutive patients persistently positive for LA was investigated, 55 with and 32 without a history of thrombosis. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) antibodies against beta2GPI and cardiolipin were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay.

Results

Patients positive for LA with thrombosis had significantly higher levels of anti-beta2GPI IgG (median 16.7 standard units, interquartile range 3.0–75.2, P = 0.002) and of ACA IgG (41.1 IgG phospholipid units per mL, 8.9–109.0, P = 0.002) than those without thrombosis (2.6, 1.4–7.9 and 9.7, 4.6–22.1, respectively). Levels of anti-beta2GPI IgM and ACA IgM did not differ significantly between LA patients with and without thrombosis (P = 0.25 and 0.12, respectively). Elevated anti-beta2GPI IgG was associated with an increased risk for thrombosis (OR = 4.0, 95% CI 1.2–13.1), especially for venous thromboembolism (OR = 5.2, 95% CI 1.5–18.0).

Conclusions

Increased levels of anti-beta2GPI IgG were associated with thrombosis. We conclude that anti-beta2GPI IgG levels above normal predict an increased risk of thrombosis in patients persistently positive for LA.

### Anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 and the anti-phospholipid syndrome [^34c9c39e]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a patient who presented with bilateral retinal vascular occlusion and the use of anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 (GPI) antibody testing in the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.

Design

Observational case report.

Methods

Hematological investigations were performed on a 49-year-old man who presented with rapid onset of bilateral severe central retinal vein occlusion.

Results

Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody testing was negative. Markedly raised titers of anti-beta2 GPI antibodies were detected on two separate occasions.

Conclusions

The raised titers of anti-beta2 GPI antibodies were considered to strongly suggest an underlying diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Antiphospholipid antibody positivity in early systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with subsequent vascular events [^efff1ae5]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

aPL are the key serological feature of the APS, which is characterized by vascular thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. aPL are found in 20–30% of patients with SLE but not all these patients develop vascular events (VE). The common clinical assays for aPL include anti-cardiolipin (anti-CL) and anti-β 2 -glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) ELISAs as well as the lupus anticoagulant test. In many lupus units, it is common for these aPL assays to be carried out routinely at the time of diagnosis in patients with SLE. This results in identification of patients who test positive without ever having suffered thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity. There is no consensus about how to manage this scenario as the long-term risk of VE for these patients is unclear.

The N-terminal domain (domain I or DI) of β2GPI is believed to contain the major epitope for pathological anti-β2GPI antibodies. Thus, IgG anti-DI have been suggested to be a more specific marker of thrombosis, which would add predictive power to analysis of future risk of VE in aPL-positive patients. However, anti-DI tests are not yet in routine clinical use.

It is not clear to what extent positivity for aPL in early SLE is predictive of increased risk of VE subsequently. In a previous publication in Rheumatology we described measurement of IgG anti-CL, IgG anti-β2GPI and IgG anti-DI in the earliest available serum samples from 501 patients with SLE. There was a trend towards increased risk of VE in patients who were positive for ≥ 2 of these antibodies (double/triple-positive), but this did not reach statistical significance. In that paper we only had data on complete vascular history for 276 patients, which limited our analysis. After further thorough analysis of the medical records of an extra 197 patients, we have complete vascular history plus aPL measurements in early samples from 423 patients and an additional 7 years' follow-up. We have therefore repeated and extended the analysis of associations between early aPL-positivity and subsequent VE in the current paper.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome [^aa7bc31b]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune systemic disease that is diagnosed when there is vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity occurring with persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) (lupus anticoagulant test, anticardiolipin antibodies, and/or anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies). Although International APS Classification Criteria have been formulated to provide a uniform approach to APS research, aPL may cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations, some of which are not included in these criteria. The main aPL-related cardiac manifestations include valve abnormalities (vegetations and/or thickening), myocardial infarction (MI), intracardiac thrombi, and myocardial microthrombosis. In this article, we will review the definition, etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of aPL-related clinical events with emphasis on cardiac manifestations.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^4809e920]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Central venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in pregnancy and postpartum — ACOG suggests prompt treatment with adjusted-dose low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent long-term significant sequelae (CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION, MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE); treatment aims include recanalization of the occluded sinus, prevention of thrombus expansion, and treatment of underlying prothrombotic state, and therapeutic adjusted-dose anticoagulation should be initiated before clinical deterioration, with evaluation for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (lupus anticoagulant, anti–cardiolipin antibodies, beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies) and inherited thrombophilias warranted once the diagnosis is made; vaccine-induced thrombosis, though rare, should not be treated with heparin anticoagulants and neurology consultation is advised.

### Prevalence and significance of anti-prothrombin (aPT) antibodies in patients with lupus anticoagulant (LA) [^7df7a2d3]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Anti-prothrombin (aPT) antibodies have been found in Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) positive patients. Their prevalence and relative contribution to thromboembolic risk in LA-positive patients is not well defined. The aim of this study was to determine their presence and association with thromboembolic events in a large series of patients with confirmed LA.

Methods

Plasma from LA-positive patients was collected at Thrombosis Centers and sent to a reference central laboratory for confirmation. Positive plasma was tested using home-made ELISA for the presence of aPT and anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies.

Results

LA was confirmed in 231 patients. Sixty-one of 231 (26%, 95%CI 22–33) LA positive subjects were positive for IgG aPT and 62 (27%, 95% CI 21–33) were positive for IgM aPT antibodies. Clinical features of Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) were not associated with the presence of IgG aPT [43 APS in 61 (70%) positive and 109 APS in 170 (64%) negative IgG aPT subjects, p = ns] or IgM aPT. Rate of positivity of IgG and IgM a beta(2)GPI was significantly higher than that of IgG and IgM aPT. Clinical events accounting for APS occurred in 97 of 130 (75%) IgG a beta(2)GPI positive and in 55 of 101 (54%) IgG a beta(2)GPI negative patients (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.3, p = 0.002). No significant association with clinical events in patients positive for both IgG aPT and IgG a beta(2)GPI as compared to those positive for one or another test was found. When patients negative for both IgG aPT and IgG a beta(2)GPI (LA positive only) were compared with remaining patients, a significantly lower association with clinical events was found (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.7, p = 0.004).

Conclusions

As compared to IgG a beta(2)GPI, the prevalence of IgG aPT in patients with LA is significantly lower and not associated with the clinical features of APS.

### Overexpression of beta2-microglobulin is associated with poor survival in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma and contributes to oral cancer cell migration and invasion [^6c0c1709]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we found that β 2M is aberrantly expressed in OCSCC relative to histologically adjacent non-tumour tissue. Moreover, β 2M is an important factor for several clinicopathological variables in OCSCC, suggesting its potential as a biomarker of the disease. Furthermore, β 2M overexpression facilitates the migration and invasion of oral cancer cells, which supports the finding that elevated levels of β 2M are positively correlated with advanced OCSCC. Apart from the exploration of prognostic factors in OCSCC, our results present a potential target for immunotherapy.

### Association of β-2-microglobulin and cardiovascular events and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad93c47c]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Our meta-analysis found that B2M was also associated with all-cause mortality and mortality from infectious diseases in the same cohorts, and the relevance of B2M with all-cause mortality was consistent across the study characteristics assessed in the present analyses. The positive associations with infectious and all-cause mortality were independent of renal function markers in line with previous findings in older age populations. B2M has previously been found to be associated with other non-cardiovascular outcomes, such as various cancers, though not reported in many of the studies included in our review. Existing evidence has suggested that B2M is probably a general biomarker that reflects the acute or chronic changes during inflammation, infection, or immune dysregulation. In our meta-analysis, however, compared to those for cardiovascular outcomes, the number of studies reporting B2M with non-cardiovascular outcomes was relatively limited, and the majority of study population patients had renal diseases. Hence, interpretations of the findings on B2M with non-cardiovascular mortality warrants cautions. This limitation emphasizes the need for prospective studies in general populations to compare the dose-response and magnitude of associations of B2M levels and incident disease outcomes.

### Anticardiolipin and anti-beta2-glycoprotein-I antibodies in preeclampsia [^0d5a5c5f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate whether antiphospholipid antibodies, specifically anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-I antibodies, are associated with preeclampsia.

Methods

Plasma was prospectively obtained from four groups of pregnant women: those with 1) mild preeclampsia (n = 109); 2) severe preeclampsia (n = 134); 3) hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome (n = 57); and 4) normotensive controls (n = 100). Anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-I levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay.

Results

Subjects with mild preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and HELLP syndrome did not have significantly elevated levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-I antibodies compared with normotensive controls (P > .05, Kruskal-Wallis). Similarly, subjects with mild preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and HELLP syndrome did not have a significantly higher proportion of women testing positive for each autoantibody compared with normotensive controls (chi(2)). The proportion of patients testing positive for anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-I antibodies were similar in patients with preeclampsia developing before and after 34 weeks' gestation (chi(2)).

Conclusion

Circulating levels of both anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-I antibodies were not increased in patients with mild preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, or HELLP syndrome compared with normotensive controls. Our data do not support routine testing for anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-I antibodies in women with preeclampsia.

### Immunoglobulin A anti-beta2-glycoprotein antibodies in women who experience unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion and unexplained fetal death [^656f3dee]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Studies in rheumatologic populations suggest that immunoglobulin A antiphospholipid antibodies are strongly associated with the clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome. However, the association between immunoglobulin A antiphospholipid antibodies and pregnancy loss is uncertain. We determined whether immunoglobulin A antiphospholipid antibodies, specifically anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I and anticardiolipin, are associated with the obstetric features of antiphospholipid syndrome.

Study Design

Sera from 4 groups of women were studied: (1) 133 women who experienced unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion, (2) 48 women who experienced unexplained fetal death, (3) 145 healthy fertile control subjects, and (4) 67 women with well-characterized antiphospholipid syndrome. Serum immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I and anticardiolipin antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay.

Results

Groups of women who experienced unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion and unexplained fetal death had a higher proportion of women who had positive test results for immunoglobulin A anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies than fertile control subjects (P < .01, chi-square test); these subjects also had higher levels of autoantibody (P = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis). Women who experienced recurrent spontaneous abortion had a higher proportion of women with positive test results for immunoglobulin A anticardiolipin antibodies compared to fertile control subjects (P < .05, chi-square test); this group also had higher levels of autoantibody (P = 0.0065, Kruskal-Wallis test). Linear regression analysis showed significant correlation between anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I immunoglobulin A and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I immunoglobulin G (R = .609; P = 0.0001) and less correlation between anticardiolipin immunoglobulin A and anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G (R = .093; P = 0.065).

Conclusion

Immunoglobulin A anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies are more common in women who experience unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion and unexplained fetal death whose initial test results are negative for lupus anticoagulant and immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibodies compared to fertile control subjects. Therefore, these antibodies may identify additional women with clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome who are not identified through traditional testing. It is unclear whether these antibodies are directly pathogenic, a result of the pregnancy losses, or markers for an underlying, yet uncharacterized autoimmune disorder.

### IgG subclass distribution of antibodies against beta (2)-GP1 and cardiolipin in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome, and their clinical associations [^0f50d0c2]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass distribution of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein 1 (beta(2)-GP1) antibodies (abeta(2)-GP1), and to examine possible associations between the different abeta(2)-GP1 and aCL subclasses and the main clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

Methods

We studied 130 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 35 patients with primary APS. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure IgG aCL and abeta(2)-GP1 and to determine the IgG subclass distribution of these two autoantibodies.

Results

When the number of patients positive for each subclass was examined, IgG(3) and IgG(2) aCL were more frequent (63.5 and 54.1% of patients were positive for the two subclasses, respectively), while for abeta(2)-GP1 IgG(2) was the most prevalent subclass (81.8% of patients were positive). IgG(2) aCL was significantly associated with arterial thrombosis (P = 0.023) and fetal loss (P = 0.013), and IgG(3) aCL was significantly associated with arterial thrombosis (P = 0.0003) and fetal loss (P = 0.045). IgG(2) abeta(2)-GP1 was associated with venous thrombosis (P = 0.012) and IgG(3) abeta(2)-GP1 was associated with venous thrombosis (P = 0.036) and fetal loss (P = 0.024).

Conclusions

The IgG(2) predominance of abeta(2)-GP1 suggests that the antibody response against beta(2)-GP1 may be T-cell-independent. As IgG(2) and IgG(3) differ in their effector functions, their association with the same clinical manifestations (i.e. thrombosis and fetal loss) suggests that more than one mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombosis and fetal loss in APS.

### Development of the 2023 ACR / EULAR antiphospholipid syndrome classification criteria, phase III-C report: assessment of patient scenarios (derivation cohort) and refinement of definitions [^7618dde9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The 2023 ACR/EULAR Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) Classification criteria aim to identify patients with high likelihood of APS for research. Phases I/II of our four-phase methodological approach resulted in 27 candidate criteria organized in clinical and laboratory domains. Here, we summarize Phase III efforts to reduce and refine criteria using patient scenarios.

Methods

Using standardized definitions for candidate criteria, the Steering Committee collected antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positive cases referred for "suspected APS". Treating physicians assessed APS case likelihood using a Likert Scale. Poisson regression calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals to quantify the direction and size of the association of candidate criteria with "highly likely" versus "equivocal or unlikely" APS, which guided Steering Committee candidate criteria refinement and organization.

Results

We collected 314 suspected APS cases (137 [44%] highly likely, 177 [56%] equivocal/unlikely APS). Provoking venous thromboembolism (VTE) or arterial thromboses (AT) risk factors reduced the size of the association with highly likely APS (RR 4.31 [95%CI 2.11–8.78] to RR 1.56 [95%CI 0.89–2.75] for VTE, and RR 3.48 [95%CI 1.91–6.32] to RR 1.64 [95%CI 0.77–3.51] for AT). Persistent lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG antibody > 40U, and anti-β 2 -glycoprotein-I IgG antibody > 40U were positively associated with highly likely APS (all p < 0.05). Eventually, items within eight additive and independent clinical and laboratory domains were refined.

Conclusion

Referred suspected APS cases provided insight into associations of individual candidate criteria with APS likelihood. Risk ratio analyses helped refine items and organize the draft classification system into eight additive and independent clinical and laboratory domains.

2.2 Data extraction and quality assessment

From each retrieved article, the following characteristics were extracted: name of first author, year of publication, study design, geographical location, data source, assay method, population type, proportion of female participants, age of participants, follow-up years, relevant outcome definitions, number of cases, mean and standard deviation of B2M, reported estimates of B2M association with outcome, scale of reported estimates, and degree of statistical adjustment for covariates. The estimate adjusted for conventional cardiovascular risk factors was chosen if more than one estimates were reported. Quality of the studies was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) (Supplementary Data 2), by two reviewers (FS and LS) independently, and discussed with the third reviewer (SK). Study scores of 0–3, 4–6, and 7–9 were considered as low, moderate and high quality, respectively.

### Paradoxical association between the 316 trp to ser beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) polymorphism and anti-beta2GPI antibodies [^173056cb]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

We report a woman with an obstetric history of a stillbirth at 28 weeks, associated with hypertension and severe intrauterine growth restriction and a miscarriage at 9 weeks. She was persistently positive for immunolgobulin G (IgG) anticardiolipin antibodies and IgG anti-Beta-2-glycoprotein I (anti-Beta2GPI) antibodies. She has delivered three healthy babies when managed antenatally with aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. Genotyping revealed that she was homozygous for the 316 Trp to Ser Beta2GPI polymorphism. Studies examining the binding of her plasma Beta2GPI to purified cardiolipin showed markedly reduced binding in comparison with Beta2GPI in pooled normal plasma.

### Non-criteria antiphospholipid antibody profiles and thrombotic outcomes in a cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^95259b1f]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune condition characterised by the presence of persistent autoantibodies directed against phospholipid-binding proteins and clinical outcomes of thrombosis and/or obstetric morbidity. There is an increased incidence of APS among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).20–30% of patients with SLE will have positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), and in SLE cohorts with 8–10 years of follow-up, 15–20% of patients with positive aPLs experience a venous, arterial or small-vessel thrombotic event. The presence of aPLs is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with SLE.

The 2006 revised Sapporo lab criteria, which are used in combination with clinical classification criteria to make a diagnosis of APS, include one or more of a positive lupus anticoagulant (LAC), IgG or IgM anti-beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (aβ2GP1), or IgG or IgM anticardiolipin (aCL). Antibodies must be persistently positive on repeat testing > 12 weeks. Based on the revised Sapporo criteria, antibodies against β2GP1 are considered positive at > 99th percentile, while aCL is considered positive at > 99th percentile or > 40 GPU (immunoglobulin G phospholipid units). Some patients present with an APS-like phenotype but do not have a positive LAC, aβ2GP1 or aCL antibodies, a phenomenon known as seronegative APS (SNAPS). Novel aPLs are present in patients with SNAPS including IgG antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin complex (aPS/PT), IgM aPS/PT and IgG anti-domain 1 β2GP1 (aβ2GP1-D1), but the significance of these non-criteria autoantibodies remains unclear.

### Revised classification criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome and the thrombotic risk in patients with autoimmune diseases [^58e96b12]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The classification criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were updated in 2006.

Objective

The aim of the study was to analyze associations between clinical complications and laboratory test abnormalities typical for APS in a group of patients with autoimmune diseases, based on the recently updated criteria.

Patients/Methods

Three hundred and thirty-six patients were enrolled into the study, with the majority (n = 235) suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus. Laboratory determinations included: lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I (anti-beta(2)GPI) antibodies (ABs) [of both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM class].

Results

A significant association was found between laboratory and clinical features of APS; odds ratios (ORs) for thrombosis associated with the presence of LA, aCL, and anti-beta(2)GPI Abs were 4.04 [95% CI: 2.44–6.68], 3.71 (95% CI 2.32–5.92) and 2.57 (95% CI 1.60–4.1), respectively. Detailed analysis showed marked differences between the risk of clinical complications associated with the presence of an antibody in the IgG class (OR 4.15, 95% CI 2.42–7.12, and OR 4.77, 95% CI 2.37–9.61 for aCL and anti-beta(2)GPI, respectively) and in the IgM class (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.31–3.70, and OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.15–3.14 for aCL and anti-beta(2)GPI, respectively). The postulated inclusion of anti-beta(2)GPI antibody positivity into the previous laboratory criteria changed only slightly the number of patients diagnosed with APS (from 112 to 117).

Conclusions

The updated APS classification criteria clearly represent a step forward. However, our results argue against the use of overall positivity for aCL or anti-beta(2)GPI, and favor a clear distinction between the IgG and IgM classes of antiphospholipid ABs. Patients with both LA and anti-beta(2)GPI IgG or LA and aCL IgG positivity may represent the subgroups at the highest risk of thrombotic complications.
