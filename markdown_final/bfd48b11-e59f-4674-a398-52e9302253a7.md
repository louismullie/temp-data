## Question

Mechanism of Action of Acetaminophen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acetaminophen's mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical COX-centric view and why it fails to explain key clinical observations. Then, I should verify the evidence for a central, metabolite-driven mechanism anchored by AM404. Next, I will examine the specific neuronal pathways involved, including TRPV1, CB1, and serotonergic modulation. After that, I need to integrate peripheral versus central actions and reconcile any residual COX hypotheses. Finally, I should consider clinical implications, safety constraints, and areas of uncertainty before synthesizing a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the traditional view and its limitations. Historically, acetaminophen was grouped with NSAIDs as a weak COX inhibitor, but unlike NSAIDs it lacks peripheral anti-inflammatory activity and has minimal effects on platelets and the gut, which already hints at a different, more central mechanism rather than broad peripheral COX blockade [^116QMfHm] [^1153GsbC]. Wait, let me verify the COX-3 hypothesis; although a brain-specific COX-1 splice variant (COX-3) was proposed, subsequent work indicates no full-length, catalytically active human COX-3, making that explanation unlikely to be clinically relevant, so I should not overstate it despite earlier enthusiasm [^111CTp4X].

> I will now examine the central metabolite hypothesis. The pivotal shift came with the demonstration that acetaminophen is a prodrug for AM404: acetaminophen is deacetylated to p-aminophenol, which is then conjugated with arachidonic acid by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the CNS to form N-arachidonoyl-phenolamine (AM404), a bioactive metabolite detected in human CSF after therapeutic dosing, which strongly supports a central mechanism of action [^115Nhn2r] [^112t4t8m]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not just a rodent artifact; yes, human CSF data corroborate central AM404 formation, strengthening translational relevance [^115Nhn2r].

> Next, I should review the principal neuronal targets of AM404. AM404 is a potent activator of TRPV1 channels in the CNS, where supraspinal TRPV1 activation paradoxically produces antinociception, and both genetic deletion and pharmacologic blockade of TRPV1 abrogate acetaminophen's analgesia, indicating a necessary role for this pathway [^116gyWFt] [^111XHsau]. Let me consider downstream signaling; AM404 engages a TRPV1–mGlu5–PLC–DAGL cascade that culminates in CB1 receptor activation, and CB1 antagonism or genetic deletion eliminates acetaminophen's antinociceptive effect, confirming endocannabinoid involvement [^112JPkDN] [^1179R8wH]. I should double-check the calcium channel piece; Cav3.2 T-type channels appear to act downstream of TRPV1 in supraspinal circuits and contribute to the analgesic effect, aligning with a multi-node central mechanism [^1167va5x] [^116gyWFt].

> But wait, what about serotonin, since descending inhibitory control is a classic pain modulatory axis. Human and animal data indicate acetaminophen reinforces descending serotonergic inhibition; in volunteers, 5-HT3 antagonists such as tropisetron or granisetron block acetaminophen's analgesia without altering acetaminophen pharmacokinetics, supporting a pharmacodynamic interaction with bulbospinal serotonergic pathways rather than altered exposure [^112cMGsX] [^112BbMKV]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not simply a ceiling effect; the blockade is specific and reproducible across studies, reinforcing a serotonergic component integrated with the AM404–TRPV1–CB1 axis rather than a nonspecific suppression [^11485aHk] [^115k4nWm].

> Let me integrate peripheral versus central actions more explicitly. Acetaminophen shows minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory effect and limited COX inhibition in inflamed tissues due to high peroxide tone, which inactivates its peroxidase-site action, explaining the lack of GI, renal, and platelet effects typical of NSAIDs [^1153GsbC] [^113fdahU]. I should confirm whether any residual COX effect matters; some data suggest low-level central COX modulation or AM404-mediated COX inhibition in brain, but these appear ancillary and insufficient to explain the full analgesic profile, which is dominated by the central AM404 pathway rather than peripheral COX blockade [^1153GsbC] [^112t4t8m].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and safety constraints. Because the analgesic effect is centrally mediated and distinct from NSAIDs, acetaminophen is preferred first-line in many populations at risk for GI, renal, or cardiovascular adverse effects, and it integrates well into multimodal regimens with NSAIDs and opioids, often yielding additive analgesia and opioid-sparing effects, though the magnitude of opioid-sparing varies by context and dose [^113wwis3] [^116Q8njS]. Hold on, I should verify hepatotoxicity; despite a favorable safety profile at therapeutic doses, acetaminophen remains the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US due to NAPQI formation in overdose or high-risk states, so adherence to daily dose limits and avoidance of multiple acetaminophen-containing products is essential [^117UTdUq] [^117Tv9ti].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and edge cases. The exact weighting of TRPV1 versus CB1 versus serotonergic contributions likely varies by pain phenotype and experimental model, and while human CSF data confirm AM404, some mechanistic links remain inferred from preclinical work, so future studies should clarify receptor-specific contributions and potential genetic modifiers such as TRPV1 variants that influence response [^115Nhn2r] [^116gyWFt]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied a single unified pathway; the current consensus favors a multi-node central mechanism rather than a monolithic target, which better fits the heterogeneous clinical efficacy across pain states [^1128Wwce].

> In summary, I should confirm the synthesis: acetaminophen's analgesia is primarily mediated by a central, COX-independent mechanism wherein CNS generation of AM404 activates supraspinal TRPV1, engages a signaling cascade leading to CB1 activation, and reinforces descending serotonergic inhibition, with minimal contribution from peripheral anti-inflammatory effects; this mechanistic profile explains its distinct safety and interaction characteristics and supports its foundational role in multimodal analgesia when used within safe dosing limits [^112t4t8m] [^113wwis3] [^116QMfHm].

Acetaminophen's analgesic and antipyretic effects are **primarily mediated by central actions** in the CNS, including inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via COX-2 [^1153GsbC], activation of descending serotonergic pathways [^11485aHk], and modulation of the endocannabinoid system through its active metabolite AM404 [^1179R8wH]. It has minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory activity, distinguishing it from NSAIDs [^114ki4Qa]. Hepatotoxicity occurs when therapeutic doses are exceeded or with chronic use, due to NAPQI formation and glutathione depletion [^116Q7Bsi] [^114dBeia].

---

## Central mechanisms of action

### Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis

- **COX-2 inhibition**: Acetaminophen selectively inhibits COX-2 in the CNS, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby mediating analgesia and antipyresis [^1153GsbC].
- **Limited peripheral COX inhibition**: Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen has minimal peripheral COX inhibition, explaining its lack of significant anti-inflammatory activity [^115F7ZEE].

---

### Activation of descending serotonergic pathways

Serotonergic modulation is evidenced by **descending serotonergic pathway activation**, which enhances inhibitory neurotransmission and contributes to analgesia [^11485aHk]. Blockade of serotonergic receptors — particularly 5-HT3 — **abolishes acetaminophen's analgesic effect**, underscoring serotonin's role [^112cMGsX].

---

### Endocannabinoid system modulation

- **AM404 formation**: Acetaminophen is metabolized to AM404, which inhibits the reuptake of anandamide and activates cannabinoid receptors, enhancing endocannabinoid-mediated analgesia [^114ki4Qa].
- **CB1 receptor involvement**: AM404 indirectly activates CB1 receptors, reinforcing descending inhibitory pathways and contributing to analgesia [^1179R8wH].

---

## Peripheral mechanisms of action

Peripheral prostaglandin synthesis is only **weakly inhibited**, limiting anti-inflammatory effects and distinguishing acetaminophen from NSAIDs [^113fdahU].

---

## Hepatotoxicity and safety considerations

- **NAPQI formation**: A small proportion of acetaminophen is metabolized to NAPQI, a reactive intermediate that can cause hepatocellular necrosis if glutathione stores are depleted [^116Q7Bsi].
- **Dose-dependent toxicity**: Hepatotoxicity is dose-dependent, with risk increasing significantly above the recommended daily limit of 4,000 mg [^117Tv9ti].
- **Risk factors**: Chronic alcohol use, malnutrition, and pre-existing liver disease increase the risk of hepatotoxicity [^116Q7Bsi].

---

## Clinical implications

First-line analgesic status reflects a **favorable safety profile** and minimal gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse effects compared with NSAIDs [^114gMgy3]. Multimodal analgesia is supported by its **distinct mechanism**, which makes it suitable for combination therapy with NSAIDs or opioids to enhance analgesic efficacy [^116Q8njS].

---

Acetaminophen's analgesic and antipyretic effects are **primarily mediated by central mechanisms**, including COX-2 inhibition, serotonergic modulation, and endocannabinoid system activation. Its minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory activity and favorable safety profile make it a first-line analgesic, but hepatotoxicity remains a critical consideration, particularly with overdose or chronic use.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^112t4t8m]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

The mechanisms of how paracetamol works are still subject to debate despite its widespread use. Previous scientific research questions the idea that paracetamol relieves pain by inhibiting cyclooxygenases (COX). Now, it is more apparent that paracetamol's pain-relieving effect occurs in the brain and is independent of the COX enzyme. This article reviewed the central paracetamol actions and how the current experimental evidence can be used in clinical practice. Based on the evidence discussed in this review, paracetamol works differently than NSAIDs and has a safer safety profile. With the central MoA for paracetamol in place, we think paracetamol will still be the first choice for acute pain management. When the COX-independent mechanism of action and stable pharmacokinetic properties of paracetamol are considered, it is safe to say that paracetamol should be preferred over NSAIDs for analgesia, especially in special populations. Newer painkillers, based on the central action of paracetamol, are being studied and show promising results in relieving pain without increasing the risk of liver damage.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^112jr1by]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Paracetamol is generally considered safe for many patients, particularly in comparison with NSAIDs and opioids. The growing evidence of the centrally located COX-independent actions of paracetamol can pave the way for optimizing the use of an old drug in a more widened patients' profile. More importantly, the development of paracetamol–based derivatives can maximize the central effects of paracetamol while reducing the risk of toxicity. The present article provides a comprehensive literature review of the centrally located, COX-independent, analgesic MoA of paracetamol and how the current experimental evidence can be translated into clinical practice. This review highlighted the advantages of the centrally located MoA and the benefit/risk of paracetamol in mild-to-moderate pain conditions. Consequently, we discussed the potential clinical applications of paracetamol analogs. Besides, we review the safety aspects of paracetamol administration and how it can be preferred over NSAIDs due to its more tolerable safety profile.

### Potential analgesic mechanisms of acetaminophen [^116D2y79]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Despite nearing the end of the decade of pain research, the analgesic mechanisms of one of the most widely used and popular analgesics remains uncertain. Acetaminophen (APAP) (paracetamol [PARA]) has been used clinically for over a half of a century and although clinicians seem to be comfortable with its benefits, risks, and limitations, they still remain in the dark as to precisely what is providing its pain relief. What does seem clearer is that the predominant mechanisms of APAP's analgesic effects are in the central nervous system (CNS). Although, which central effects are largely responsible for APAP's effects on pain continue to be uncertain. Perhaps, the most accepted theory is that of APAP's positive effects on the serotonergic descending inhibitory pathways. However, interactions with opioidergic systems, eicosanoid systems, and/or nitric oxide containing pathways may be involved as well. Furthermore, endocannabinoid signaling may play a role in APAP's activation of the serotonergic descending inhibitory pathways. A greater understanding of APAP's analgesic mechanisms may promote optimal utilization of analgesic polypharmacy.

### A rationale for combining acetaminophen and NSAIDs for mild-to-moderate pain [^116mtcPF]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Analgesic therapy that combines individual agents with different mechanisms of action has potential advantages for the management of mild-to-moderate pain in the outpatient setting. Theoretically, this approach can lead to greater efficacy and fewer adverse events. While the precise mechanism of action for the analgesic effect of acetaminophen remains uncertain, accumulating evidence suggests that its activity resides primarily in the central nervous system. In contrast, the site of action for the analgesic effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is predominantly peripheral, within injured or inflamed tissue. Several controlled clinical studies among patients with musculoskeletal conditions, dental pain, or postoperative pain have shown that combinations of acetaminophen and NSAIDs provide additive pain-relieving activity, thereby leading to dose-sparing effects and improved safety. Further studies are warranted to determine the clinical utility and safety of acetaminophen/NSAID combinations as analgesic therapy for common conditions associated with mild-to-moderate pain.

Conclusion and Expert Opinion

Paracetamol remains among the most commonly prescribed analgesics. Nonetheless, the paracetamol MoA remained complex and not yet fully understood. It is now more evident that paracetamol analgesia has multiple pathways and is mediated by the formation of the bioactive AM404 metabolite in the CNS. The evidence discussed in this review established paracetamol as a central, COX-independent, analgesic medication that has a distinct MoA from NSAIDs and a more tolerable safety profile.

This leads to consider that paracetamol remains the preferred first-line option for mild-to-moderate acute pain management for healthy adults and patients with health concerns, such as the elderly, patients with gastrointestinal, renal impairments and/or cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, to avoid hepatotoxicity, healthcare practitioners should consider appropriate paracetamol dosing individually in special populations and weigh the potential risk–benefit ratio after considering the patient-specific factors.

The central COX-independent MoA of paracetamol warrants to use it for multimodal analgesic approaches. Paracetamol can potentiate the analgesic effect of opioids without increasing the risk of adverse events; still, the evidence is limited, and further studies are needed on the morphine-sparing effect of combining paracetamol and opioids. Paracetamol/NSAIDs combination resulted in higher analgesia and no increase in the risk of adverse events than NSAIDs alone. Although the interest in paracetamol-based combinations is growing, the evidence is still limited, and further high-quality evidence is warranted.

As our understanding of the AM404-mediated activation of the TRPV 1 channel and CB1 receptor signaling evolves, several investigations are being conducted to test the benefit of paracetamol analogs, with promising results. Paracetamol analogs can activate the TRPV 1 channel signaling without the hepatic production of the toxic metabolite, NAPQI; hence, they can induce a higher analgesic effect than that of paracetamol without increasing the risk of hepatoxicity. Thus, future experiments to better explain the central actions of paracetamol could pave the way for discovering analgesics with a better benefit-to-risk ratio as genetic studies could help to predict efficacy and tolerability of paracetamol.

### Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity-isn' T it time for APAP to go away? [^116Demib]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever around the world. At the same time, APAP can cause dose-related hepatocellular necrosis, responsible for nearly 500 deaths annually in the United States (US) alone, as well as 100,000 calls to US Poison Control Centers, 50,000 emergency room visits and 10,000 hospitalisations per year. As an over-the-counter and prescription product (with opioids), APAP toxicity dwarfs all other prescription drugs as a cause of acute liver failure in the US and Europe, but it is not regulated in any significant way. In this review the ongoing controversy surrounding the proper role for this ubiquitous pain reliever: its history, pathogenesis, clinical challenges in recognition and management, and current regulatory status are highlighted. A new solution to a 50-year-old problem is proposed.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^117F76xp]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Paracetamol remains the recommended first-line option for mild-to-moderate acute pain in general population and particularly in vulnerable populations. Despite its wide use, debate exists regarding the analgesic mechanism of action (MoA) of paracetamol. A growing body of evidence challenged the notion that paracetamol exerts its analgesic effect through cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent inhibitory effect. It is now more evident that paracetamol analgesia has multiple pathways and is mediated by the formation of the bioactive AM404 metabolite in the central nervous system (CNS). AM404 is a potent activator of TRPV 1, a major contributor to neuronal response to pain in the brain and dorsal horn. In the periaqueductal grey, the bioactive metabolite AM404 activated the TRPV 1 channel-mGlu5 receptor-PLC-DAGL-CB1 receptor signaling cascade. The present article provides a comprehensive literature review of the centrally located, COX-independent, analgesic MoA of paracetamol and relates how the current experimental evidence can be translated into clinical practice. The evidence discussed in this review established paracetamol as a central, COX-independent, antinociceptive medication that has a distinct MoA from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and a more tolerable safety profile. With the establishment of the central MoA of paracetamol, we believe that paracetamol remains the preferred first-line option for mild-to-moderate acute pain for healthy adults, children, and patients with health concerns. However, safety concerns remain with the high dose of paracetamol due to the NAPQI-mediated liver necrosis. Centrally acting paracetamol/ p -aminophenol derivatives could potentiate the analgesic effect of paracetamol without increasing the risk of hepatoxicity. Moreover, the specific central MoA of paracetamol allows its combination with other analgesics, including NSAIDs, with a different MoA. Future experiments to better explain the central actions of paracetamol could pave the way for discovering new central analgesics with a better benefit-to-risk ratio.

Potential Clinical Consequences of the Centrally Located Analgesic Action of Paracetamol

Paracetamol, a COX-Independent, Centrally Acted as the First Choice for a Wide Range of Special Populations

Safety is the primary concern in choosing OTC analgesics, particularly for mild-to-moderate pain conditions in vulnerable groups. Patients with health concerns are frequently reluctant to take the appropriate analgesic dose due to safety concerns, leading to inadequate pain management. Most NSAIDs have safety concerns related to the development of gastric ulcers and bleeding, bronchial asthma, acute kidney injury, and long-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Initial reports classified paracetamol as a part of the NSAIDs class due to the presumably shared inhibitory effect on PG synthesis. One thing that is already accepted in the scientific community is that paracetamol has almost no anti-inflammatory activity and does not cause the same adverse effects as NSAIDs do. So, it is sensible to assume that paracetamol is different from NSAIDs. The fact that paracetamol has a limited peripheral COX inhibitory effect and potent centrally located actions can help better understand the benefit–risk ratio of this old drug.

Abstract

Paracetamol remains the recommended first-line option for mild-to-moderate acute pain in general population and particularly in vulnerable populations.

Still, the safety of paracetamol is surrounded by controversy. Of course, hepatoxicity is well established and remains a major issue. Indeed, paracetamol produces variable amounts of the hepatotoxic compound, NAPQI. Hepatic metabolism of paracetamol via the P450 system (mainly CYP-2E1) leads to the synthesis of NAPQI normally conjugated with glutathione and eliminated in urine. However, when high doses of paracetamol are used or at usual doses, in some patients at risk (malnutrition, alcoholism, some combinations of drugs, etc), glutathione stores can be decreased and/or CYP activity increased, both leading to a high level of NAPQI and NAPQI-mediated liver necrosis, and thus doses must be adapted in this population. Interestingly, a recent work studying the role of acetaminophen on epitranscriptome suggests that its hepatotoxicity could be reduced by adequate strategy. Otherwise, although some other safety issues associated with paracetamol remain inconclusive, some patients with comorbidities have concerns with the use of paracetamol for common pain conditions. Thus, it is imperative to consolidate the current literature and appropriately weigh the risk–benefit ratio of paracetamol for pain conditions in special populations until good scientific evidence of safety should prevail. Recently, Alchin et al reviewed the current evidence of paracetamol as the first-option analgesic in patients with kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, asthma, and the elderly. In another context, a recent work suggests that acetaminophen would be a potential suppressor of antitumor immunity, suggesting that it should be used with caution in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The precise mechanism of the analgesic and antipyretic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to primarily involve central actions.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Acetaminophen has been shown to have analgesic and antipyretic activities in animal and human studies.

Single-doses of acetaminophen up to 3,000 mg and repeated doses of 1,000 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours have not been shown to cause a significant effect on platelet aggregation. Acetaminophen does not have any immediate or delayed effects on small-vessel hemostasis. Clinical studies of both healthy subjects and patients with hemophilia showed no significant changes in bleeding time after receiving multiple doses of oral acetaminophen.

### What dose of paracetamol for older people? [^117DdNeF]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Paracetamol, on its own or in combination with other analgesics, is widely used to treat pain associated with acute and chronic conditions. It is considered safe enough to have a general sales licence (GSL) for use by "adults, elderly and children over 16 years" and has few listed cautions or contraindications.1,2 However, recently the effectiveness and safety of paracetamol for some conditions have been challenged, 3,4 and there are published case reports of liver failure associated with therapeutic doses.5–9 Here, we review the use of paracetamol, its pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms by which it can cause liver damage and consider whether frail older people are at greater risk of adverse effects. We also discuss if dose reduction should be considered in some circumstances.

Introduction

Pain represents substantial healthcare and financial burden despite the available pain management approaches, highlighting the urgent need for innovative medications and, possibly, indications of established analgesics. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen or N -acetyl- p -aminophenol) are commonly prescribed for pain management in a wide range of conditions. Globally, paracetamol is also at the apex of the most commonly utilized over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic and the preferred first-line option for patients with mild-to-moderate acute pain. The good tolerability at the recommended dosage (eg, lack of gastrointestinal adverse effects) is a major contributor to the preference for paracetamol by general practitioners, specialists, and pharmacists. Although it was introduced in clinics more than 100 years ago, paracetamol remains the recommended first-line option for pain management by several scientific societies, and particularly in vulnerable populations such as geriatrics, children, patients with peptic ulcers, and pregnant women. Despite its wide use, debate exists regarding the analgesic mechanism of action (MoA) of paracetamol.

Historically, it was believed that the paracetamol-mediated analgesia stems solely from its cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent inhibitory effect on prostaglandin (PG) synthesis; however, it is now evident that the analgesic MoA of paracetamol is multidimensional and involves several pathways within the central nervous system (CNS), such as the endocannabinoid, serotonergic, and nitric oxide pathwaysor for some authors opioid pathways. The notion that we already know concerning the metabolic pathways for paracetamol has been challenged in the past two decades following the 2005 study by Högestätt et al; in this report, the authors demonstrated that, following hepatic deacetylation to p -aminophenol, this paracetamol metabolite crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and is converted to N -arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404). Subsequent experimental evidence found that this new metabolite pathway was involved in its analgesic MoA. Moreover, several molecular actors targeted by the bioactive AM404, including the Cav3.2 calcium channel, the cannabinoid CB1 receptors and TRPV 1 receptors, would participate in the MoA.

Paracetamol in Combination with Other Analgesics

Multimodal analgesia has become a principal approach for the management of acute postoperative pain conditions that offers additive or synergistic analgesia and lower opioid dose requirements. Theoretically, combining two analgesics with different mechanisms of action potentiates their analgesic actions without increasing their doses and compromising the safety outcomes. Paracetamol has linear and consistent pharmacokinetics, and its tolerable profile makes it a good option when a combination is required.

As previously elucidated, paracetamol has a central, COX-independent, analgesic action that can synergize other analgesics with different central or peripheral MoA. Thus, it can potentiate the analgesic effect of opioids without increasing the risk of adverse events (Table 1). The paracetamol plus opioids combination can benefit from the rapid onset of action of paracetamol and the sustained analgesic effect of opioids. Several reports demonstrated that paracetamol plus opioids led to superior pain relief and lower dose requirements than individual components without increasing the risk of adverse events in a wide range of pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis and postoperative pain. However, we do not have good evidence that paracetamol spares the opioid adverse effects when a high dose of opioid is used. Recently, a comparative trial showed that the oxycodone/paracetamol combination was more effective than celecoxib in terms of reducing postoperative pain and rescue analgesia consumption amongst patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.

### Pathophysiology and first-line treatment of osteoarthritis [^115fRUTL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) and the various treatment modalities, focusing specifically on acetaminophen (APAP), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors as the primary treatment options.

Data Sources

Primary literature and tertiary references were identified by a MEDLINE search (1966-March 2001) and through other secondary sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

After evaluating the articles and references identified from the data sources, all the information that was judged relevant by the reviewers was included in the review article.

Data Synthesis

OA is the most common joint disorder worldwide. Current research suggests that factors such as inflammation and changes in subchondral bone may play a larger role in the pathophysiology than previously thought. With this research and the development of COX-2 inhibitors, selecting the medication of choice for OA has become difficult.

Conclusions

More research needs to be done before the pathophysiology of OA can be clearly determined. In the meantime, treatment should be based on clinical data and patient response. Studies have shown that APAP and NSAIDs have comparable efficacy, as do traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. APAP is associated with fewer toxicities than are the traditional NSAIDs. Due to their mechanism of action, the new COX-2 inhibitors should result in fewer adverse effects compared with traditional NSAIDs, but evidence from clinical trials has not been conclusive. Therefore, APAP should still be considered the drug of choice for OA.

### Systematic review of systemic and neuraxial effects of acetaminophen in preclinical models of nociceptive processing [^1128Wwce]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Concluding Comments

"The current evidence supports the assertion that acetaminophen has a behaviorally relevant, but delimited, analgesic effect in humans and in a variety of preclinical models". While mechanisms of action remain arguably controversial, the effects of acetaminophen on centrally evoked facilitated states (as after IT sP) and on aversive electrical stimulation strongly support the conclusion that at least a component of the effects of systemic acetaminophen reflect an effect upon CNS nociceptive processing that engage both spinal and supraspinal systems in humans and animals. The long history of acetaminophen in showing a highly desirable side effect profile and the absence of abuse potential is consistent with its wide use as an over-the-counter medication. Though it may possess deleterious effects upon liver function with persistent high-level use, it is surprisingly well tolerated in this regard in humans. A number of proposed mechanisms exist involving serotonin, cannabinoids and TRP signaling, while these mechanisms appear interesting and relevant, they are noteworthy in the absence of effects such as rewarding potential and absent any activating effects that such actions would endow the parent compound. It is the authors' opinion that the mechanisms of this profoundly interesting compound remain to be fully understood.

### Quality of life and paracetamol in advanced dementia (Q-PID): protocol of a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial [^116vGyE1]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The complete mechanism of action of paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is still unclear. Thus, the question remains whether paracetamol has only analgesic and antipyretic effects and, thereby, improves QoL, or whether it has another (yet unknown) independent mechanism of action on well-being that has not yet been revealed. Over all, the effects of regular pain treatment (not only with paracetamol) on QoL in persons with dementia have not yet been studied.

This proposed study will help gain more insight into and knowledge on the effect of pain treatment on QoL, neuropsychiatric symptoms, ADL function, pain, care dependency, and (change in) use of psychotropic and pain medication. Hopefully, the results will help persons with dementia to achieve and/or sustain the highest possible QoL, by alleviating undesired symptomatology.

Aims of the Q-PID trial

The primary objective of the Q-PID trial is to evaluate the effect of scheduled administration of pain treatment with paracetamol on QoL of people with advanced dementia in LTCFs. Secondary aims are to evaluate the effects of regular pain treatment with paracetamol on neuropsychiatric symptoms, ADL function, pain, care dependency, and (change in) use of psychotropic and pain medication.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^114fqPQ6]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Paracetamol Perspective: Future Analogs

As we have elucidated in this article, paracetamol itself can be considered as a pro-drug of the active centrally located metabolite, AM404. Nonetheless, paracetamol must first undergo hepatic deacylation into p -aminophenol and also produces variable amounts of the hepatotoxic compound NAPQI. Thus, paracetamol analogs were proposed to improve the safety profile of the drug, while keeping the same or even higher analgesic activity.

The development of paracetamol analogs that target the brain TRPV 1 receptors without the production of NAPQI and depletion of glutathione stores is a clinical perspective linked to the central action of paracetamol. It has been recently shown that paracetamol amine analogs undergo FAAH-dependent transformation into TRPV 1 activators without producing hepatotoxicity at the same dose that paracetamol produces clinically relevant hepatotoxicity; these analogs exhibited dose-dependent antinociceptive effects without antipyretic action, liver cell necrosis, or elevation in liver enzyme levels. Adamantyl, a paracetamol analog that selectively inhibits the TRPA 1 receptor, was also proposed. These findings highlighted that developing centrally acted analgesics is possible; these compounds can exhibit a well-tolerable safety profile without significantly inducing hepatotoxicity.

### Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^1129QrmY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The following information is based on studies of tramadol alone or acetaminophen alone, except where otherwise noted:

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol, an opioid agonist and inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin re-uptake, and acetaminophen. Although the mode of action of tramadol is not completely understood, the analgesic effect of tramadol is believed to be due to both binding to µ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.

Opioid activity of tramadol is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O -demethylated metabolite M1 to µ-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.

Acetaminophen is a non-opioid, non-salicylate analgesic. The site and mechanism for the analgesic effect of acetaminophen has not been determined but is thought to primarily involve central actions.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen [^113N75EE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanism of Action

Hydrocodone is full opioid agonist with relative selectivity for the mu-opioid (μ) receptor, although it can interact with other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydrocodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with hydrocodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to involve central actions.

Pharmacodynamics

Effects on the Central Nervous System

The principal therapeutic action of hydrocodone is analgesia. Hydrocodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Hydrocodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

This article is a review of the peri-operative use of paracetamol.

### Asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase elevations with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen [^114kp2NL]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.

### Liver regeneration after acetaminophen hepatotoxicity: mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities [^115bjvYY]. The American Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-para-aminophenol; APAP) overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the Western world, with limited treatment opportunities. For years, research on APAP overdose has been focused on investigating the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity, with limited success in advancing therapeutic strategies. Acute liver injury after any insult, including APAP overdose, is followed by compensatory liver regeneration, which promotes recovery and is a crucial determinant of the final outcome. Liver regeneration after APAP-induced liver injury is dose dependent and impaired after severe APAP overdose. Although robust regenerative response is associated with spontaneous recovery and survival, impaired regeneration results in faster progression of injury and death after APAP overdose. APAP hepatotoxicity-induced liver regeneration involves a complex time- and dose-dependent interplay of several signaling mediators, including growth factors, cytokines, angiogenic factors, and other mitogenic pathways. Compared with the liver injury, which is established before most patients seek medical attention and has proved difficult to manipulate, liver regeneration can be potentially modulated even in late-stage APAP-induced acute liver failure. Despite recent efforts to study the mechanisms of liver regeneration after APAP-induced liver injury, more comprehensive research in this area is required, especially regarding factors that contribute to impaired regenerative response, to develop novel regenerative therapies for APAP-induced acute liver failure.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^111CTp4X]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The Analgesic MoA is Independent of Central COX Inhibition

Historically, Vane and Flower demonstrated that paracetamol reduced brain PGE2 with a preferred action in the CNS than in the periphery.

PGs are produced by COX enzymes which need to be oxidized by hydroperoxides to be catalytically active. Paracetamol, as reducing agent, reduces the hydroperoxide tone and thus inactivates COX. The selectivity of paracetamol for CNS was hypothesized to be based on cellular concentration of peroxide and arachidonic acid. High levels of peroxide (found especially in the periphery, eg, in an inflammatory context) or arachidonic acid, thwart paracetamol COX inhibition.

Another proposed COX-dependent MoA of paracetamol is the involvement of another COX isoenzyme, named COX-3. Flower and Vane demonstrated that the COX inhibitory effect of paracetamol was more potent in the brain than in the spleen, suggesting another COX isoenzyme as a sensitive site for paracetamol action.COX-3 is an exon splice variant from COX-1 that was identified in the canine cerebral cortex and exhibited selective sensitivity to paracetamol. However, further genomic and kinetic studies showed that a full-length, catalytically active form of COX-3 does not exist in humans, and that the COX-3 selective interaction is unlikely to be clinically relevant.

However, the question remained whether the analgesic MoA of paracetamol is primarily mediated by COX inhibition. In mice, administering a weekly dose of paracetamol, which induced an analgesic effect, did not reduce PGE2 content in the brain. Besides, the antinociceptive profile of paracetamol was found to be different from that of the competitive COX inhibitor, ibuprofen, with no observed antinociceptive action of ibuprofen, in the first phase of the formalin test, despite the proposed shared MoA. Altogether, these results indicate that the analgesic action of paracetamol cannot be attributed to the inhibition of central COX, however data from the literature would suggest such an involvement. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of paracetamol on COX observed by some authors seems more closely related to its hypothermic/antipyretic effects than to its analgesic action.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Hydrocodone

Effects on the Central Nervous System

Hydrocodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Hydrocodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.

Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle

Hydrocodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

Effects on the Cardiovascular System

Hydrocodone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.

### Systematic review of systemic and neuraxial effects of acetaminophen in preclinical models of nociceptive processing [^117NrJ7h]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute and chronic pain imposes a burden on society, not only because of the associated human suffering, but also because of the cost of medical treatment, loss of productivity and disability payments, which has been estimated to be up to $650 billion per year in the United States alone. According to the recently posted National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pain Management fact sheet, pain affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. Opiates are widely used but are associated with a significant risk of addiction and diversion, while other types of analgesics [eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), antidepressants and anti-epileptics] are hampered by limited efficacy and varying side effects.

Acetaminophen, (also known generically as APAP or paracetamol) was synthesized by Morse in 1873 via the reduction of p-nitrophenol with tin in glacial acetic acid. It was then discovered as a metabolite of phenacetin in the 1890s. It is a small molecule (151 Da). Its commercial development occurred in the United States in the 1950s. Here, the product went on sale in the United States in 1955 under the brand name "Tylenol".

Unlike opioid analgesics, it was early appreciated that acetaminophen does not generate euphoria or mood alteration. It has, over decades of use, been appreciated to be without risks of sedation, addiction, dependence, tolerance and withdrawal when administered alone. The principal limitation is that in large amounts over time, acetaminophen can result in the formation of hepatotoxic metabolites. Its general tolerability, lack of abuse potential and, as discussed below, efficacy has led to its appreciation as a therapeutic with an important role in pain management. As such, it is one of the most commonly employed analgesic molecules with over 25 billion doses delivered annually in the US alone. In spite of its widespread use, its mechanisms of action remain controversial.

This narrative review looks to consider issues related to site and mechanism of action. It is organized into three parts: 1) an overview of the clinical efficacy of acetaminophen; 2) a review of the effects of acetaminophen in animal models of acute nociception, after tissue injury and nerve injury following per os (PO), intravenous (IV), intrathecal (IT), intracerebroventricular (ICV) and peripheral routes of delivery; and 3) a summary of mechanisms by which acetaminophen (and/or its metabolites) exert its analgesic actions.

### Use of analgesics / antipyretics in the management of symptoms associated with COVID-19 vaccination [^111tgNMg]. NPJ Vaccines (2022). Medium credibility.

Effect of analgesic and antipyretic medicines on immune responses to vaccination

Although analgesics and antipyretics are not indicated for prophylactic use, they can be administered at the time of vaccination to prevent side effects or therapeutically following side-effect onset. A limited number of studies have evaluated the effect of analgesics/antipyretics on immunogenicity. However, these studies have been limited to either specific age groups of the population or specific vaccines. As COVID-19 vaccination is being applied universally and eventually to all age groups, we undertook a more expansive review of the literature on acetaminophen and NSAIDs and their effects on vaccination.

Acetaminophen (Paracetamol)

Despite its widespread use for many years, the mechanism(s) of action of acetaminophen remain(s) unclear. The drug may exert its therapeutic effects through inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 and −2 and the subsequent decrease of prostaglandin synthesis, although other mechanisms have been suggested. Both COX-2 activation and prostaglandin production are important in innate immune response signaling. Activated T and B cells express COX-2 and produce prostaglandins. A small number of randomized controlled trials with several different vaccines have investigated the effects of prophylactic or therapeutic acetaminophen on vaccine responses in pediatric – and adult populations, with conflicting results (Table 1).

Table 1

At booster vaccination, the same dose was given to infants weighing between 7 kg and less than 9 kg and those with bodyweight of 9 kg or greater received four administrations of 125 mg acetaminophen each within 24 h (≤ 55.6 mg/kg/24 h).

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen (combogesic) [^111qPiaK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Analgesia

COMBOGESIC contains acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic. The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to primarily involve central actions. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Its mechanism of action for analgesia, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ibuprofen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Hematological Effects

NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.

Absorption

Peak plasma concentration following the administration of three COMBOGESIC tablets occurs at approximately 45 minutes and 1 hour 15 minutes after administration for acetaminophen and ibuprofen, respectively, under fasting condition. In the same study, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the extent of absorption (AUC0-inf) are 14.88 mcg/mL and 47.44 mcg.h/mL for acetaminophen and 25.58 mcg/mL and 95.62 mcg.h/mL for ibuprofen, respectively. The Cmaxand AUC0-infvalues for both acetaminophen and ibuprofen increase dose proportionally to increases in COMBOGESIC doses from one, to two, to three tablets. A single-dose pharmacokinetic study of COMBOGESIC in volunteers showed no drug interactions between acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

Food effects

When COMBOGESIC was administered with food, the time to peak plasma concentration was delayed by approximately 30 minutes for acetaminophen and was approximately the same when compared to fasting conditions for ibuprofen. The peak plasma concentration of acetaminophen was reduced by approximately 30%, but the extent of absorption was not affected. Peak plasma concentration and the extent of absorption were not affected for ibuprofen.

Distribution

Acetaminophen appears to be widely distributed throughout most body tissues except fat. Its apparent volume of distribution is about 0.9 L/kg. A relatively small portion (~20%) of acetaminophen is bound to plasma protein.

### Drug-induced liver injury: advances in mechanistic understanding that will inform risk management [^112dTc6b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major public health problem. Intrinsic (dose-dependent) DILI associated with acetaminophen overdose is the number one cause of acute liver failure in the US. However, the most problematic type of DILI impacting drug development is idiosyncratic, occurring only very rarely among treated patients and often only after several weeks or months of treatment with the offending drug. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of DILI suggest that three mechanisms may underlie most hepatocyte effects in response to both intrinsic and idiosyncratic DILI drugs: mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alterations in bile acid homeostasis. However, in some cases hepatocyte stress promotes an immune response that results in clinically important idiosyncratic DILI. This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of both intrinsic and idiosyncratic DILI as well as emerging tools and techniques that will likely improve DILI risk identification and management.

### Systematic review of systemic and neuraxial effects of acetaminophen in preclinical models of nociceptive processing [^116VNUxH]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points Regarding Human Action of Acetaminophen

Four clinical observations are of potential significance as to the activity and mechanisms of action of acetaminophen:

1) CSF sampling after acetaminophen reveal high levels within 10 min after an IV delivery with peak concentrations being lower and delayed after PO administration.

2) Acetaminophen reduced the areas of secondary hyperalgesia to pinprick and touch otherwise observed after peripheral electrical stimulation. These results suggest an effect independent of the presence of peripheral injury/inflammation leading to a hyperalgesic state and suggest an effect upon central processes underlying sensitization.

3) Importantly, brain imaging has further confirmed the effects of analgesic doses of acetaminophen on brain responses to aversive stimulation. Human studies with fMRI have revealed that acetaminophen reduces the response to noxious thermal stimulation as compared to placebo in prefrontal cortices, insula, thalami, anterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray matter, leading to the suggestion of an inhibitory effect of acetaminophen on spinothalamic outflow. Similarly, in subjects with knee osteoarthritis, acetaminophen reduced blood oxygenation level dependent signal activation in the sensory cortex and supramarginal gyrus, prefrontal and frontal cortex, and insula. Thus, while acetaminophen efficacy has been questioned in the management of osteoarthritis pain, it is clear that it has state dependent effects upon neuraxial processing.

4) Systematic analysis of plasma levels after acetaminophen dosing and the magnitude of the opioid sparing effects in postoperative pain point to a ceiling effect of the effect of even IV acetaminophen on postoperative pain.

5) While acetaminophen has minimal effects other than altering nociception, recent work has suggested that, in addition, acetaminophen may have broader psychological effects. Thus, acetaminophen has been shown to reduce affective responses to both negative and positive emotional imagesand reduced the neural responses associated with experiences of acute applic pain.

Mechanisms of Acetaminophen Action

Metabolism

Acetaminophen (pKa: 9.5) at physiological pH is essentially neutral and is rapidly absorbed after PO delivery. In humans, blood half-life ranges from 1.5–3 h at therapeutic half-lives to 8 h at dose up to 4 g/day. Similarly, in the rat half-lives are dose dependent and range from approximately 15 min at low doses and up to 120 min after high (therapeutic) doses (300 mg/kg). In all species, elimination largely occurs in the liver, where the majority of the drug undergoes conjugation catalyzed by a variety of transferases and then excretion in urine. The formation of toxic metabolites, such as N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), occurs secondary to this sequence. More recently it has been shown that acetaminophen, following deacetylation to its primary amine (4-aminophenol), is conjugated with arachidonic acid through the actions of fatty acid amide hydrolase in the brain and spinal cord to form a variety of biologically active molecules. This will be discussed further below.

Mechanisms of Analgesic Action

A number of mechanisms have been hypothesized for the actions of acetaminophen in modulating pain transmission. Broadly speaking, these effects can be considered in terms of an effect of the drug itself or an action mediated by a metabolite. In the human, acetaminophen is known to be metabolized in the liver into p-aminophenol and then converted to N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-arachidonamide (AM404) via fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and into N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. While this conversion typically occurs in the liver, recent work has shown that acetaminophen can be converted into the AM404 metabolite within the neuraxis.

Membrane Target

Measurement of acetaminophen levels in the brain revealed significant tissue/blood ratios that were essentially the same across the brain. Quantitative autoradiography has failed to demonstrate that acetaminophen binds specifically to any area of the murine brain or spinal cord. Competition studies with a variety of targets failed to show interactions with a variety of monoamine receptors or opioid receptors.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^115Nhn2r]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

AM404: The Active Metabolite of Paracetamol

Research experiments have shown that the analgesic MoA of paracetamol is primarily COX-independent and mediated by the formation of the bioactive AM404 metabolite in the CNS, highlighting that paracetamol is a pro-drug of a potent analgesic metabolite. The first description of the central conversion of paracetamol was reported in 2005. In this report, Högestätt et al demonstrated that the deacetylated form of paracetamol, the p -aminophenol, is converted mainly in the brain to AM404 by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme (Figure 1). These findings were then supported by Muramatsu et al's experiment. The first human evidence of central conversion of paracetamol to AM404 was demonstrated by Sharma et al in 2017; 26 patients received 1g of paracetamol, followed by measurement of the AM404 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. The study detected AM404 in the CSF of 17 patients, confirming the central conversion of paracetamol to the bioactive AM404 in humans.

Figure 1
Schematic representation of the central mechanism of action of paracetamol to its antinociceptive activity. Paracetamol is deacetylated in p -aminophenol in the liver, then metabolized in the brain by FAAH into AM404. AM404 activates the TRPV1 channel‐mGlu5 receptor‐PLC‐DAGL‐CB1 pathway and co-activates the Cav 3.2 T-type calcium channel, which in turn reinforces the activity of the descending serotonergic pathways.

Importantly, it has been shown that 1) centrally injected AM404 induced analgesia, and 2) the inhibition of FAAH (genetically and pharmacologically) suppressed the analgesic effect of paracetamol (and p -aminophenol), demonstrating the involvement of AM404 as the active metabolite in the analgesic effect of paracetamol. In the setting of nociceptive pain, Dalmann et al observed the loss of paracetamol analgesic effect after supra-spinal administration of a FAAH inhibitor, which did not occur after peripheral FAAH inhibitor injection. This demonstrated that the FAAH-synthetized AM404 formation occurs mainly at supra-spinal level, even if a study evoked a spinal level.

### Advanced preclinical models for evaluation of drug-induced liver injury-consensus statement by the European drug-induced liver injury network [PRO-EURO-DILI-NET] [^112wL1Vz]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major cause of acute liver failure (ALF) and one of the leading indications for liver transplantation in Western societies. Given the wide use of both prescribed and over the counter drugs, DILI has become a major health issue for which there is a pressing need to find novel and effective therapies. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DILI, our incomplete knowledge of its pathogenesis and inability to predict DILI is largely due to both discordance between human and animal DILI in preclinical drug development and a lack of models that faithfully recapitulate complex pathophysiological features of human DILI. This is exemplified by the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, a major cause of ALF because of its extensive worldwide use as an analgesic. Despite intensive efforts utilising current animal and in vitro models, the mechanisms involved in the hepatotoxicity of APAP are still not fully understood. In this expert Consensus Statement, which is endorsed by the European Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, we aim to facilitate and outline clinically impactful discoveries by detailing the requirements for more realistic human-based systems to assess hepatotoxicity and guide future drug safety testing. We present novel insights and discuss major players in APAP pathophysiology, and describe emerging in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical models, as well as advanced imaging and in silico technologies, which may improve prediction of clinical outcomes of DILI.

### Systematic review of systemic and neuraxial effects of acetaminophen in preclinical models of nociceptive processing [^112vnuZW]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) in humans has robust effects with a high therapeutic index in altering postoperative and inflammatory pain states in clinical and experimental pain paradigms with no known abuse potential. This review considers the literature reflecting the preclinical actions of acetaminophen in a variety of pain models. Significant observations arising from this review are as follows: 1) acetaminophen has little effect upon acute nociceptive thresholds; 2) acetaminophen robustly reduces facilitated states as generated by mechanical and thermal hyperalgesic end points in mouse and rat models of carrageenan and complete Freund's adjuvant evoked inflammation; 3) an antihyperalgesic effect is observed in models of facilitated processing with minimal inflammation (eg, phase II intraplantar formalin); and 4) potent anti-hyperpathic effects on the thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical and cold allodynia, allodynic thresholds in rat and mouse models of polyneuropathy and mononeuropathies and bone cancer pain. These results reflect a surprisingly robust drug effect upon a variety of facilitated states that clearly translate into a wide range of efficacy in preclinical models and to important end points in human therapy. The specific systems upon which acetaminophen may act based on targeted delivery suggest both a spinal and a supraspinal action. Review of current targets for this molecule excludes a role of cyclooxygenase inhibitor but includes effects that may be mediated through metabolites acting on the TRPV1 channel, or by effect upon cannabinoid and serotonin signaling. These findings suggest that the mode of action of acetaminophen, a drug with a long therapeutic history of utilization, has surprisingly robust effects on a variety of pain states in clinical patients and in preclinical models with a good therapeutic index, but in spite of its extensive use, its mechanisms of action are yet poorly understood.

### Paracetamol use during pregnancy-a call for precautionary action [^117WbMz4]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

We call for precautionary action

In this Consensus Statement, we summarize research showing adverse neurological, urogenital and reproductive outcomes associated with maternal and perinatal use of APAP. Based on this experimental and epidemiological literature (Supplementary Tables 1–4), we believe the potential for harm from continued inaction exceeds the harm that might arise from precautionary action. We recognize the limitations of the existing epidemiological literature and the need for rigorous meta-analyses (Supplementary Table 5) and therefore we call for a focused research effort. This effort should include the initiation of epidemiological and experimental studies to understand the hormonal, epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms by which APAP acts and might adversely affect development. Epidemiological studies should be designed specifically with the following goals in mind:
Human epidemiological studies on APAP use in pregnancy should be designed to reduce confounding by indication for use.
Human epidemiological studies on APAP use in pregnancy should be designed to control for genetic factors.
Human epidemiological studies on APAP use in pregnancy should be designed to accurately capture exposure and outcome.
Human epidemiological studies on APAP should be designed to examine timing, dosage and duration of exposure both prenatally and postnatally.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen injection (Combogesic iv) [^116XkkYb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

COMBOGESIC IV contains acetaminophen and ibuprofen as active drug substances.

Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic. The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to primarily involve central actions. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Its mechanism of action for analgesia, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ibuprofen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Hematological Effects

NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic profile of the intravenous formulation is dose proportional following the administration of a half dose and a full dose of COMBOGESIC IV.

The maximum concentration (Cmax) occurs at the end of the 15-min intravenous infusion of COMBOGESIC IV. While overall exposures (area under the concentration time curve [AUC]) were similar following a single dose of COMBOGESIC IV compared to the same dose given orally, the Cmaxof the intravenous formulation was twice that of the oral formulation. As expected, the Tmaxfollowing intravenous administration was achieved much faster (in 15 minutes) than with the oral formulation. The mean Cmaxand AUC0-infof COMBOGESIC IV following administration of a single intravenous dose of 1,000 mg acetaminophen and 300 mg ibuprofen in adults were 34.30 mcg/mL and 56.48 mcg.h/mL for acetaminophen and 48.12 mcg/mL and 102.82 mcg.h/mL for ibuprofen, respectively.

A single-dose pharmacokinetic study of COMBOGESIC IV in healthy volunteers showed no drug interactions between acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

Distribution

Acetaminophen appears to be widely distributed throughout most body tissues except fat. Its apparent volume of distribution is about 0.9 L/kg. A relative small portion (~20%) of acetaminophen is bound to plasma protein.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^11581yr4]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act via inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, were discovered more than 100 years ago. They remain a key component of the pharmacological management of acute and chronic pain. The COX-1 and COX-2 isozymes have different biological functions; analgesic activity is primarily (although not exclusively) associated with inhibition of COX-2, while different side effects result from the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2. All available NSAIDs, including acetaminophen and aspirin, are associated with potential side effects, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects, related to their relative selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2. Since all NSAIDs exert their therapeutic activity through inhibition of the COX isozymes, strategies are needed to reduce the risks associated with NSAIDs while achieving sufficient pain relief. A better understanding of the inhibitory activity and COX-1/COX-2 selectivity of an NSAID at therapeutic doses, based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties (eg, inhibitory dose, absorption, plasma versus tissue distribution, and elimination), and the impact on drug tolerability and safety can guide the selection of appropriate NSAIDs for pain management. For example, many NSAIDs with moderate to high selectivity for COX-2 versus COX-1 can be administered at doses that maximize efficacy (~80% inhibition of COX-2) while minimizing COX-1 inhibition and associated side effects, such as gastrointestinal toxicity. Acidic NSAIDs with favorable tissue distribution and short plasma half-lives can additionally be dosed to provide near-constant analgesia while minimizing plasma concentrations to permit recovery of COX-mediated prostaglandin production in the vascular wall and other organs. Each patient's clinical background, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be taken into account when selecting appropriate NSAIDs. New methods are emerging to assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate NSAIDs and their doses/schedules, such as biomarkers that may predict the response to NSAID treatment in individual patients.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^114Mqfmd]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Acetaminophen for low back pain — Evidence summaries report no demonstrated benefit and potential harm, leading the Work Group to suggest against its use. A large systematic review (SR) found no difference between acetaminophen and placebo for acute low back pain (LBP) outcomes through 12 weeks, and a second SR found it was no more effective than placebo for pain or function through three weeks; for chronic LBP, evidence was insufficient versus NSAIDs or other interventions. Over half of the 2,000 annual U.S. acute liver failure cases are due to acetaminophen toxicity, and it is the most frequent cause of acute liver injury. As no benefits were shown, the Work Group suggested against the use of acetaminophen and decided upon a Weak against recommendation as a Reviewed, New-replaced recommendation with low confidence in the quality of evidence; other options, such as NSAIDs, can be offered when benefits outweigh harms.

### Paracetamol (acetaminophen): mechanisms of action [^115F7ZEE]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Paracetamol has a central analgesic effect that is mediated through activation of descending serotonergic pathways. Debate exists about its primary site of action, which may be inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis or through an active metabolite influencing cannabinoid receptors. Prostaglandin H(2) synthetase (PGHS) is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of arachidonic acid to the unstable PGH(2). The two major forms of this enzyme are the constitutive PGHS-1 and the inducible PGHS-2. PGHS comprises of two sites: a cyclooxygenase (COX) site and a peroxidase (POX) site. The conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG(2) is dependent on a tyrosine-385 radical at the COX site. Formation of a ferryl protoporphyrin IX radical cation from the reducing agent Fe(3+) at the POX site is essential for conversion of tyrosine-385 to its radical form. Paracetamol acts as a reducing cosubstrate on the POX site and lessens availability of the ferryl protoporphyrin IX radical cation. This effect can be reduced in the presence of hydroperoxide-generating lipoxygenase enzymes within the cell (peroxide tone) or by swamping the POX site with substrate such as PGG(2). Peroxide tone and swamping explain lack of peripheral analgesic effect, platelet effect, and anti-inflammatory effect by paracetamol. Alternatively, paracetamol effects may be mediated by an active metabolite (p-aminophenol). p-Aminophenol is conjugated with arachidonic acid by fatty acid amide hydrolase to form AM404. AM404 exerts effect through cannabinoid receptors. It may also work through PGHS, particularly in areas of the brain with high concentrations of fatty acid amide hydrolase.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate, acetaminophen (Hydrocodone / apap) [^113WQqaU]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, opioids may produce drowsiness, changes in mood and mental clouding.

The analgesic action of acetaminophen involves peripheral influences, but the specific mechanism is as yet undetermined. Antipyretic activity is mediated through hypothalamic heat regulating centers. Acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthetase. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen have negligible effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems; however, toxic doses may cause circulatory failure and rapid, shallow breathing.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^1169xt8Y]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for trauma pain management — properties, dosing, formulations, and cautions: Acetaminophen (APAP) is a commonly used analgesic and antipyretic, although its exact mechanism of action for pain management remains unknown, and it offers several advantages, including numerous routes of administration, ease of access, and relatively few adverse effects. The addition of APAP to traditional opioid therapy consistently demonstrates decreased morphine requirements, and scheduled dosing is ideal. Intravenous APAP is commonly used in several countries as the only postoperative analgesic; however, many U.S. hospitals do not include it in their inpatient formularies because of the drug's high cost and similar analgesic effects between scheduled intravenous and oral therapy. Intravenous APAP is generally well-tolerated and effective in most patients, but hypotension has been reported in some patients. Recognize that the liquid oral formulation of APAP contains sorbitol and can cause diarrhea in some patients. Avoid APAP in patients with acute liver failure, and use reduced doses in older adults and patients with chronic liver disease.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^1167va5x]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

In Cav3.2 knockout mice, the analgesic effect of the TRPV 1 agonist (capsaicin) was diminished, despite the analgesic action of an inhibitor of Cav3 channels (TTA-A2) persisted in TRPV 1 knockout mice suggesting that Cav3.2 and TRPV 1 support paracetamol's analgesic activity sequentially, Cav3.2 acting downstream of TRPV 1.

In the setting of paracetamol injection, CB1 knockout models or mice pretreated with selective CB1 antagonists showed no analgesic response to paracetamol. The expected synergism between paracetamol and opiates was also attenuated in mice pretreated with selective CB1 antagonist. Notably, two previous reports showed that paracetamol injection did not alter the brain endocannabinoid content, suggesting that other studies are needed to know how CB1 receptors are involved. Recently, periaqueductal grey-located CB1 receptors were found to be essential for the MoA of paracetamol through a AM404-activated TRPV 1 channel‐mGlu5 receptor‐PLC‐DAGL‐CB1 receptor signaling.

Serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine are engaged in pathways of physiological nociception, both of which can be produced via descending pain pathways to alter nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord. Serotonin appears to have both inhibitory and facilitative effects on pain. The involvement of the serotonergic pathway in the analgesic effect of paracetamol was described even before the 2005 work by Högestätt et al. Earlier reports described the pharmacological blockade of the serotonergic pathway decreased the antinociceptive effect of paracetamol. The involvement of the serotonergic pathway in paracetamol action was reported to stem from increasing 5-TH levels in the central structures and activating the spinal 5-TH receptors. Nonetheless, the evidence was not conclusive regarding the contribution of serotonergic receptors to the paracetamol action. As an example, the involvement of 5-HT3 receptors has been discussed in humans, and experimental work in rodents with 5-HT3 receptor antisense oligonucleotides showed that they were not involved in the analgesic effect of paracetamol, while a tropisetron-sensitive receptor was. However, investigations showed that p -aminophenol analgesic action was mediated by the bulbospinal serotonergic system, which may suggest an involvement of this serotonergic system in the AM404 antinociceptive activity, as recently suggested. Finally, if bulbospinal serotoninergic pathways seem to be involved in the analgesic effect of paracetamol or its metabolites, the exact nature of the spinal tropisetron-sensitive receptor involved in this effect remains to be elucidated.

Altogether, the data collected draw the schematic MoA represented in Figure 1.

### Stimulating the development of mechanism-based, individualized pain therapies [^116CR352]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2007). Medium credibility.

Biomedical science has greatly improved our understanding of pain in recent decades, but few novel molecular entities that address fundamentally new pain mechanisms have entered the clinic, despite dramatically increased pharmaceutical investment. Indeed, virtually all new analgesics approved over the past 25 years are derivatives or reformulations of opioids or aspirin-like drugs, existing drugs given for a new indication or older drugs given by a different route of administration. Here, we discuss factors contributing to this lack of innovation in therapies for pain and advocate public-private partnerships (PPPs) to translate new knowledge into more efficacious and safer treatments.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^116gyWFt]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

AM404-Modulated Molecular Targets

TRPV 1 Channels

AM404 is a potent activator of TRPV 1, a major contributor to neuronal response to pain. Contrary to the periphery, where activated TRPV 1 induces nociception, hyperalgesia, and pain transduction modulation, supraspinal TRPV 1 activation induces anti-nociception. In Zygmunt et al's patch-clamp experiment, AM404 activated the vanilloid receptor TRPV 1, an effect that was suppressed after administration of the TRPV 1 antagonist, capsazepine. Besides, experiments showed diminished analgesic action of paracetamol and p -aminophenol in TRPV 1 knockout mice and mice pretreated with capsazepine. Notably, a recent report by Barrière et aldemonstrated that paracetamol reduced the connectivity of brain structures in the pain pathway, particularly the periaqueductal grey, where local blockade of TRPV1 suppressed the analgesic action of paracetamol, this confirms a fully TRPV1-dependent mechanism and thus tends to exclude a mechanism involving central COX. As a confirmation of the role of TRPV1 in humans, Pickering et al demonstrated the involvement of a specific TRPV1 rs224534 variant in paracetamol antinociception in healthy volunteers.

Downstream Targets of TRPV 1

The T-type calcium Cav3.2 isoform regulates the neuronal response to pain. Cav3.2 knockout models and mice pretreated with Cav3.2 blockers showed impaired nociceptive response to pain stimuli. Previous reports indicated that the antinociceptive action of arachidonic compounds involves inhibition of Cav3.2 channels, suggesting a potential interaction between Cav3.2 and AM404. In 2014, Kerckhove et al demonstrated that Cav3.2 knockout mice had impaired response to the analgesic effect of a systemic administration of paracetamol or intracerebroventricular injection of AM404. Interestingly, an experiment aimed to establish the location of Cav3.2 involved in the analgesic effect of paracetamol found that, contrary to supra-spinal channels, spinal Cav3.2 blockade did not affect the analgesic profile of paracetamol, highlighting that the involvement of Cav3.2 in the analgesic activity of paracetamol is mainly supra-spinal.

### Postoperative pain management in enhanced recovery pathways [^114x1Nht]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-Opioid Medications

Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen is a cornerstone of multimodal postoperative pain treatment in ERPs. Its analgesic effect is thought to be primarily mediated through inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway, though the exact mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. A single dose of acetaminophen has been shown to provide 50% pain relief for four hours in about half of patients experiencing moderate-to-severe acute postoperative pain. Use of acetaminophen in conjunction with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can have an additive or even synergistic analgesic effect. In addition, acetaminophen use has been associated with reduced opioid requirements during the postoperative period.ERPs generally recommend that acetaminophen be given on a scheduled basis as this leads to more consistent dosing and is associated with decreased opioid use. While intravenous acetaminophen is associated with more favorable pharmacokinetics including faster onset and higher plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels compared to oral and rectal acetaminophen, it does not provide a clear benefit with regard to analgesic efficacy and patient outcomes. Therefore, use of oral acetaminophen is generally preferred in patients that are able to tolerate oral intake while intravenous acetaminophen is useful in patients who are unable to tolerate oral intake or have impaired gastrointestinal tract function. Overall, acetaminophen is well-tolerated with its most concerning adverse effect being hepatotoxicity at higher doses and in patients with liver insufficiency. Given its favorable safety profile and the strong evidence supporting its use for postoperative pain treatment, almost all ERPs will recommend the routine use of acetaminophen in postoperative analgesia regimens.

The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, narcotics may produce drowsiness, changes in mood and mental clouding.

Acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthetase. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen have negligible effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems; however, toxic doses may cause circulatory failure and rapid, shallow breathing.

Pharmacokinetics

The behavior of the individual components is described below.

Following a 10 mg oral dose of hydrocodone administered to five adult male subjects, the mean peak concentration was 23.6 ± 5.2 ng/mL. Maximum serum levels were achieved at 1.3 ± 0.3 hours and the half-life was determined to be 3.8 ± 0.3 hours. Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism including O-demethylation, N-demethylation and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-α- and 6-β-hydroxymetabolites. See for toxicity information. Hydrocodone OVERDOSAGE

Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by liver damage and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug. See for toxicity information. Acetaminophen

### Pain and osteoarthritis: new drugs and mechanisms [^115Sfhs1]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the recent literature on drugs used for symptomatic pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) as well as potential mechanisms underlying their pharmacologic action.

Recent Findings

Recent research has shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of prostaglandins to pain sensation. Moreover, the role of the enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in inflammation and subsequent structural changes of joints has been clarified. Based on the COX-1/COX-2 hypothesis, various selective COX-2 inhibitors with improved gastrointestinal tolerability as compared with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been established for the symptomatic treatment of OA in recent years. Rational therapy with these compounds should be based on their diverse pharmacokinetic characteristics. Among the traditional NSAIDs, the mode of action of aceclofenac has been recently clarified in that the compound was shown to elicit preferential inhibition of COX-2 as a result of limited but sustained biotransformation to diclofenac. Novel mechanisms have also been proposed to account for the action of acetaminophen. Finally, there is evidence from animal models to suggest that the dual LOX/COX inhibitor licofelone may stop disease progression in OA. Clinical studies are under way to establish this compound for treatment of OA.

Summary

It is anticipated that new insights into the pathophysiology of OA as well as novel therapeutics will improve the pharmacologic options in OA.

### Is acetaminophen safe in pregnancy? [^115H8fQE]. Scandinavian Journal of Pain (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) — acetaminophen use in pregnancy — is affirmed as safe, stating that acetaminophen is safe and effective when taken as intended and, because of its safety profile and absence of teratogenic effects, it has been considered the medication of choice for fever and pain relief during pregnancy. ACMT affirms the safety of acetaminophen in pregnancy and calls for an evidence-based approach to the search for causes and treatment of autism. Regarding autism risk, multiple studies have investigated the association between acetaminophen and autism but have failed to find a causal effect, and larger, more sophisticated studies, including a study of siblings in the same family, demonstrated no increased risk in children exposed to acetaminophen. The statement cautions that raising concerns about acetaminophen use in pregnancy without strong supporting evidence may discourage care for maternal fever, which is known to pose significant fetal risk on its own, and notes that untreated maternal pain can also lead to morbidity. It further warns that patients may turn to alternatives such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and opioids, both of which can clearly cause harm to the developing fetus and newborn.

### Tramadol / paracetamol fixed-dose combination in the treatment of moderate to severe pain [^112cY8Jc]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common reason patients seek medical attention and pain relief has been put forward as an ethical obligation of clinicians and a fundamental human right. However, pain management is challenging because the pathophysiology of pain is complex and not completely understood. Widely used analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have been associated with adverse events. Adverse event rates are of concern, especially in long-term treatment or at high doses. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are available by prescription, over the counter, and in combination preparations. Patients may be unaware of the risk associated with high dosages or long-term use of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Clinicians should encourage patients to disclose all medications they take in a "do ask, do tell" approach that includes patient education about the risks and benefits of common pain relievers. The ideal pain reliever would have few risks and enhanced analgesic efficacy. Fixed-dose combination analgesics with two or more agents may offer additive or synergistic benefits to treat the multiple mechanisms of pain. Therefore, pain may be effectively treated while toxicity is reduced due to lower doses. One recent fixed-dose combination analgesic product combines tramadol, a centrally acting weak opioid analgesic, with low-dose paracetamol. Evidence-based guidelines recognize the potential value of combination analgesics in specific situations. The current guideline-based paradigm for pain treatment recommends NSAIDs for ongoing use with analgesics such as opioids to manage flares. However, the treatment model should evolve how to use low-dose combination products to manage pain with occasional use of NSAIDs for flares to avoid long-term and high-dose treatment with these analgesics. A next step in pain management guidelines should be targeted therapy when possible, or low-dose combination therapy or both, to achieve maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity.

### Acetaminophen reinforces descending inhibitory pain pathways [^11485aHk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The mechanism of the analgesic action of acetaminophen involves the serotonergic system. This study explores how acetaminophen interferes with serotonergic descending pain pathways. Eighteen rapid metabolizers of tropisetron were included in this double-blind cross-over study. After ethical approval, the healthy volunteers took 1 g oral acetaminophen (A) or placebo (p) combined with either the 5-HT3 antagonist tropisetron (T) (5 mg) or saline, intravenously, at weekly intervals. Mechanical pain thresholds, determined before and after a cold pressor test (CPT), were repeated seven times during the three post-dosing hours, and area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) of the three treatments were compared. After CPT, AUC (%*min) of Ap (1,561 ± 429) was larger than before CPT (393 ± 382, P < 0.05); these effects were totally inhibited by tropisetron. Acetaminophen reinforces descending inhibitory pain pathways; it suggests a supraspinal target for acetaminophen's antinociceptive action. This study also confirmed that there is a central serotonergic mechanism of action for acetaminophen that is not stimulus-dependent.

Therapeutic management of pain

Evolution of analgesics

In the wake of increased understanding of the pathophysiology of pain, various receptors have been identified as potential targets for drug therapy over the years. In the early 1970s, Vane et alproposed the involvement of prostaglandin inhibition as the mechanism of action of aspirin-like drugs. These findings paved the path for development of NSAIDs, targeting the COX-1 enzyme system involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, thereby reducing both pain and associated inflammation. The earliest known marketed NSAIDs were ibuprofen and aspirin, which were followed up by similar compounds, with varying efficacies. Acetaminophen, the safest analgesic till date was developed in 1946, after two synthetic antipyretics, acetanilide and phenacetin, were developed and had significant associated toxicities. In the search for a more effective and safer analgesic, research was focused on the development of the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. However, there were severe concerns of cardiac toxicities observed with these agents, limiting their use.

### Tropisetron blocks analgesic action of acetaminophen: a human pain model study [^112BbMKV]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Because the mechanism underlying the analgesic action of acetaminophen remains unclear, we investigated the possible interaction of acetaminophen with central serotonergic pathways. The effects of acetaminophen, tropisetron, the combination of both drugs, and saline on pain perception and central sensitization in healthy volunteers were compared. Sixteen healthy volunteers were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Intracutaneous electrical stimulation (46.1 ± 19.1 mA) induced acute pain (numeric rating scale, 6 of 10) and stable areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia. Pain intensities and areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia were regularly assessed before, during, and after a 15-min infusion of acetaminophen, tropisetron, the combination of both drugs, and saline. Acetaminophen concentrations were measured to rule out any pharmacokinetic interaction. Both acetaminophen and tropisetron led to decreased pain ratings as compared to saline. However, when acetaminophen and tropisetron were administered simultaneously, the pain ratings were not affected. There was no significant difference in the evolution of the hyperalgesic and allodynic areas during the study period between the study groups (P = 0.06 and P = 0.33, respectively). Acetaminophen serum levels were not significantly different when associated with tropisetron (P = 0.063), although we observed a trend toward lower acetaminophen concentrations when both drugs were concurrently administered. In summary, while the combination of acetaminophen and tropisetron showed no analgesic action, each drug administered alone led to decreased pain ratings as compared to saline. In an electrically evoked human pain model, the combination of acetaminophen with tropisetron was free of any analgesic potential. However, when administered on its own, both acetaminophen and tropisetron were mildly analgesic.

Multimodal analgesia incorporates the use of analgesic adjuncts with different mechanisms of action to enhance postoperative pain management. Acetaminophen, anti-inflammatories, and gabapentinoids provide effective analgesia while reducing opioid requirements and opioid-related side effects. Intrathecal morphine and periarticular local anesthetic infiltration further enhance dynamic analgesia and improve postoperative mobilization. Epidural analgesia, peripheral nerve blocks, tramadol, ketamine, and/or clonidine can be added for improved benefit in opioid-tolerant individuals.

Acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthetase. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen have negligible effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems; however, toxic doses may cause circulatory failure and rapid, shallow breathing.

Pharmacokinetics – The behavior of the individual components is described below.

Hydrocodone – Following a 10 mg oral dose of hydrocodone administered to five adult male subjects, the mean peak concentration was 23.6 ± 5.2 ng/mL. Maximum serum levels were achieved at 1.3 ± 0.3 hours and the half-life was determined to be 3.8 ± 0.3 hours. Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism including O-demethylation, N-demethylation and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-α- and 6-β-hydroxy-metabolites (see OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information).

Acetaminophen – Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by liver damage and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug (see OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information).

### Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet function by acetaminophen in healthy volunteers [^115mCBkk]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is widely used for postoperative analgesia. Its mechanism of action is inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system, and acetaminophen is traditionally not considered to influence platelet function. The authors studied the dose-dependent inhibition of platelet function by acetaminophen in healthy volunteers.

Methods

Thirteen healthy male volunteers (aged 19–26 yr) were given placebo or 15, 22.5, or 30 mg/kg acetaminophen intravenously in a double-blind, crossover study. Ten and 90 min after infusion, platelet function was assessed by photometric aggregometry and by measuring release of thromboxane B2, analgesia by cold pressor test, and plasma acetaminophen concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Results

When triggered with 500 microm arachidonic acid, median platelet aggregation (area under the curve) was 25.7, 22.8, 4.1, or 3.6 x 10 area units (P < 0.001) 10 min after placebo or 15, 22.5, or 30 mg/kg acetaminophen, respectively. An increasing concentration of arachidonic acid attenuated the antiaggregatory effect. After 90 min, platelet function was recovering. Release of thromboxane B2 was also dose-dependently inhibited by acetaminophen. Although plasma concentration of acetaminophen increased linearly with the dose, no analgesic effect was detected in the cold pressor test.

Conclusions

Acetaminophen, which is a weak inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase 1, has a dose-dependent antiaggregatory effect. This property may become clinically significant in patients with intrinsic or drug-induced impairment of hemostasis.

### Medication safety: does intravenous acetaminophen promote perioperative hypothermia for total hip arthroplasty? [^111WjDCE]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

As an effective antipyretic with a yet-unknown mechanism-of-action, intravenous (IV) acetaminophen use for total hip arthroplasties (THA) may worsen perioperative hypothermia when combined with the known hypothermia-inducing effects of general anesthesia (GA), affecting wound healing, recovery times, and patient satisfaction. This retrospective chart review of primary THA cases compared perioperative heat loss for patients who received IV acetaminophen with GA (group A, n = 74) to those receiving GA alone (group B, n = 197). All patients received forced-air warming blankets. Neuraxial anesthesia cases were excluded. No significant temperature differences existed between group A (-0.33°C, SD = 0.36) and group B (-0.30°C, SD = 0.34, P > 0.05). IV acetaminophen use for THA does not appear to promote hypothermia under general anesthesia.

### Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity and acute liver failure [^1116kRcR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity is a common consequence of acetaminophen overdose and may lead to acute liver failure (ALF). Currently acetaminophen is the most common cause of ALF in both United States and United Kingdom, with a trend to increasing incidence in the United States. N-acetylcysteine is the most effective drug to prevent progression to liver failure with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Liver transplantation is the only definitive therapy that will significantly increase the chances of survival for advanced ALF. This communication reviews current information regarding causes and management of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and ALF.

### The role of acetaminophen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis [^111EM5ZE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of osteoarthritis increase with advancing age. Management of osteoarthritis in older adults focuses on reducing pain and other symptoms, minimizing functional limitation and disability from the disease, and avoiding the side effects associated with pharmacologic therapy. This article first briefly reviews the clinical pharmacology of acetaminophen and then summarizes the evidence supporting the use of acetaminophen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis. We conclude that acetaminophen, when given at full doses of 4,000 mg/day, is more efficacious than placebo and has comparable efficacy to ibuprofen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who have mild to moderate pain. Thus, acetaminophen merits a trial as initial therapy based on its cost-effectiveness and safety profile relative to NSAIDs.

### Timing of ibuprofen use and bone mineral density adaptations to exercise training [^1168xFoS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Potential reasons for the smaller than expected BMD changes in the placebo-only group should be considered. One possibility is that because they did not receive any NSAID treatment, the physical discomforts that sometimes occur with vigorous exercise training may have caused them to reduce their physical activity level outside the exercise program. We think that this was unlikely because all participants were instructed to take acetaminophen if they had a need for analgesic therapy. This recommendation was based on the long-standing belief that, in contrast to NSAIDs, the mechanism by which acetaminophen relieves pain does not involve COX suppression. However, recent evidence suggests that acetaminophen does, indeed, act through COX-related mechanisms. To our knowledge, the effect of acetaminophen on the bone-formation response to loading has not been studied. However, if effects are similar to those of NSAIDs, and if the group on placebo-only therapy used more acetaminophen than the groups on ibuprofen, then this may have contributed to the small changes in BMD in the placebo group.

### Systematic review of systemic and neuraxial effects of acetaminophen in preclinical models of nociceptive processing [^11383Yjz]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Analgesic Efficacy of Acetaminophen in Humans

While acetaminophen is often times considered dismissively as a weak or minimally efficacious therapeutic, clinical studies often show that it compares favorably to other analgesic regimens in the management of a variety of pain states. Clinically, acetaminophen is available for oral, rectal and IV delivery. Not surprisingly, higher plasma concentrations are achieved with the shortest latency after IV delivery, and peak cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are significantly greater with IV administration than with PO.

Experimental Pain

The analgesic effects of acetaminophen have been studied in experimental pain models in humans. In double-blinded and placebo-controlled trials, electrical stimulation at high current densities induced spontaneous acute pain and distinct areas of hyperalgesia for painful mechanical stimuli (pinprick hyperalgesia). IV acetaminophen (650 mg), tramadol (75 mg) or a combination of both (325/37.5 mg, respectively) was administered. Tramadol led to a maximum pain reduction of 12% with negligible antihyperalgesic properties. In contrast, acetaminophen led to a similar pain reduction (10%), but surprisingly displayed a sustained antihyperalgesic effect.

Inflammatory and Postoperative Pain

PO doses of 1000 mg of acetaminophen are reported to result in modest, but statistically significant reductions in mild to moderate acute pain states with etiologies ranging from acute soft tissue injury (sprain), major surgeries, head ache, total hip or knee replacementsand hip or knee osteoarthritis. The use of IV acetaminophen has been reported to be well tolerated and efficacious in well-powered, prospective and retrospective trials and to result in significant decreases in postoperative morphine consumption and pain intensity after a variety of surgical interventions including orthopedic, dental, spinal fusion, abdominal laparoscopic interventions, post bariatric, C-section and hysterectomies, cardiac surgery, and head and neck cancer surgery. IV acetaminophen reduced the likelihood of readmission after 30 days following knee arthroscopy. This raises the possibility that the actions of acetaminophen reflect disease modifying actions that alter the transition from an acute to a chronic pain state hypothesized to reflect a role of innate/adaptive immune systems. Less promising results have also been reported, concerns of toxicity remainand the superiority of IV vs PO acetaminophen has been questioned.

### Variants of cyclooxygenase-1 and their roles in medicine [^111ZTC2V]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) and other analgesic/antipyretic drugs such as dipyrone have been postulated to act centrally through inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COXs). COX activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mammalian leukocytes, microglial cells, and platelets is inhibited by these drugs at physiological concentrations. Yet purified COX enzymes are poorly inhibited by acetaminophen, particularly under conditions of high oxidant tone and elevated substrate levels. This suggests the presence of cell-specific differences that govern COX inhibition by these drugs. COX-3, a variant of COX-1, has been found in canine brain and is inhibited by acetaminophen and dipyrone at physiological concentrations. Additionally, other new COX-1-derived proteins called PCOX have been identified that do not make prostaglandins but apparently bind heme and may have other enzymatic properties. Antibodies specific for these variants detect analogous proteins in human tissues. Expression of COX variants is postulated to be an integral part of the mechanism of action of analgesic/antipyretic drugs.

### Acetaminophen for the patent ductus arteriosus: has safety been adequately demonstrated? [^116vtnCG]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common cardiovascular condition diagnosed in premature infants. Acetaminophen was first proposed as a potential treatment for PDA in 2011. Since that time acetaminophen use among extremely preterm neonates has increased substantially. The limited available data demonstrate that acetaminophen reduces PDA without evident hepatotoxicity. These findings have led some to suggest that acetaminophen is a safe and effective therapy for PDA closure. However, the lack of apparent hepatoxicity is predictable. Acetaminophen induced cellular injury is due to CYP2E1 derived metabolites; and hepatocyte CYP2E1 expression is low in the fetal and neonatal period. Here, we review preclinical and clinical data that support the hypothesis that the lung, which expresses high levels of CYP2E1 during fetal and early postnatal development, may be particularly susceptible to acetaminophen induced toxicity. Despite these emerging data, the true potential pulmonary risks and benefits of acetaminophen for PDA closure are largely unknown. The available clinical studies in are marked by significant weakness including low sample sizes and minimal evaluation of extremely preterm infants who are typically at highest risk of pulmonary morbidity. We propose that studies interrogating mechanisms linking developmentally regulated, cell-specific CYP2E1 expression and acetaminophen-induced toxicity as well as robust assessment of pulmonary outcomes in large trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of acetaminophen in extremely preterm infants are needed.

### COX inhibitors and breast cancer [^112wy1w3]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

This result is at odds with the findings of another large study involving 734 899 women in a nested case–control design. This study, using the General Practice Research Database, found a protective role for aspirin and paracetamol if taken for one year or longer, with daily doses of aspirin and paracetamol showing greatest risk reduction. There was no risk reduction for use of non-aspirin NSAIDs.

The dose–response relationship shown by the US Women's Health Initiative Observational Study was also illustrated in a population-based case–control study involving 1442 cases and 1420 controls, comparing aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Here there was a statistically significant inverse association for any NSAID use, and frequent use. For aspirin use, the effects for frequency of use were stronger than duration of use. This differs with ibuprofen use where frequency and duration of use was not associated with decreasing risk. Acetaminophen was unrelated to the incidence of breast cancer. The authors examined the relationship between the observed risk reduction of breast cancer in patients taking NSAIDs and hormone receptor status. They concluded that there was a reduction in risk and this was mainly of hormone receptor-positive tumours. This result leads credibility to the theory that the COX-2 inhibitors' action is through aromatase inhibition. However, this is the only epidemiological study so far to show that the mechanism of NSAID activity is through hormone receptor, and needs to be replicated before the findings can be accepted as conclusive.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115FE9uj]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for pain management — APAP, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent whose analgesic and antipyretic actions appear limited to the central nervous system and, for this reason, APAP is ineffective as an anti-inflammatory; research suggests that APAP may also act as a cannabinoid system modulator. The most commonly reported side effect is GI discomfort, and the most common severe effects are hepatotoxicity from significant overdose with hepatocellular damage and death; toxicity from a single administration < 150 mg/kg for adults or 200 mg/kg for children is rare, and care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and other patients with hepatic dysfunction where the maximum safe daily dose may not be known. APAP has the advantage of being lightweight and low bulk, is available in PO, PR, and IV formulations, and multiple studies comparing IV against PO and PR administrations have found clinical equipoise.

### Nitric oxide releasing acetaminophen (nitroacetaminophen) [^111FR1V7]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

The nitric oxide releasing derivative of acetaminophen (nitroacetaminophen) exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity in a variety of animal models. On a mol for mol basis nitroacetaminophen is some 3–20 times more potent than acetaminophen. Nitroacetaminophen exhibits little or no hepatotoxicity following administration in rat or mouse and indeed protects against the hepatotoxic activity of acetaminophen. Nitroacetaminophen does not affect blood pressure or heart rate of anaesthetised rats but has similar potency to acetaminophen as an anti-pyretic agent. The enhanced anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity of nitroacetaminophen and the reduced hepatotoxicity in these animal models is likely to be secondary to the slow release of nitric oxide from the molecule. As yet the precise molecular mechanism(s) underlying these actions of nitroacetaminophen are not clear. Evidence for inhibition of cytokine-directed formation of pro-inflammatory molecule production (e.g. COX-2, iNOS) by an effect on the NF-kappaB transduction system and/or nitrosylation (and thence inhibition) of caspase enzyme activity has been reported. Data described in this review indicate that the profile of pharmacological activity of nitroacetaminophen and acetaminophen are markedly different. The possibility that nitroacetaminophen could be an attractive alternative to acetaminophen in the clinic is discussed.

### Analgesic effect of acetaminophen in humans: first evidence of a central serotonergic mechanism [^112cMGsX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Preclinical studies have suggested that the mechanism of the analgesic action of acetaminophen (INN, paracetamol) is linked to the serotonergic system and that it is inhibited by tropisetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonist. The aim of this study was to confirm these findings in humans.

Methods

Twenty-six rapid metabolizers of tropisetron were included in this double-blind crossover study. After ethical approval, at weekly intervals, the subjects took a single oral dose of 1 g acetaminophen combined with either intravenous tropisetron (5 mg), granisetron (3 mg), or placebo (saline solution). For each session, the analgesic effect of acetaminophen was assessed by use of a pain self-evaluation instrument, the Pain Matcher. The pain detection threshold was determined 5 times over the period of the 4 postdosing hours. The area under the curve (0–4 hours) (mean ± SD) of acetaminophen/tropisetron and the area under the curve of acetaminophen/granisetron were compared with the effect of acetaminophen/placebo. Blood samples for acetaminophen concentration measurements were taken to evaluate a pharmacokinetic interaction.

Results

The analgesic effect of acetaminophen/placebo (expressed as the area under the curve of the percentage of the individual pain score reported at baseline along time [% x min]) (2145 ± 2901% x min) was totally inhibited by both tropisetron (89 ± 1747% x min, P = 0.007) and granisetron (45 ± 2020% x min, P = 0.002). Acetaminophen concentration was not significantly different when associated with tropisetron (P = 0.919) or granisetron (P = 0.309).

Conclusion

These results clearly show for the first time in humans that the coadministration of tropisetron or granisetron with acetaminophen completely blocks the analgesic effect of acetaminophen. They support the hypothesis that the mechanism of the analgesic action of acetaminophen might involve the serotonergic system. Furthermore, they demonstrate a pharmacodynamic interaction between these 2 types of drugs, which are frequently coadministered, especially in cancer patients.

### Acetaminophen and codeine [^117Tv9ti]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatotoxicity

Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.

The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.

Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect (see Dependence). Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; WARNINGS).

### Acetaminophen increases aldosterone secretion while suppressing cortisol and androgens: a possible link to increased risk of hypertension [^114cvd61]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug. Potential side effects are of public health concern, and liver toxicity from acute overdose is well known. More recently, a regular use of acetaminophen has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension.

Methods

We investigated effects of acetaminophen on steroidogenesis as a possible mechanism for the hypertensive action by using the human adrenocortical cell line, H295R. Cells were treated with 0.1, 0.5, and 1mM of acetaminophen for 24 hours, and secretion of steroids and gene expression of key steps in the steroidogenesis were investigated.

Results

Progesterone and aldosterone secretion were increased dose dependently, while secretion of 17α-OH-progesterone and cortisol as well as dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione was decreased. CYP17α-hydroxylase activity, assessed by the ratio 17α-OH-progesterone/progesterone, and CYP17-lyase activity, assessed by the ratio androstenedione/17α-OH-progesterone, were both dose-dependently decreased by acetaminophen. No effects were revealed on cell viability. Treatment of cells with 0.5mM of acetaminophen did not cause any effects on the expression of 10 genes in the steroidogenic pathways.

Conclusions

The pattern of steroid secretion caused by acetaminophen can be explained by inhibition of CYP17A1 enzyme activity. A decreased secretion of glucocorticoids and androgens, as demonstrated by acetaminophen, would, in an in vivo situation, induce adrenocorticotropic hormone release via negative feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and result in an upregulation of aldosterone secretion. Our results suggest a novel possible mechanism for acetaminophen-induced hypertension, which needs to be further elucidated in clinical investigations.

Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by liver damage and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug. See OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information.

### Systematic review of systemic and neuraxial effects of acetaminophen in preclinical models of nociceptive processing [^115k4nWm]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Serotonin Signaling

Several lines of investigation have suggested that acetaminophen may exert its effects through serotonin transmission. As acetaminophen displays little or no affinity for 5-HT receptors, or for neuronal reuptake sites, these actions have been argued to reflect an indirect effect notably by a brainstem action altering activity in bulbospinal serotonergic projections. Thus, destruction of bulbospinal 5-HT projections is reported to attenuate the antinociceptive action of acetaminophen. An important issue is whether the effects of acetaminophen reflect an increase or a decrease in the activation of the bulbospinal projection. It has been reported that acetaminophen increases 5-HT levels in rat brain. Such an increase may be interpreted as having increased serotonin to be released. It is equally consistent with the notion that acetaminophen is decreasing terminal release leading to accumulation. In this regard, bulbospinal serotonin projections have been said to facilitate dorsal horn processing leading to hyperalgesia, likely mediated through an excitatory 5-HT receptor such as 5-HT3. Others have argued that activation of the descending pathway may lead to a block of dorsal processing by activating a G protein coupled inhibitory 5-HT receptor (eg, 5-HT1 isotypes). Other possibilities are that serotonin, through an excitatory receptor (5-HT2, 3, 7), may activate an inhibitory interneuron such as GABAor encephalin, as suggested by the report of naloxone sensitivity of acetaminophen antinociception to naloxone, an opioid. In the case of acetaminophen, the literature is complex and controversial. Thus, IT 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A/C and 5-HT7 antagonism has been reported to reduce acetaminophen actions. IT 5-HT3 antagonism has been reported to inhibit the antinociceptive effects of acetaminophen in various pain models, and specific knock down with 5-HT3 receptor antisense did not alter acetaminophen antinociception. In humans, pain reports by median nerve stimulation were significantly reduced by acetaminophen, and this effect was reduced vs control by 5-HT receptor antagonists.

### Mitigating the risk of opioid abuse through a balanced undergraduate pain medicine curriculum [^113kvHhj]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacology of pain

Nonopioid analgesics

Clinical pharmacology is generally underemphasized in medical school curricula, and this applies not only to opioids but to all pharmacotherapies. A proper understanding of mechanisms of action is essential for selecting appropriate analgesics for specific patient populations and for limiting exposure to medications with the potential for misuse.

Acetaminophen is a weak inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and acts centrally by mechanisms that are not clearly understood but are believed to include inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Given its lack of a potent anti-inflammatory effect, the IASP curriculum recommends acetaminophen only for headaches and as an antipyretic. Tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors boost levels of neurotransmitters involved in neuropathic pain or pain with a neuropathic component. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, with COX-2 inhibition providing most of their anti-inflammatory effects.

Given their mechanisms of action, it is logical that NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are recommended for inflammatory conditions such as back pain or osteoarthritis but not neuropathic pain. Similarly, tricyclic antidepressants are considered first-line therapies for neuropathic pain, whereas tricyclics and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are considered primarily adjunctive therapies in inflammatory conditions. Mechanisms influencing nociceptive pain and the monoamine system explain the broad indications for opioids and also provide a rationale for opioid/antidepressant combinations, such as tapentadol.

### Clinical implications of nonopioid analgesia for relief of mild-to-moderate pain in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease [^113fdahU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonopioid analgesics, which include acetaminophen, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors (coxibs), are frequently used for the relief of mild-to-moderate pain. Although all of these agents are effective at controlling pain, inhibition of prostaglandins (PGs) by NSAIDs may result in untoward cardiorenal effects, including hypertension, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, acute renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Individuals with an increased risk for cardiorenal effects from NSAIDs (eg, the elderly, and those with hypertension, cardiac disease, or gouty nephropathy) should be monitored for early onset of edema, destabilization of blood pressure control, and/or onset of congestive heart failure when started on NSAID therapy. Because acetaminophen has a different mechanism of action from the conventional NSAIDs, it does not inhibit peripheral PGs at recommended dosing and therefore appears to have a more favorable cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety profile. This review discusses the effects of acetaminophen, traditional NSAIDs, and coxibs on fluid and electrolytes, blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and renal function, as well as their consequences in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It also summarizes information on the mechanisms by which NSAID-induced cardiovascular adverse events develop, and it provides recommendations for the use of nonopioid analgesics for relief of mild-to-moderate pain in patients with or at risk for CVD.

Cyclooxygenase Inhibition

Prostaglandins play an important central and peripheral role in sensitizing systems which are involved in nociceptive transmission. The prostanoids are formed by the actions of constitutive (COX1) and inducible forms (COX2) of cyclooxygenase. Common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as acetylsalicylic acid, or ibuprofen, block activity of these isoforms. While a literature has suggested acetaminophen may inhibit cyclooxygenase, minimal evidence supports a direct effect. This assertion is consistent with the side effect profile for acetaminophen, which does not include effects commonly associated with COX1 inhibition known on the gastrointestinal tract, platelet activation, and kidney functions and with COX2 on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and kidney function. One explanation for this distinction is that acetaminophen may act as a CNS-COX inhibitor, whereas the other COX inhibitors act both centrally and peripherally. In this regard, acetaminophen acts to interfere with the peroxidase activity of COX2. This interaction is particularly manifest when the cellular environment is low in arachidonic acid and peroxides and may reflect the "central" effects where constitutively expressed COX2 at the spinal level plays a principal role in initiating facilitated states, and why it appears to display less activity in inflamed tissues (where peroxides and arachidonic acid are highly concentrated). In this regard, acetaminophen inhibits conversion of arachidonic acid to Prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2 and thromboxane‐A2 in microglia exposed to lipopolysaccharideat 3‐fold lower concentrations in microglia than in peripheral macrophages. A further point is that recent work has suggested that AM404, the downstream metabolite of acetaminophen, can inhibit isolated cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 enzymes and prostaglandin synthesis in macrophage cultures and in brain slices. AM404 is also a potent inhibitor of T cell activation and inhibited TNF gene transcription and protein synthesis, thereby regulating activation of several transcription factors including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB).

### Endocannabinoid and serotonergic systems are needed for acetaminophen-induced analgesia [^1179R8wH]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is the most used analgesic/antipyretic drug. Its unclear mechanism of action could rely on cyclooxygenase inhibition, NO synthesis blockade or reinforcement of the serotonergic system. Here we show that in thermal, mechanical and chemical pain tests, AM-251, a specific CB(1) receptor antagonist, abolished the analgesic action of acetaminophen, which was also lost in CB(1) receptor knockout mice. Moreover, acetaminophen was shown unable to bind to CB(1) receptors demonstrating an indirect involvement of these receptors in the analgesic effect of this compound. Accordingly with these results, we also demonstrated that the inhibition of FAAH, an enzyme involved in the cerebral metabolism of acetaminophen into AM404, known to reinforce the activity of the endocannabinoid system, suppressed the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen. In addition, similarly to the interaction of acetaminophen with bulbospinal serotonergic pathways and spinal serotonin receptors, we observed that the antinociceptive activity of ACEA, a CB(1) receptor agonist, was inhibited by lesion of bulbospinal serotonergic pathways and antagonists of spinal 5-HT receptors. We therefore propose that acetaminophen-induced analgesia could involve the following sequence: (1) FAAH-dependent metabolism of acetaminophen into AM404; (2) indirect involvement of CB(1) receptors by this metabolite; (3) endocannabinoid-dependent reinforcement of the serotonergic bulbospinal pathways, and (4) involvement of spinal pain-suppressing serotonergic receptors.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^1129QNzS]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

During the inflammatory response, COX-dependent prostanoids play a role in the development of hyperalgesia. PGE 2 and PGI 2 increase the sensitivity of pain receptors (or nociceptors) in the periphery and enhance the activity of various pain mediators. Peripheral inflammation is also associated with upregulation of COX-2 and an increase in PGE 2 in the central nervous system, while contributing to the development of central hyperalgesia. The role of COX-2 in the development of central hyperalgesia has been demonstrated in an engineered mouse model, in which conditional deletion of the gene for COX-2 in neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system resulted in the reduction of peripheral inflammation–induced COX-2 expression in the spinal cord and of mechanical hypersensitivity related to joint movement or tenderness to touch.

In general, NSAIDs inhibit prostanoid synthesis by competitive and transient inhibition of arachidonic acid binding to the COX active site. The therapeutic effects of NSAIDs largely result from COX-2 inhibition at sites of inflammation, while many of the side effects associated with NSAIDs, particularly gastrointestinal side effects, are attributed to inhibition of the protective effects of prostanoids produced by COX-1. Although all NSAIDs generally act by inhibition of arachidonic acid binding at COX, the mechanism of action of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) differs fundamentally from that of non-aspirin NSAIDs in that it causes an irreversible inactivation of COX-1 and COX-2 in most patients, preventing the oxidative conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG 2 and PGH 2. In non-nucleated platelets, this effect confers persistent inhibition of COX-1–mediated TxA 2 production and platelet function throughout the dosing interval. Acetaminophen also differs from other NSAIDs in that it has no measurable anti-inflammatory effects at therapeutic doses, but primarily inhibits prostanoid-mediated hyperalgesia through suppression of PGE 2 biosynthesis.–

Inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis by NSAIDs is responsible for the therapeutic activities of these drugs;, however, this inhibitory activity also suppresses other effects of these prostanoids, resulting in the side effects associated with NSAID treatment. For example, inhibition of PGE 2 production may reduce hyperalgesia but may also reduce the tissue-protective effects of this prostanoid in various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, vascular wall, kidney, and lung.

### Systematic review of systemic and neuraxial effects of acetaminophen in preclinical models of nociceptive processing [^111XHsau]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

TRP Signaling

The acetaminophen metabolite AM404 can bind to the vanilloid binding site and activate the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1(TRPV1) channel in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Moreover, the antinociceptive effects of acetaminophen are absent in TRPV(1) knockout mice. Activation of TRPV1 can lead to inhibition of downstream excitatory T-type calcium channels. NAPQI, the toxic liver metabolite of acetaminophen, has been shown to activate TRPV1. Further, acetaminophen and the metabolite NAPQI sensitizes and activates transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) slowly but directly by interacting with distinct intracellular cysteine residues. This TRPA1 activation paradoxically serves to reduce voltage-gated calcium and sodium currents in DRG neurons, while intrathecal acetaminophen and NAPQI produced anti-nociception that was absent in TRPA1 KO mice.

An important caveat is that the activation of TRP receptors is generally associated with adverse events including activation of pain signaling. It should be noted that NAPQI will result in neurogenic inflammation, which indeed suggest that such metabolites would serve to activate small peptidergic nociceptive afferents. If the actions of acetaminophen action are indeed mediated through such signaling, then one would similarly anticipate adverse pain components, which to date have not been noted.

### An integrated safety analysis of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen (maxigesic / combogesic) in adults [^114ki4Qa]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

APAP is an analgesic and antipyretic agent that has little anti-inflammatory activity. It has been used clinically for more than a century, having been introduced into use in 1893 and is now the most widely prescribed analgesic in the world. APAP is commonly used for the relief of fever, headaches, and other minor aches and pains. Unlike other common OTC analgesics such as aspirin and IBP, APAP has a relatively little anti-inflammatory activity, and so it is not considered to be an NSAID. Used in combination with NSAIDs, APAP is useful in the management of more severe pain, where it allows lower dosages of NSAIDs to be used, thereby minimizing the risk of class-related adverse effects.,

APAP undergoes a two-step metabolic process to reach the active metabolite (Figure 1). APAP is first metabolized in the liver to p -aminophenol which is then metabolized in the brain by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) containing cells into N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) arachidonylamide (AM404).–AM404 is a potent agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV 1), a low-affinity ligand of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), an anandamide membrane transporter blocker, and a COX inhibitor. Furthermore, AM404 inhibits sodium channels in a similar manner to neuroprotectants and anesthetics. All the above actions have individually been shown to reduce pain and are considered possible mechanisms of action for APAP. It has been demonstrated that after either genetically or pharmacologically blocking cannabinoid receptors, or knocking out FAAH and TRPV 1 in mice, APAP no longer has any analgesic effect, suggesting the pain-relieving action is mediated by the activation of both TRPV 1 and CB1 in the central nervous system.

### Paracetamol use during pregnancy-a call for precautionary action [^113yBhHx]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

The experimental evidence of neurodevelopmental effects

Experimental animal studies have suggested that perinatal APAP exposure, even at low therapeutic doses, increases the risk of brain and behavioural abnormalities in rodents. supporting the epidemiological evidence (Supplementary Table 4). A 2019 study suggested that APAP enters the developing rat brain and cerebrospinal fluid in higher amounts than the adult brain. Long-term (5 days) fetal exposure resulted in even higher transfer rates than short-term exposure, which might lead to accumulation of APAP in the fetal brain. Consistent with the epidemiological data, studies have demonstrated that the strongest effects of long-term use and exposure occur at a time equivalent to the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy and the time around birth in humans.

APAP effects on the cannabinoid and prostaglandin pathways alone or in combination might be the possible mechanisms. The antipyretic effect of APAP involves inhibition of prostaglandin-synthesizing cyclooxygenase enzymes in the brain. Prostaglandin E2 is an endogenous lipid molecule involved in normal brain development, regulating cerebellar development and inducing masculinization of the preoptic area of the brain. Emerging clinical and molecular research has provided compelling evidence that abnormal cyclooxygenase 2 and prostaglandin E2 signalling is associated with ASD-related pathology and behaviours. Other data suggest that the analgesic effect of APAP acts through the endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is a complex network of lipid signalling pathways that have an important role in the developing nervous system. Alterations of the endocannabinoid system have been found in both the brain and the immune system of humans with ASD. Studies in mice have demonstrated the emergence of ASD-like behaviours following diverse genetic or pharmacological manipulations targeting the endocannabinoid system.

As with reproductive studies, inconsistencies between studies might relate to factors such as species, strain, age, dose, duration of exposure, and route and schedule of administration. However, a particular obstacle is the difficulty in translating human outcomes, such as ADHD and ASD, to behaviour in an animal model. Future studies should include evaluation of brain and behavioural effects in higher order species, from both prenatal and early life exposure, for specific indications and exposure windows.

### Correlation of pain reduction with fMRI BOLD response in osteoarthritis patients treated with paracetamol: randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical efficacy study [^112kvui6]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Paracetamol (APAP) is an over-the-counter analgesic medicine used to manage mild to moderate pain associated with multiple acute and chronic pain disorders, including osteoarthritis (OA). Despite evidence that suggests that APAP works through multiple mechanisms in the central nervous system, the exact effects of this medication on neurologic activity in patients with OA are not yet characterized. Neuro-imaging measures showing the relationship between pain reduction in OA and changes in functional activities in the human brain may help elucidate the mechanism of action of APAP. Currently used self-reported pain measurements — such as a visual analog scale, numerical rating scale (NRS), and pain relief score — are subjective measurements that provide little understanding of the neurophysiologic processes underlying the pain associated with OA and therefore offer limited options for evaluating therapeutic efficacy.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) maps functional activity in the brain by indirect evaluation of changes in blood flow and oxygen levels in the capillary beds. Several fMRI neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that different patterns of brain activity occur in acute and chronic pain. Acute pain has been shown to activate brain regions associated with nociceptive pain pathways, including the thalamus, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex. In clinical studies in patients with OA, painful mechanical stimulation of the affected knee joint has been associated with blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) responses measured by fMRI in the brain regions commonly involved in acute pain. In pharmacologic investigations in healthy volunteers, analgesics such as ibuprofen-arginine, remifentanil, nalbuphine, naloxone, and naproxen have shown greater fMRI BOLD responses in pain-related brain regions compared with placebo. One fMRI study in healthy volunteers receiving painful stimulation showed that APAP treatment was associated with reduced activation in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and prefrontal cortices compared with placebo. fMRI studies have also evaluated the placebo effect, showing that placebo can change brain activity in the thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex in healthy volunteers. These observations provide evidence that placebo alters the experience of pain through a different mechanism of action compared with active analgesics.

The present study aimed to correlate the efficacy of pain reduction with the intensity, location, and pattern of changes in BOLD signal in different regions of the brain using fMRI in response to noxious stimulation of the painful knee joint in subjects with OA after treatment with eight-hour extended-release (ER) APAP compared with placebo and no treatment.

### Warfarin and acetaminophen interaction: a summary of the evidence and biologic plausibility [^112BWbxT]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Ms TS is a 66-year-old woman who receives warfarin for prevention of systemic embolization in the setting of hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. She had a transient ischemic attack about 4 years ago when she was receiving aspirin. Her INR control was excellent; however, over the past few months it has become erratic, and her average dose required to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 appears to have decreased. She has had back pain over this same period and has been taking acetaminophen at doses at large as 650 mg four times daily, with her dose varying based on her symptoms. You recall a potential interaction and wonder if (1) her acetaminophen use is contributing to her loss of INR control, and (2) does this interaction place her at increased risk of warfarin-related complications?

### Fifty years of paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning: the development of risk assessment and treatment 1973–2023 with particular focus on contributions published from Edinburgh and Denver [^114dBeia]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fifty years ago, basic scientific studies and the availability of assay methods made the assessment of risk in paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning possible. The use of the antidote acetylcysteine linked to new methods of risk assessment transformed the treatment of this poisoning. This review will describe the way in which risk assessment and treatments have developed over the last 50years and highlight the remaining areas of uncertainty.

Methods

A search of PubMed and its subsidiary databases revealed 1,166 references published in the period 1963–2023 using the combined terms "paracetamol", "poisoning", and "acetylcysteine". Focused searches then identified 170 papers dealing with risk assessment of paracetamol poisoning, 141 with adverse reactions to acetylcysteine and 114 describing different acetylcysteine regimens. To manage the extensive literature, we focused mainly on contributions made by the authors during their time in Edinburgh and Denver.

Dose and Concentration Response

The key relationship between paracetamol dose and toxicity risk was established in 1971 and led to the development of the Rumack-Matthew nomogram from data collected in Edinburgh.

Mechanisms Of Toxicity

A series of papers on the mechanisms of toxicity were published in 1973, and these showed that paracetamol hepatotoxicity was caused by the formation of a toxic intermediate epoxide metabolite normally detoxified by glutathione but which, in excess, was bound covalently to hepatic enzymes and proteins. An understanding of the relationship between the rate of paracetamol metabolism, paracetamol concentration, and toxic hazard in humans soon followed.

Antidote Development and Efficacy In Patients

These discoveries were followed by the testing of a range of sulfhydryl-donors in animals and "at risk" patients. Acetylcysteine was developed as the lead intravenous antidote in the United Kingdom. The license holder in the United States refused to make an intravenous formulation. Thus, oral acetylcysteine became the antidote trialed in the United States National Multicenter Study. Intravenous acetylcysteine regimens used initially in the United Kingdom and subsequently in the United States used loading doses of 150 mg/kg over 15 minutes or one hour, 50 mg/kg over four hours, and 100mg/kg over 16 hours. These regimens were associated with adverse drug reactions (nausea, vomiting and anaphylactoid reactions) and hence, treatment interruption. Newer dosing regimens now give loading doses more slowly. One, the Scottish and Newcastle Anti-emetic Pretreatment protocol, using an acetylcysteine regimen of 100mg/kg over two hours followed by 200mg/kg over 10 hours, has been widely adopted in the United Kingdom. A cohort comparison study suggests this regimen has comparable efficacy to standard regimens and offers opportunities for selective higher acetylcysteine dosing.

Risk Assessment At Presentation

No dose-ranging studies with acetylcysteine were done, and no placebo-controlled studies were performed. Thus, there is uncertainty regarding the optimal dose of acetylcysteine, particularly in patients ingesting very large overdoses of paracetamol. The choice of intervention concentration on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram has important consequences for the proportion of patients treated. The United States National Multicenter Study used a "treatment" line starting at 150mg/L (992µmol/L) at 4hours post overdose, extending to 24hours with a half-life of 4hours, now standard there, and subsequently adopted in Australia and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, the treatment line was initially 200mg/L (1,323µmol/L) at 4hours (the Rumack-Matthew "risk" line). In 2012, the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency lowered the treatment line to 100mg/L (662µmol/L) at 4hours for all patients, increasing the number of patients admitted and treated at a high cost. Risk assessment is a key issue for ongoing study, particularly following the development of potential new antidotes that may act in those at greatest risk. The development of biomarkers to assess risk is ongoing but has yet to reach clinical trials.

Conclusion

Even after 50years, there are still areas of uncertainty. These include appropriate acetylcysteine doses in patients who ingest different paracetamol doses or multiple (staggered) ingestions, early identification of at-risk patients, and optimal treatment of late presenters.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^114vvRJm]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacological management: acetaminophen — In the absence of sufficient evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that when not contraindicated, oral acetaminophen may be considered to improve pain and function in the treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip. Quality of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Option: Consensus. The systematic literature review yielded no studies that met inclusion criteria for this option, and the use of non-opioid medications such as acetaminophen for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids. Although oral acetaminophen is widely utilized to treat osteoarthritis of the hip, there are contraindications to its use. Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with preexisting liver disease. Acetaminophen is widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip, this option should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice, and oral acetaminophen is widely available such that this option should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption.

### Alternatively activated macrophages promote resolution of necrosis following acute liver injury [^117UTdUq]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) overdose is a common cause of acute liver injury (ALI) in the clinic and is the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the United States. APAP also serves as a model hepatotoxin for preclinical studies and the molecular mechanisms that underpin APAP hepatotoxicity are relatively well understood. Therapeutic management of APAP-induced ALI (APAP-ALI) is primarily limited to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy, which serves as an effective antidote. However, NAC efficacy is substantially diminished in patients who present late after APAP ingestion (i.e. longer than 10 h). Liver transplantation may be required in patients who subsequently develop ALF. However, due to the shortages of suitable donor tissue, and associated life-long immunosuppression, liver transplantation is not an ideal therapeutic intervention. Therefore, novel therapies to prevent liver injury progressing to ALF are urgently sought.

### The paracetamol metabolite N-acetylp-benzoquinone imine reduces excitability in first-and second-order neurons of the pain pathway through actions on KV7 channels [^116U2q4K]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is often referred to as the drug that is used most frequently around the globe to treat mild to moderate pain and to reduce fever. It is generally favored over nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as it provokes serious adverse events less frequently. Nevertheless, paracetamol overdose may cause acute liver failure, a toxic effect rarely seen with NSAIDs. Analgesic and unfavorable actions of NSAIDs, such as gastric ulcers, kidney dysfunction, and bleeding, involve inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX). Because these detrimental effects are not associated with paracetamol, the latter is not viewed as prototypic COX inhibitor. Still, paracetamol has been shown to inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 with half maximal effects at 105 and 26 µM, respectively, and COX inhibition is frequently inferred as an analgesic mechanism of this drug.

In light of uncertainties regarding COX inhibition as paracetamol's most relevant mechanism of action, numerous investigations have searched for alternative explanations. In this respect, 2 paracetamol metabolites have gained particular attention. In humans, between 5% and 15% of a paracetamol dose is metabolized through cytochrome P450 enzymes (mainly CYP2E1 and CYP3A4) to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is known to mediate hepatotoxicity after paracetamol over dosage. Less than 0.01% of paracetamol is converted to N-arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404) through conjugation of the intermediate product p-aminophenol with arachidonic acid by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH).N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine activates TRPA1and TRPV1channels, whereas AM404 activates TRPV1and inhibits Ca V 3.2 channels.TRPV1 and Ca V 3.2 channels in the brain and TRPA1 channels in the spinal cord seem to be involved in the antinociceptive actions of these paracetamol metabolites, because both, intracerebroventricular application of AM404, and intrathecal administration of NAPQI, provide analgesia in rodent models of chemical and thermal pain. Because knock out of either TRPV1or TRPA1was sufficient to abolish the antinociceptive action of APAP, it remains unclear whether any of these 2 channels might represent a single relevant target for paracetamol and its active metabolites.

### A virtual scalable model of the hepatic lobule for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity prediction [^1155PQHm]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

N -acetyl- p -aminophenol (APAP, generic name acetaminophen) is a widely used "over-the-counter" analgesic-antipyretic medication with well-documented mechanisms of action. APAP hepatotoxicity is one of the most common, and unpredictable cause of DILI. It can result in ALF requiring liver transplantation –. With liver transplantation being the second most common solid organ transplant and having only 10% of current liver transplant needs met, the need to address this clinical burden is great. In 2000, Shakil et al.reported that 28% of transplant cases were attributed to APAP injury during a 13-year retrospective study from the University of Pittsburgh. Another study found in 2003 that APAP-induced ALF accounted for 20% of liver transplant cases. The breadth of available data makes APAP the ideal agent to validate our approach. After ingestion, APAP reaches hepatocytes through the portal vein and is metabolized through phase II glucuronidation and sulfation enzymes. About 5–10% of APAP is metabolized via phase I enzymes, into toxic N -acetyl- p -benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI). Glutathione (GSH) binding to NAPQI forms the nontoxic conjugate, mercapturic acid, which can then be excreted from the body as urine. Toxic NAPQI occurs when hepatic stores of sulfate, glucuronide, and GSH are depleted or when phase I enzymes have been induced. Case in point, ingestion of excessive APAP can deplete the levels of GSH required to detoxify NAPQI. Toxic NAPQI is then free to bind to intracellular organelles causing oxidative stress that can injure or kill hepatocytes. The resulting hepatocellular necrosis can precipitate life-threatening ALF.

### Definition of propacetamol-NCI drug dictionary… [^112kq5Hk]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

propacetamol A water-soluble para-aminophenol derivative and ester prodrug of acetaminophen in which acetaminophen is bound to the carboxylic acid diethylglycine, with analgesic and antipyretic activities. Upon intravenous administration, propacetamol is hydrolyzed by plasma esterases into its active form acetaminophen. Although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated despite its widespread use, acetaminophen enters the central nervous system and acts centrally. This agent binds to cyclooxygenase and prevents the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin. A reduction in prostaglandin formation relieves pain and reduces fever. Acetaminophen may also act centrally on cannabinoid receptors and on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Check for active clinical trials using this agentView this agent in the NCI Thesaurus

### Consensus-based recommendations on management of acetaminophen poisoning… [^111MhsX3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

If indicated, acetylcysteine should be initiated and the route or rate of administration adjusted if the patient develops adverse events, such as vomiting or an anaphylactoid reaction. When a 150-mg/kg loading dose is used, it should be infused over at least 1 hour. ALT indicates alanine transaminase; AST, aspartate transaminase; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration; IV, intravenous; INR, international normalized ratio; NAC, acetylcysteine; PT, prothrombin time. Objective To develop consensus guidelines for the management of acetaminophen poisoning in the US and Canada. Evidence Review. Finally, specific treatment considerations, including acetylcysteine dosing, fomepizole administration, and considerations for extracorporeal elimination and transplant evaluation, were addressed.

Conclusions and Relevance This qualitative study provides a consensus statement on consistent evidence-based recommendations for medical, pharmacy, and nursing education and practice to optimize care of patients with acetaminophen poisoning. Acetaminophen poisoning may occur as a self-harm attempt or the inadvertent consumption of repeated doses in the treatment of pain or fever. Toxic effects of acetaminophen are characterized by hepatocellular damage, which may lead to acute liver injury, acute liver failure, or death. When acetaminophen is coingested with anticholinergic or opioid agonist medications, the clinical concern is that acetaminophen absorption may be delayed or prolonged. Management is the same as with other acetaminophen products except that if the first acetaminophen concentration measured at 4 to 24 hours after ingestion is 10 μg/mL or less, another measurement need not be taken and acetylcysteine treatment is not needed.

If any concentration is above the treatment line, acetylcysteine is needed. Enhanced elimination is recommended when a very large ingestion has occurred. The consensus panel concurred with the extracorporeal treatment of poisoning. 14 Hemodialysis is recommended in addition to treatment with acetylcysteine in a patient with an acetaminophen concentration of 900 μg/mL or greater with acidosis or altered consciousness due to acetaminophen toxic effects. If the intravenous route is used, the rate of acetylcysteine infusion should be at least 12. 5 mg/kg per hour during hemodialysis. The oral acetylcysteine regimen does not require adjustment during hemodialysis.
