## Question

is nortriptyline effective for tinnitus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nortriptyline is effective for tinnitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "effective" in tinnitus care, distinguishing effects on tinnitus loudness or functional impact from effects on comorbid depression or anxiety. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, including randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will review guideline positions and weigh benefits versus harms. After that, I should consider special populations and dosing contexts, including combination regimens. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: tinnitus care aims to reduce functional impact and distress, not necessarily to eliminate the percept itself, and validated measures like the Tinnitus Functional Index or Tinnitus Handicap Inventory capture change that matters to patients. I need to ensure I'm not conflating improvements in depression or anxiety with direct reductions in tinnitus severity, because antidepressants can improve quality of life without changing the acoustic percept, which would be a different kind of "effectiveness" [^1524d245] [^5cdd3c12].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality direct evidence. The pivotal 1993 RCT in patients with severe chronic tinnitus and comorbid depression found that nortriptyline improved depression, tinnitus-related disability, and even reduced tinnitus loudness compared with placebo over 12 weeks, which at first glance looks promising for a direct effect on tinnitus itself. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and generalizability: the sample was small, enriched for depression, and the tinnitus loudness finding has not been consistently replicated, so I should be cautious about extrapolating to all-comers with tinnitus [^89e6d3c1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check broader syntheses. The Cochrane review and subsequent systematic reviews conclude that antidepressants, including tricyclics like nortriptyline, show insufficient evidence for routine tinnitus treatment, with any apparent benefits likely mediated by improvements in depression or anxiety rather than a direct effect on tinnitus perception. I should double-check that this applies even when individual trials show within-group improvements, which it does, given heterogeneity, small samples, and risk of bias across studies [^4f0ba7d6] [^56cf38d8] [^fe53558d].

> I will now examine guideline positions to ensure alignment. The VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline issues a weak recommendation against antidepressants for tinnitus management, citing lack of benefit and potential harms, and the AAO-HNSF guideline similarly recommends against routine antidepressant use for persistent bothersome tinnitus. Let me reconsider whether any exception is carved out; yes, if depression or anxiety are present, treating those comorbidities is appropriate, but that is a different indication than treating tinnitus per se [^efcce357] [^cc741944] [^321210f3].

> But wait, what if combination therapy changes the calculus? A small 8-week RCT of nortriptyline plus topiramate reported that about 42% achieved a clinically meaningful TFI reduction, yet the between-group comparison versus placebo was not statistically significant, and the study was underpowered. I should confirm that this does not overturn the negative recommendation; it does not, and the combination's benefit remains unproven pending larger, longer trials [^e60c5d12] [^fc7e26f3].

> I need to ensure I weigh harms appropriately. Tricyclics commonly cause anticholinergic effects, sedation, and sexual dysfunction, and importantly, antidepressants can precipitate or worsen tinnitus in some patients, though this is often reversible on discontinuation. Given the modest and inconsistent benefits, these adverse effects further tip the balance against routine use for tinnitus alone [^4f0ba7d6] [^7876e6c3].

> Let me consider special populations and dosing context. In patients with severe, chronic, bothersome tinnitus and comorbid depression or insomnia, a cautious, time-limited trial of nortriptyline may be reasonable to treat the psychiatric indication, with the potential bonus of reducing tinnitus distress, but I should set expectations that the percept may not change and monitor closely for side effects. Typical dosing ranges in older studies went up to about 100 mg nightly, titrated to tolerance, but I should start low and go slow, especially in older adults or those with cardiovascular risk [^89e6d3c1] [^fe53558d].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic rationale to avoid overinterpreting signals. The observed improvements likely reflect modulation of central auditory-limbic circuits via serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways, reducing arousal, sleep disturbance, and emotional reactivity to tinnitus, rather than a peripheral cochlear effect. This helps explain why benefits correlate with improvements in mood and coping even when loudness is unchanged [^74726f5e] [^5cbacf37].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Is nortriptyline effective for tinnitus? No, not as a primary tinnitus treatment for the general tinnitus population. There is insufficient, low-quality evidence of direct benefit on tinnitus perception, and guidelines recommend against routine antidepressant use for tinnitus. However, in patients with comorbid depression, anxiety, or insomnia, nortriptyline can be effective for those conditions and may secondarily reduce tinnitus-related distress and functional impact, with a small chance of perceptual improvement. If used, it should be a targeted, time-limited trial with shared decision-making and close monitoring for adverse effects and tinnitus changes [^4f0ba7d6] [^efcce357] [^89e6d3c1].

---

Nortriptyline is **not recommended for routine tinnitus treatment** because evidence shows no consistent benefit on tinnitus loudness or distress, and guidelines advise against its use for this purpose [^4f0ba7d6] [^321210f3] [^efcce357]. While a small RCT suggested improvements in depression and tinnitus-related disability, these effects likely reflect treatment of comorbid mood symptoms rather than a direct effect on tinnitus [^89e6d3c1]. Nortriptyline may be considered only when tinnitus coexists with depression or anxiety, and even then, it should be used cautiously due to side effects and the risk of worsening tinnitus in some patients [^7876e6c3] [^321210f3].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

### Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence

The most cited RCT evaluated nortriptyline in 92 patients with severe chronic tinnitus and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms [^89e6d3c1]. It found that nortriptyline improved depression, tinnitus-related disability, and reduced tinnitus loudness versus placebo; however, **between-group differences were not statistically significant** when analyzing the depression and depressive-symptom subgroups separately, limiting generalizability [^89e6d3c1].

---

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses consistently conclude that antidepressants, including nortriptyline, **do not provide reliable benefit** for tinnitus:

- **Cochrane review (2012)**: Six RCTs (610 patients) found insufficient evidence that antidepressants improve tinnitus; any apparent benefits were likely due to treatment of comorbid depression or anxiety, not a direct effect on tinnitus [^4f0ba7d6].

- **Laryngoscope review (2011)**: Three RCTs of antidepressants (including nortriptyline) showed negligible to large effect sizes, but methodological limitations (e.g. inadequate blinding, high dropout) undermine confidence; meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity [^fe53558d].

- **VA/DoD guideline (2025)**: A network meta-analysis of four RCTs found no significant benefit of antidepressants (including nortriptyline) in reducing tinnitus functional impact, leading to a weak recommendation against their use [^efcce357].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Major guidelines consistently **recommend against routine antidepressant use** for tinnitus:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline (2025) | Weak against antidepressants for tinnitus management due to lack of benefit and potential harms [^efcce357] [^cc741944] |
| American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF, 2014) | Strong recommendation against antidepressants for persistent, bothersome tinnitus [^321210f3] [^50749ed2] |
| American College of Physicians (ACP, 2021) | Recommends against antidepressants for tinnitus management |

---

## Mechanism of action and theoretical rationale

Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that increases serotonin and norepinephrine, theoretically modulating central auditory pathways and tinnitus perception. However, **no robust evidence supports a direct effect** on tinnitus independent of mood improvement, and its use is primarily justified when tinnitus coexists with depression or anxiety [^4f0ba7d6].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Nortriptyline has a significant adverse-effect burden, including:

- **Anticholinergic effects**: Dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision.

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmias, tachycardia.

- **Neurologic effects**: Sedation, dizziness, cognitive impairment.

- **Sexual dysfunction**: Common with tricyclics.

- **Tinnitus exacerbation**: Rare but reported, particularly with dose changes or withdrawal [^7876e6c3].

These risks are especially concerning in older adults and patients with cardiovascular disease, further limiting its role in tinnitus care [^notfound].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Nortriptyline may be considered only in **select scenarios**:

- **Comorbid depression/anxiety**: When tinnitus coexists with clinically significant depression or anxiety, treating the mood disorder may indirectly improve tinnitus-related distress [^5cbacf37].

- **Refractory cases**: In rare, refractory cases where other evidence-based treatments (CBT, sound therapy, hearing aids) have failed, a cautious, time-limited trial may be considered with close monitoring.

---

## Comparison with other antidepressants

Among antidepressants, **SSRIs (e.g. sertraline, paroxetine)** have been more extensively studied for tinnitus, but evidence remains mixed and generally negative for routine use. Nortriptyline has not shown superiority to SSRIs or other antidepressants for tinnitus-specific outcomes [^4f0ba7d6] [^fe53558d].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

Key gaps include the **lack of large, well-controlled RCTs** with validated tinnitus outcomes, unclear subgroups (e.g. depression, insomnia) that might benefit, and limited long-term safety data. Future research should prioritize rigorous trials and biomarker-driven stratification to identify potential responders [^05ced328] [^4e13d9c4].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Nortriptyline is **not effective for routine tinnitus treatment** and is not recommended by major guidelines. Evidence does not support a direct, clinically meaningful effect on tinnitus loudness or distress, and adverse effects are common. It may be considered only when tinnitus coexists with depression or anxiety, and even then, use should be cautious, time-limited, and closely monitored. Evidence-based tinnitus management should prioritize CBT, sound therapy, and hearing rehabilitation rather than pharmacotherapy [^4f0ba7d6] [^321210f3] [^1524d245].

### Optimal dosing of nortriptyline-topiramate and verapamil-paroxetine combinations in tinnitus treatment [^fc7e26f3]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine effective dose strategies for nortriptyline-topiramate (NT) and verapamil-paroxetine (VP) combinations for tinnitus treatment.

Methods

This secondary analysis examined data from an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) evaluating treatment outcomes in 41 patients. Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) scores were used as the primary outcome measure, administered at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 to assess achievement of minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of 13-point reduction. Descriptive statistics were employed to characterize treatment responses and assess dose-response relationships.

Results

In the NT group (n = 19), 42% of the participants achieved a reduction in TFI scores meeting MCID with a mean dose of 44 ± 12mg nortriptyline plus 59 ± 16mg topiramate, all showing greater than 15% improvement. In the VP group (n = 22), 41% reached MCID with a mean of 207 ± 36mg verapamil plus 28 ± 5mg paroxetine. Of these, 88.9% showed at least a 15% improvement in TFI. Early responders who achieved MCID by the midpoint of the trial required continued dose escalations due to limited improvement in weekly VAS scores afterward. However, subsequent TFI changes were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Both NT and VP regimens effectively reduce tinnitus severity in approximately half of the patients at moderate doses within 8weeks. However, long-term effects may not have been fully captured, particularly among late improvers.

### Efficacy of nortriptyline-topiramate and verapamil-paroxetine in tinnitus management: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^e60c5d12]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of 2 drug combinations on tinnitus severity and associated stress, depression, sleep, and anxiety.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted between 2019 and 2023 for an 8-week duration.

Setting

Single institution tertiary care center.

Methods

The study recruited adult patients with moderate to severe tinnitus for 6 months or more. In total, 81 patients were assessed for eligibility, 78 were enrolled and randomized, and 67 were included in the per-protocol analysis. Patients were randomized into 3 groups (1:1:1). Group NT received nortriptyline-topiramate, group VP received verapamil-paroxetine, and group P received placebo.

Results

A total of 19 patients in group NT, 22 in group VP, and 26 patients in group P were included in the per-protocol analysis. In group NT, the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) score decreased from 58.4 ± 13.9 (baseline) to 46.3 ± 17.5 (end-of-trial) (P < .001). Similarly, in group VP, the TFI score decreased from 54.6 ± 17.5 to 42.2 ± 16.1 (P = 0.004). However, group P did not demonstrate any significant decrease in the TFI score from 51.2 ± 18.6 to 45.2 ± 20.1 (P = 0.086). The between-arm analysis did not yield any statistical significance decrease in the TFI score (analysis of variance, P = 0.265).

Conclusion

Both combinations of drugs were promising in improving tinnitus severity. However, larger-scale trials with longer follow-up periods are warranted to validate our findings between groups.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^efcce357]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, trazodone, nortriptyline) for tinnitus management reports evidence from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a network meta-analysis (NMA) that failed to show a significant benefit in reducing tinnitus functional impact. The use of fluoxetine alone or in combination with alprazolam improved the tinnitus functional impact (THI) and VAS scores compared with placebo in patients with chronic subjective tinnitus at 4 weeks, whereas TSI scores decreased in both treatment groups without a significant difference between the single therapy and the combination treatment. The use of trazodone in a small study (n = 43) showed no difference in quality of life (QoL) compared with placebo in individuals at up to 8 weeks of follow-up, and there was also no difference in QoL after administration of nortriptyline versus placebo. The Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of antidepressants because of the lack of evidence to support the benefit of using these agents for tinnitus management, with the RCT showing a reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory in the treatment groups while the severity of anxiety in the fluoxetine and control group increased significantly (p = 0.003) and Seven individuals left the combination group as a result of side effects; commonly reported side effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^fe53558d]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Antidepressants

Three RCTs examining the efficacy of antidepressants were identified, providing moderate-to-high level evidence of negligible to large-effect sizes (Table I). Robinson et al.compared paroxetine (up to 50 mg daily, as tolerated) to placebo. They found no significant changes in tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression. Furthermore, they noted several significant adverse events: sexual dysfunction, excessive drowsiness, and dry mouth. Sullivan et al.compared nortriptyline (up to 100 mg at night, as tolerated) to placebo (lactose). They reported a significant reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, score for the intervention group compared to controls. Sub-analysis suggested that those reporting greatest benefit were women and individuals reporting insomnia. Zöger et al.compared sertraline to placebo. They reported significant improvements on the Tinnitus Severity Questionnaireand the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)for the group receiving sertraline compared to placebo. This study is slightly complicated, as nine participants were given oxazepam in the first 2 weeks to alleviate expected worsening of distress. But oxazepam itself is a benzodiazepine, which may have an effect on tinnitus.Zöger et al.reported 24% attrition in this study, but none of the dropouts had received oxazepam, suggesting that it may have affected their result.

In summary, three RCTS examining antidepressants report three different findings. Meta-analysis was not performed.

Anxiolytics

One RCT examined the efficacy of an anxiolytic. Jalali et al.compared alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) with chlorpheniramine (antihistamine), excluding participants scoring more than 14 points on the HAM-A anxiety questionnaire. They found no significant change in THI score between groups. Changes in anxiety and depression were not reported.

Night Sedation

Two RCTs were identified that examined the efficacy of the neurohormone sedative melatonin. Neri et al.compared melatonin (3 mg at night for 80 nights) to a no-treatment control group. There were no significant changes in THI score between groups. Rosenberg et al.compared melatonin (3 mg at night for 30 nights) to placebo (lactose) and also found no significant effect on THI score between groups. Anxiety and depression were not measured in these studies. Meta-analysis was not performed.

### Antidepressants and tinnitus-reply… [^7876e6c3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Golden and Evans point out an important clinical fact that we failed to discuss in our article. 1 Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to produce tinnitus in patients who did not have it before. Most, but not all, of this tinnitus is reversible with discontinuation of the administration of tricyclics. While this fact is important for understanding tinnitus that emerges during the treatment of depression with tricyclics, it may be less important in the treatment of pre-existing tinnitus with antidepressants. All the patients in our trial obviously had tinnitus prior to starting nortriptyline treatment. Very few of our patients reported a worsening of tinnitus when receiving nortriptyline. In those few who reported this, it was always linked to a worsening of the concomitant depressive symptoms. What has been observed in our clinical experience is that if depressive symptoms in a patient with tinnitus can be improved, his/her tinnitus noise improves. Sullivan MD.

### Psychopathological dimensions of tinnitus and psychopharmacologic approaches in its treatment [^74726f5e]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this review to investigate presence of psychopathological states and efficacy of psychopharmacological drugs in the treatment of tinnitus.

Materials and Methods

An extensive Internet search has been performed for this aim through PubMed by using related key words in English.

Results

Higher anxiety and depression levels and somatoform disorder clusters are defined in patients with tinnitus. Additionally, impulsivity, hostility, demanding, physical discomfort, anxiety for health, emotionality and suicidal tendency are also defined in these people. Personality characteristics in these patients are depression, hysteria and hypochondriac features. Besides these symptom clusters, more severe psychopathologies like personality disorders may be encountered in these patients. Sertraline, paroxetine and nortriptyline can be considered as the first-line antidepressants in the psychopharmacological treatment of tinnitus. There are studies which have reported the efficacy of sulpiride. Carbamazepine, valproate and gabapentin can be effective as mood stabilizers. Short-acting benzodiazepines like alprazolam and midazolam are effective in signs of anxiety. Clonazepam and diazepam can be evaluated as other options. However, some glutamate receptor antagonists also can be used in the treatment of tinnitus. Disturbed sleep is frequently associated with tinnitus. Sleep disturbance can disrupt the quality of life in the patients with tinnitus. These patients might benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy, which offers the promise of relief from tinnitus-related distress and insomnia.

Conclusion

When pathophysiologic reasons are excluded, it should be at least considered that tinnitus is exaggerated by psychopathological symptoms. Life quality of patients can be increased by treating these symptoms.

### Antidepressants for patients with tinnitus [^4f0ba7d6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006 and previously updated in 2009. Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. It has been compared with chronic pain, and may be associated with depression or depressive symptoms which can affect quality of life and the ability to work. Antidepressant drugs have been used to treat tinnitus in patients with and without depressive symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of tinnitus and to ascertain whether any benefit is due to a direct tinnitus effect or a secondary effect due to treatment of concomitant depressive states.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 January 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical studies of antidepressant drugs versus placebo in patients with tinnitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors critically appraised the retrieved studies and extracted data independently. Where necessary we contacted study authors for further information.

Main Results

Six trials involving 610 patients were included. Trial quality was generally low. Four of the trials looked at the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on tinnitus, investigating 405 patients. One trial investigated the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a group of 120 patients. One study investigated trazodone, an atypical antidepressant, versus placebo. Only the trial using the SSRI drug reached the highest quality standard. None of the other included trials met the highest quality standard, due to use of inadequate outcome measures, large drop-out rates or failure to separate the effects on tinnitus from the effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression. All the trials assessing tricyclic antidepressants suggested that there was a slight improvement in tinnitus but these effects may have been attributable to methodological bias. The trial that investigated the SSRI drug found no overall improvement in any of the validated outcome measures that were used in the study although there was possible benefit for a subgroup that received higher doses of the drug. This observation merits further investigation. In the trial investigating trazodone, the results showed an improvement in tinnitus intensity and in quality of life after treatment, but in neither case reached statistical significance. Reports of side effects including sedation, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth were common.

Authors' Conclusions

There is as yet insufficient evidence to say that antidepressant drug therapy improves tinnitus.

### Depression and tinnitus [^1a8fbc2f]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with tinnitus are neither depressed nor seriously bothered by their tinnitus. Patients who complain bitterly of tinnitus, however, are often found to have a MDD. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressant drugs helps these patients, especially those who complain of insomnia. Other types of drugs and psychotherapy may also be helpful.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^6b93bed3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants — antidepressants are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 7 RCTs and 1 Cochrane review that failed to demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm. Although 4 of 7 trials showed improvement, these trials had significant methodological limitations, and the Cochrane review included 4 trials of tricyclic antidepressants, 1 trial of trazodone, and 1 trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine); of these trials, 4 are double blind, 1 is single blind, and 1 does not clearly state blinding. Three tricyclic trials showed modest improvement possibly related to depression/anxiety modulation rather than tinnitus change, and commonly reported side effects include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth with more subjects dropping out of treatment groups than placebo; tinnitus is listed as a rare side effect of all available antidepressants.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^6be7b388]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Tinnitus care and research has long been and continues to be a challenge. The efficacy of most tinnitus management interventions recommended for clinical practice remains to be demonstrated conclusively as there are currently too few studies to make informed conclusions. Most studies reviewed here provide only moderate levels of evidence largely due to a lack of power and incomplete data reporting. Interventions most in need of high-level evidence studies are hearing aids/sound enrichment and TRT, whereas the efficacy of therapist-delivered CBT appears to be reasonably established. If audiologists are to deliver CBT, however, this will require new investigation. Although the overall quality of CBT studies is moderate, there is sufficient consistency within these results to be confident of its benefit for tinnitus intrusiveness. In terms of pharmacotherapy, only antidepressant use shows any evidence of potential benefit.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^321210f3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Medical therapy for persistent, bothersome tinnitus — clinicians should not routinely recommend antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for a primary indication of treating persistent, bothersome tinnitus, with Recommendation (against) based on systematic reviews and RCTs with methodological concerns, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B and level of confidence in the evidence is Medium regarding the lack of efficacy of medical therapy as a primary treatment for persistent bothersome tinnitus. Benefits include avoiding unproven therapy, side effects/adverse events (including tinnitus), false hope, and expense, and avoiding use of medications not approved for use in geriatric population, whereas risks, harms, costs are denying some patients benefit; the benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit. Value judgments state evidence is insufficient to justify routine use given known harms, cost of therapy, and potential for some medications (eg, antidepressants) to worsen tinnitus; intentional vagueness notes routine acknowledges individual circumstances; role of patient preferences is Limited with a trial of medication administered based on individual circumstances; exclusions are patients with depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders indicating pharmacologic therapy independent of tinnitus; and the policy level is Recommendation (against). Supporting text emphasizes avoiding routine medications because they have not been shown to alleviate tinnitus and may have adverse effects, that there are no medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of tinnitus, and that no medications have been shown to reliably eliminate or reduce tinnitus perception.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1951 to 2006); EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CINAHL (to 2006), PSYCINFO (to 2006), LILACS (to 2006), and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. The date of the most recent search was March 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical studies of antidepressant drugs versus placebo in patients with tinnitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

The studies retrieved were critically appraised and data extracted independently by two authors. Where necessary study authors were contacted for further information.

Main Results

Five trials involving 525 patients were included. Four of these trials looked at the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on tinnitus, investigating 405 patients. One trial investigated the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a group of 120 patients. No trials involving other antidepressant agents met the inclusion criteria. Only the trial using the SSRI drug met the highest quality standard.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^41138a75]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — medical therapy recommendation (against): Clinicians should not routinely recommend antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for a primary indication of treating persistent, bothersome tinnitus; this is a Recommendation (against) based on systematic reviews and RCTs with methodological concerns, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with a Medium level of confidence, and identified benefits are to avoid unproven therapy, side effects/adverse events (including tinnitus), and false hope while reducing expense, although risks include denying some patients benefit; the benefit–harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit. Value judgments state the evidence is insufficient to justify routine use, with intentional vagueness acknowledging individual circumstances; patient preferences are limited, a trial of medication may be administered based on individual circumstances. Exclusions are patients with depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders that constitute an indication for pharmacologic therapy independent of tinnitus, the policy level is Recommendation (against), and differences in opinion are none.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^94b94e02]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this NMA found that pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effects (i.e. amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) and those with anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (i.e. intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) were associated with superior improvement in tinnitus severity and response rate compared to placebo/control in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin. The main results did not change when focusing RCTs with placebo-controlled. Most treatments showed similar drop-out rate compared to placebo/control. However, because some of the intervention comparisons were based on only a few RCTs and the rating scales of tinnitus severity and other subjective symptoms had widely varied, clinicians should select specific treatments with caution. Based on the statistical result found in the current NMA, we would like to recommend future RCTs investigating brain-acting regimens/modulations targeting abnormal brain hyperactivities and overt oxidative stress in tinnitus without specific or treatable origin.

Appendix C — medication-related considerations in managing patients with bothersome tinnitus note that no medications have been approved by the FDA to treat tinnitus and no cure exists. Providing care focuses on improving QoL with tinnitus, and encouraging patients to address with their health care provider co-occurring conditions that also reduce QoL is useful. Many of these co-occurring conditions can be successfully treated with medication (or other methods), which might contribute to overall improved QoL. Some medications are known to be ototoxic and might lead to or contribute to bothersome tinnitus; however, the risks of these medications must be balanced with the benefits of treatment when considering whether to continue treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue the medication, and if the decision is made to continue a medication believed to contribute to or worsen tinnitus, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.

The search for an effective medication that will eliminate tinnitus has a long history. Currently, no drugs exist that universally cure tinnitus. Pharmacologic interventions that have been investigated can be divided into those that attempt to eliminate the perception of tinnitus, and those that are designed to treat the negative comorbidities associated with tinnitus, thereby mitigating tinnitus' negative impact on quality of life. A third category of drugs can also be considered that addresses an identified pathologic condition that has tinnitus as an associated symptom (for example, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, migraine-associated vertigo). This third category is not addressed.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^efcc73ed]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although tinnitus has a prevalence between 20 and 42.8%, the currently recommended management for tinnitus, such as tinnitus support and psychologic therapies, are relatively time-consuming and expensive. Several new pharmacologic treatments designed for tinnitus patients without specific origin had been developed but their efficacy remains unclear.

Methods

The current Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacologic treatments for tinnitus management in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin (i.e. primary tinnitus). Databases were searched from inception to April 5 th, 2021. All network meta-analytic procedures were conducted under the frequentist model. We calculated the effect size of outcomes with different rating scales with standardized mean difference. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020177742.

Findings

Overall, 36 RCTs were included with 2,761 participants. The main results revealed that pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effect (for example, amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) and those with anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (for example, intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) were associated with superior improvement in tinnitus severity and response rate compared to placebo/control. Oral amitriptyline were associated with the highest improvement in tinnitus severity and the fourth highest response rate. None of the investigated interventions was associated with different changes in quality of life compared to placebo/control. All the investigated treatments were associated with similar drop-out rate to placebo/control.

Interpretation

The current NMA suggests a potential role for treatments with brain-acting effect (for example, amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) or anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (for example, intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) as the preferable effective treatments for tinnitus without specific or treatable origin.

Introduction

Up to 18% of people in industrialised societies are mildly affected by chronic tinnitus, and 0.5% report tinnitus having a severe effect on their daily life. Tinnitus can be associated with hearing loss, acoustic neuromas, drug toxicity, ear diseases, and depression. Tinnitus can last for many years, and can interfere with sleep and concentration.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for chronic tinnitus? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acamprosate; acupuncture; antidepressant drugs; benzodiazepines; carbamazepine; cinnarizine; electromagnetic stimulation; ginkgo biloba; hearing aids; hypnosis; psychotherapy; tinnitus-masking devices; and tinnitus retraining therapy.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^aa1b4997]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To evaluate the existing level of evidence for tinnitus management strategies identified in the UK Department of Health's Good Practice Guideline.

Study Design

Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and meta-analyses.

Methods

Searches were conducted in PubMed, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Web of Science, and EMBASE (earliest to August 2010), supplemented by hand searches in October 2010. Only randomized controlled trials that used validated questionnaire measures of symptoms (i.e., measures of tinnitus distress, anxiety, depression) were included.

Results

Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria, most of which provide moderate levels of evidence for the effects they reported. Levels of evidence were generally limited by the lack of blinding, lack of power calculations, and incomplete data reporting in these studies. Only studies examining cognitive behavioral therapy were numerous and similar enough to perform meta-analysis, from which the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (moderate effect size) appears to be reasonably established. Antidepressants were the only drug class to show any evidence of potential benefit.

Conclusions

The efficacy of most interventions for tinnitus benefit remains to be demonstrated conclusively. In particular, high-level assessment of the benefit derived from those interventions most commonly used in practice, namely hearing aids, maskers, and tinnitus retraining therapy needs to be performed.

4 Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first NMA addressing the efficacy of different pharmacologic management in tinnitus without specific/treatable origin (i.e. primary tinnitus). The main findings of the current NMA were that regimens of pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effect, such as amitriptyline, acamprosate, gabapentin, and melatonin, were associated with significantly better improvement in tinnitus severity or response rate than the placebo/waiting-list groups. Several mechanisms support the effects found in this NMA. Another important finding of the current NMA was the significantly higher response rate of intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin than the placebo/waiting-list group. Most treatments showed similar drop-out rate compared to placebo/control.

The severe tinnitus perception exerted similar abnormal neurotransmitter secretion found in the pain perception in the somatosensory system, which was associated with decreased GABAergic inhibition. Therefore, the prescription of gabapentin, which bound at calcium channel proteins and exerted widely suppressing effect, could imitate the GABAergic effect. Similarly, the amitriptyline, one of the tri-cyclic antidepressant family, had been found to exert its role on nociceptive perception in the central somatosensory system through multiple neurotransmitter system, such as GABA and alpha1-adrenergic receptors. In addition to the theory of abnormal nociceptive perception, the previous systematic review and network meta-analysis had demonstrated that tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin had been found to have significant hyperactivity in brain multiple regions. Therefore, the strategy to reduce the abnormal hyperactivity would exert potential beneficial effects to reduce tinnitus severity. For example, the acamprosate is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain through blocking glutaminergic N-methyl — aspartate receptors and GABA receptors, which efficacy in improving tinnitus would reflect the potential new direction for guiding future research of tinnitus management.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^38171d9f]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In comparison with the previous clinical guidelines, the current NMA did not focus on the traditional management (i.e. tinnitus support and psychologic therapy) to tinnitus, which was relatively time-consuming and expensive. Rather, the current NMA focus on the pharmacologic interventions to manage the tinnitus severity. In addition, the current NMA also focus on the potential placebo effect in the tinnitus management. To be specific, the current NMA found that the oral form placebo exerted significantly beneficial effects in participants with tinnitus (p < 0.001) (Suppl. B, eFig. 3A). However, the CLES of response rates of oral form placebo (i.e. the probability of one random observation from the treated population being larger than another random observation from the control population) was only 24.5%, which was relatively low compared to that of neuropsychiatric disease, such as depression (i.e. 35%−40%). However, the unavoidable placebo effect could also be at least partly explained by the fact that most studies applied subjective rating scales and there was a relative lack of reliable objective investigating tools. Therefore, to develop up an conclusive objective measurements for the severity of tinnitus without specific/treatable origin should be warranted.

We report on a case of unilateral tinnitus after a short course of low-dose amitriptyline for neuralgic foot pain. This has been described in the literature previously at much higher doses and is associated with prolonged administration; we present our case with a review of the current literature in-order to raise awareness of this possible complication of anti-depressant therapy. We also propose a novel hypothesis for the pharmacological basis of amitriptyline-induced tinnitus.

Several potential limitations should be considered. First, this NMA may have been underpowered due to the heterogeneity of the participants (e.g. comorbidities, mood disorder, baseline severity of tinnitus, duration of tinnitus onset, wearing hearing-aids, treatment duration in each study and follow-up duration), variety in the definition of response, variety in tinnitus severity or quality-of-life rating scales, and high risk of bias in 'Random sequence generation' and 'Blinding of participants' in some of the included RCTs. In order to overcome the potential bias on the primary outcome, we arranged subgroup to exclude RCTs without placebo-control, in which the main results would not change. Further, in the subgroup of different duration of tinnitus symptoms, there was no significant difference of placebo effect between the subgroups with different disease duration of tinnitus symptom (p = 0.80), which suggest potentially less impact by the different duration of tinnitus symptom on the primary outcome. As for the heterogeneity of the outcome reporting (i.e. variety in tinnitus severity or quality-of-life rating scales), this was an unavoidable limitation of any NMA investigating subjective outcomes. The tinnitus, just like the depressive symptoms, quality of life, or pain symptoms, was a subjective symptom and lack of objective measurement to measure its severity or to define its treatment response. Currently, there had not been any conclusive golden rating scales to measure its severity. Also, there had been no conclusive evidence to approve the superiority of one rating scales to the others. The choice or selection of one specific rating scales would become an potential source of bias in the network meta-analysis of subjective symptoms. Based on this limitation, we highly recommend future studies to address the need for a gold standard measurement of tinnitus severity, which would appear to be a significant limitation in the tinnitus research field. Further, the results of the future study would be recommended to be rated according to a standardized multi-measure scale. Therefore, the clinicians may pay attention when applied the results of current study in their clinical practice because of the potential difference between the rating scales and the variety of definition of response rate. Second, although the most of the RCTs included a placebo control in their study design, some of the included trials applied waiting list as their control groups. However, the main findings were unchanged after excluding those trials (Suppl. B, eFig. 1D-1E and 2D-2E). Third, given the relatively small number of patients and RCTs, the main results of this NMA should perhaps be conservatively applied in clinical practice. Fourth, despite some heterogeneity among RCTs regarding the control group, when trials were restricted to an oral form of placebo therapy, results were similar. Further, the potential placebo effect was an unavoidable issue in any clinical studies investigating disease of subjective symptoms, such as tinnitus. The overall placebo of the injection form placebo and oral form placebo were 26.4% and 24.5%, which was relatively low compared to that of neuropsychiatric disease, such as depression (i.e. 35%−40%). Fifth, because of small numbers of included RCTs and insufficient direct/indirect comparison between treatment arms, there would be different findings between the primary outcome (i.e. changes of tinnitus severity) and secondary outcome (i.e. response rate). Sixth, although the De Ridder et al. (2021)had provided the clear concept of "tinnitus disorder", the most included RCTs (published from 1993 to 2020) in the current NMA did not apply the concept of "tinnitus disorder". Therefore, we could not make distinguish between the target of "tinnitus vs tinnitus disorder" in the current study. Finally, we only investigated the drop-out rate but not by an adverse events profile because too few studies provided data about adverse events to form a network. Also, there were some other important factors associated with the baseline tinnitus severity, such as quality of life, anxiety mood, depressive mood, and so on. However, we could only perform network meta-analysis of quality of life but not the others because there were too few RCTs providing such data to form a network structure.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^9841333e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus guideline — evidence-based statement categories define how benefits, harms, and evidence quality map to clinician actions. Strong recommendation indicates benefits clearly exceed harms with excellent evidence (grade A or B), and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternate approach is present". Recommendation indicates benefits exceed harms with less strong evidence (grade B or C), and "Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". Option applies when evidence is suspect (grade D) or when well-done studies show little clear advantage between approaches, and "Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role". No recommendation reflects both a lack of pertinent evidence (grade D) and an unclear benefit–harm balance, and "Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role".

### A randomized trial of nortriptyline for severe chronic tinnitus… [^89e6d3c1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Objective: To determine whether the antidepressant, nortriptyline, is effective for treatment of depression, tinnitusrelated disability, and tinnitus symptoms in patients with severe chronic tinnitus. Design: A 12-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: A university otolaryngology clinic. Patients: Ninety-two subjects with severe chronic tinnitus: 38 with current major depression and 54 with depressive symptoms and significant tinnitus-related disability. Intervention: Nortriptyline or placebo. Main Outcome Measures: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Tinnitus Disability Measures, and Audiometric Measures. Results: Nortriptyline was superior to placebo by multivariate analysis of covariance for depression, for tinnitusrelated disability, and tinnitus loudness. When major depression and depressive symptoms groups were considered separately, nortriptyline was superior to placebo on these same measures but differences did not achieve statistical significance. Conclusions: The antidepressant nortriptyline decreases depression, functional disability, and tinnitus loudness associated with severe chronic tinnitus. What appears to be irreversible disability of otologic origin may, in part, be reversible disability of psychiatric origin. Sullivan M, Katon W, Russo J, Dobie R, Sakai C.

It urges conducting clinical trials comparing different counseling treatments and studies comparing the effectiveness of CBT, ACT, and bibliotherapy, as well as in-person versus Internet-based CBT with cost-benefits. It also calls to conduct studies on acamprosate and additional anticonvulsant medications, conduct clinical trials on new therapies such as cochlear implantation and deep brain stimulation, and ensure patient cohorts are stratified by concurrent depression and anxiety when testing antidepressant and anxiolytic medications. Brain stimulation research priorities include studying a variety of techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation and investigating rTMS with longer duration or combined approaches to assess prolonged efficacy.

2.7 Statistical analysis

We estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (95%CIs) for continuous variables (i.e. the primary outcome of tinnitus severity and the secondary outcome of quality of life). For the categorical variables, we used the rate ratio (RR) and 95%CIs (i.e. the secondary outcome of response rates and drop-out rate) and applied a 0.5-zero-cell correction during the meta-analysis procedure. However, if zeroes were present in both the intervention and control arms of one study, we did not apply such a correction procedure because of the risk of increasing the bias; instead, such studies were excluded from our analysis. We used the frequentist model of NMA to compare the effect sizes of studies with similar interventions. All comparisons were performed using a two-tailed t -test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated using the tau value, which is the estimated standard deviation of the effect across the included studies.

We used mixed comparison with generalised linear mixed models to make direct and indirect comparisons. To compare multiple treatment arms, we combined direct and indirect evidence from the included studies. STATA version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC Statistics/Data Analysis StataCorp, TX, USA) was used in our NMA with the mvmeta command. The restricted maximum likelihood method was used to evaluate the between-study variance. To provide additional information for clinical applications, we calculated the relative ranking probabilities of the treatment effects of all treatments for the target outcomes. In brief, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated the percentage of the mean rank of each treatment relative to an imaginary intervention that was the best without uncertainty. When the area under the curve was smaller, the treatment deserved a higher rank of benefit in the treatment of tinnitus.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus — action statements include a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus, and a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: clinicians should perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus; obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (≥ 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months); educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; against Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and against transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group also provided options, stating that clinicians may obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status).

Tinnitus is a common symptom. Standard therapies aim at improving the quality of life and reducing the psychological stress associated with tinnitus. Most interventions have little or no effect on the main symptom. Those affected subjects, however, want such a change and prefer a specific solution, such as pharmacologic therapy to other modalities. Scientific efforts have not yet led to significant improvement in the range of therapies. This article outlines existing efforts and develops ideas on how research for improved tinnitus therapy might look in the future.

The Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of NMDA receptor antagonists because of the lack of evidence to support the benefit of using these agents for tinnitus management, and the harms and burdens of using these treatments slightly outweighed the potential benefits, which were mostly lacking in the evidence reviewed; therefore, it is categorized as a Reviewed, New-added recommendation. Patient values and preferences varied somewhat due to preferences for non-invasive treatments, potential for adverse events, concerns with using medications that lack evidence of benefit, and time to travel for appointments for intratympanic injections.

INTRODUCTION

The "phantom" auditory experience of tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of people in the United Kingdom. It is most clearly associated with noise exposure and ageing and can present with comorbid sleep disturbance, hearing difficulty, social withdrawal, and negative emotional reactions such as anxiety and depression. Although a majority of tinnitus patients are male and present with some form of hearing loss and higher-frequency steeply sloping hearing loss in particular, there is no typical characteristic history or level of distress of the help-seeking tinnitus patient.

In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health issued a Good Practice Guide (GPG) for the commissioning of tinnitus services and for the clinical assessment and management of tinnitus patients. It recommends that tinnitus severity is assessed using either the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)or the Tinnitus Questionnaire. It also recommends that psychological comorbidity is assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventoryor the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). However, questionnaire use in clinical practice is limited.

In terms of management, therapeutic targets include the sound itself (i.e. interrupt the neural signal generating the sound) or the associated symptoms of distress, anxiety, or depression that can accompany tinnitus. The GPG states that tinnitus patients will be given, as appropriate, information/education, hearing aids, counseling and psychological support, relaxation therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with the requisite professional supervision, sleep management (including supervised CBT), sound enrichment therapy, and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). The use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and night sedation is also advocated. However, the GPG lacks an evidence base to support these recommendations and is in part based on anecdotal evidence and expert opinion.

This review asked the question, how much high-level evidence exists for the efficacy of the GPG-suggested tinnitus management strategies, and was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for evaluating therapeutic interventions. A systematic search was used to identify RCTs that examined tinnitus management strategies and reported validated measures of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression, therefore providing comparable measures of change in patient symptoms. Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted. The outcome of this review provides high-level evidence that supports some, but not all, GPG recommended strategies for tinnitus management in the United Kingdom, and also highlights where further RCTs would be of immediate benefit.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The PRISMA Statement outlines the essential components for transparent reporting of a systematic reviewand guided our reporting.

Systematic Search Strategy and Study Selection

Studies were selected and screened according to the research question and PICOS criteria. PICOS were: participants, adult humans with tinnitus; intervention, tinnitus management strategies proposed by the Department of Health (GPG); comparisons, a no-treatment group or suitable second treatment group; outcomes, validated questionnaire measure of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, depression; and study design, randomized controlled trials only. Quasi- and pseudo-randomizations were excluded from this review.

Initial database searches were conducted in August 2010. PubMed, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (including Medline, Toxbase, Biological Sciences), Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched using the search terms: 1) tinnitus AND 2) random AND/OR randomized AND/OR randomised AND 3) information AND/OR education OR hearing AND aid(s) OR counselling OR counseling AND/OR psychological (support) OR relaxation (therapy) OR cognitive AND behavioural OR behavioral AND therapy AND/OR CBT OR sleep AND management OR sound AND enrichment (therapy) OR retraining AND therapy AND/OR TRT OR antidepressant OR depression or anxiolytic OR anxiety OR night AND/OR nocturnal AND sedation. Search results were screened to remove duplicate, non-peer reviewed, and review articles. Two authors (D.J.H. V.L.K.) screened abstracts according to the research question and PICOS criteria. All titles selected by either author were retrieved to screen their full text for final agreement and inclusion. The initial search was complimented with further hand searches of key journals, Cochrane reviews, and the reference lists of all included studies. The stages and reasons for exclusions are presented in Figure 1.

Fig 1
Summary of the systematic literature search.

Data Extraction

Extracted data comprised participant numbers, baseline tinnitus severity, age range, the intervention and control, validated questionnaire measures used, follow-up conducted, the study design, and study findings. For all studies, data was extracted independently by two authors (D.J.H. V.L.K.). Any differences in reporting were reconciled by jointly revisiting the relevant publication.

2.4 Data extraction

Three authors (JJ Chen, YW Chen and BY Zeng) independently screened the studies and extracted the relevant information from the manuscripts. In cases of discrepancy, the corresponding author (PT Tseng) mediated. If data of outcomes of interest were missing from published reports, the corresponding authors or co-authors were approached to obtain the additional data. If the data of outcomes of interest still were unavailable, we will only count the other available outcomes of interest from this RCT in the network meta-analysis of other outcomes. We followed an a priori defined unpublished protocol (available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author) and the flowchart used in previous NMAs.

2.5 Outcomes

2.5.1 Primary outcome

The primary outcome was change in the severity of tinnitus after treatment in patients with tinnitus.

2.5.2 Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes were change in quality of life and response rate related to the treatment in patients with tinnitus. The response rate was defined on the basis of the criteria applied in the included studies. Finally, we assessed the dropout rate, which was defined as the percentage of patients dropping out for any reason before study completion.

2.6 Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Grade ratings

Three independent authors (JJ Chen, YW Chen and BY Zeng) evaluated the risk of bias (interrater reliability, 0.85) for each domain described in the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence, including transitivity, precision, and coherence, according to the GRADE framework and the article by Cipriani, et al.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^992efdb5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Persistent tinnitus — classification and rationale for timing: Clinicians should distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care. Recommendation based on inclusion criteria in RCTs, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on inclusion criteria in RCTs, with level of confidence in the evidence Moderate, and benefit-harm assessment Preponderance of benefit. The majority of RCTs of tinnitus therapies enroll subjects with moderate severity tinnitus of at least 6 months' duration, and a review of 89 RCTs yielded only 1 trial with enrollment limited to new onset tinnitus (less than 3 months' duration) and 1 trial of tinnitus less than 6 months' duration. Another reason for distinguishing those with recent onset tinnitus from those with persistent tinnitus is the potential for resolution of tinnitus within 6 months of onset, and value judgments note that 6 months was a reasonable time to conclude that the tinnitus would likely persist, while risks include deferring treatment that may benefit some tinnitus patients who do not have persistent symptoms.

Systematic evidence review inclusion criteria — tinnitus studies were graded and selected by prespecified thresholds and designs. For precision, the GRADE approach applied "one downgrade for imprecision of a single study with < 200 patients per study arm". Studies "must have enrolled at least 80% of patients who meet the study population criteria: adults with bothersome tinnitus", and if fewer than 80% met this, they "must have presented separate results for this patient subgroup". Each study "must have reported on at least one critical or important outcome of interest". For key questions (KQs), "for all KQs except KQ 1 and 11, studies must have been SRs or prospective RCTs with an independent control group", and "crossover trials were not included unless they reported data for the first phase of the study separately". Additionally, "in addition to RCTs and SRs, KQ 1 and 11 included observational comparative study designs that addressed the specific comparisons outlined for each of these KQs".

RESULTS

Safety and Tolerability of OTO-313 in Patients With Tinnitus (Parts A and B)

Eight patients were randomized in Part A and 35 patients in Part B (Fig. 1). Thirty-one patients in Part B were randomized and completed at least one post-baseline TFI assessment (evaluable set). Overall, treatment groups were similar with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics (Table 1). Two Part B patients assigned to OTO-313 deviated from eligibility criteria and were enrolled with bilateral rather than unilateral tinnitus (bilateral tinnitus was allowed in Part A). Based on audiometry, patients exhibited a wide range of hearing thresholds and most Part B patients had slight or mild hearing loss (based on PTA; 16–25 dB and 26–40 dB, respectively). The use of hearing aids as well as psychoactive medications including those for symptoms related to tinnitus (e.g. antidepressants, medications for anxiety and insomnia) was comparable for OTO-313 and placebo groups and therefore unlikely to have an impact on OTO-313 results in this study (Table 1). Of the OTO-313 treated patients, three of six responders were on stable doses of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications compared with three of eight non-responders, hence the use rate of these medications was similar between responders and non-responders.

TABLE 1
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics

A single intratympanic injection of OTO-313 was well-tolerated and patients who received OTO-313 had a lower incidence of adverse events than placebo (Table 2). There were no adverse events that led to withdrawal, and a very low incidence of tympanic membrane perforation (one OTO-313 patient each in Parts A and B) which resolved by the end of the study. There was one serious adverse event (stress cardiomyopathy), but it was not considered related to study drug. Most adverse events were ear- or injection site-related, were mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved by the end of the study. There were no meaningful changes from baseline in tympanometry, otoscopy, or audiometry. There were no notable changes in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, or assessment of suicidality. Plasma concentrations of gacyclidine were below the limit of assay quantitation (≤ 0.1 ng/mL) for both dose levels at all timepoints confirming limited systemic exposure.

### Tinnitus: diagnosis and management [^1524d245]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is the sensation of hearing a sound in the absence of an internal or external source and is a common problem encountered in primary care. Most cases of tinnitus are benign and idiopathic and are strongly associated with sensorineural hearing loss. A standard workup begins with a targeted history and physical examination to identify treatable causes and associated symptoms that may improve with treatment. Less common but potentially dangerous causes such as vascular tumors and vestibular schwannoma should be ruled out. A comprehensive audiologic evaluation should be performed for patients who experience unilateral tinnitus, tinnitus that has been present for six months or longer, or that is accompanied by hearing problems. Neuroimaging is not part of the standard workup unless the tinnitus is asymmetric or unilateral, pulsatile, associated with focal neurologic abnormalities, or associated with asymmetric hearing loss. Cognitive behavior therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to improve quality of life in patients with tinnitus. Sound therapy and tinnitus retraining therapy are treatment options, but evidence is inconclusive. Melatonin, antidepressants, and cognitive training may help with sleep disturbance, mood disorders, and cognitive impairments, respectively. Avoidance of noise exposure may help prevent the development or progression of tinnitus. Providing information about the natural progression of tinnitus and being familiar with the causes that warrant additional evaluation, imaging, and specialist involvement are essential to comprehensive care.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^d4ae46f7]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

By design, all RCTs reviewed here reported validated measures of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression. Although many authors reported clinically as well as statistically significant changes, some limited their reports to the statistical changes only, which may have no real meaning in the clinic. In similar terms, it is also important to note the significance of nonspecific effects. For example, Rief et al.reported a 5-point reduction in TQ score as a significant improvement compared to waiting-list controls. However, elsewhere in the literature a 5-point reduction in TQ score (from a comparable baseline) was observed between two repeated measures, suggesting that this reduction is within the expected variability or test-retest value of the measure. More thorough reporting of clinical and statistical significance, or the provision of individual scores, is recommended for transparency and to facilitate future meta-analyses.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence base for those tinnitus management interventions recommended by the Department of Health's Good Practice Guide. Where possible, we aimed to identify the conditions under which these interventions are efficacious, and consider whether these interventions are sufficiently researched or in need of further study. We also asked which patients benefit most, but report little on this question due to limited information in those studies reviewed.

In a previous review of RCTs of tinnitus interventions, Dobie did not find any that demonstrated a significant benefit of intervention over typically large placebo effects. He concluded that nowhere in the literature were there studies similar enough to attempt meta-analysis. Two recommendations from that review were that future RCTs needed consensus outcome measures and adequate sample sizes. There is a now reasonable consensus in the tinnitus research community on which validated measures to use. In this review, the most widely used tinnitus questionnaire was the TRQ. It appeared in 10 of the 28 studies and was used here in two separate meta-analyses. However, only seven of 28 studies used a power calculation to estimate their required sample size. Therefore, more than 10 years on, although we have greater RCT-level evidence and some opportunities for meta-analysis, there is still little evidence for the efficacy of most recommended treatment strategies.

It is striking that many authors ascribed null results for changes in depression and anxiety to the fact that participants have low baseline scores, often quoting floor effects. It may well be that, as authors suggest, more distressed individuals are less likely to put themselves forward for clinical trials. However, it may equally be that major depression or other comorbidities are less common than anecdotally suggested. Studies of the prevalence of comorbid depression or anxiety suggest it is no more an issues for tinnitus patients than it is for non-tinnitus ENT patients. Given that the screening and management of anxiety and depression is highlighted in the GPG, more routine clinical assessment of anxiety and depression at baseline and outcome is needed to explore this observation.

VA/DoD tinnitus CPG — GRADE methodology links recommendation strength to evidence confidence, noting that strength is tied to "the confidence in the quality of the evidence on outcomes that are critical to clinical decision making". Topics where rigorous studies are difficult are "typically supported by lower quality evidence and, in turn, Weak recommendations". Per GRADE, "the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation", and "the VA/DoD Tinnitus CPG Work Group did not have the evidence to make strong recommendations for this CPG". The guideline also states that recommendation strength is distinct from clinical importance.

Quality Assessment

Study quality was based on a subset of extracted data. The quality assessment tool was based on one reported previously. For each criterion, a score of 2 was applied if the study met the criterion to a high standard, 1 if it partly met the criterion, or a score of 0 if it was flawed or if the relevant information was not stated. Two authors scored studies independently before agreeing on a final score for each criterion and each study. The potential overall quality score varied from 0 to 16, giving grades of evidence from very low (0–4), low (5–8), moderate (9–12) to high (13–16). Qualitative descriptors for these grades are given in Oxman et al. Essentially, the lower the level of evidence, the more likely further studies are to impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and are likely to change that estimate. Only high-level evidence studies provide conclusive evidence, after which additional research is unlikely to change the estimate of effect.

Data Synthesis and Meta-Analyses

Where studies were sufficiently similar, a meta-analysis was performed. Similarity is defined here as the same intervention and outcome measure, and low heterogeneity. The test for heterogeneity is detailed below. Where studies were not sufficiently similar to conduct a meta-analysis, data were synthesized using a narrative approach. All analyses were performed in R using libraries rmeta, epiR, and meta.

Effect Size Calculation for Individual Studies

For each study, Cohen's d effect size was calculated for the primary treatment intervention and primary measure of change compared to an independent control given by the formula below. An intention-to-treat analysis was used, and follow-up assessments were not included in this analysis. Limited by the available data, standard deviation (SD) of preintervention and precontrol (baseline) scores were used as the group-specific standard deviations of mean change scores within groups.

where

and SDs and Ns are the group-specific standard deviations and sample sizes for study i.

Test for Heterogeneity Across Studies

Heterogeneity (χ²) of aggregated effect sizes were calculated using Cochran's Q statistic (significance level = .05) and I² index (percentages of around 25% indicates low heterogeneity and 0 indicates that sampling error only accounts for all the variability in effect size estimates within studies). Results were checked for significance with K-1 degrees of freedom, where K = number of studies.

We evaluated the potential inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence within the network by using the loop-specific approach and identified local inconsistencies by using the node-splitting method. The design-by-treatment model was used to evaluate global inconsistencies across the entire NMA. We used the comparison adjusted funnel plot and Egger regression to evaluate the potentially small study effects in the order of efficacy of individual treatments. Finally, following the rationale of previous NMA study, we assessed the efficacy of the different kinds of placebo therapy or control (treatment as usual or waiting list) as additional proof of transitivity by computing the severity of tinnitus (Hedges' g) and response rate (event rate) for an oral form of placebo therapy, injection form of placebo therapy, and controls (treatment as usual or waiting list) on the platform of Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). If significant evidence of different effects of placebo therapy or control (treatment as usual or waiting list) by specific placebo therapy/control was found, we arranged sensitivity tests by removing the trial(s) of that specific placebo therapy/control and repeated the main analysis. In addition, in order to investigate the potential impact of different disease duration of the tinnitus symptom on the current NMA, we arrange further evaluation of the potential different placebo effect in the subgroups of different disease duration of the tinnitus symptom as additional proof of transitivity. In order to reduce the potential heterogeneity of the study design, we arranged subgroup analysis focusing on RCTs with placebo-controlled. Finally, in order to improve the methodology reliability of the included RCTs, we arranged subgroup analysis focusing on RCTs with multiple domain rating scales, such as tinnitus handicap inventory, tinnitus handicap questionnaire, and tinnitus severity index.

2.8 Role of funding source

None of the funding source had any role in study design and/or data analysis or interpretation.

Vicious circle of symptoms in tinnitus — Tinnitus severity is positively correlated with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and other psychosocial factors, which can form a "vicious circle" of symptoms, and tinnitus that has been present for six months or more is likely to persist; the treatment of chronic tinnitus is more accurately described in terms of management rather than cure. For some patients, tinnitus can exacerbate co-occurring anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and these co-occurring conditions can affect the severity of tinnitus; effective treatment of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or PTSD might decrease the severity of tinnitus and improve quality of life (QoL). Effective interventions should include management of tinnitus functional impact and associated co-occurring conditions, and when tinnitus negatively impacts patients' health-related QoL, multidisciplinary interventions are often required.

Anxiolytics — anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, should not be used to treat tinnitus, because clinical trials do not consistently show benefit. These medications can have adverse effects, particularly in the elderly, unless dosing is carefully monitored and tailored with drug holidays. Evidence is mixed: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of alprazolam showed decreased tinnitus loudness, whereas another triple-blind randomized crossover trial using chlorpheniramine did not find a significant difference in THI or tinnitus loudness but did find a significant improvement on a visual analogue scale for tinnitus severity. A single-blind randomized study of 66 patients treated with diazepam, flurazepam, oxazepam, clonazepam, and carbamazepine showed improvement on a tinnitus visual analogue scale with oxazepam and clonazepam, but it did not assess tinnitus loudness or use validated questionnaires and subjects received more than 1 medication.

VA/DoD tinnitus guideline — research priorities in complementary and integrative health and pharmacotherapy emphasize evaluating nonpharmacologic and drug-related approaches for tinnitus. Complementary and integrative health priorities are to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different types of acupuncture as a tinnitus intervention, evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different types of complementary and integrative whole health approaches to improve quality of life (QoL) with tinnitus, and evaluate the effectiveness of biofeedback to reduce tinnitus functional impact. Pharmacotherapy research priorities are to use tinnitus assessments (perception and functional impact) as outcome measures in clinical trials of medications designed to regenerate or reactivate hair cells and restore cochlear functions, and to conduct large clinical trials to determine whether effective pharmacological treatment of behavioral/mental health disorders is associated with reductions in tinnitus severity for patients who experience these co-occurring conditions.

Phase 1/2 Study Part B: Safety and Exploratory Efficacy Cohort

Part B objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OTO-313 (primary), assess plasma pharmacokinetics of gacyclidine (secondary), and assess preliminary efficacy of OTO-313 measured by change from Baseline visit in tinnitus functional index (TFI) (secondary). Exploratory objectives were to evaluate efficacy of OTO-313 on tinnitus loudness and tinnitus annoyance using patient reported numeric rating scales (NRS) and on tinnitus global status with patient global impression of change.

Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years, were consistently aware of their tinnitus throughout much of the waking day, had tinnitus that was likely of cochlear origin (e.g. associated with acute hearing loss from noise trauma, barotrauma, blast trauma, middle ear surgery, age-related hearing loss, resolved otitis media, ototoxic drug exposure) and had an onset of tinnitus of 1 to 6 months before signing informed consent. Exclusion criteria included pulsatile tinnitus, tinnitus resulting from traumatic head or neck injury, active middle ear disease including Menière's disease, abnormality or perforation of the tympanic membrane, any ongoing therapy known to be potentially tinnitus-inducing, severe or untreated depression or anxiety, and systemic or intratympanic steroids within 6 weeks before screening. Stable previous treatments (≥ 1 month before screening) of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications, over-the-counter supplements or medications for tinnitus, or use of hearing aids, noise generators, sound therapy devices, and any behavioral therapy for tinnitus were allowed.

What are the effects of treatments for chronic tinnitus. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Tricyclic Antidepressants One small randomized controlled trial in people with depression and chronic tinnitus found that tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo significantly improved tinnitus-related disability, audiometric tinnitus loudness matching, and symptoms of depression, but found no significant difference in tinnitus severity at six weeks. One small RCT in people with tinnitus but without depression found that a greater proportion of people rated themselves as improved with tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo at six weeks. UNKNOWN EFFECTIVENESS Psychotherapy One systematic review found insufficient evidence about effects of cognitive behavior treatment, relaxation therapy, counseling, education, hypnosis, biofeedback, or stress management compared with other or no treatment in people with chronic tinnitus.

Acupuncture; Antiepileptics; Baclofen; Benzodiazepines; Cinnarizine; Electromagnetic Stimulation; Hyperbaric Oxygen; Hypnosis; Low-Power Laser; Nicotinamide; Tinnitus Masking Devices; Zinc. We found insufficient evidence about the effects of these interventions. LIKELY TO BE INEFFECTIVE OR HARMFUL Ginkgo Biloba One systematic review and one subsequent RCT found no significant difference with ginkgo biloba versus placebo in tinnitus symptoms. Tocainide One RCT found no significant difference with tocainide versus placebo in improving symptoms, but found evidence that tocainide caused significantly more adverse effects after 30 days of treatment. Definition Tinnitus is defined as the perception of sound, which does not arise from the external environment, from within the body, or from auditory hallucinations related to mental illness.

This review concerns the management of chronic tinnitus, where tinnitus is the only, or the predominant, symptom in an affected person. Prognosis Tinnitus may have an insidious onset, with a long delay before clinical presentation. It may persist for many years or decades, particularly when associated with a sensori-neural hearing loss. In Ménière's disease, the presence and intensity of tinnitus can fluctuate. Tinnitus may cause disruption of sleep patterns, an inability to concentrate, and depression. 3.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^8b7415d0]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

The aforementioned study by Dornhoffer et al. included 18 patients treated with nortriptyline 20–50 mg daily and 17 patients treated with venlafaxine 37.5–75 mg daily. As discussed earlier, treatment duration was variable, some patients were treated with additional medications or vestibular rehabilitation and only patients who were compliant with medication were analysed. Mean DHI reduced by 16.8 points in the nortriptyline patients and 26.0 points in the venlafaxine patients (both reported as not statistically significant). Venlafaxine 37.5–150 mg daily was compared with propranolol 40–160 mg daily in an unblinded RCT of 64 patients. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) improved to a greater degree with venlafaxine (P = 0.002); however, there were no significant differences between the two groups for the BAI or vertigo outcome measures. A before-and-after analysis of the venlafaxine group showed improvements in mean monthly vertigo frequency (12.2–2.6, P < 0.001), DHI (50.9–19.9, P < 0.001) and subjective vertigo severity (VAS 7.9–1.8, P < 0.01) after 4 months, similar to the improvements seen with propranolol. In another study, 75 patients were systematically allocated 3 months of treatment with low-dose (37.5 mg daily) venlafaxine, flunarizine (10 mg daily) or sodium valproate (500 mg twice daily). A before-and-after analysis of the venlafaxine group showed a reduction in mean monthly vertigo frequency (5.8–3.1, P = 0), VAS vertigo severity (6.0–3.8, P = 0) and total DHI (41.7–31.3, P = 0.001) after treatment. Like the previous study which found superiority of venlafaxine for depressive symptoms, the emotional domain of the DHI improved to a greater degree with venlafaxine compared to the other treatments (P < 0.05). Tolerability of venlafaxine was comparable to the other treatments: discontinuation rate was 13% with venlafaxine and 12% with propranolol in one studyand 22% of patients reported side effects (with none discontinuing treatment) in the other, which was similar to the other medications. It should be noted that a withdrawal syndrome with venlafaxine can complicate its use clinically.

### Intratympanic administration of OTO-313 reduces tinnitus in patients with moderate to severe, persistent tinnitus: a phase 1 / 2 study [^4d437de4]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, OTO-313 treatment was well-tolerated and demonstrated a higher proportion of responders versus placebo based on a 13-point clinically meaningful reduction in TFI scores across consecutive study visits (Week 4 and Week 8). Mean improvements from baseline in TFI, tinnitus loudness, and tinnitus annoyance were numerically higher for OTO-313 compared with placebo. Reductions in TFI scores strongly correlated with improvements in tinnitus loudness, tinnitus annoyance, and PGIC. These findings demonstrate safety and exploratory efficacy of OTO-313 and support further clinical development for the treatment of tinnitus.

Tinnitus — acamprosate randomized controlled trials: Two RCTs compared acamprosate with placebo for tinnitus; in Farhadi et al., patients (n = 20) were randomized to acamprosate (n = 9) or placebo (n = 11) three times daily for 30 days, and despite within-group improvements, between-group analyses showed no differences, with four patients discontinuing due to gastrointestinal adverse events or loss of interest. In Sharma et al., a crossover RCT in patients (n = 40) with tinnitus and varying degrees of sensorineural hearing loss assessed tinnitus severity, QoL, and VAS; acamprosate or placebo was taken three times daily for 40 days followed by a 7-day washout period before crossover, and improvement in tinnitus scores was reported in 92.5% with acamprosate versus 12.5% with placebo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Phase 1/2 Study Part A: Safety Cohort

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2 study was conducted in the United States in two parts, Part A: one site and Part B: 15 sites screened (12 sites randomized). This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03918109) and conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements. The Institutional Review Board (March 18, 2019 by IntegReview #4007596, Investigator: George Atiee, MD) approved the protocol and all participants provided written consent before enrollment.

An initial safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic cohort was conducted where patients with subjective unilateral or bilateral tinnitus received a single intratympanic injection of either 0.11 mg OTO-313 or placebo (Part A, see Text, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Following review by a Safety Review Committee, a follow-on exploratory efficacy cohort took place in patients with subjective unilateral tinnitus of moderate to severe intensity who received a single intratympanic injection of either 0.32 mg OTO-313 or placebo (Part B).

Appendix H patient focus group — findings report that participants stated tinnitus has an impact on multiple aspects of their lives, noted they must remain preoccupied throughout the day to decrease symptom severity, described many daily tasks as nearly unbearable, and emphasized negative effects on personal and professional relationships. Participants emphasized that tinnitus is a neurological condition that can be complicated by or interact with anxiety, sleep disorders, PTSD, and suicidal ideation, and they emphasized the importance of access to an interdisciplinary care team; they also acknowledged the importance of early detection and the need for treating tinnitus as a neurological condition. Participants reported comorbid mental health disorders such as PTSD and anxiety, with one participant having survived two suicide attempts, and they recognized the importance of an interdisciplinary care team in effectively addressing all aspects of their tinnitus.

VA/DoD tinnitus guideline — patient preferences and overall supplement evidence highlight uncertainty and burdens. Some variation occurs in patient preference regarding the management of bothersome tinnitus, and the patient focus group noted that self-management strategies to treat tinnitus varied in effectiveness. No consistent research outcomes exist to prove the efficacy of GB, herbal or dietary supplements, and nutraceuticals to manage tinnitus, and the cost of these supplements and the risk of drug interactions can be burdensome for patients.

Tinnitus assessment — bothersome versus nonbothersome: Tinnitus, as currently understood, has 2 components: perception and reaction, and a clinician may distinguish bothersome from nonbothersome tinnitus by asking if the tinnitus is bothersome and whether the patient would like to pursue further intervention(s), asking if it interferes with communication, concentration, sleep, or enjoyment of life, asking how much time and effort the patient has put into seeking treatments, and administering 1 of several validated questionnaires/ surveys. Distinguishing bothersome from nonbothersome tinnitus will ensure similarity to clinical trial populations, and within the bothersome group a subset may be depressed or even suicidal; these patients warrant immediate psychiatric evaluation and treatment. For patients with bothersome tinnitus, administration of 1 of several validated questionnaires will help characterize the type of tinnitus-related disability and quantify severity, and these instruments will also obtain a baseline assessment to assess the effect of interventions; in addition, the clinician should determine who needs urgent or emergent psychiatric referral, and in patients who appear severely anxious or depressed it can be helpful to ask if they have seen, or have considered seeing, a mental health professional.

Tinnitus — intervention and service research priorities include the following directives: conduct surveys to determine utilization of hearing aids and audiology evaluation for tinnitus and to determine frequency of patient education and counseling in community and academic settings. Conduct studies on acamprosate and other "promising" medical interventions and conduct additional studies on anticonvulsant medications for tinnitus treatment. Conduct studies comparing the effectiveness of CBT, ACT, and bibliotherapy, and conduct clinical trials comparing different counseling treatments; conduct clinical trials on new therapies such as cochlear implantation and deep brain stimulation, and conduct clinical trials on auditory training strategies that could include bone conduction devices or middle ear implants. Conduct studies comparing the effectiveness, as well as cost-benefits, of in-person versus Internet-based CBT; ensure that patient cohorts are stratified by concurrent depression and anxiety in controlled trials of antidepressant and anxiolytic medications. Study a variety of brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation; investigate rTMS using longer-duration schedules or in combination with other methods; and study acupuncture, including electroacupuncture and responses in patients with somatic head and neck disorders.
