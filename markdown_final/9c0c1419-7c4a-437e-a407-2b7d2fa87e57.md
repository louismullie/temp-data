## Question

Is there a cure for peripheral neuropathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a cure for peripheral neuropathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "peripheral neuropathy" is defined and how it is classified by etiology. Then, I should verify whether any disease-modifying therapies exist across major subtypes, including diabetic, chemotherapy-induced, hereditary, and inflammatory neuropathies. Next, I will examine symptomatic treatments and their limitations. After that, I should review prevention strategies and their impact on progression. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and communicate prognosis and management implications for patients and clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its breadth. Peripheral neuropathy encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders of peripheral nerves that can be classified by cause (e.g., metabolic, toxic, hereditary, inflammatory), by distribution (length-dependent versus non–length-dependent), and by pathophysiology (axonal versus demyelinating), and many cases remain idiopathic, which already hints that a universal cure is unlikely given the diversity of mechanisms and stages at presentation [^114xYEFy] [^115S7eq4].

> Now, I need to check whether any subtype has a true cure. For diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy, I should confirm whether any therapy reverses established nerve damage. The best available evidence shows no approved disease-modifying therapy, and management centers on risk-factor modification and symptom control rather than restoration of nerve structure or function, so there is no cure here [^115NQxeo] [^114X6HWA] [^1137Ebuh].

> For chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, hold on, let me verify guideline positions. Multiple high-credibility guidelines conclude there are no proven preventive agents and no curative treatments. Duloxetine is the only agent with modest benefit for painful CIPN, and even that is symptomatic rather than disease-modifying, reinforcing that CIPN is not currently curable [^114rcPfi] [^116vV6qF] [^1123Zx5Y].

> For hereditary neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, I should double-check whether any approved therapy halts or reverses the underlying genetic neuropathy. Current reviews emphasize progress toward targeted therapies but no approved cure exists, so management remains supportive and symptomatic rather than curative at present [^116tX5US].

> But wait, what if the neuropathy is immune-mediated. Let me consider inflammatory neuropathies like Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; here, immunotherapy can be disease-modifying and improve outcomes, yet even in these treatable forms, "cure" is not guaranteed, relapses occur, and residual deficits are common, so calling them "curable" would overstate the clinical reality [^115S7eq4] [^111zXnpY].

> Next, I should review symptomatic management to ensure I'm not conflating symptom control with cure. For painful neuropathic symptoms, agents such as duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, and topical capsaicin can reduce pain, and some combinations may outperform monotherapy, but none restore lost sensation or reverse axonal degeneration, which underscores that these are palliative strategies rather than cures [^111bFbBi] [^116S3rZ3] [^116m9VzN] [^112MXFZq].

> I will now examine prevention and progression-slowing strategies. In type 1 diabetes, intensive glycemic control reduces incident neuropathy, but in type 2 diabetes the effect is modest at best, and once neuropathy is established, progression is difficult to halt, which again argues against a cure once structural nerve injury has occurred [^115NQxeo] [^1111ugsB]. For CIPN, dose modification, substitution, or cessation of neurotoxic chemotherapy can mitigate further injury, but this is prevention or risk mitigation rather than reversal of existing damage, and guidelines still find no proven preventive pharmacologic agents [^112MFufx] [^114rcPfi].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Across the major etiologies of peripheral neuropathy — metabolic, toxic, hereditary, and idiopathic — there is no established cure that reliably reverses established nerve damage. Current care is etiology-targeted risk reduction and symptom control, with the notable exception that some immune-mediated neuropathies respond to immunotherapy without guaranteeing cure, and emerging therapies remain investigational rather than curative in routine practice [^115NQxeo] [^114rcPfi] [^116tX5US] [^115S7eq4].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical implications for prognosis and counseling. Many patients experience chronic, sometimes progressive symptoms, and a subset develop persistent deficits. Clinicians should set expectations around partial improvement, emphasize risk-factor optimization and foot safety, and discuss evidence-based symptomatic options, while also acknowledging that nerve regeneration is limited and that recovery, when it occurs, is often slow and incomplete [^114X6HWA] [^1144A6sc] [^114xYEFy].

---

There is **no cure** for most peripheral neuropathies, but symptoms can be managed and progression slowed with treatment [^114xYEFy]. For diabetic neuropathy, **tight glycemic control** can prevent or slow progression, especially in type 1 diabetes [^115NQxeo], but does not reverse established damage [^114X6HWA]. For chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, **duloxetine** is the only evidence-based treatment for pain [^114rcPfi], but there is no proven cure or prevention [^115etVj5]. Immune-mediated neuropathies (e.g. Guillain-Barré, CIDP) can improve with immunotherapy [^115S7eq4], but relapse is common and long-term deficits may persist [^notfound]. Management focuses on **symptom control**, physical therapy, and addressing underlying causes; recovery is often incomplete and may leave residual deficits [^111AAzWS].

---

## Types of peripheral neuropathy and their curability

Peripheral neuropathy is broadly classified into **several categories**, each with distinct causes, mechanisms, and treatment responses:

| **Type** | **Examples** | **Curability** |
|-|-|-|
| Diabetic neuropathy | Distal symmetric polyneuropathy | No cure; progression can be slowed with glycemic control [^115NQxeo] [^1137Ebuh] |
| Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy | Cisplatin, paclitaxel, vincristine | No cure; symptomatic management only [^114rcPfi] [^115etVj5] |
| Autoimmune neuropathies | Guillain-Barré syndrome, CIDP | Treatable but not curable; relapses common [^111zXnpY] [^115S7eq4] |
| Hereditary neuropathies | Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease | No cure; management is supportive [^notfound] |
| Nutritional neuropathies | Vitamin B12 deficiency | Reversible if treated early [^notfound] |
| Toxic neuropathies | Alcohol, drug-induced | Potentially reversible if exposure stops early [^notfound] |

---

## Current treatments and their limitations

While there is **no definitive cure** for most peripheral neuropathies, several treatments can manage symptoms, slow progression, and improve quality of life:

- **Glycemic control**: Intensive glucose control can prevent or delay diabetic neuropathy, particularly in type 1 diabetes, but has limited effect in reversing established neuropathy [^115NQxeo] [^113KFMbd].
- **Pain management**: Medications such as duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin, and tricyclic antidepressants are used to manage neuropathic pain, but they do not cure the underlying nerve damage [^1118p4c7] [^114pHkgo].
- **Immunotherapy**: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), corticosteroids, and plasma exchange can improve symptoms in autoimmune neuropathies, but relapses are common and long-term remission is rare [^notfound].
- **Physical therapy**: Rehabilitation and physical therapy help maintain function and reduce disability, but cannot reverse nerve damage [^115nwz2F] [^113KFMbd].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Recent research has explored novel therapeutic approaches, including:

- **Gene therapy**: Investigated for hereditary neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, but still experimental [^notfound].
- **Stem cell therapy**: Early-stage research aims to regenerate damaged nerves, but clinical applicability remains uncertain [^notfound].
- **Neurotrophic factors**: Experimental drugs targeting nerve growth factors are being studied to promote nerve regeneration [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis of peripheral neuropathy **varies** with the cause, severity, and timeliness of intervention. Diabetic neuropathy is often chronic and progressive despite optimal glycemic control, with a significant risk of complications such as foot ulcers and amputations [^114X6HWA]. Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy may improve over time, but many patients experience persistent symptoms or permanent nerve damage [^111F9ebX]. Autoimmune neuropathies can show substantial improvement with immunotherapy, but relapses and residual deficits are common [^115S7eq4].

---

## Patient experiences and quality of life

Peripheral neuropathy **significantly impacts** patients' quality of life, causing chronic pain, sensory loss, mobility impairment, and emotional distress [^114onphf]. Many patients express frustration with the lack of effective treatments and the chronic nature of their condition [^113D7jra]. Psychological support, pain management, and lifestyle modifications are essential to improve daily functioning and well-being [^113L7sLZ].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no cure** for most peripheral neuropathies, but symptoms can be managed and progression slowed with appropriate treatment. Early diagnosis, glycemic control, pain management, and immunotherapy for autoimmune cases are key strategies. Emerging therapies such as gene and stem cell therapy offer hope but remain experimental.

### Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy [^114LtEYp]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) causes numerous debilitating symptoms, impairs functional capacity, and results in dose reductions or possible cessation of chemotherapy. Analgesic or neurotropic agents are only modestly effective in treating neuropathic symptoms. Animal and human studies into the pathogenesis of CIPN have demonstrated heterogeneity in the mechanism(s) of nerve injury caused by individual agents, which may partly explain the wide variation in the resultant symptoms. Development of optimal therapeutic measures to treat CIPN requires continued research into the pathophysiologic basis of nerve injury, identification of risk factors for individual patients, development of reproducible and easy-to-use measurement scales, and finally, the performance of appropriately designed clinical trials to evaluate potentially promising agents.

5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy

ADCETRIS treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory. Cases of peripheral motor neuropathy have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced peripheral neuropathy is cumulative.

In studies of ADCETRIS as monotherapy, 62% of patients experienced any grade of peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset was 3 months (range, 0–12). Of the patients who experienced neuropathy, 62% had complete resolution, 24% had partial improvement, and 14% had no improvement at their last evaluation. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement was 5 months (range, 0–45). Of the patients with ongoing neuropathy (38%), 71% had Grade 1, 24% had Grade 2, and 4% had Grade 3.

In ECHELON-1 (Study 5), 67% of patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD experienced any grade of peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of any grade was 2 months (range, 0–7), of Grade 2 was 3 months (range, 0–6) and of Grade 3 was 4 months (range, < 1–7). By the time of the primary analysis, 43% of affected patients had complete resolution, 24% had partial improvement, and 33% had no improvement at their last evaluation. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 2 months (range, 0–32).

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^116S3rZ3]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological Management

Medications form the basis of first- and second-line therapy for neuropathic pain (Table 1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentanoids, tramadol, lidocaine, and capsaicin are the most effective options. Most of these first- and second-line options come with considerable potential for side effects. Depending on the medication, a three- to eight-week trial is recommended with review midway and at the end of the trial to assess effectiveness. If the patient does not receive significant relief or has adverse effects from a medication, then dosing should be adjusted, an alternative medication or combination therapy should be tried, or the patient should be considered for a trial of neurostimulation.

Table 1
First- and second-line medications for neuropathic pain

Tricyclic Antidepressants. TCAs are one of the most studied antidepressants for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Their use as a firstline therapy is supported across multiple guidelines. They have been shown to be effective in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and neuropathic pain post–spinal cord injury and of limited effect in radiculopathy, HIV, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

Peripheral neuropathy has a major impact on quality of life and may limit the amount of treatment patients can receive. Neurotoxic agents are used increasingly in oncologic practice, yet clinicians are often unaware of the protean manifestations of neuropathy and find its management troubling. Recent knowledge about the mechanisms of neuropathic disease and new treatments may help to minimize the impact of neuropathy on this vulnerable patient population.

### From guideline to patient: a review of recent recommendations for pharmacotherapy of painful diabetic neuropathy [^115Lbnan]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2014). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, affecting, by some estimates, up to one quarter of diabetic patients. Since 2010, no fewer than 5 major international treatment guidelines for painful DPN have been issued, and there are meaningful differences among them. Duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin, and tricyclic antidepressants are the mainstays of treatment, but the choice of which class or agent to use in any given patient should be informed by patient characteristics. This review seeks to describe the differences among the recently issued guidelines, to assess the evidence on which they are based, and to offer insight into the most appropriate treatment choices based on patient characteristics.

### Peripheral neuropathies in rheumatic disease – a guide to diagnosis [^115CvkRF]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological disorder that can be associated with a wide range of conditions, including rheumatic disease. Although the association of the two disorders can be coincidental, an underlying pathogenic link can occur in many instances, which can affect treatment options. The presentation of peripheral neuropathy can be multifaceted, an important consideration when recognizing the condition and optimizing diagnosis. Furthermore, understanding the diagnostic strategy will help physicians treating patients with rheumatic disease who develop peripheral neuropathy. Finally, although available treatment options have greatly reduced the risk of patients with inflammatory disorders developing systemic complications, among which includes peripheral neuropathy, new therapeutic agents can trigger toxic or immune-mediated neuropathies and treatment will need to be adjusted accordingly. In this Review, we will discuss the general approach for diagnosing patients with peripheral neuropathy, and detail the presentation, pathophysiological features and general rules of treatment of patients with peripheral neuropathy in the context of rheumatic disease.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy – A survey of patient experiences [^113D7jra]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

An online survey was conducted in the USA to obtain information about the knowledge and experiences of patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN).

Patients and Methods

506 adults with diabetes and pDPN affecting the feet for ≥ 6 months, for which pain medication had been prescribed for ≥ 6 months, completed an online survey questionnaire in March 2021.

Results

79% of respondents had type 2 diabetes, 60% were male, 82% were Caucasian and 87% had comorbidities. Pain was significant to severe in 49% of respondents, and 66% had disability due to nerve pain. Anticonvulsants, over-the-counter pills and supplements were the most commonly used medications. Topical creams/patches were prescribed in 23% of respondents. 70% had tried multiple medications for their pain. 61% of respondents had to see ≥ 2 doctors before receiving a correct diagnosis of pDPN. 85% of respondents felt that the doctor understood their pain and its impact on their life. 70% had no difficulty finding the information they wanted. 34% felt insufficiently informed about their condition. A medical professional was the primary, and most trusted, source of information. Frustration, worry, anxiety and uncertainty were the most commonly reported emotions. Respondents were generally eager to find new medications for pain relief and desperate for a cure. Lifestyle changes because of nerve pain were most commonly associated with physical disabilities and sleep disturbance. Better treatments and freedom from pain were the overriding perspectives when considering the future.

Conclusion

Patients with pDPN are generally well informed about their pain and trust their doctor but remain unsatisfied with their current treatment and struggle to find a lasting solution for their pain. Early identification and diagnosis of pain in diabetics, and education about treatments, is important to minimize the impact of pain on quality of life and emotional well-being.

### Management options for established chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^116b4K13]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and debilitating condition associated with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. Clinicians are cognizant of the negative impact of CIPN on cancer treatment outcomes and patients' psychosocial functioning and quality of life. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, clinicians and patients try various therapeutic interventions, despite limited evidence to support efficacy of these treatments. The rationale for such use is mostly based on the evidence for the treatment options in non-CIPN peripheral neuropathy syndromes, as this area is more robustly studied than is CIPN treatment. In this manuscript, we examine the existing evidence for both CIPN and non-CIPN treatments and develop a summary of the best available evidence with the aim of developing a practical approach to the treatment of CIPN, based on available literature and clinical practice experience.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^114KNuRm]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Painful DPN, a highly prevalent and disabling complication of diabetes, impacts negatively on patient function and HR-QoL and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. A variety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological options are available to treat painful DPN which may be combined as part of an individualized, comprehensive pain management plan. Healthcare providers are encouraged to increase their familiarity with the available options and to incorporate a comprehensive understanding of the clinical evidence substantiating their efficacy. In recognition of the needs of this fast-growing segment of the diabetic population, research into painful DPN has become increasingly active. Numerous studies are underway evaluating drugs with novel mechanisms of action and various noninvasive electrical stimulation devices. Beyond providing more effective pain relief, identifying disease-modifying interventions that can prevent or reverse the nerve damage associated with DPN should be a research priority. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations should be conducted to determine whether the enormous healthcare burden associated with painful DPN might be mitigated to some extent through the use of modern treatments with greater efficacy and improved tolerability relative to conventional oral agents, despite their higher acquisition costs.

### 3 versus 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combination therapy for colorectal cancer (SCOT): an international, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^116GWD4i]. The Lancet: Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

The major cumulative chronic toxic effect of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is sensory peripheral neuropathy, which can be disabling. This effect is recognised to be dependent on dose and duration and can be long-lasting. As most patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy are cured and will survive, long-term, irreversible peripheral neuropathy is a significant issue.

The current standard duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer is 6 months. A shorter duration of adjuvant chemotherapy would be expected to result in less chronic peripheral neuropathy, but it has been hitherto unknown to what, if any, extent cutting duration would compromise its efficacy. The results of one studyusing fluoropyrimidine alone, which was not powered for non-inferiority, suggested that 3 months of infused fluoropyrimidine was similar to 6 months of bolus fluoropyrimidine treatment in terms of disease-free survival.

The SCOT study was designed as a stand-alone international phase 3 non-inferiority study to investigate whether 3 months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer is non-inferior to 6 months of treatment with the same regimen. Here we report the final efficacy results of disease-free survival and the toxicity and quality-of-life (QoL) results.

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^117Nkojt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — treatment of established chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) states that for treatment of established painful neuropathy, duloxetine remains the sole recommended treatment, and when patients stop duloxetine, it should be tapered slowly, as stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms. The guideline recommends against acetyl-l-carnitine for the treatment of established chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. There were 3 treatments that were inconclusive in the original guideline but "reasonable to try in some situations" — tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids, and a topical gel containing baclofen, amitriptyline, and ketamine — and there is waning enthusiasm regarding them; currently, the use of tricyclic antidepressants does not appear to be common because of their lack of established benefit and/or their unfavorable side effects. Regarding topical baclofen, amitriptyline, and ketamine, reasons to be less enthusiastic now include that (1) no additional trials have been conducted, (2) there is not an US Food and Drug Administration–approved product and compounding is required, and (3) a subsequent publication of a negative trial of topical amitriptyline and ketamine. For gabapentinoids, with the 1 older placebo-controlled clinical trial showing no benefit for gabapentin and 2 subsequent pregabalin prevention trials (1 for paclitaxel and 1 for oxaliplatin), trials failed to provide evidence of benefit.

### Immunotherapy in peripheral neuropathies [^111zXnpY]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy has been investigated in a small subset of peripheral neuropathies, including an acute one, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and 3 chronic forms: chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and neuropathy associated with IgM anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein. Several experimental studies and clinical data are strongly suggestive of an immune-mediated pathogenesis. Either cell-mediated mechanisms or antibody responses to Schwann cell, compact myelin, or nodal antigens are considered to act together in an aberrant immune response to cause damage to peripheral nerves. Immunomodulatory treatments used in these neuropathies aim to act at various steps of this pathogenic process. However, there are many phenotypic variants and, consequently, there is a significant difference in the response to immunotherapy between these neuropathies, as well as a need to improve our knowledge and long-term management of chronic forms.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in adult cancer survivors — evidence base and study quality: The review identified 31 prevention and 14 treatment publications that met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the guideline updated recommendations, and study quality was assessed for 45 intervention studies; systematic reviews and meta-analyses were evaluated using the AMSTAR tool with AMSTAR scores ranging from 8 to 9 out of a possible 11 points. Randomized controlled trials ranged from low to high overall risk of bias, studies were heterogeneous in populations, methods, and outcomes, and this diversity precluded a quantitative analysis so only a qualitative review was performed.

FDA-Approved Treatments for Painful DPN

Five treatments are currently approved by the FDA to treat painful DPN based on their efficacy and safety in RCTs in this patient population. These include three oral medications (duloxetine, pregabalin, and tapentadol extended release [ER]); one topical agent (capsaicin 8% topical system); and low- and high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices indicated for the treatment of chronic intractable painful DPN, which is defined as constant moderate to severe pain that has no known cure and requires daily medical treatment.

Table 2 summarizes the year of approval, indication, contraindications, and most common adverse events reported with the use of FDA-approved options to treat DPN. Although pain-related endpoints among RCTs differed to some extent, all treatments were associated with significant improvements from baseline in pain scores relative to placebo or standard therapy, as well as increases in the proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful pain response (ie, a ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% improvement in pain score).

Table 2
Current FDA-Approved Options for the Management of Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (Trade name; Year of FDA Approval for Painful DPN)

In reverse chronological order of their FDA approval, the efficacy and safety of these treatments in their pivotal RCTs are examined, with emphasis on the two most recently approved options (ie, SCS devices and the capsaicin 8% topical system).

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^111CskEQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Acute neuropathy characteristics — oxaliplatin and paclitaxel — indicate that both agents cause acute neuropathy; oxaliplatin-induced acute neuropathy is characterized by cold sensitivity, throat discomfort, discomfort swallowing cold liquids, and muscle cramps, with severity usually peaking 2 to 3 days after each dose, increasing such that symptom severities double in magnitude with subsequent cycles, and not returning to baseline between cycles when administered once every 2 weeks; paclitaxel frequently causes a pain syndrome occurring in the days following each dose with a similar time pattern, peaking approximately 2 to 3 days after each dose, and the symptom complex is primarily a pain in a truncal/hip distribution.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^111pMTts]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common finding in patients with peripheral nerve injury. It has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a pain "caused by lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system". Peripheral neuropathic pain is typically chronic in nature and is caused by a heterogenous group of diseases. It has an estimated prevalence of between 6.9% and 10% of the population. It is typically described as a "pins and needles", burning, cramping, or tingling pain by patients. Prior research has demonstrated that neuropathic causes of pain may be underrecognized and inadequately managed. In this review, we seek to briefly outline the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathic pain and provide a comprehensive list of non‐interventional treatment approaches.

### Painful peripheral neuropathy and its nonsurgical treatment [^111AAzWS]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of neuropathic pain is the primary focus of management for many patients with painful peripheral neuropathy. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants are the two pharmacological classes most widely studied and represent first-line agents in the management of neuropathic pain. The number of pharmacological agents that have demonstrated effectiveness for neuropathic pain continues to expand. In the current review, we summarize data from randomized, controlled pharmacological trials in painful peripheral neuropathies. Although neuropathic pain management remains challenging because the response to therapy varies considerably between patients, and pain relief is rarely complete, a majority of patients can benefit from monotherapy using a well-chosen agent or polypharmacy that combines medications with different mechanisms of action.

Guidelines for Managing Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN)

The management of painful DPN involves controlling the underlying diabetic condition and symptomatically treating the associated pain, as recommended in multiple clinical practice guidelines and expert reviews. Given their influence and importance in determining recommendations in other relevant expert opinions and reviews, we have focused on evidence-based guidelines and recommended treatment algorithms from the following US organizations:
American Academy of Neurology (AAN): Published in December 2021, the Oral and Topical Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: Practice Guideline Update Summaryprovides updated recommendations on the treatment of painful DPN. Graded recommendations for the use of numerous drug classes and individual agents are based on a systematic and statistical analysis of the results of 133 relevant peer-reviewed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).
American Diabetes Association (ADA): Three publications guiding the treatment of painful DPN are available from the ADA. Diabetic Neuropathy: A Position Statementwas published in 2017 and provides graded recommendations on all aspects of DPN management — including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment — based on several technical reviews and associated supporting references. The clinical compendium on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathyand Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes‒2022, were published in 2022. The clinical compendium focuses on the screening, diagnosis and treatment of painful DPN in routine clinical practice, and summarizes the latest guidance on effective therapies, including pharmacological agents, nutraceutical products, and non-pharmacological therapies. Guidance on treating painful DPN is also provided in Chapter 12: Retinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Careof the updated Standard of Medical Care in Diabetes ‒2022.
American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE). Published in 2022, the AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan‒2022 Updateprovides graded recommendations for the care of diabetic patients, including diagnosis and management of DPN, based on a comprehensive search and appraisal of the current literature.

### Recent developments of novel pharmacologic therapeutics for prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^115WNtTH]. Clinical Cancer Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and dose-limiting toxicity, negatively affecting both quality of life and disease outcomes. To date, there is no proven preventative strategy for CIPN. Although multiple randomized trials have evaluated a variety of pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of CIPN, only duloxetine has shown clear efficacy in a phase III study. The National Cancer Institute's Symptom Management and Health-Related Quality of Life Steering Committee has identified CIPN as a priority for translational research in cancer care. Promising advances in preclinical research have identified several novel preventative and therapeutic targets, which have the potential to transform the care of patients with this debilitating neurotoxicity. Here, we provide an overarching view of emerging strategies and therapeutic targets that are currently being evaluated in CIPN.

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^115n11ZW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy diagnosis and testing relies primarily on clinical history, as the diagnosis of the more chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can generally be made by clinical history and if a patient receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy develops new or worsening numbness, tingling, and/or pain in their hands and/or feet without another good reason, then the diagnosis is made; neurologic physical examination can be abnormal, electromyography (EMG) can be used but is not usually necessary, and although nerve conduction studies in asymptomatic patients can predict the development or worsening of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), these tests are not routinely used.

### Diabetic neuropathy: clinical manifestations and current treatments [^1111ugsB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a prevalent, disabling disorder. The most common manifestation is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP), but many patterns of nerve injury can occur. Currently, the only effective treatments are glucose control and pain management. While glucose control substantially decreases the development of neuropathy in those with type 1 diabetes, the effect is probably much smaller in those with type 2 diabetes. Evidence supports the use of specific anticonvulsants and antidepressants for pain management in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, the lack of disease-modifying therapies for diabetic DSP makes the identification of new modifiable risk factors essential. Growing evidence supports an association between components of the metabolic syndrome, including prediabetes, and neuropathy. Studies are needed to further explore this association, which has implications for the development of new treatments for this common disorder.

### NCCN guidelines for survivorship expanded to address two common conditions [^114PqoiF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Survivorship include a new section on cancer-associated cognitive impairment and an expanded section on adult cancer pain that more completely addresses chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. These additions to the guidelines are the result of increasing awareness that long-term cancer survivors struggle with many late effects. Both the assessment and the management of cognitive impairment still lack a strong evidence-based foundation. The management of peripheral neuropathy, including the use of anti-depressants and opioids, often in combination, is backed by data primarily derived from clinical trials performed for various types of peripheral neuropathy.

### Pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management of diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy [^114X6HWA]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus and is associated with increased mortality, lower-limb amputations and distressing painful neuropathic symptoms (painful DSPN). Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease has largely been derived from animal models, which have identified key potential mechanisms. However, effective therapies in preclinical models have not translated into clinical trials and we have no universally accepted disease-modifying treatments. Moreover, the condition is generally diagnosed late when irreversible nerve damage has already taken place. Innovative point-of-care devices have great potential to enable the early diagnosis of DSPN when the condition might be more amenable to treatment. The management of painful DSPN remains less than optimal; however, studies suggest that a mechanism-based approach might offer an enhanced benefit in certain pain phenotypes. The management of patients with DSPN involves the control of individualized cardiometabolic targets, a multidisciplinary approach aimed at the prevention and management of foot complications, and the timely diagnosis and management of neuropathic pain. Here, we discuss the latest advances in the mechanisms of DSPN and painful DSPN, originating both from the periphery and the central nervous system, as well as the emerging diagnostics and treatments.

### Expert panel consensus statement on the optimal use of pomalidomide in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma [^1137h2Pz]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy

Peripheral neuropathy is a common and potentially treatment-limiting adverse event associated with thalidomide and bortezomib, but lenalidomide does not appear to cause substantial neurotoxicity. Although patients with grade ⩾2 peripheral neuropathy were excluded from pomalidomide trials, the incidence of newly occurring or worsening peripheral neuropathy during pomalidomide treatment was low. In MM-002, no cases of grade 3–4 peripheral neuropathy were observed despite the fact that 73% of patients in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone arm had a history of peripheral neuropathy. In MM-003, 15% of patients treated with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone developed any-grade treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy; 52% of these cases had grade 1 peripheral neuropathy at baseline. The incidence of grade 3–4 peripheral neuropathy was ≤ 2% in both treatment arms.

For patients who develop grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, pomalidomide treatment should be interrupted, but may be resumed at a lower dose if the neuropathy resolves to grade 0–1; pomalidomide should be discontinued in patients who develop grade 4 peripheral neuropathy (Figure 5).

### Stratified analyses for selecting appropriate target patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy for long-term treatment with an aldose reductase inhibitor, epalrestat [^116z69qB]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

As it is not expected that cure of diabetes mellitus will be achieved, management of this condition focuses on maintaining long-term glycaemic control and reducing the occurrence and progression of diabetes-related complications, including diabetic neuropathy. If diabetic neuropathy symptoms deteriorate or persist, they can cause immeasurable mental and physical stress to patients; serious complications such as ulcers or necrosis may culminate in amputation of an appendage. Diabetic neuropathy is often associated with considerable mortality. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to diagnose diabetic neuropathy immediately and provide an appropriate response to various risk factors for the development and progression of diabetic neuropathy.

The first priority in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy is to maintain long-term glycaemic control. However, even when strict glycaemic control is achieved via traditional treatments, the occurrence and progression of diabetes-related complications remain unavoidable. One important metabolic factor underlying diabetic neuropathy is an enhanced polyol pathway. Suppression of this pathway may be an important treatment strategy for diabetic neuropathy.

Diabetic neuropathy involves diverse symptoms such as spontaneous pain and numbness. Patients often complain of multiple symptoms. To determine distress in individual patients, numerous studies have calculated scores for multiple symptoms. In this study, we conducted stratified analyses based on background variables, using the mean VAS score for 10 symptoms and the mean VAS score for four symptoms of lower extremities, with the aim of identifying patients expected to respond better to epalrestat therapy. The results indicated that achievement of symptom amelioration differed significantly between the epalrestat group and the control group for patients with HbA₁c < 7.0% or < 9.0%, with no or background retinopathy and no proteinuria. These results are consistent with those from stratified analyses on median MNCV reported previously and provide evidence from both aspects of nerve function and subjective symptoms that epalrestat is more effective in patients with good glycaemic control and limited complications.

### Association of an inherited genetic variant with vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^11431nbg]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

With cure rates of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeding 85%, there is a need to mitigate treatment toxicities that can compromise quality of life, including peripheral neuropathy from vincristine treatment.

Objective

To identify genetic germline variants associated with the occurrence or severity of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in children with ALL.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Genome-wide association study of patients in 1 of 2 prospective clinical trials for childhood ALL that included treatment with 36 to 39 doses of vincristine. Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy were assessed in 321 patients from whom DNA was available: 222 patients (median age, 6.0 years; range, 0.1–18.8 years) enrolled in 1994–1998 in the St Jude Children's Research Hospital protocol Total XIIIB with toxic effects follow-up through January 2001, and 99 patients (median age, 11.4 years; range, 3.0–23.8 years) enrolled in 2007–2010 in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol AALL0433 with toxic effects follow-up through May 2011. Human leukemia cells and induced pluripotent stem cell neurons were used to assess the effects of lower CEP72 expression on vincristine sensitivity.

Exposure

Treatment with vincristine at a dose of 1.5 or 2.0 mg/m².

Main Outcomes and Measures

Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy was assessed at clinic visits using National Cancer Institute criteria and prospectively graded as mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), serious/disabling (grade 3), or life threatening (grade 4).

Results

Grade 2 to 4 vincristine-induced neuropathy during continuation therapy occurred in 28.8% of patients (64/222) in the St Jude cohort and in 22.2% (22/99) in the COG cohort. A SNP in the promoter region of the CEP72 gene, which encodes a centrosomal protein involved in microtubule formation, had a significant association with vincristine neuropathy (meta-analysis P = 6.3×10⁻⁹). This SNP had a minor allele frequency of 37% (235/642), with 50 of 321 patients (16%; 95% CI, 11.6%-19.5%) homozygous for the risk allele (TT at rs924607). Among patients with the high-risk CEP72 genotype (TT at rs924607), 28 of 50 (56%; 95% CI, 41.2%-70.0%) developed at least 1 episode of grade 2 to 4 neuropathy, a higher rate than in patients with the CEP72 CC or CT genotypes (58/271 patients [21.4%; 95% CI, 16.9%-26.7%]; P = 2.4×10⁻⁶). The severity of neuropathy was greater in patients homozygous for the TT genotype compared with patients with the CC or CT genotype (2.4-fold by Poisson regression [P < .0001] and 2.7-fold based on mean grade of neuropathy: 1.23 [95% CI, 0.74–1.72] vs 0.45 [95% CI, 0.3–0.6]; p = 0.004 by t test). Reducing CEP72 expression in human neurons and leukemia cells increased their sensitivity to vincristine.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this preliminary study of children with ALL, an inherited polymorphism in the promoter region of CEP72 was associated with increased risk and severity of vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy. If replicated in additional populations, this finding may provide a basis for safer dosing of this widely prescribed anticancer agent.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: consensus recommendations on diagnosis, assessment and management [^1118p4c7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is common, is associated with significant reduction in quality of life and poses major treatment challenges to the practising physician. Although poor glucose control and cardiovascular risk factors have been proven to contribute to the aetiology of DPN, risk factors specific for painful DPN remain unknown. A number of instruments have been tested to assess the character, intensity and impact of painful DPN on quality of life, activities of daily living and mood. Management of the patient with DPN must be tailored to individual requirements, taking into consideration the co-morbidities and other factors. Pharmacological agents with proven efficacy for painful DPN include tricyclic anti-depressants, the selective serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors, anti-convulsants, opiates, membrane stabilizers, the anti-oxidant alpha-lipoic acid and topical agents including capsaicin. Current first-line therapies for painful DPN include tricyclic anti-depressants, the serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor duloxetine and the anti-convulsants pregabalin and gabapentin. When prescribing any of these agents, other co-morbidities and costs must be taken into account. Second-line approaches include the use of opiates such as synthetic opioid tramadol, morphine and oxycodone-controlled release. There is a limited literature with regard to combination treatment. In extreme cases of painful DPN unresponsive to pharmacotherapy, occasional use of electrical spinal cord stimulation might be indicated. There are a number of unmet needs in the therapeutic management of painful DPN. These include the need for randomized controlled trials with active comparators and data on the long-term efficacy of agents used, as most trials have lasted for less than 6 months. Finally, there is a need for appropriately designed studies to investigate non-pharmacological approaches.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^113L7sLZ]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychological interventions play a crucial role in managing peripheral nerve pain by addressing various dimensions of the condition. These interventions assist individuals in coping with pain‐related distress, managing emotional challenges like anxiety and depression, and reframing negative thought patterns, thereby contributing significantly to the management of chronic pain. By focusing on enhancing coping skills and altering pain perceptions, these therapies aim to improve overall quality of life for those experiencing persistent pain.

It is important to note that while psychological treatments hold promise in managing peripheral nerve pain, they are often most effective when combined with medical interventions. This comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach aims to holistically address the multifaceted nature of chronic pain, leading to better outcomes and an improved quality of life for individuals navigating persistent pain.

3.4 Lifestyle approaches

Lifestyle Medicine approaches may be helpful in certain conditions with peripheral neuropathic pain. The field of Lifestyle Medicine is a rapidly growing area of interest among health professionals of many disciplines, centered on six fundamental pillars: whole food plant‐based nutrition, physical activity, stress management, avoidance of risky substances, restorative sleep, and positive social connections. This approach uses evidence‐based, whole‐person, prescriptive lifestyle changes as a primary modality to treat and, when used intensively, often improves, or reverses several chronic health conditions by treating the underlying cause. The Association of Academic Physiatrists, American Academy of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, and American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine have recently incorporated Lifestyle Medicine content into national meetings.

Peripheral neuropathic pain can be caused by as well as treated by lifestyle factors. The etiology of nerve pain may be related to a problem primarily affecting the nerves or a secondary musculoskeletal problem, leading to nerve impingement. Median neuropathy at the wrist has been associated with several risk factors that can be in part lifestyle‐related, including obesity, diabetes, renal failure, congestive heart failure, and autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease may be partially caused by or exacerbated by lifestyle risk factors as well, such as obesity and smoking, affecting the spine via mechanical and biochemical pathophysiological processes, resulting in decreased nutrient availability, structural changes, inflammation and neoinnervation of the intervertebral disc, leading to disc degeneration and herniation. Furthermore, smoking cessation can lead to clinically meaningful improvement in patients with chronic back pain.

### Novel insights on diagnosis, cause and treatment of diabetic neuropathy: focus on painful diabetic neuropathy [^114GWyPv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is common, under or misdiagnosed, and causes substantial morbidity with increased mortality. Defining and developing sensitive diagnostic tests for diabetic neuropathy is not only key to implementing earlier interventions but also to ensure that the most appropriate endpoints are employed in clinical intervention trials. This is critical as many potentially effective therapies may never progress to the clinic, not due to a lack of therapeutic effect, but because the endpoints were not sufficiently sensitive or robust to identify benefit. Apart from improving glycaemic control, there is no licensed treatment for diabetic neuropathy, however, a number of pathogenetic pathways remain under active study. Painful diabetic neuropathy is a cause of considerable morbidity and whilst many pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are currently used, only two are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We address the important issue of the 'placebo effect' and also consider potential new pharmacological therapies as well as nonpharmacological interventions in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^111CCnvM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update the ASCO guideline on the recommended prevention and treatment approaches in the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in adult cancer survivors.

Methods

An Expert Panel conducted targeted systematic literature reviews to identify new studies.

Results

The search strategy identified 257 new references, which led to a full-text review of 87 manuscripts. A total of 3 systematic reviews, 2 with meta-analyses, and 28 primary trials for prevention of CIPN in addition to 14 primary trials related to treatment of established CIPN, are included in this update.

Recommendations

The identified data reconfirmed that no agents are recommended for the prevention of CIPN. The use of acetyl-l-carnitine for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer should be discouraged. Furthermore, clinicians should assess the appropriateness of dose delaying, dose reduction, substitutions, or stopping chemotherapy in patients who develop intolerable neuropathy and/or functional impairment. Duloxetine is the only agent that has appropriate evidence to support its use for patients with established painful CIPN. Nonetheless, the amount of benefit from duloxetine is limited. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity [^112yCxLB]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is clinically relevant because it is frequent, it might be dose-limiting, it affects the cancer survivors' quality of life, and no treatment is available. Better understanding of CIPN might lead to an improvement in its management.

Recent Findings

Conventional chemotherapy is a well known cause of peripheral neurotoxicity, which mostly manifest with sensory impairment. CIPN has also been described for new, highly effective compounds, which are, therefore, limited in their more widespread use. Even several 'targeted drugs', which should be free from the risk of CIPN by definition, are neurotoxic, occasionally inducing severe motor impairment.

Summary

Precise definition of CIPN clinical features can be obtained by only using validated outcome measures. Therefore, a major aim of clinical research is to standardize CIPN assessment, also considering that healthcare providers and patients frequently have a different perception of CIPN severity. A second major aim in clinical research is to maintain a high level of attention to the possible neurotoxicity of drugs more recently introduced into clinical practice. Preclinical studies are of pivotal importance to identify druggable targets for pharmacological intervention in order to prevent or limit CIPN.

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy: prevention and treatment [^114pHkgo]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Consistent screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure, and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic, objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### National cancer institute-supported chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy trials: outcomes and lessons [^114Eidki]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most common and debilitating complications of cancer treatment. Due to a lack of effective management options for patients with CIPN, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored a series of trials aimed at both prevention and treatment. A total of 15 such studies were approved, evaluating use of various neuro-modulatory agents which have shown benefit in other neuropathic pain states. Aside from duloxetine, none of the pharmacologic methods demonstrated therapeutic benefit for patients with CIPN. Despite these disappointing results, the series of trials revealed important lessons that have informed subsequent work. Some examples of this include the use of patient-reported symptom metrics, the elimination of traditional — yet unsubstantiated — practice approaches, and the discovery of molecular genetic predictors of neuropathy. Current inquiry is being guided by the results from these large-scale trials, and as such, stands better chance of identifying durable solutions for this treatment-limiting toxicity.

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes: too little too late [^1137Ebuh]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes is poorly managed because of its insidious onset, delayed diagnosis and more complex aetiology resulting from the contribution of not only hyperglycaemia, but also ageing, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and obesity. Because there is no US Food and Drug Adminstration-approved disease-modifying therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the key to ameliorating it in type 2 diabetes has to be through earlier diagnosis and timely multi-factorial risk factor reduction. The management of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy also requires a detailed appraisal of the choice of therapy, taking into account efficacy, patient wishes, comorbidities, side effect profile and potential for abuse.

### Therapy of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^11235p58]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is still a common and disabling side effect of many chemotherapy agents in use today. Unfortunately, neither prophylactic strategies nor symptomatic treatments have proven useful yet. This review will discuss the diagnosis and evaluation of neuropathy in cancer patients, as well as reviewing the various prophylactic and symptomatic treatments that have been proposed or tried. However, sufficient evidence is lacking to recommend any of these treatments to patients suffering with CIPN. Therefore, the best approach is to treat symptomatically, and to start with broad-spectrum analgesic medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If NSAIDs fail, a reasonable second-line agent in properly selected patients may be an opioid. Unfortunately, even when effective in other types of neuropathic pain, anti-depressants and anticonvulsants have not yet proven effective for treating the symptoms of CIPN.

### Removing the idiopathic from the chronic sensory neuropathies [^114xYEFy]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies are common. Estimated to affect around 2.4% of the general population, rising to 8% in those over the age of 55, neuropathies can cause significant morbidity, and can sometimes be fatal. Peripheral nerves consist of motor nerves that convey motor signals from the spinal cord to the peripheries, sensory nerves that convey sensory signals from the peripheries to the CNS, along with sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres that together make up the autonomic nervous system. While neuropathies can be classified into acute and chronic forms, they can also present symmetrically or in an asymmetric manner. Moreover, using neurophysiological and pathological criteria, neuropathies are often classified into demyelinating or axonal forms, reflecting the principal site of pathology as the myelin-forming Schwann cell or the axon, respectively. Furthermore, neuropathies can be classified into those that are inherited, such as the Charcot-Marie-Tooth and related disorders, and those believed to be acquired. Of the latter group, the commonest risk factor associated with an acquired peripheral neuropathy seen in European populations is diabetes mellitus, while infectious and toxic causes remain prevalent worldwide. Nevertheless, despite careful and thorough investigation, it is estimated that between 20% and 40% of neuropathies that present to the clinic have no identifiable cause — hence the longstanding and common use of 'idiopathic' or 'cryptogenic' — and are now grouped together under the diagnostic label of 'chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy' (CIAP).

The CIAPs mainly present with sensorimotor involvement (where both sensory and motor symptoms and signs exist), but a pure sensory neuropathy has also long been recognized, along with a rarer pure motor syndrome. Onset of symptoms is generally in the fifth decade and electrophysiological and histopathological studies are consistent with axonal degeneration. These neuropathies tend to deteriorate slowly and management is currently supportive and focused on symptoms. Previous observational studies aimed at identifying latent underlying risk factors and causes have been largely unsuccessful, hindering efforts to develop effective therapies.

In contrast, many other forms of neuropathy are treatable. While acquired inflammatory neuropathies are commonly managed with immunomodulation, the past decade has seen the development of novel yet effective therapies for previously untreatable inherited neuropathies. These treatments are the culmination of years of scientific investigation which began with the discovery of mutations in disease-associated genes in affected families, followed by the deciphering of molecular pathological mechanisms at the cellular level, leading finally to the identification of potential therapeutic pathways amenable to pharmacological targeting.

### Toxic neuropathies: chemotherapy induced peripheral neurotoxicity [^116PKR4L]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a common and distressing side-effect of many chemotherapy regimens. Currently, aside from symptomatic treatments for neuropathic pain, there are no treatments to prevent CIPN or treat established CIPN. We discuss recent articles addressing clinimetric issues and treatment of CIPN.

Recent Findings

There are important clinimetric issues that need to be addressed so that robust clinical trials in CIPN can be performed. There are new compounds in early development that may treat CIPN, but larger studies are needed.

Summary

A multidisciplinary, international approach is needed to unravel CIPN; the Toxic Neuropathy Consortium (TNC) of the Peripheral Nerve Society may be the home for such efforts.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^114SiriF]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The induction of peripheral neuropathy is a common factor in limiting therapy with chemotherapeutic drugs. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the development of neuropathy. Depending on the substance used, a pure sensory and painful neuropathy (with cisplatin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin) or a mixed sensorimotor neuropathy with or without involvement of the autonomic nervous system (with vincristine, taxol, suramin) can ensue. Neurotoxicity depends on the total cumulative dose and the type of drug used. In individual cases neuropathy can evolve even after a single drug application. A general predisposition for developing a chemotherapy-induced neuropathy has been observed in nerves previously damaged by diabetes mellitus, alcohol or inherited neuropathy. The recovery from symptoms is often incomplete and a long period of regeneration is required to restore function. Up to now, no drug is available to reliably prevent or cure chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^114onphf]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain Management

Overall, it is estimated that more than half of patients with T2D develop signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy during their lifetime, with rates of 20–30% in newly diagnosed and early-stage (first few years) disease. Neuropathic pain is a cardinal symptom of DPN and is often severe, poorly diagnosed and difficult to treat. From the patient's perspective, painful DPN has a marked negative impact on daily functioning (sleeping, walking, driving, exercising, working, and performing other daily activities) and HR-QoL which, in turn, increases the social and economic burden of the disease.

Successful treatment of painful DPN requires a personalized approach balancing pain relief with improvements in daily functioning and HR-QoL. To achieve this, it is likely that more sophisticated tools beyond simple pain scores (eg, VAS or NPRS) will provide better feedback about neuropathic symptoms. The Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6 evaluates the frequency and intensity of individual neuropathy sensory symptoms frequently identified by DPN patients (ie, numbness and/or insensitivity, prickling and/or tingling sensation, burning sensation, aching pain and/or tightness, sharp, shooting, lancinating pain, and allodynia and/or hyperalgesia). The modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score evaluates the presence of symptoms (ie, foot pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, ataxia and upper limb symptoms) and clinical signs (ie sensory pinprick, temperature, light touch, vibration, and position sense) associated with DPN.

At present, there is a significant need for more effective and better-tolerated treatment options for painful DPN, as many affected patients continue to experience pain despite treatment. While initial responses to current guideline-recommended oral treatments (eg, antiepileptics and antidepressants) may be good, pharmacological tolerance often occurs and higher dosages may be needed to achieve the same level of pain relief. This increases the likelihood of ADRs. Such patients may benefit from treatment choices that are better tolerated, such as lower-dose combination therapy (pharmacological and non-pharmacological), topical agents (eg, capsaicin 8% topical systems), nutraceuticals, and non-pharmacological approaches (eg, nerve stimulation).

### Amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin each effective in… [^116m9VzN]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin effective in decreasing pain in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Bottom Line Adults with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy had similar degrees of improvement with monotherapy using amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin. There was even greater improvement with subsequent combination therapy regardless of initial choice of medication. Synopsis The researchers enrolled 130 adults with diabetes mellitus and pain associated with distal symmetric polyneuropathy for at least three months. In this crossover trial, the participants were randomly assigned to three 16-week pathways separated by a two-week washout period: oral amitriptyline supplemented with pregabalin, pregabalin supplemented with amitriptyline, and duloxetine supplemented with pregabalin. Each pathway started with a two-week period in which doses were titrated to the maximum tolerated dose.

This was followed by six weeks of maintenance monotherapy. At the end of six weeks, those with a pain level of 3 or less out of 10 were classified as responders and remained on monotherapy for 10 weeks. Nonresponders received the second drug for 10 weeks. During the subsequent 10 weeks, the researchers titrated medication doses to maintain pain levels at 3 or less out of 10. At the end of 16 weeks, the researchers stopped all study drugs for a two-week washout period, and the participants started the next drug combination. Most of the participants had type 2 diabetes and were White. Although 130 started the first pathway, only 97 and 84 began a second and third pathway, respectively. At the end of six weeks of monotherapy, the proportion of responders was similar for amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin.

At the end of 16 weeks, the proportion of responders was similar for oral amitriptyline supplemented with pregabalin, pregabalin supplemented with amitriptyline, and duloxetine supplemented with pregabalin. The authors found that at the end of each evaluation period, the participants had similar degrees of improvement in pain regardless of agent. Most adverse events were mild and similar across all three pathways, with the three exceptions summarized in the accompanying table.

### Update on Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^116tX5US]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the common terminology used to describe the hereditary neuropathies. This update reviews advances in the past year in our understanding of these diseases, including some important earlier references.

Recent Findings

In the past year, advances in next-generation sequencing continued to increase the number of genes associated with CMT. The connection between genotype and phenotype has become more complicated. New insights into the pathogenesis of the diseases are reviewed. Treatment and clinical trial updates coming from these new insights, as well as use of high-throughput screening to match potential treatments with targets, are moving the field forward. There is a discussion of potential next steps, including the use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, to enhance our understanding of individual genotypes and phenotypes.

Summary

The use of high-throughput screens, and techniques such as RNAi and induced pluripotent stem cell continue to push forward other therapies for specific genetic forms of CMT and are potentially more generalizable to peripheral neuropathies. These developments, along with the development of improved outcome measures and longitudinal natural history data, advance CMT, making the future for finding treatments and/or cures closer than it has ever been.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: mechanisms and therapeutic avenues [^115etVj5]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a serious and often persistent adverse consequence of certain chemotherapeutic agents. It is a major dose-limiting factor of many first-line chemotherapies, affecting 20–50% of patients at standard doses and nearly all patients at high doses. As cancer survivorship continues to increase with improvements in early diagnosis and treatment, more patients will experience CIPN despite completing cancer treatment, which interferes with recovery, leading to chronic pain and worsening quality of life. The National Cancer Institute has identified CIPN as a priority in translational research. To date, there are no FDA-approved drugs for preventing or treating CIPN, with emerging debate on mechanisms and promising new targets. This review highlights current literature and suggests novel approaches to CIPN based on proposed mechanisms of action that aim either to confer neuroprotection against chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity or reverse the downstream effects of painful neuropathy.

### Peripheral neuropathies from chemotherapeutics and targeted agents: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^115nwz2F]. Neuro-Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies induced by chemotherapy (CIPN) are an increasingly frequent problem. Contrary to hematologic adverse effects, which can be treated with hematopoetic growth factors, neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment is available, and only symptomatic treatment can be offered. Neurotoxic drugs are becoming a major dose-limiting factor. The epidemiology is still unclear. Several drug-dependent pathogenetic mechanisms exist. CIPN are predominately sensory, length-dependent neuropathies that develop after a typical cumulative dose. Usually, the appearance of CIPN is dose dependent, although in at least 2 drugs (oxaliplatin and taxanes), immediate toxic effects occur. The most frequent substances causing CIPN are platin compounds, vinka alkaloids, taxanes, and bortezomib and thalidomide. The role of synergistic neurotoxicity caused by previously given chemo-therapies and concomitant chemotherapies and the role pre-existent neuropathy on the development of a CIPN is not clear. As the number of long-term cancer survivors increases and a new focus on long-term effects of chemotherapy-induced neuropathies emerge, concepts of rehabilitation need to be implemented to improve the patients' functions and quality of life.

Unmet Needs in the Treatment of Painful DPN

Unmet needs with regard to the treatment of painful DPN can be categorized at three levels, which should form the basis for a personalized approach to the management of this frequently debilitating and progressive condition.
In the absence of any approved effective pharmacological disease-modifying therapy, preventative approaches that delay the development of nerve damage and slow disease progression would be highly beneficial. This should involve educating healthcare professionals and patients about diabetes and DPN, implementing effective targeted screening strategies as part of routine clinical practice, encouraging patients to undertake lifestyle modifications, and optimizing the use of medications. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of painful DPN is vital to prevent progression, avoid the development of advanced complications, and improve HR-QoL, economic and other outcomes.
A vital goal should be to develop pathogenetically oriented disease-modifying treatments designed to prevent/reverse the nerve damage associated with painful DPN.
Since approximately 30% of patients with DPN experience painful episodes, optimal approaches to minimize pain are an essential goal for a relevant proportion of patients.

Disease Prevention

To ensure that DPN is diagnosed and managed as early as possible, screening for DPN should be conducted regularly and routinely in all diabetic patients (Table 1). Healthcare professionals should be educated in patient assessment, which involves obtaining a careful clinical history and conducting a targeted physical exam. A patient-centered approach may require referral to specialists in other disciplines including but not limited to endocrinology, pain management, and podiatry. Patients should also be educated about the risk of DPN and its early signs and symptoms.

Management decisions pertaining to DPN prevention should be individualized to the patient's needs. These include appropriate foot care and a range of initiatives to reduce DPN risk factors. To prevent the onset of DPN in patients with T1D, intensive glucose control should be implemented when possible. In patients with T2D, controlling features of the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, together with educational strategies to improve lifestyle measures, including weight loss, increased physical activity, and smoking cessation, are recommended to prevent DPN. Education about lifestyle interventions is also important to prevent DPN in individuals with prediabetes/metabolic syndrome.

### Towards prevention of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and new treatments [^115NQxeo]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) occurs in up to half of individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. DPN results from the distal-to-proximal loss of peripheral nerve function, leading to physical disability and sometimes pain, with the consequent lowering of quality of life. Early diagnosis improves clinical outcomes, but many patients still develop neuropathy. Hyperglycaemia is a risk factor and glycaemic control prevents DPN development in type 1 diabetes. However, glycaemic control has modest or no benefit in individuals with type 2 diabetes, probably because they usually have comorbidities. Among them, the metabolic syndrome is a major risk factor for DPN. The pathophysiology of DPN is complex, but mechanisms converge on a unifying theme of bioenergetic failure in the peripheral nerves due to their unique anatomy. Current clinical management focuses on controlling diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and pain, but remains suboptimal for most patients. Thus, research is ongoing to improve early diagnosis and prognosis, to identify molecular mechanisms that could lead to therapeutic targets, and to investigate lifestyle interventions to improve clinical outcomes.

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline [^1158Mie7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based guidance on the optimum prevention and treatment approaches in the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies (CIPN) in adult cancer survivors.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified relevant, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of CIPN. Primary outcomes included incidence and severity of neuropathy as measured by neurophysiologic changes, patient-reported outcomes, and quality of life.

Results

A total of 48 RCTs met eligibility criteria and comprise the evidentiary basis for the recommendations. Trials tended to be small and heterogeneous, many with insufficient sample sizes to detect clinically important differences in outcomes. Primary outcomes varied across the trials, and in most cases, studies were not directly comparable because of different outcomes, measurements, and instruments used at different time points. The strength of the recommendations is based on the quality, amount, and consistency of the evidence and the balance between benefits and harms.

Recommendations

On the basis of the paucity of high-quality, consistent evidence, there are no agents recommended for the prevention of CIPN. With regard to the treatment of existing CIPN, the best available data support a moderate recommendation for treatment with duloxetine. Although the CIPN trials are inconclusive regarding tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline), gabapentin, and a compounded topical gel containing baclofen, amitriptyline HCL, and ketamine, these agents may be offered on the basis of data supporting their utility in other neuropathic pain conditions given the limited other CIPN treatment options. Further research on these agents is warranted.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: diagnosis, agents, general clinical presentation, and treatments [^113W8dyV]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to discuss pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation, and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Agent-specific presentation and pathophysiology is also being discussed.

Recent Findings

As new systemic oncological treatments continue to be developed, the number of cancer survivors continues to grow. Survivors are living longer with the long-term side effects of oncological treatments. We reviewed the pathophysiology of agent-specific chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and the updates in its treatment and preventative tools. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating long-term side effect that often impairs cancer survivors' function and quality of life. The increasing life expectancy of cancer survivors has resulted in increased prevalence of this condition. Understanding its intricacies can provide physicians with better treatment tools and research opportunities to develop or identify new therapeutic agents.

### Comprehensive insights into diabetic peripheral neuropathy: pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches [^111ucrYZ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common and debilitating complication of diabetes, resulting from prolonged hyperglycemia-induced peripheral nerve dysfunction. It leads to neuropathic pain, sensory impairment, and diminished quality of life.

Methods

This review summarizes the current literature available on the pathophysiology and treatment approaches for DPN. The literature search was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between 2009 and 2025. The search used keywords such as "Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy", "pathophysiology", "pharmacological treatments", and "non-pharmacological treatments". Relevant data were collected from peer-reviewed journals, clinical trials, and authoritative databases. Only studies published in English were included. Studies limited to animal models or addressing other complications of diabetes were excluded.

Results

The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is driven by metabolic and inflammatory changes that contribute to nerve damage and neuropathic pain. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved pharmacological treatments for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: pregabalin, duloxetine, gabapentin, extended-release tapentadol, tramadol, and the capsaicin 8% patch. Non-Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies, such as amitriptyline and the 5% lidocaine patch, are also widely used. Non-pharmacological interventions, including tonic spinal cord stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, manual acupuncture, local plantar vibration, and the Frequency Rhythmic Electrical Modulated System, show promise in alleviating symptoms and promoting nerve regeneration.

Conclusion

A multifaceted approach incorporating pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies is essential for optimizing patient outcomes in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeting underlying pathophysiological mechanisms while providing symptomatic relief can enhance treatment efficacy and improve the quality of life for individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### The importance of rare subtypes in diagnosis and treatment of peripheral neuropathy: a review [^115S7eq4]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Peripheral neuropathy is a prevalent condition that usually warrants a thorough history and examination but has limited diagnostic evaluation. However, rare localizations of peripheral neuropathy often require more extensive diagnostic testing and different treatments.

Objective

To describe rare localizations of peripheral neuropathy, including the appropriate diagnostic evaluation and available treatments.

Evidence Review

References were identified from PubMed searches conducted on May 29, 2015, with an emphasis on systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials. Articles were also identified through the use of the authors' own files. Search terms included common rare neuropathy localizations and their causes, as well as epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

Findings

Diffuse, nonlength-dependent neuropathies, multiple mononeuropathies, polyradiculopathies, plexopathies, and radiculoplexus neuropathies are rare peripheral neuropathy localizations that often require extensive diagnostic testing. Atypical neuropathy features, such as acute/subacute onset, asymmetry, and/or motor predominant signs, are frequently present. The most common diffuse, nonlength-dependent neuropathies are Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Effective disease-modifying therapies exist for many diffuse, nonlength-dependent neuropathies including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, and some paraprotein-associated demyelinating neuropathies. Vasculitic neuropathy (multiple mononeuropathy) also has efficacious treatment options, but definitive evidence of a treatment effect for IgM anti-MAG neuropathy and diabetic amyotrophy (radiculoplexus neuropathy) is lacking.

Conclusions and Relevance

Recognition of rare localizations of peripheral neuropathy is essential given the implications for diagnostic testing and treatment. Electrodiagnostic studies are an important early step in the diagnostic evaluation and provide information on the localization and pathophysiology of nerve injury.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy – A survey of patient experiences [^115fSKyZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 37 million people in the United States (US) have diabetes and as many as 96 million may have prediabetes. Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is the most common microvascular complication associated with diabetes. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects about 50% of patients with diabetes, and symptomatic or painful DPN (pDPN) occurs in 30–50% of these patients.pDPN generally presents as a spontaneous burning pain of the feet, can be difficult to treat successfully, and has a significant impact on lifestyle and quality of life (QoL). The pathophysiology of pDPN is not well understood, but hyperglycemia-induced cellular damage in the nervous system results in hyperexcitable pain pathways, resulting in both peripheral and central sensitization. Thus, both primary afferent nociceptors and central neurons may contribute to neuropathic pain in pDPN.

The management of pDPN is multifactorial, involving a combination of lifestyle factors (such as diet, exercise and weight loss) and pain medications. Because the pathogenesis of pDPN is poorly understood there is no mechanism-based approach to pharmacotherapy, resulting in doctors testing different treatments until something works. Glycemic control and risk factor management play an important role and, if well managed, can prevent or partially reverse DPN and modulate associated pain. There is a plethora of novel pharmacological agents that target a variety of pain pathways of potential therapeutic benefit in pDPN, although very few have gained FDA-approval for pDPN. Thus, the treatment of patients with pDPN is difficult, complex and frustrating for health-care professionals (HCPs), patients and caregivers.

Whatever their diagnosis, patients are entitled to be informed about their condition and receive sound and clear advice about their treatment options. For patients with pDPN, the patient journey can consist of various stages: initially, because they may experience tingling and numbness, patients may not interpret what they feel in their feet as being pain, and this can delay the identification of foot pain; the search for information to obtain a diagnosis; the introduction of treatment; and thereafter, at any given time, evaluation of their current treatment, assessment of their current status (eg degree of ability/disability) and a review of their perspective of what the future holds.

### Peripheral neuropathy… [^1144A6sc]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Brown TJ, Sedhom R, Gupta A. Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy. JAMA Oncol. 2019; 5:

750. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.6771 Peripheral neuropathy refers to symptoms arising from damage to peripheral nerves. These nerves carry sensation, control movements of the arms and legs, and control the bladder and bowel. Chemotherapy and other drugs used to treat cancer can cause peripheral neuropathy. This is termed chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Certain chemotherapy drugs are more likely to cause neuropathy. These include: platinum drugs, such as oxaliplatin; taxanes, such as docetaxel; vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine; and myeloma treatments, such as bortezomib. Other chemotherapy drugs can also cause neuropathy. The risk of developing CIPN is higher with higher doses, multiple courses, and combination chemotherapy. Patients are more likely to develop CIPN if they are older or have diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or preexisting peripheral neuropathy.

No medication or supplement has been shown to definitively prevent CIPN. Regular exercise, reducing alcohol use, and treating preexisting medical conditions may reduce the risk of CIPN. Depending on the nerves affected, symptoms include: Tingling Pain, which may be severe and constant, may come and go, or may feel like burning. One should avoid injury by paying attention to home safety, such as by using handrails on stairs to prevent falls and potholders in the kitchen to avoid burns. Your oncologist may choose to discontinue or reduce the dose of a chemotherapy drug. Your oncologist may recommend over-the-counter pain medications, lidocaine patches, menthol creams, or a medication called duloxetine. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation may be helpful to regain function. Studies are researching how novel therapies can help. Improvements in function may be gradual.

In some cases, nerve damage may be permanent. American Cancer Societyhttps: //www. cancer. org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/physical-side-effects/peripheral-neuropathy. htmlPublishedOnline: February28, 2019. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.**6771ConflictofInterestDisclosures**: Nonereported.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: pathogenesis and emerging therapies [^1138Cq2f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a major dose-limiting side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents. The type and degree of neuropathy depend on the chemotherapy drug, dose-intensity, and cumulative dose. Disabling peripheral neuropathy has a significant negative impact on quality of life. Accordingly, a reliable assessment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity is necessary, especially if potential neuroprotective agents are to be investigated. Chemoprotectants are agents that have been developed to ameliorate the toxicity associated with cytotoxic drugs. They aim to provide site-specific protection for normal tissues, without compromising antitumor efficacy. Several chemoprotectant compounds have been studied in recent clinical trials. These trials must include sufficient dose-limiting events for study and assessment of both toxicity and antitumor effect. A future avenue of investigation includes the identification of patients at higher risk for the development of peripheral neuropathy based on their genotype. Identification of these higher-risk patients may enable us to devise prevention strategies prior to the onset of this potentially debilitating complication.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^1143qxYs]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of pain related to DPN is not fully understood, although several theories have been proposed. These include changes in blood vessels that supply the peripheral nerves; metabolic and autoimmune disorders accompanied by glial cell activation; alterations in sodium and calcium channel expression; and, more recently, central pain mechanisms, such as increased thalamic vascularity and imbalance of the facilitatory/inhibitory descending pathways.

The management of painful DPN involves treating the underlying causes via lifestyle modifications and pharmacological control of risk factors, targeting its pathogenesis, and providing symptomatic pain relief, thereby improving patient function and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Despite the substantial morbidity of painful DPN, its negative impact on HR-QoL, and immense healthcare burden, the condition is often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated.

Since 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two novel options to manage painful DPN, namely the capsaicin 8% topical system and spinal cord stimulation devices. As such, we considered it timely to examine the evidence supporting the use of these newer options and their positioning within current US guidelines. We also present evidence for three FDA-approved oral pharmacological treatments and other guideline-supported oral treatments commonly used as first-line options in clinical practice; explore potential future options to manage painful DPN; and discuss the unmet needs of this increasingly complex and rapidly growing patient population.

### Peripheral neuropathies associated with DNA repair disorders [^115hxQ72]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The DNA repair deficiencies are a category of rare disorders representing multiple individual ultrarare populations that can display overlapping disease phenotypes, including neuropathies. Although significant advances are being made to better understand the natural progression of these disorders and their underlying disease mechanisms, more detailed preclinical experiments and human natural history studies for DNA repair disorders are needed to prepare novel therapies for translation into human clinical trials and to determine optimal outcome measures for such trials, respectively. We anticipate that the peripheral nerves will have an important role in the development of new therapies, either as a target organ or as the nexus for a surrogate biomarker. There is cause to be optimistic about future therapeutic development for these serious inherited disorders.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a current review [^117PGP3D]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting side effect experienced by patients receiving treatment for cancer. Approximately 30 to 40% of patients treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy will develop CIPN, and there is considerable variability in its severity between patients. It is often sensory-predominant with pain and can lead to long-term morbidity in survivors. The prevalence and burden of CIPN late effects will likely increase as cancer survival rates continue to improve. In this review, we discuss the approach to peripheral neuropathy in patients with cancer and address the clinical phenotypes and pathomechanisms of specific neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

### Neurobiological opportunities in diabetic polyneuropathy [^113KFMbd]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

This review highlights a selection of potential translational directions for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) currently irreversible and without approved interventions beyond pain management. The list does not include all diabetic targets that have been generated over several decades of research but focuses on newer work. The emphasis is firstly on approaches that support the viability and growth of peripheral neurons and their ability to withstand a barrage of diabetic alterations. We include a section describing Schwann cell targets and finally how mitochondrial damage has been a common element in discussing neuropathic damage. Most of the molecules and pathways described here have not yet reached clinical trials, but many trials have been negative to date. Nonetheless, these failures clear the pathway for new thoughts over reversing DPN.

### Basic science and clinical management of painful and non-painful chemotherapy-related neuropathy [^114hxq6g]. Gynecologic Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting toxicity of several chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of all the most common malignancies. There are several defined mechanisms of nerve damage that take place along different areas of the peripheral and the central nervous system. Treatment is based on symptom management and there are several classes of medications found to be efficacious in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain that persists despite appropriate pharmacotherapy may respond to interventional procedures that span a range of invasiveness. The purpose of this review article is to examine the basic science of neuropathy and currently available treatment options in the context of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.

### What role for capsaicin in diabetic peripheral neuropathy? [^114ULFNS]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common long-term complication of diabetes mellitus. In many patients, neuropathy is accompanied by pain, which is often difficult to manage effectively. Drug treatment options include certain antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs. Another option is the use of topical capsaicin. In this article, we consider the evidence for capsaicin in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and how it fits with current management strategies.
