## Question

Which CPAP settings are indicated for dissolving cholelithiasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which CPAP settings, if any, are indicated to dissolve cholelithiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what CPAP is indicated for and how it works. Then, I should verify the evidence and guidelines for gallstone dissolution therapies. Next, I need to check whether any literature connects CPAP settings to gallstone dissolution. After that, I will review the dosing and efficacy of bile acid therapy where dissolution is considered. Finally, I will reconcile these findings and provide a clear, guideline-concordant recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the indications and mechanisms. CPAP is a first-line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea and functions as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open during sleep, typically delivered as continuous or autotitrating positive airway pressure rather than as a therapy affecting abdominal or biliary physiology [^113zKF1W] [^116REiLS] [^112LHzm6].

> I need to check for any direct therapeutic connection between CPAP and gallstone dissolution. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: I see no evidence that positive airway pressure affects gallstone composition or promotes litholysis, and contemporary hepatology guidelines do not position CPAP anywhere in gallstone management pathways, which focus on cholecystectomy for symptomatic disease and explicitly advise against bile acid litholysis for gallbladder stones [^1111CP8n] [^112iyB7e].

> Next, I should review established dissolution therapy. Ursodeoxycholic acid has historically been used for selected radiolucent, cholesterol-rich gallbladder stones, with an effective dose around 8–10 mg/kg/day in divided doses; however, complete dissolution occurs in roughly 30% of unselected patients at about 10 mg/kg/day and requires careful ultrasound monitoring over months [^116ESxzX] [^1137qRLA].

> Wait, let me verify the key efficacy modifiers. Success is higher for small, floating cholesterol stones and falls off markedly when stones exceed 20 mm, with durability limited by substantial recurrence after dissolution; this limited efficacy underpins modern guidance that recommends against routine bile acid litholysis for gallbladder stones in favor of surgical management when symptomatic [^116ESxzX] [^112iyB7e].

> I will now examine potential misinterpretations. Hmm, wait a minute, one could mistakenly conflate pressure-controlled ventilation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy with CPAP; at first glance I almost did, but I should confirm these are distinct intraoperative ventilation modes used under anesthesia and not outpatient CPAP therapies intended for sleep apnea, so they do not constitute gallstone treatments [^114wQebm]. But wait, what if a patient with gallstones also has OSA? In that perioperative context, continuing CPAP is recommended for OSA management, yet this is to mitigate respiratory risk and does not influence gallstone dissolution or selection for cholecystectomy [^115epns3].

> Let me think about CPAP settings themselves. Therapeutic CPAP pressures are individualized, often within single-digit to low–teens cm H₂O, and reflect upper airway collapsibility rather than any hepatobiliary target; for example, patients with mildly collapsible airways may be adequately treated at pressures ≤ 8 cm H₂O, while PAP modalities include CPAP, APAP, and BiPAP — none of which have a mechanistic or clinical role in changing gallstone chemistry or size [^111xMAPq] [^112LHzm6].

> Bringing this together, I should double-check guideline-consistent recommendations. CPAP settings are not indicated for dissolving cholelithiasis, and there is no evidence basis for using PAP to treat gallstones; for patients in whom dissolution is selectively attempted, ursodeoxycholic acid at 8–10 mg/kg/day may be used with modest success in carefully chosen radiolucent, small cholesterol stones, but current EASL guidance recommends against bile acid litholysis and supports laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the preferred option for symptomatic gallbladder stones [^116ESxzX] [^112iyB7e] [^1111CP8n].

CPAP is not used to dissolve gallstones. CPAP is for **obstructive sleep apnea** [^113zKF1W] and has no role in gallstone management. Gallstone dissolution is achieved with **UDCA** at 8–10 mg/kg/day [^116ESxzX] for small, radiolucent cholesterol stones, with ultrasound monitoring every 6 months [^1137qRLA]. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the **preferred treatment** [^1113ZqqS] for symptomatic gallstones. No **evidence or guidelines** support CPAP for gallstone dissolution.

---

## Clinical indications for CPAP therapy

CPAP is indicated for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**, characterized by repeated upper airway collapse during sleep, causing intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, and daytime sleepiness [^114TqjPq]. It maintains airway patency, reduces apneas/hypopneas, and improves oxygenation and sleep quality [^116REiLS]. It is not indicated for gallstone disease [^1113ZqqS].

---

## Pathophysiology of gallstone formation and dissolution

Gallstones arise from **cholesterol supersaturation**, bile stasis, and cholesterol crystal nucleation. Dissolution requires altering bile composition to lower cholesterol saturation and gradually dissolve stones [^113gHH93].

---

## Established medical therapies for gallstone dissolution

Medical dissolution relies on **bile acids**, primarily ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), to reduce cholesterol saturation and dissolve small, radiolucent cholesterol stones [^116ESxzX]. UDCA is recommended at 8–10 mg/kg/day in 2–3 divided doses [^116ESxzX], with ultrasound monitoring every 6 months [^1137qRLA]. Complete dissolution occurs in about 30% of unselected patients, with higher rates for small (< 5 mm), radiolucent, cholesterol-rich stones [^1176a9us].

---

## Surgical management of gallstones

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the **preferred treatment** [^1113ZqqS] for symptomatic gallstones, providing definitive relief and preventing recurrence. It is recommended for symptomatic patients, including those with acute calculous cholecystitis and those with Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis [^116KUdiL].

---

## Lack of evidence supporting CPAP for gallstone dissolution

There is **no evidence or guideline support** for CPAP in gallstone dissolution [^1113ZqqS]. CPAP does not alter bile composition or promote stone dissolution and is used exclusively for OSA management [^113zKF1W].

---

## Potential risks and complications of CPAP therapy

CPAP is **generally safe** but may cause nasal congestion, dryness, discomfort, and rare barotrauma [^115KZ7e1]. These effects are unrelated to gallstone disease and do not affect its management.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Physicians [^114TqjPq], American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^113zKF1W], and European Association for the Study of the Liver [^1113ZqqS] do not mention CPAP for gallstone dissolution. CPAP is for **OSA**, whereas gallstone management relies on medical dissolution with UDCA [^116ESxzX] or surgical cholecystectomy [^1111CP8n].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

CPAP is not indicated for **gallstone dissolution**. Gallstone management should follow established medical and surgical protocols, with UDCA for small, radiolucent cholesterol stones [^116ESxzX] and laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic disease [^1113ZqqS]. No **evidence or guidelines** support CPAP for gallstone dissolution.

### Ursodiol 400 mg [^116ESxzX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

On the basis of clinical trial results involving a total of 868 patients with radiolucent gallstones treated in eight studies (three in the U.S. involving 282 patients, one in the U.K. with 130 patients, and four in Italy with 456 patients) for periods ranging from 6 to 78 months, an ursodiol dose of about 8–10 mg/kg/day appeared to be the most effective. The ursodiol dose ranged from approximately 5–20 mg/kg/day. At a dose of about 10 mg/kg/day, complete stone dissolution is expected in about 30% of unselected patients with uncalcified gallstones. Gallstones larger than 20 mm in maximal diameter rarely dissolve.

- **Chance of gallstone dissolution**: The chance of dissolution rises to 50% in patients with floating or floatable stones (i.e. those with high cholesterol content) and is inversely related to stone size for those smaller than 20 mm in maximal diameter. Complete dissolution was observed in 81% of patients with stones up to 5 mm in diameter.

- **Demographic factors**: Age, sex, weight, degree of obesity, and serum cholesterol level are not related to the chance of stone dissolution with ursodiol.

### Reltone 400 mg [^1137qRLA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:

	- **Gallstone dissolution**: The recommended dose for Reltone™ treatment of radiolucent gallbladder stones is 8–10 mg/kg/day, administered in 2 or 3 divided doses. Ultrasound images of the gallbladder should be obtained at 6-month intervals for the first year of Reltone™ therapy to monitor gallstone response. If gallstones appear to have dissolved, Reltone™ therapy should be continued, and dissolution confirmed on a repeat ultrasound examination within 1 to 3 months. Most patients who eventually achieve complete stone dissolution will show partial or complete dissolution at the first on-treatment reevaluation. If partial stone dissolution is not seen by 12 months of Reltone™ therapy, the likelihood of success is greatly reduced.

	- **Gallstone prevention**: The recommended dosage of Reltone™ for gallstone prevention in patients undergoing rapid weight loss is 600 mg/day.

### Perioperative adherence to continuous positive airway pressure and its effect on postoperative nocturnal hypoxemia in obstructive sleep apnea patients: A prospective cohort study [^1158CFyD]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep. Among patients undergoing elective surgery, the prevalence of OSA is estimated to be at least 25% and can be as high as 80% in certain populations, such as patients undergoing bariatric surgery. OSA has important perioperative implications, as it is associated with an increased risk of cardiac and pulmonary complications, oxygen desaturations, difficult intubation, and, in rare instances, death.

Many of the sequelae of OSA are strongly linked to the degree and duration of oxygen desaturation. Preoperative indices of oxygen desaturation have been linked to postoperative complications. In one study, preoperative oxygen desaturation index (ODI) > 29 events/h, greater than 7% of sleep duration with SpO2 < 90%, and mean SpO2 < 93% were identified as thresholds predictive of increased postoperative complications. Among patients with OSA, postoperative hypoxemia occurs mostly between postoperative nights two to five and may lead to serious consequences, including poor wound healing, cardiac arrhythmias, and delirium.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is currently the first-line treatment for OSA. CPAP serves as a functional pneumatic upper airway splint, preventing airway collapse as well as the associated oxygen desaturation that may accompany respiratory events in sleep. With appropriate settings, CPAP is expected to treat sleep-disordered breathing and normalize oxygenation during sleep.

### New frontiers in pharmacologic obstructive sleep apnea treatment: A narrative review [^115TDXp4]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, characterized by intermittent partial or complete closure of the upper airway during sleep. If left untreated, OSA is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, and death. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is often considered the first-line treatment for OSA. While PAP can be very effective in reducing the number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas, its impact on the prevention of adverse cardiovascular consequences remains controversial, and treatment adherence is often poor. Hence, there is a necessity for novel treatment options to help those who cannot adhere to positive airway pressure treatment. Different classes of medications have been tested regarding their effect on OSA severity.

- **Update on epidemiology and pathophysiology of OSA**: This review provides an update on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of OSA.

- **Mechanistic rationale for medication classes**: The review outlines the mechanistic rationale for medication classes tested as OSA treatment.

- **Effects of medications on OSA**: The review discusses the effects of these medications on OSA.

Several wake-promoting medications are approved for the management of persistent sleepiness despite OSA treatment; however, the discussion of these symptomatic treatments is outside the scope of this review. Herein, the authors review the evidence for the pharmacological management of OSA and provide future directions.

### The history and future of bile acid therapies [^113gHH93]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Animal bile has been regarded as a potential remedy for liver diseases for millennia in ancient Eastern cultures. The application of bile acids as major organic bile components for gallstone dissolution and of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for cholestatic liver diseases began in the second half of the 20th century. Currently, UDCA is regarded as the effective first-line treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, the most frequent chronic cholestatic liver disease, and is also applied in other cholestatic disorders, including primary sclerosing cholangitis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

For the past two decades, nuclear receptor agonists such as the farnesoid X receptor agonist and chenodeoxycholic acid derivative, obeticholic acid, and derivatives of UDCA, such as norucholic acid and various UDCA hybrids, are under evaluation for the treatment of diverse benign and malignant, genetic and acquired hepatobiliary disorders. The development of new drugs interacting with the enterohepatic bile acid circulation has attracted attention for rare genetic pediatric disorders.

This review describes the status and future prospects of bile acid-based therapies for hepatobiliary diseases of adults, children, and during pregnancy, based on historical developments over centuries and millennia.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): Pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113YkQDf]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

From a patient perspective, the defining symptom of gallstone disease is severe and lasting abdominal pain (i.e. lasting more than 30 minutes). General abdominal symptoms commonly intensify over time and become regular pain attacks, known as biliary colic, that may require medical attention.

A recent large prospective study in the UK, with 8,909 participants, showed that 10.8% of people experienced complications 30 days after surgery. Furthermore, as much as 40% of patients may continue to experience pain and abdominal symptoms after surgery. In particular, persistent pain similar to that experienced preoperatively has been reported in about 20% of people after cholecystectomy. Additionally, new pain has been reported in up to 14% of people. Based on the 61,000 episodes reported for 2018/19, 6,600 people would have experienced complications from surgery, and 24,400 would continue to experience pain, with a substantial impact on NHS resources and costs.

Post-cholecystectomy syndrome is an umbrella term widely used to describe the range of symptoms patients might experience after surgery. The term "persistent post-cholecystectomy symptoms" has been suggested as a more accurate description of these symptoms, which include biliary and non-biliary abdominal pain, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Up to 40% of people may experience persistent pain and discomfort, usually described as post-cholecystectomy symptoms. Persistent diarrhoea or constipation are often reported after cholecystectomy, and flatulence may arise as a new symptom.

### Restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain (SECURE): A multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority trial [^116KhQ8g]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

International guidelines advise laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat symptomatic, uncomplicated gallstones. Usual care regarding cholecystectomy is associated with practice variation and persistent post-cholecystectomy pain in 10–41% of patients. We aimed to compare the non-inferiority of a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection against usual care to assess the (in)efficient use of cholecystectomy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority study in 24 academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18–95 years with abdominal pain and ultrasound-proven gallstones or sludge were enrolled. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual care, wherein selection for cholecystectomy was left to the discretion of the surgeon, or to a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection for cholecystectomy. For the restrictive strategy, cholecystectomy was advised for patients who fulfilled all five pre-specified criteria of the triage instrument: 1) severe pain attacks, 2) pain lasting 15–30 minutes or longer, 3) pain located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant, 4) pain radiating to the back, and 5) a positive pain response to simple analgesics. Randomisation was done with an online program, implemented into a web-based application using blocks of variable sizes, and stratified for centre type (academic versus non-academic and a high vs low number of patients), sex, and body-mass index. Physicians and patients were masked to study-arm allocation until after completion of the triage instrument.

This article provides an overview of the management of the obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS). Where possible, recommendations are based on a review of the relevant literature. With the exception of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, which is considered in greater detail elsewhere in the series, and certain oral appliances, the efficacy of many proposed treatments for OSAHS is not supported by data from randomised controlled clinical trials. To a considerable extent, treatment recommendations are based on data from uncontrolled studies, case series, consensus guidelines, practice parameters, and other less rigorous forms of evidence.

### Upper airway collapsibility in patients with OSA treated with continuous positive airway pressure: A retrospective preliminary study [^111xMAPq]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To investigate the prevalence of mildly collapsible upper airways — defined by therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) values ≤ 8 cm H₂O — in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients treated with CPAP, a study was conducted. The study also aimed to determine the clinical, functional, and nocturnal polysomnographic characteristics of these patients.

Eighty-seven patients with moderate to severe OSA, who were consecutively treated with CPAP, were retrospectively investigated. Two nocturnal home sleep portable monitoring studies were performed at baseline and during treatment. Participants were categorized according to therapeutic CPAP values: ≤ 8 cm H₂O (group 1), 8–12 cm H₂O (group 2), and ≥ 12 cm H₂O (group 3). Data on anthropometric, awake respiratory function, symptoms, comorbidities, and nocturnal home sleep portable monitoring were collected.

Mild upper airway collapsibility, indicated by therapeutic CPAP values ≤ 8 cm H₂O, was present in 25.3% of patients. These patients demonstrated more favorable results in apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, mean nocturnal saturation, sleep time with oxygen saturation < 90%, desaturation nadir, and supine position. The oxygen desaturation index showed a weak association with anatomical collapsibility. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a low area under the curve for the oxygen desaturation index versus CPAP pressure requirements ≤ 8 cm H₂O, with an oxygen desaturation index ≤ 40.8/h demonstrating a sensitivity of 63.3% and a specificity of 69.2% for detecting patients with mild collapsibility.

In conclusion, a quarter of patients with moderate to severe OSA exhibited mild upper airway collapsibility, as reflected in their CPAP requirements and related indices.

### Drug therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea in adults [^111EWzr6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of choice for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied via a mask during sleep. However, this is not tolerated by all individuals, and its role in mild OSA is not proven. Drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP for some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea and could be valuable for patients intolerant of CPAP. A number of mechanisms have been proposed by which drugs could reduce the severity of OSA. These include an increase in tone in the upper airway dilator muscles, an increase in ventilatory drive, a reduction in the proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increase in cholinergic tone during sleep, an increase in arousal threshold, a reduction in airway resistance, and a reduction in surface tension in the upper airway.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of drug therapies in the specific treatment of sleep apnoea.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. The searches were as of July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, placebo-controlled trials involving adult patients with confirmed OSA were included. Trials were excluded if continuous positive airway pressure, mandibular devices, or oxygen therapy were used. We also excluded studies investigating treatment of associated conditions such as excessive sleepiness, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and obesity.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

### Provigil [^113dQrVD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Provigil in improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was established in two multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical studies of patients who met the criteria for OSA. The criteria include either:

- **Excessive sleepiness or insomnia**: Plus frequent episodes of impaired breathing during sleep and associated features such as loud snoring, morning headaches, and dry mouth upon awakening.
- **Polysomnography demonstrating conditions**: Excessive sleepiness or insomnia and polysomnography demonstrating one of the following conditions: more than five obstructive apneas, each greater than 10 seconds in duration, per hour of sleep, along with one or more of the following - frequent arousals from sleep associated with the apneas, bradytachycardia, and arterial oxygen desaturation in association with the apneas.

In addition, for entry into these studies, all patients were required to have excessive sleepiness as demonstrated by a score of ≥ 10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) despite being treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Evidence that CPAP was effective in reducing episodes of apnea/hypopnea was required, along with documentation of CPAP use.

In the first study, a 12-week trial, a total of 327 patients with OSA were randomized to receive either Provigil 200 mg/day, Provigil 400 mg/day, or a matching placebo. The majority of patients (80%) were fully compliant with CPAP, defined as CPAP use greater than 4 hours/night on more than 70% of nights. The remainder were partially CPAP compliant, defined as CPAP use on 30% of nights.

### Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea among privately paying patients- a cross-sectional study [^116Kqt2f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a relatively common disorder with an estimated prevalence of 4% in men and 2% in women. OSA is characterized by intermittent obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. Patients experience repetitive episodes of apnea (complete cessation of airflow), hypopnea (partial reduction in airflow), oxygen desaturation, and sleep fragmentation. Common symptoms include loud habitual snoring, frequent nocturnal awakenings, unrefreshing sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Age, gender, obesity, and nasal blockage are some of the well-established risk factors for OSA. OSA is associated with poor sleep quality, impaired cognition, and an increased risk of accidents. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and the treatment of OSA favorably reduces the risks associated with OSA. Similarly, OSA is associated with an increase in blood pressure that is improved with treating apnea, but not by supplemental O2 therapy, suggesting mechanisms other than hypoxemia are responsible for hypertension.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice for OSA. CPAP therapy produces improvements in daytime sleepiness and cognitive function, with an improved quality of life compared with control. Good compliance with CPAP therapy has been shown to achieve cardiovascular and metabolic benefits.

Despite the high efficacy of CPAP, treatment effectiveness is limited by variable adherence to prescribed therapy. Failure to comply with CPAP therapy may occur in up to 25% to 50% of patients.

### Effect of positive airway pressure on obese patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LHzm6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024).

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, resulting in inadequate oxygen levels. Studies have revealed that middle-aged adults with a higher BMI face a significantly higher risk of sleep apnoea. In severely obese individuals, the prevalence of sleep apnoea can range from 40%–90%. Obstructive sleep apnoea is more prevalent among obese individuals.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is the gold standard treatment for moderate to severe OSA. PAP therapy maintains upper airway patency by maintaining positive air pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, functioning as an inflatable splint. This modality encompasses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), and positive airway pressure with automatic titration (APAP). CPAP provides a continual, stable influx of positive air pressure to the patient's airway, engineered to avert airway collapse and minimize the frequency of apnoeic episodes. BIPAP delivers two distinct pressure settings — an elevated pressure during inspiration (IPAP) and a reduced pressure during expiration (EPAP) — enabling patients to benefit from increased respiratory support during inspiration along with continuous positive pressure during expiration, thereby contributing to enhanced comfort and therapeutic outcomes. The APAP is an intelligent non-invasive ventilator that autonomously adjusts the end positive airway pressure level in alignment with the patient's respiratory requirements.

### A comparison of pressure-controlled and volume-controlled ventilation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^114wQebm]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

The potential advantages of pressure-controlled over volume-controlled ventilation during laparoscopic surgery have yet to be proven. We randomly assigned 42 patients with BMI < 30 kg/m² scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy to receive either pressure- or volume-controlled ventilation. Compared with volume-controlled ventilation, pressure-controlled ventilation resulted in a significant decrease in mean (SD) peak airway pressure at 10 min (20.4 (2.7) vs. 24.0 (4.7) cmH₂O, p = 0.004) and 30 min (20.7 (3.0) vs. 23.9 (4.9) cmH₂O, p = 0.015), and an increase in mean airway pressure at 10 min (10.5 (0.9) vs. 9.6 (1.1) cmH₂O, p = 0.007) and 30 min (10.5 (1.1) vs. 9.6 (1.2) cmH₂O, p = 0.016) after the start of surgery. Gas exchange and haemodynamic stability were similar. We conclude that pressure-controlled ventilation is a safe alternative and offers some advantages to volume-controlled ventilation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in non-obese patients.

### Clinical foundation for efficient treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^111FLFUa]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Only a few decades ago, the entity known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was unknown and untreated. Now, there is a rush to put literally millions of Americans on continuous positive airway pressure devices. Community practice standards are changing yearly under pressure from strong forces based on economic incentives for industry, government, and physicians, independent of the actual medical evidence supporting treatment and efficacy. Medicare has lowered the diagnostic threshold for diagnosis and reimbursement; the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revision 2 (2005) has allowed OSA to be diagnosed exclusively by a laboratory test without the patient having clinical symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness; and industry is poised to have the public buy computer-assisted continuous positive airway pressure machines without the need for a physician prescription. Because of this paradigm shift away from physician-directed diagnosis and treatment, this article will critically evaluate the present state of medical evidence regarding the clinical foundation for treatment of OSA.

### Managing hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea: the interplay of continuous positive airway pressure, medication and chronotherapy [^113npjdR]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertension is highly prevalent and usually uncontrolled among patients with obstructive sleep apnea despite multiple interventions, namely lifestyle modifications, use of antihypertensive drugs, and continuous positive airway pressure application. The main prognosticators of blood pressure (BP) reduction with continuous positive airway pressure therapy are high levels of BP, severity of apnea, and daytime sleepiness. The long-term effect of continuous positive airway pressure on BP is still inconclusive, and compliance issues constitute a major limitation. There is no clear evidence for a preference for a specific type of antihypertensive drug, and selection should primarily be guided by the patient's cardiometabolic profile and associated clinical conditions. Furthermore, as hypertensive patients with obstructive sleep apnea frequently exhibit a disturbed circadian BP pattern, chronotherapy emerges as a possible therapeutic supplement.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^116VfZGC]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

In addition to this approach, a criteria set with patient characteristics and preoperative symptoms is of high value in improving treatment decision-making. In the SUCCESS trial, a criteria set was developed and validated to allow selection of patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease for surgery based on prediction of becoming pain-free or achieving a relevant reduction in pain. The SUCCESS cohort provided the data for development of the criteria set: 494 patients with radiologically confirmed gallbladder stones, gastrointestinal pain symptoms, and a referral to the surgery department of the hospital.

The criteria set comprised: older patients, with a high baseline pain score, no history of abdominal surgery, radiation of pain to the back, nausea, effective result after simple painkillers, and no symptoms of heartburn. Patients with these characteristics/symptoms more frequently had a relevant reduction in pain after gallbladder removal. External validation of the SUCCESS criteria in the SECURE data indicated good distinction between patients with and without a relevant reduction in pain.

For daily clinical use, an online tool was developed, which can be accessed easily via the QR code in Fig. 2. To tailor treatment for individual patients, Fig. 3 illustrates a decision tree. When patients with proven gallbladder stones complain of repeated biliary colic, this is considered to represent symptomatic gallstone disease, and cholecystectomy is advised in shared decision-making with the patient. An option talk is advocated for patients who report abdominal pain.

### Current trends in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^1162Qcjh]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by partial or complete upper airway obstruction, which leads to increased resistance to airflow and potential cessation of breathing during sleep. Effective treatment of OSA is challenging, but there has been greater recognition by the medical and dental disciplines. By understanding the rationale, indications, benefits, risks, and success of the various treatment options available, clinicians will be able to make more informed treatment recommendations in patient management.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^115ArJbZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

There is a lack of consensus in selecting patients who benefit from surgery when they present with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones are present. This review aimed to provide an overview of the results from recent trials and available literature to improve treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

- **Methods**: First, an overview of different symptom criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is provided, based on national and international guidelines. Second, treatment outcomes, including the absence of biliary colic, a pain-free state, and biliary and surgical complications, are summarized with data from three clinical trials. Finally, personal advice for treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is provided, based on recent trials, the available literature, and expert opinion.

- **Results**: This review describes different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis, provides an overview of outcomes after cholecystectomy, and advises on treatment decisions in patients with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. After cholecystectomy, biliary colic is resolved in 95 percent of patients, yet non-specific abdominal pain persists in 40 percent. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia significantly increase the risk of persistent pain. Age, previous abdominal surgery, baseline pain score on a visual analogue scale, pain characteristics, nausea, and heartburn are part of the SUCCESS criteria and are associated with clinically relevant factors.

### Systematic review: Clinical effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux [^114weA81]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Low credibility.

- **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)**: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repetitive partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep, leading to obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and/or arousals from sleep. Symptoms include daytime sleepiness, excessive snoring, and gasping during sleep. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard for the treatment of OSAS. CPAP increases intrathoracic pressure and prevents the upper airway from collapsing, effectively reducing apneas, hypopneas, and arousals from sleep. It is hypothesized that by raising intrathoracic pressure, CPAP might also reduce the occurrence of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux.

We identified seven clinical trials investigating the effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) on nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux. All of these are non-blinded, non-randomized crossover trials or observational studies. Five studies were performed in OSAS patients with subsequent nocturnal reflux symptoms and were at serious or critical risk of bias. Two studies were performed in a non-OSAS population, with a moderate or low risk of bias.

### Interventions to improve compliance in sleep apnea patients previously non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure [^1169EDMc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite widespread agreement that continuous positive airway pressure is an effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, it is estimated that 50% of patients recommended for therapy are non-compliant one year later. Interventions to improve compliance in such patients have not been thoroughly studied. We evaluated a two-phase intervention program to improve compliance in sleep apnea patients previously non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure.

- **Methods**: 204 patients with previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure were enrolled. Phase 1 evaluated standard interventions to improve therapy compliance, including mask optimization, heated humidification, topical nasal therapy, and sleep apnea education. Persistently non-compliant patients proceeded to phase 2, where compliance was compared in a double-blind, randomized fashion between standard continuous positive airway pressure and flexible bilevel positive airway pressure.

- **Results**: 49 (24%) of the 204 previously non-compliant patients became compliant (average nightly use ≥ 4 hours) after standard interventions. Then, 104 of the 155 persistently non-compliant patients agreed to continue and were randomized to either CPAP or flexible bilevel positive airway pressure re-titration and treatment for an additional ninety days. At follow-up, 15 (28%) of the 53 randomized to CPAP and 25 (49%) of the 51 randomized to flexible bilevel positive airway pressure achieved compliance (p = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: A two-phase intervention program, initially employing standard interventions, demonstrated effectiveness in improving compliance among this patient population.

### Evolution of mild obstructive sleep apnea after different treatments [^1176sdLQ]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

To evaluate the prognosis of mild obstructive sleep apnea in relation to different treatment modalities, a study was conducted using an open, retrospective, longitudinal follow-up design. Fifty adult patients who had been diagnosed and treated for mild obstructive sleep apnea at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Kuopio University Hospital between 1998 and 2004 underwent a control polysomnography in 2005. The changes in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were observed in three groups: untreated (n = 28), operative (n = 11), and those receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n = 11) at a long-term follow-up visit.

The mean follow-up period was 4 years, with a range from 1.3 to 9.0 years (SD, 1.9). In the untreated patients, there was a statistically significant increase in AHI (mean 13.3, SD 18.3) at follow-up. Half of these patients developed moderate or severe sleep apnea, with only 11% being cured. Among those treated with CPAP, 64% experienced a worsening degree of obstructive sleep apnea, while in 27% of patients, AHI returned to normal levels (< 5). For the operative patients, 18% experienced deterioration in their condition, whereas AHI returned to normal in 27% of the cases.

In conclusion, mild obstructive sleep apnea has a natural tendency to worsen over time. Therefore, active treatment of mild obstructive sleep apnea is recommended.

### What are the nonsurgical treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^112qzkNu]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2001). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is now recognized as a relatively common cause of excessive daytime sleepiness, resulting in psychosocial impairment and motor vehicle accidents, and it likely contributes to premature cardiovascular disease. Treatment is naturally directed at the upper airway; however, it is also important to identify and correct significant risk factors, such as obesity and hypothyroidism, whenever possible. Oral appliances or nasal continuous positive airway pressure may immediately reverse symptoms caused by OSA and can be used either indefinitely or as a bridge to potentially definitive surgery.

### Obesity as a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias [^112quTqY]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, although reports on the effects of this treatment on atrial fibrillation (AF) risk are conflicting. Observational studies have reported reductions in atrial and ventricular ectopy and arrhythmias with continuous positive airway pressure and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion and catheter ablation for AF. Two meta-analyses of 108 observational studies evaluating the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on AF risk reported similar results.

One meta-analysis of 3,743 people suggested that AF risk increased by almost 60% in people with obstructive sleep apnea who were not treated with continuous positive airway pressure. The other meta-analysis of 4,752 patients reported a 42% relative risk reduction of AF recurrence with continuous positive airway pressure among more than 1,000 patients. Another meta-analysis of clinical and observational studies comprising 14,812 patients showed that continuous positive airway pressure reduced AF recurrence by over 60%. The benefits of this treatment in reducing AF recurrence might also be greater in younger patients (< 60 years). Similarly, continuous positive airway pressure has been shown to be particularly efficacious at decreasing AF risk in younger men who are obese, supporting intervention early in the progression of obesity.

Nevertheless, an open-label randomized trial of 108 patients with paroxysmal AF and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea showed no difference in AF burden between groups treated with continuous positive airway pressure.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113pQ1Xi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. Symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 percent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

The authors declare no conflict of interest.

### Rise in nocturnal respiratory rate during CPAP may be an early sign of COVID-19 in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^1165d8H1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A middle-aged man with obstructive sleep apnea who had been treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) developed COVID-19. An analysis of airflow records from the CPAP machine revealed a rise in his respiratory rate on the night before the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms, while his nocturnal respiratory rate had been stable during the 18-month period prior to the presently reported episode. This case suggests that a rise in respiratory rate detected using CPAP machine data could be an important sign of impending acute illness, such as COVID-19. Studies to elucidate the usefulness of this method are warranted.

### Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea among privately paying patients - a cross sectional study [^117Deush]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the compliance, benefits, and side effects associated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy among Pakistani patients treated for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the private sector.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with OSA based on an overnight study, who were recommended for CPAP therapy between 1998 and 2003, were evaluated through a telephonic survey and a review of hospital notes. Compliance, benefits, and side effects associated with CPAP therapy were assessed.

- **Results**: Out of 135 patients who were prescribed CPAP therapy, 75 could be contacted. Sixty (80%) started using CPAP within one month of diagnosis, and 46 (61%) continued to use it long-term (beyond one year). Compliance with CPAP therapy was associated with a higher body mass index, higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, a history of witnessed apnea, and a reduction in daytime sleepiness with CPAP therapy. OSA severity, as assessed by the apnea-hypopnea index, did not affect compliance with CPAP therapy. The use of antidepressants and CPAP-induced sleep disturbances were associated with poor compliance.

- **Conclusions**: Obesity, excessive daytime sleepiness, witnessed apnea, and improvement of daytime symptoms following the use of CPAP were predictors of improved compliance. The use of antidepressants and CPAP-induced sleep disturbances were predictors of poor compliance.

### Comparison of the effects of continuous positive airway pressure and mandibular advancement devices on sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: a network meta-analysis [^114FuYpz]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness is the most important symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea and can affect work productivity, quality of life, and the risk of road traffic accidents. We aimed to quantify the effects of the two main treatments for obstructive sleep apnoea — continuous positive airway pressure and mandibular advancement devices — on daytime sleepiness and to establish predictors of response to continuous positive airway pressure.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from inception to May 31, 2015, to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of continuous positive airway pressure, mandibular advancement devices, or an inactive control (e.g. placebo or no treatment) on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS, range 0–24 points) in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. We conducted a network meta-analysis using multivariate random-effects meta-regression to assess the effect of each treatment on the ESS. Meta-regression was used to assess the association of the reported effects of continuous positive airway pressure versus inactive controls with the characteristics of trials and their risk of bias.

- **Findings**: We included 67 studies comprising 6,873 patients in the meta-analysis. Compared with an inactive control, continuous positive airway pressure was associated with a reduction in ESS score of 2.5 points (95% CI 2.0–2.9) and mandibular advancement devices resulted in a reduction of 1.7 points (1.1–2.3). On average, continuous positive airway pressure reduced the ESS score by a further 0.8 points compared with mandibular advancement devices.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones, such as steady, non-paroxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen, or complications like acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis, warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having a cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### Cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in patients with silent gallstones [^111mY8sM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Cholecystectomy is currently advised only for patients with symptomatic gallstones. However, about 4% of patients with asymptomatic gallstones develop symptoms, including cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, and gallbladder cancer.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of surgical removal of the gallbladder for patients with asymptomatic gallstones.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until 2006 to identify the randomized trials using The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group search strategy.

- **Selection criteria**: Only randomized clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing cholecystectomy and no cholecystectomy were considered for the review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We were unable to identify any randomized clinical trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy.

- **Main results**: We were unable to identify any randomized clinical trial comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy.

- **Authors' conclusions**: There are no randomized trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in patients with silent gallstones. Further evaluation of observational studies, which measure outcomes such as obstructive jaundice, gallstone-associated pancreatitis, and/or gallbladder cancer for a sufficient duration of follow-up, is necessary before randomized trials are designed.

### EAES rapid guideline: Updated systematic review, network meta-analysis, CINeMA and GRADE assessment, and evidence-informed European recommendations on the management of common bile duct stones [^116vnHRd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Choledocholithiasis presents in a considerable proportion of patients with gallbladder disease. There are several management options, including preoperative or intraoperative endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE).

- **Objective**: To develop evidence-informed, interdisciplinary European recommendations on the management of common bile duct stones in the context of an intact gallbladder, with a clinical decision to intervene both the gallbladder and the common bile duct stones.

- **Methods**: We updated a systematic review and network meta-analysis of LCBDE, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative ERCP. We formed evidence summaries using the GRADE and the CINeMA methodology, and a panel of general surgeons, gastroenterologists, and a patient representative contributed to the development of a GRADE evidence-to-decision framework to select among multiple interventions.

- **Results**: The panel reached unanimous consensus on the first Delphi round. We suggest LCBDE over preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative ERCP when surgical experience and expertise are available; intraoperative ERCP over LCBDE, preoperative or postoperative ERCP, when this is logistically feasible in a given healthcare setting; and preoperative ERCP over LCBDE or postoperative ERCP when intraoperative ERCP is not feasible and there is insufficient experience or expertise with LCBDE (weak recommendation). The evidence summaries and decision aids are available on the platform MAGICapp (https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/nJ5zyL).

### Gallstones in obesity and weight loss [^116RFru1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2000). Low credibility.

The prevalence of cholesterol gallstones is increased in obese persons. The risk is especially high in those with the highest body mass index, with a relative risk of 5–6. Weight loss further increases the risk of gallstones. The prevalence of new gallstones reaches 10–12% after 8–16 weeks of a low-calorie diet and more than 30% within 12–18 months after gastric bypass surgery. About one-third of the stones are symptomatic.

The increased prevalence of stones is mostly due to the supersaturation of bile with cholesterol, which occurs because of increased synthesis by the liver and secretion into bile. Saturation is further increased during weight loss but returns toward normal after weight stabilization at a lower level, allowing spontaneous stone dissolution in some cases. Identified risk factors for gallstones during weight loss include a relative loss of weight greater than 24% of initial body weight, a rate of weight loss greater than 1.5 kg per week, a very low-calorie diet with no fat, a long overnight fast period, and a high serum triglyceride level.

Ursodeoxycholic acid decreases cholesterol saturation of bile and gallstone incidence during weight loss. Other preventive measures include controlling the rate of weight loss, reducing the length of the overnight fast, and maintaining a small amount of fat in the diet.

### Persistent high residual AHI after CPAP use [^117LXR48]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea has recently been observed following various treatment modalities for obstructive sleep apnea. Often, it resolves spontaneously or can be managed with continuous positive airway pressure. However, we encountered a pediatric patient with obstructive sleep apnea who presented with severe complications, including growth failure, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, poor school performance, daytime sleepiness, and urinary difficulty that required permanent cystostomy. His obstructive sleep apnea resolved after adenotonsillectomy. Despite this, treatment-emergent central sleep apnea developed post-adenotonsillectomy and was further aggravated by the use of continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure without a backup respiratory rate.

After undergoing bilevel positive airway pressure with a backup respiratory rate for three months, all symptoms improved except for growth failure. Later, with the implementation of adaptive servoventilation for ten months, the patient's growth began to show improvement.

### Age and weight considerations for the use of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in pediatric populations: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^114zuZCg]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). High credibility.

This position statement provides guidance for age and weight considerations for using continuous positive airway pressure therapy in pediatric populations. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in pediatric sleep medicine to review the medical literature and develop a position statement based on a thorough review of these studies and their clinical expertise. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine Board of Directors approved the final position statement. It is the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that continuous positive airway pressure can be safe and effective for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea for pediatric patients, even in children of younger ages and lower weights, when managed by a clinician with expertise in evaluating and treating pediatric obstructive sleep apnea. The clinician must make the ultimate judgment regarding any specific care in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, accessible treatment options, patient/parental preference, and resources.

### Treating obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure benefits type 2 diabetes management [^115qXoBW]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are both common major public health concerns. Epidemiological and clinical evidence postulates that OSA may be a causal factor in the pathogenesis of T2DM. This review examines recent empirical developments in theory, research, and practice regarding T2DM and OSA.

We first examined the data from 10 studies that covered 281 patients with T2DM who used continuous positive airway pressure therapy, followed by research describing how hypoxia/reoxygenation in OSA may be key triggers initiating or contributing to insulin resistance and inflammation.

Mechanisms relating diabetes with OSA are proposed. The issues that should be addressed in the future are outlined. We suggest that intervention with continuous positive airway pressure may improve diabetic symptoms and should be encouraged for patients with diabetes.

### Cardiovascular effects after five nights without continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea: A randomized controlled trial [^114aNWEj]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

About 400 million people worldwide are estimated to suffer from moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and they run an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment can effectively treat sleep apnea and reduce arterial stiffness and blood pressure. However, adherence to CPAP treatment is essential, as obstructive sleep apneas return after only one night without CPAP treatment.

Few trials, however, have investigated the effects of CPAP withdrawal on cardiovascular outcomes, including 24-h blood pressure. A PubMed search for randomized controlled trials on CPAP withdrawal identified only one group of researchers studying cardiovascular outcomes after 14 days on CPAP vs. subtherapeutic CPAP. This group reported significant increases in morning office blood pressure with subtherapeutic CPAP, along with impaired endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation. The PubMed search found no trial that had studied how a few nights without CPAP treatments affect cardiovascular outcomes even though many patients with sleep apnea occasionally skip their CPAP treatment.

Here, we investigated whether five nights without CPAP affects arterial stiffness and 24-h blood pressure. In addition, we investigated whether five nights without CPAP affects NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide, nocturnal urine norepinephrine, glucose metabolism, blood lipids, inflammatory markers, the apnea–hypopnea index, oxygen-desaturation index, daytime sleepiness, and lung function, with separate analyses for men and women.

### Reltone 400 mg [^1176a9us]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Based on clinical trial results involving a total of 868 patients with radiolucent gallstones, treated in eight studies, the optimal ursodiol dose was determined. These studies included three conducted in the U.S. with 282 patients, one in the U.K. with 130 patients, and four in Italy with 456 patients, spanning periods from 6 to 78 months. The range of ursodiol doses was 5–20 mg/kg/day, with a dose of approximately 8–10 mg/kg/day proving most effective.

With an ursodiol dose of about 10 mg/kg/day, complete stone dissolution can be anticipated in about 30% of unselected patients with uncalcified gallstones. However, stones measuring 20 mm in maximal diameter rarely dissolve. The chance of gallstone dissolution increases up to 50% in patients with floating or floatable stones, which are characterized by high cholesterol content. The dissolution likelihood is inversely related to stone size for those under 20 mm in diameter. Notably, complete dissolution was observed in 81% of patients with stones up to 5 mm in diameter.

Age, sex, weight, degree of obesity, and serum cholesterol levels do not influence the likelihood of stone dissolution with ursodiol.

### Pitolisant for daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who refuse continuous positive airway pressure treatment. A randomized trial [^112Nnbt3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common disabling symptom in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pitolisant, a selective histamine H3 receptor antagonist with wake-promoting effects, for the treatment of daytime sleepiness in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who refuse continuous positive airway pressure treatment.

- **Methods**: In an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized (3:1), placebo-controlled, parallel-design trial, pitolisant was individually titrated at up to 20 mg/d over 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Key secondary endpoints included maintenance of wakefulness assessed on the basis of the Oxford Sleep Resistance test, safety, Clinical Global Impression of severity, patient's global opinion, EuroQol quality-of-life questionnaire, and Pichot fatigue questionnaire.

- **Measurements and main results**: A total of 268 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (75% male; mean age, 52 years; apnea–hypopnea index, 49/h; baseline sleepiness score, 15.7) were randomized (200 to pitolisant and 68 to placebo) and analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was reduced more with pitolisant than with placebo (−2.8; 95% confidence interval, −4.0 to −1.5; P < 0.001). Wake maintenance tests were not improved. The Pichot fatigue score was reduced with pitolisant. The overall impact of pitolisant was confirmed by both physicians' and patients' questionnaires. Adverse event incidence, mainly headache, insomnia, and nausea, was observed.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116ezaSE]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended to be used in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines in the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

- **Methods**: The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically significant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements" that establish the basis for appropriate and effective treatment of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Good practice statements**: The following good practice statements are based on expert consensus, and their implementation is necessary for appropriate and effective management of patients with OSA treated with positive airway pressure: (1) Treatment of OSA with PAP therapy should be based on a diagnosis of OSA established using objective sleep apnea testing. (2) Adequate follow-up, including troubleshooting and monitoring of objective efficacy and usage data to ensure adequate treatment and adherence, should occur following PAP therapy initiation and during the course of treatment.

### Chenodiol [^117A4EkF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Observed stone dissolution rates achieved with Chenodiol treatment are higher in subgroups having certain pretreatment characteristics. In the NCGS, patients with small (less than 15 mm in diameter) radiolucent stones experienced an observed rate of complete dissolution of approximately 20% with a dosage of 750 mg/day. In the uncontrolled trials using 13 to 16 mg/kg/day doses of Chenodiol, the rates of complete dissolution for small radiolucent stones ranged from 42% to 60%. Even higher dissolution rates have been observed in patients with small floatable stones. Some obese patients and occasional normal weight patients fail to achieve bile desaturation even with doses of Chenodiol up to 19 mg/kg/day for unknown reasons. Although dissolution is generally higher with increased dosage of Chenodiol, doses that are too low are associated with increased cholecystectomy rates.

Stones have recurred within five years in about 50% of patients following complete confirmed dissolutions. Although retreatment with Chenodiol has proven successful in dissolving some newly formed stones, the indications for and safety of retreatment are not well defined. Serum aminotransferase elevations and diarrhea have been notable in all clinical trials and are dose-related.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^1144c8H9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

There is a lack of consensus in selecting patients who do or do not benefit from surgery when patients present with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones are present. This review aimed to give an overview of results from recent trials and available literature to improve treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

- **Methods**: First, an overview of different symptom criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is given, based on national and international guidelines. Second, treatment outcomes — absence of biliary colic, pain-free state, biliary, and surgical complications — are summarized with data from three clinical trials. Finally, personal advice for treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is provided based on recent trials, the available literature, and expert opinion.

- **Results**: This review describes different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis, provides an overview of outcomes after cholecystectomy, and advises on treatment decisions in patients with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. After cholecystectomy, biliary colic is resolved in 95 percent of patients. However, non-specific abdominal pain persists in 40 percent. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia significantly increase the risk of persistent pain. Age, previous abdominal surgery, baseline pain score on a visual analogue scale, pain characteristics, nausea, and heartburn are part of the SUCCESS criteria, and are associated with clinical outcomes.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): Pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112N6ZkR]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

The study aimed to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of conservative management compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy for preventing symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease.

The research was organized as a parallel group, pragmatic randomised superiority trial and conducted across 20 secondary care centres in the UK. It involved 434 adults over the age of 18 with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease. These participants, referred to secondary care, were assessed for eligibility between August 2016 and November 2019. They were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either conservative management or a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

- **Interventions**: The two interventions compared were conservative management versus the surgical removal of the gallbladder.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measured was the quality of life using the SF-36 bodily pain domain over 18 months. A higher score on the SF-36 (ranging from 0 to 100) indicated a better quality of life. The study also considered costs to the NHS, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

- **Results**: Out of 2667 patients assessed for eligibility, 434 were randomised into two groups: 217 in the conservative management group and 217 in the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. By the end of 18 months, 54 participants (25%) in the conservative management group and 146 participants (67%) in the cholecystectomy group had undergone surgery. The mean SF-36 norm-based bodily pain scores were 49.4 (standard deviation 11.7) in the conservative management group and 50.4 (standard deviation 11.6) in the cholecystectomy group. There was no significant difference in the SF-36 bodily pain area under the curve up to 18 months.

### Adult obstructive sleep apnoea [^1171fWup]. Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is an increasingly common disorder characterized by repeated upper airway collapse during sleep, leading to oxygen desaturation and disrupted sleep. Features include snoring, witnessed apnoeas, and sleepiness. The pathogenesis varies, with predisposing factors including a small upper airway lumen, unstable respiratory control, low arousal threshold, small lung volume, and dysfunctional upper airway dilator muscles. Risk factors include obesity, male sex, age, menopause, fluid retention, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and smoking.

Obstructive sleep apnoea causes sleepiness and road traffic accidents, and probably contributes to systemic hypertension. It has also been linked to myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, and diabetes mellitus, although not definitively. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice, with adherence rates of 60–70%. Bi-level positive airway pressure or adaptive servo-ventilation can be used for patients who are intolerant to continuous positive airway pressure. Other treatments include dental devices, surgery, and weight loss.
