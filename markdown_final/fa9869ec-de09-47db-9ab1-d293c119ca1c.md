## Question

what is follow up for a partial empty sella with mild Prolactin elevation, stable on imaging over 9 months and no other hormonal abnormalities

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what follow-up to recommend for a patient with partial empty sella (PES) and mild prolactin elevation, stable on imaging over 9 months and with no other hormonal abnormalities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and pathophysiology and how that influences risk. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidance says about imaging intervals for stable PES. Next, I will examine how to confirm and monitor mild hyperprolactinemia, including assay pitfalls and when to treat. After that, I should review which pituitary axes require baseline and follow-up testing. Then, I need to consider clinical surveillance, visual field testing triggers, and red flags. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic follow-up schedule that avoids overtreatment while ensuring safety, with explicit triggers for earlier reassessment.

> Let me first confirm what PES implies clinically and radiographically. Partial empty sella refers to CSF herniation into the sella with a flattened pituitary that still occupies more than half the sella and is at least 3 mm thick; it is commonly incidental and often stable, with low risk of progression when imaging is unchanged over time, as in this case with 9-month stability, which strongly lowers near-term risk of clinically relevant evolution [^111TBWN1] [^116EtSwT]. Mild hyperprolactinemia here most likely reflects stalk effect from diaphragmatic incompetence and CSF pulsation rather than a lactotroph adenoma, with typical values well under 100 ng/mL and without mass-effect features of a tumor, which refocuses management on conservative surveillance rather than tumor-directed therapy [^111TBWN1] [^notfound]. I should also remember that posterior pituitary involvement (e.g., diabetes insipidus) is uncommon in PES, but if polyuria and polydipsia arise, I need to reassess promptly because AVP deficiency, while rare, can occur in the PES context [^114Jigy6].

> Next, I should review and synthesize guidance. The 2024 Pituitary review advises that when no concerning alterations are detected, re-evaluation at 24–36 months is appropriate given the low progression risk, and that endocrine evaluation is indicated at diagnosis, with no mandate for routine frequent retesting in stable, asymptomatic PES; wait, I almost wrote "no routine surveillance" — that garbled phrasing should be corrected to "no routine frequent surveillance" in stable PES, emphasizing individualized follow-up based on symptoms and changes over time [^111TBWN1]. The 2025 Pituitary Society consensus reinforces initial pituitary hormone testing for all incidental sellar lesions, including empty sella, and recommends individualizing management with multidisciplinary input if new or worsening lesion-specific symptoms occur, rather than defaulting to aggressive serial imaging in stable, asymptomatic PES [^112HyemM] [^116EtSwT]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from adenoma-centric guidance: Endocrine Society incidentaloma schedules (6–12 month MRIs) are tailored to adenomas, not empty sella, so I should not automatically apply those intervals to PES in the absence of red flags [^114z6gzx].

> I will now examine imaging follow-up. Given 9-month stability and the benign natural history of PES, the next sellar MRI should be planned at approximately 24–36 months from the baseline diagnostic study rather than at 6–12 months, provided the patient remains asymptomatic, with earlier imaging only if new neuro-ophthalmic symptoms emerge or if biochemical or clinical red flags arise; this approach avoids over-imaging an incidental, non-neoplastic anatomic variant and aligns with PES-specific guidance and individualized care principles [^111TBWN1] [^112HyemM]. Let me double-check: annual MRIs are standard for macroincidentalomas but are not indicated for stable PES, so I should explicitly avoid defaulting to adenoma algorithms here unless the clinical picture changes [^114z6gzx].

> Now, prolactin management: I should confirm the mild elevation with a repeat morning sample, minimizing venipuncture stress, because a single properly obtained value establishes the diagnosis, and discordant or unexpected results warrant verification; if the patient is asymptomatic, I should check for macroprolactin to exclude biologically inactive aggregates that can artifactually elevate immunoassay readings, and I should consider repeating PRL on an alternative platform if the value does not fit the clinical context due to known inter-assay variability that can lead to overestimation and unnecessary interventions [^112Yvr5J] [^112jNhUb] [^112gmSwi]. I need to ensure I am not misapplying the hook effect guidance: serial dilution to exclude a falsely low PRL is mainly pertinent when a large sellar mass coexists with only modest PRL elevation, which is not this scenario, though I should keep this in mind should imaging ever reveal a sizable lesion with unexpectedly low PRL [^113KpDLA]. If PRL remains only mildly elevated and the patient is asymptomatic without fertility goals, observation with repeat PRL in 6–12 months, then annually if stable, is reasonable; dopamine agonist therapy is reserved for symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, rising PRL above roughly 100 ng/mL suggesting greater stalk effect or true prolactinoma biology, or when fertility is desired, with cabergoline preferred when treatment is indicated [^1119DMso] [^112Yvr5J].

> Let me consider the broader pituitary axes. I should confirm that an initial pituitary hormone panel was obtained at diagnosis, as recommended for incidental sellar findings including empty sella; if baseline testing was normal and the patient remains asymptomatic with stable imaging, routine periodic re-testing is not mandated, but I should re-evaluate promptly if symptoms evolve that suggest hypopituitarism, tailoring the scope of testing to the clinical picture rather than a rigid timetable [^116EtSwT] [^111TBWN1]. Wait, should I be scheduling annual comprehensive panels anyway? The adenoma guidelines recommend periodic testing for macroincidentalomas because growth can precipitate new deficits, but in stable PES the risk trajectory is lower, so symptom-triggered reassessment is appropriate while maintaining a low threshold to test if clinical features change [^114z6gzx] [^113HUKxm].

> Next, I should review neuro-ophthalmic surveillance. Formal visual field testing is not necessary in an asymptomatic patient with PES that is not abutting the chiasm; however, if future MRI shows proximity to or compression of the chiasm, or if the patient develops visual symptoms, then prompt perimetry is indicated to detect early deficits and guide escalation of care, consistent with incidentaloma guidance adapted to the anatomic situation [^113iwuqn] [^112HyemM]. I need to check that the current imaging report documents chiasmal relationship clearly; if not, a dedicated pituitary MRI protocol with thin sections and dynamic sequences should be obtained at the time of the scheduled re-evaluation to ensure accurate anatomic correlation and risk assessment [^112HyemM].

> But wait, what if new symptoms emerge between scheduled reviews? Red flags that should trigger earlier reassessment include new or worsening headaches with concerning features, any visual change (acuity, fields), symptoms of hypopituitarism (e.g., secondary adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism), significant PRL rise to more than twice baseline or above about 100 ng/mL, and new polyuria or polydipsia suggesting AVP deficiency; these should prompt expedited clinical review, targeted labs, and earlier MRI as indicated [^111TBWN1] [^114Jigy6]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking medication-induced hyperprolactinemia; if medications known to elevate PRL are present and cannot be interrupted, imaging correlation and longitudinal context become important to avoid misattribution, and the hyperprolactinemia guideline provides a framework for handling suspected drug-induced cases prudently [^1178pcVQ] [^112MSUJk].

> Let me summarize the follow-up plan to ensure internal consistency. Imaging: schedule the next dedicated pituitary MRI at 24–36 months from baseline, with earlier imaging only if red flags appear, and avoid routine annual MRIs in stable, asymptomatic PES because this is not a tumor surveillance paradigm [^111TBWN1] [^112HyemM]. Prolactin: repeat in 6–12 months, then annually if stable; confirm with a proper sample, check macroprolactin if asymptomatic, and consider cross-platform verification if results are incongruent; initiate dopamine agonist therapy only for symptomatic disease, PRL escalation suggesting pathology beyond simple stalk effect, or fertility goals [^112Yvr5J] [^112jNhUb] [^112gmSwi] [^1119DMso]. Endocrine axes: ensure baseline pituitary evaluation is complete; thereafter, retest based on symptoms rather than a fixed schedule in stable PES, maintaining vigilance for evolving hypopituitarism [^116EtSwT] [^111TBWN1]. Clinical surveillance: conduct annual clinical review focused on neuro-ophthalmic and endocrine symptoms, with visual field testing only if symptoms develop or imaging shows chiasmal proximity, and expedite reassessment for any of the defined red flags, including new polyuria-polydipsia suggesting AVP deficiency, in which case urgent evaluation is warranted [^113iwuqn] [^114Jigy6] [^112HyemM].

For a patient with partial empty sella, mild prolactin elevation, stable MRI over 9 months, and no other hormonal abnormalities, the recommended follow-up is **annual clinical review with prolactin and pituitary hormone testing** [^116EtSwT] and **MRI every 2–3 years if stable** [^111TBWN1]. Macroprolactin should be checked **once** to exclude assay artifact [^112jNhUb] [^1145k2GN], and dopamine agonists are not needed unless symptoms develop or prolactin rises significantly [^1119DMso]. Escalate follow-up if **new symptoms**, visual changes, or hormonal abnormalities occur [^113DNtHx].

---

## Clinical significance of partial empty sella with mild prolactin elevation

Partial empty sella is **often incidental and benign** [^111TBWN1], though it may be associated with mild hyperprolactinemia from stalk effect or macroprolactin artifact [^112jNhUb]; **most patients remain stable without progression** [^1147CTD6].

---

## Recommended follow-up strategy

### Clinical evaluation

Annual clinical assessment should monitor for **headaches, visual changes, menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea, or hypopituitarism symptoms** [^116EtSwT]. Visual field testing is indicated only with **new visual symptoms** or when MRI shows **chiasmal proximity** [^113iwuqn].

---

### Hormonal evaluation

- **Annual prolactin measurement**: Track stability or progression.

- **Macroprolactin testing**: Perform once to exclude assay artifact [^112jNhUb].

- **Annual pituitary panel**: Morning cortisol, TSH/free T4, IGF-1, LH/FSH, testosterone (men), estradiol (premenopausal women) [^116EtSwT].

---

### Imaging follow-up

Schedule **MRI every 2–3 years** if the patient remains stable and asymptomatic [^111TBWN1]. Obtain an **earlier MRI if symptoms** arise or new hormonal abnormalities develop [^116EtSwT].

---

## Indications for escalation of follow-up or intervention

Escalate follow-up or consider intervention if any of the following occur:

- **Prolactin rise**: Significant increase or symptomatic hyperprolactinemia (e.g. galactorrhea, amenorrhea, hypogonadism).

- **New hormonal deficits**: Development of hypopituitarism.

- **Visual symptoms**: New visual field defects or chiasmal compression on MRI.

- **Lesion growth**: MRI progression.

In these cases, consider dopamine agonists (e.g. cabergoline) and refer to endocrinology or neurosurgery as appropriate [^116EtSwT] [^1119DMso].

---

## Long-term prognosis

The **long-term outlook is excellent** [^111TBWN1]; most patients remain stable without progression or significant endocrine dysfunction. Regular follow-up ensures early detection of rare progression or new hormonal abnormalities [^1147CTD6].

---

## Summary of recommended follow-up schedule

| **Follow-up component** | **Frequency** | **Indication for escalation** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical assessment | Annually | New symptoms (headache, visual changes, menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea, hypopituitarism) |
| Prolactin measurement | Annually | Significant increase or symptomatic hyperprolactinemia |
| Macroprolactin testing | Once | Confirmed macroprolactin artifact |
| Pituitary hormone panel | Annually | New hormonal abnormalities |
| MRI | Every 2–3 years | Lesion growth or new symptoms |

---

## Conclusion

For partial empty sella with mild prolactin elevation, stable imaging, and no other hormonal abnormalities, use **annual clinical and hormonal review** with **MRI every 2–3 years** if stable. Escalate follow-up only if symptoms, visual changes, or new hormonal abnormalities arise.

### Empty sella syndrome: An update [^111TBWN1]. Pituitary (2024). High credibility.

Empty sella is characterized by a flattened profile of the pituitary gland that, in most cases, represents only a radiological incidental finding. When endocrine, ophthalmic, and neurological symptoms occur, this condition is described as empty sella syndrome.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed database) with the data filter 2024–2009 using the keywords listed above. The articles met the following inclusion criteria: (1) written in English; (2) published between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2023; (3) original studies and case series on the epidemiology, characteristics, and treatment of empty sella and empty sella syndrome. Exclusion criteria included articles written in languages other than English and single case reports.

- **Results**: The incidence of empty sella is about 12% in neuroimaging studies, while in clinical practice, it can reach 35%. Endocrine pituitary disorders, defined as at least one hormone deficit, were reported in 19% to 40% of patients. Magnetic nuclear imaging (MRI) is confirmed to be the gold standard for the radiological diagnosis of empty sella. If no alterations are detected, a careful reevaluation is suggested at 24–36 months, due to the low risk of progression to PES syndrome.

- **Conclusions**: Empty sella is, in most cases, a radiological finding without clinical manifestations. In individuals with empty sella, hormonal pituitary evaluation should be assessed at the moment of diagnosis, along with careful imaging using MRI.

- **Follow-up testing of the pituitary incidentaloma**: Patients with incidentalomas who do not meet criteria for surgical removal of the tumor should receive nonsurgical follow-up [2|⊕⊕○○], with clinical assessments and the following tests:

	- **MRI scan**: An MRI scan of the pituitary should be performed 6 months after the initial scan if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma and 1 year after the initial scan if it is a microincidentaloma [1|⊕⊕○○]. In patients whose incidentaloma does not change in size, it is suggested to repeat the MRI every year for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 years for microincidentalomas for the following 3 years, and gradually less frequently thereafter [2|⊕⊕○○].

	- **VF testing**: VF testing is recommended for patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on a follow-up imaging study [1|⊕⊕⊕⊕]. Clinicians are suggested not to test VF in patients whose incidentalomas are not close to the chiasm, have no new symptoms, and are being followed closely by MRI [2|⊕○○○].

	- **Clinical and biochemical evaluations**: Clinical and biochemical evaluations for hypopituitarism should be conducted 6 months after the initial testing and yearly thereafter in patients with a pituitary macroincidentaloma, although typically hypopituitarism develops with the finding of an increase in size of the incidentaloma [1|⊕⊕○○]. It is suggested that clinicians do not need to test for hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary microincidentalomas whose clinical picture, history, and MRI do not change over time [2|⊕⊕○○].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for amenorrhea, specifically with respect to evaluating the etiology of hyperprolactinemia, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining a single measurement of serum prolactin for the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia. The diagnosis should be confirmed with a level above the upper limit of normal (ULN), provided the serum sample is obtained without excessive venipuncture stress.

### Long-term follow-up of 84 patients with giant prolactinomas-a Swedish nationwide study [^115mMXxQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Giant prolactinomas are rare, and treatment can be challenging for some patients. In this nationwide study of 84 patients with giant prolactinomas followed for a median of 9 years after diagnosis, most patients had a good treatment outcome, with long-term normalization of PRL achieved in over half of the patients and a significant tumor response in almost 70%.

- **Initial treatment response**: The largest decrease in PRL levels occurred during the first year of dopamine agonist (DA) treatment, and the long-term combined response was predicted by the effect after the first year of treatment. Most patients were treated with DA monotherapy, but approximately 1 in 4 needed additional therapy, mainly pituitary surgery.

- **Demographics and symptoms**: A large majority of the patients in the study were men, and the most frequent symptoms at diagnosis were related to the mass effects of the tumor, such as visual problems and headache. These results align with findings in smaller cohorts of giant prolactinomas. In our study, 1 out of 10 patients were discovered incidentally on a brain CT/MRI undertaken for other reasons. Similar rates of incidentally diagnosed giant prolactinomas were observed in other studies, indicating the slow growth of the tumors over many years.

- **Correlation between PRL levels and tumor size**: In patients with prolactinomas, there is a correlation between PRL levels and tumor size at diagnosis, an association that seems less evident in giant prolactinomas (r = 0.24–0.63). This is consistent with our study, where a weak correlation between PRL levels and baseline maximum tumor diameters was observed (r = 0.35).

The patient has no personal or family history of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, or heart disease. On examination, her vital signs are normal. Her body mass index is 16 kg/m². Axillary and pubic hair appeared normal, and there are no other significant findings. Her initial urine specific gravity was low (1.005), and her initial random urine osmolality test was 150 mOsm/kg. After an overnight water deprivation test, the serum osmolality increased to 298 mOsm/kg; however, the urine osmolality remained low (210 mOsm/kg). The amount of urine during the water deprivation test was 3 L over 8 hours. Her urine specific gravity after the water deprivation test was 1.006.

The intravenous desmopressin challenge test was not performed due to unavailability. However, after starting on a low dose of oral desmopressin, her symptoms significantly improved, and her urine specific gravity normalized to 1.020 at a follow-up outpatient department visit. Her urine osmolality increased to 600 mOsm/kg. Additional laboratory investigations included serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) level at 1.2 mIU/mL (normal: < 5 mIU/mL), serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level at 7 ng/mL (normal: 0 to 40 ng/mL), serum IgG4 level at 28 mg/dL (normal: < 140 mg/dL), and serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor at 203 U/mL (normal: 158–623 U/mL).

She had a normal chest x-ray. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain shows a partial filling of the pituitary.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: A case report [^1142bMXK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Arginine vasopressin deficiency, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is defined as a reduction in the release of arginine vasopressin (AVP), resulting in a variable degree of polyuria. Partial empty sella refers to an enlarged sella turcica that is not completely filled by the pituitary gland. It can be either primary or secondary, with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic cases to dysfunctions of the isolated posterior pituitary, isolated anterior pituitary, or both anterior and posterior pituitary. Diabetes insipidus caused by a partially empty sella is rare.

- **Case presentation**: The patient, an 18-year-old Ethiopian woman, presented with long-standing headache, increased urination, increased thirst, absence of menses, and weight loss. Urine and serum osmolality tests suggested diabetes insipidus. Further workup, including brain magnetic resonance imaging, led to a diagnosis of partially empty sella.

- **Conclusion**: Diabetes insipidus secondary to partially empty sella is uncommon. In patients presenting with headache and anterior or posterior pituitary dysfunction, empty sella should be considered, whether partial or complete.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline [^112o9XQJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation for silent somatotroph-secreting tumors, although rare, is recommended. In a prospective study, one of 11 macroincidentalomas was found to have elevated IGF-I levels consistent with subclinical GH excess, and another study found two of 13 surgically removed incidentalomas were positive on immunohistochemistry for GH. In a series of 3,048 autopsies, 334 pituitary adenomas were reported, with 1.8% staining positive for GH. Given that surgery is the initial treatment for GH-secreting tumors and that GH-secreting microadenomas can often be surgically cured, screening for GH-secreting tumors by measuring IGF-I levels is warranted. If elevated, further evaluation for GH excess is suggested.

- **Screening for glucocorticoid excess**: Screening may be considered when there is clinical suspicion of a corticotroph tumor. Among the 334 pituitary adenomas found in the series of 3,048 autopsies, 13.8% stained positive for ACTH. Although systematic screening of incidentalomas for subclinical glucocorticoid excess has not been reported, adrenal incidentalomas might be associated with Cushing's syndrome-related morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and osteoporosis. In such cases, patients with pituitary incidentalomas may also exhibit subclinical Cushing's disease, which could be associated with these morbidities. Thus, laboratory screening is suggested for patients with clinical suspicion of glucocorticoid excess. Detection of subclinical hypercortisolism should be followed by an evaluation for possible Cushing's disease.

### The postoperative monitoring of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas [^111LbkHH]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Clinically, nonfunctioning pituitary tumors are common in tertiary endocrine practice. Although it is widely accepted that patients with these adenomas require long-term surveillance after surgery — particularly those with macroadenomas, which grow much more frequently than microadenomas — a consensus on postoperative monitoring and treatment strategies is lacking.

The indications for radiotherapy, which has seen a decline in use over the past decade, are not entirely clear. However, most experts agree that a residual tumor mass after surgery, as well as tumor expansion into the cavernous sinus, indicate the need to consider postoperative radiotherapy. In patients not treated with radiotherapy after surgical treatment of a nonfunctioning adenoma, MRI of the tumor should be performed annually for the first six years and every two years thereafter.

Additionally, silent adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting tumors can behave more aggressively if they recur. Tumor regrowth can occasionally be found in patients after classical pituitary apoplexy. This suggests that individuals with these conditions should also be monitored carefully after surgery. However, at which point this scanning routine can be ceased remains the subject of debate, as few data on late recurrence of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas exist.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperprolactinemia, particularly in patients with drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering discontinuation of medication for 3 days or substituting with an alternative. This should be followed by re-measurement of serum prolactin in symptomatic patients with suspected drug-induced hyperprolactinemia.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112LEBCA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The evaluation for hypersecretion should include an assessment for prolactin, GH, and ACTH hypersecretion. Evidence is strongest for the need to measure a serum prolactin level in all patients presenting with an incidentaloma. Ideally, for patients with large macroincidentalomas, the laboratory should measure prolactin levels in diluted serum to ensure that levels are not falsely lowered by a hook effect in the assay.

Hyperprolactinemia was found in five of 42 patients with microincidentalomas at initial evaluation; however, in other studies, none of 22 developed a prolactin elevation on prospective follow-up. In additional studies, prolactinomas were detected in seven of 46 patients with incidentalomas (micro and macro combined). In macroincidentalomas, prolactin levels were elevated in two of 16 cases. In a large autopsy study, 39.5% of the adenomas detected (most microadenomas) were found to stain positive for prolactin. These data might suggest that prolactinomas are very common among pituitary incidentalomas, which is contrary to the literature. Autopsy data should be cautiously considered representative of incidentalomas presenting in life because the autopsy studies lack clinical data, and prolactin staining may not have been associated with clinically relevant circulating hyperprolactinemia.

Patients with hyperprolactinemia could receive a trial of dopamine agonist therapy, recognizing that mild to moderate elevations may be due to stalk compression from a lesion other than a prolactinoma. In these patients, tumor shrinkage is unlikely, and growth of the incidentaloma is minimal.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113aWSPq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The proposed algorithms for the MRI follow-up of pituitary incidentalomas considered those used in prior studies. However, these algorithms varied considerably between studies, and none was validated. As a result, the imaging follow-up proposed in this guideline incorporated the experiences of the Task Force's members. Follow-up MRI scans were recommended for macroincidentalomas because it has been demonstrated that although generally these lesions grow slowly, some do enlarge and become symptomatic. In data combined from several studies, macroincidentalomas enlarged in 85 of 353 (24%) patients. Visual field (VF) abnormalities developed in 28 (8%) patients over time, demonstrating that enlargement adversely affected the patients' health. Pituitary apoplexy developed in seven of 353 (2%) patients, with most experiencing permanent hypopituitarism and one developing permanent vision impairment. A meta-analysis of these studies showed that 8.2% of incidentalomas enlarged per year with a follow-up of 472 person-years.

- **Surveillance of microincidentalomas**: Less frequent surveillance was recommended because their rate of enlargement was low, reported in 17 of 160 patients (10.6%) followed from 2.3 to 7 years. In the meta-analysis, 1.7% of microincidentalomas enlarged per year. Importantly, none of the patients with these microincidentalomas developed new VF abnormalities that would have necessitated surgery.

### What is the natural history of nonoperated nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas [^111Hrjin]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Series of patients systematically investigating the outcome of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) not treated by surgery or radiotherapy during long follow-up periods are limited. Most reports involve the follow-up of selected cases of incidentally found lesions, rendering their results unreliable on the assessment of the pros and cons of a 'watch and wait' policy.

- **Objective**: To investigate the outcome of a series of consecutive patients with presumed NFA (microadenoma or macroadenoma), who were not offered treatment at presentation (for a number of reasons) and were regularly followed up, and to identify possible factors predicting subsequent increase in tumour size.

- **Patients and Methods**: All patients presenting to the Department of Endocrinology in Oxford between 1989 and 2005 with presumed NFA were studied retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were: (i) imaging features suggestive of a pituitary adenoma, (ii) no clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hormonal hypersecretion by the tumour, (iii) monitoring being the initial choice of management, and (iv) at least one repeat scan during the follow-up period. Subjects presenting with acute apoplexy were excluded. Follow-up management included clinical evaluation, assessment of the visual acuity and fields, and imaging at regular intervals. The duration of observation was estimated from the dates of the first and last scan.

- **Results**: Forty subjects were included in the study [18 males/22 females, median age 52 years (range 18–89), 16 with microadenoma/24 with macroadenoma]. The mean follow-up period

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: A case report [^112xRkMD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

About 29.6% of patients had arginine vasopressin deficiency in a series of patients with Sheehan's syndrome; all of these patients had an increased thirst threshold. Our patient has no history of pregnancy and does not have Sheehan's syndrome. The presentation of central diabetes insipidus in this patient is due to a primary partial empty sella.

The prevalence of migraine headache is higher in women with a ratio of 3 to 1. This may have contributed to the higher prevalence of incidental partial empty sella in this particular population, as they may be exposed to neuroimaging modalities that help to diagnose and detect asymptomatic (and clinically silent) partial empty sella. In our case, the patient is a female with a four-year history of intermittent severe headaches that have worsened in the last two years, which is similar to other studies and case reports.

This patient had a classic presentation of central diabetes insipidus and amenorrhea of four years' duration, possibly caused by her significant weight loss. Hormonal analysis showed normal levels of cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid function test, and prolactin. Her initial urine specific gravity was low (1.005), corresponding to a diluted urine with an osmolarity of 150 mosmol/L. Only urine osmolality above 700 mOsm/kg excludes diabetes insipidus. Her serum sodium concentration is also in the higher part of the reference range, which is more suggestive of diabetes insipidus. After the overnight water deprivation test, the serum osmolality increased to 298 mOsm/kg and the urine osmo.

- **Design**: We conducted a clinical audit of 18 patients who presented with hyperprolactinaemia, followed by a laboratory audit of 40 split samples across a range of serum prolactin (5–5051 mIU/L). In each case (total n = 58), serum prolactin was measured on both Roche and Siemens platforms.

- **Results**: Serum prolactin as measured by Roche was higher than the corresponding Siemens value in every case, despite similar reference ranges. The mean discrepancy in serum prolactin by Roche vs. Siemens was +81% in the clinical audit and +50% in the laboratory audit. This led to unnecessary interventions in 7/18 patients (39%) in the clinical audit.

- **Conclusions**: Serum prolactin is overestimated on the Roche relative to the Siemens platform. Laboratories should review Roche reference intervals for serum prolactin, and clinicians should consider repeating serum prolactin on another platform if the serum prolactin is incongruent with the clinical scenario.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^116wUjWG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In December 2009, a 26-year-old woman was referred for endocrinological consultation due to infertility. Her medical history included oligo-amenorrhea and mild hirsutism (Ferriman–Gallway score = 9) over the past 10 years, along with progressive weight gain over the past 3 years. Gynecological ultrasounds indicated a multifollicular appearance of the ovaries without clear signs of polycystic ovary syndrome. However, a hormonal assessment disclosed normal androgen levels accompanied by mild hyperprolactinemia (up to 36 µg/L; normal range, 5–25 µg/L).

The patient had previously undergone treatment with oral contraceptives from 2004 to 2006, but there was a rapid relapse of symptoms following discontinuation. During the initial endocrinological assessment, she reported amenorrhea over the previous 9 months, headaches, and moderate hyperprolactinemia (PRL, 126.7 µg/L). A pituitary MRI revealed a microadenoma with a maximal diameter of 8 mm. Though her facial features — prominent frontal and zygomatic bones, an enlarged nose, and mandibular prognathism — suggested possible concomitant GH hypersecretion, her GH and IGF-I levels were within normal limits (GH, 0.3 µg/L; IGF-I, 206 µg/L).

The diagnosis of a pituitary microadenoma with hyperprolactinemia was confirmed, and cabergoline therapy was initiated at a dose of 0.5 mg/week. Over the years, the clinical course was indolent, and the response to cabergoline was optimal, leading to complete normalization of PRL levels (PRL, 18 µg/L) and a 50% reduction in the size of the microadenoma.

Regarding the medical management of hyperprolactinemia, specifically concerning dopamine agonists, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend considering tapering and eventually discontinuing dopamine agonist therapy. This should be done with careful clinical and biochemical follow-up in patients treated for at least two years, who no longer have elevated serum prolactin levels, and have no visible tumor remnant on MRI.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^115zT5PF]. BMC endocrine disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The pituitary gland protrudes from the base of the brain at the sella turcica. In adults, it measures approximately 12 mm in transverse diameter, 8 mm in anterior-posterior diameter, and weighs between 500 and 1000 milligrams. The pituitary consists of two distinct lobes: the anterior pituitary, or adenohypophysis, and the posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis. The gland has a dual embryonic origin; the anterior and intermediate lobes derive from the oral ectoderm, whereas the posterior pituitary derives from the neural ectoderm.

Arginine vasopressin deficiency, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is characterized by decreased release of arginine vasopressin (AVP), or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in varying degrees of polyuria. This condition can be caused by disorders affecting sites involved in AVP synthesis and secretion, such as the hypothalamic osmoreceptors, the supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei, or the superior part of the supraopticohypophyseal tract, though damage to the neurohypophysis is rare.

Partial empty sella is an enlarged sella turcica not completely filled by pituitary tissue, as seen on imaging. It entails a loss of pituitary concavity with the gland still occupying more than 50% of the sella and having a thickness of at least 3 mm. In contrast, a complete empty sella is radiographically defined as a pituitary gland thickness of 2 mm or less, with more than 50% of the sella occupied by cerebrospinal fluid. If the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, it may not be visible on a magnetic resonance imaging scan.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115nNKxC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Follow-Up Testing of the Pituitary Incidentaloma

Patients with incidentalomas who do not meet criteria for surgical removal of the tumor should receive nonsurgical follow-up with clinical assessments and the following tests:

- **MRI scan**: Conduct an MRI scan of the pituitary 6 months after the initial scan if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma and 1 year after the initial scan if it is a microincidentaloma. In patients whose incidentaloma does not change in size, repeat the MRI every year for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 years for microincidentalomas for the following 3 years, gradually less frequently thereafter.

- **Visual field (VF) testing**: Perform VF testing in patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on a follow-up imaging study. It is suggested that clinicians do not need to test VF in patients whose incidentalomas are not close to the chiasm, who have no new symptoms, and are being followed closely by MRI.

- **Clinical and biochemical evaluations for hypopituitarism**: Conduct evaluations 6 months after the initial testing and yearly thereafter in patients with a pituitary macroincidentaloma, as typically hypopituitarism develops with the finding of an increase in size of the incidentaloma. Clinicians may not need to test for hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary microincidentalomas whose clinical picture, history, and MRI do not change over time.

Patients who develop any signs or symptoms potentially related to the incidentaloma or who show an increase in size should be further evaluated and managed accordingly.

### Ten-year follow-up of a giant prolactinoma [^111KCRbd]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Giant prolactinomas are rare pituitary tumors, and their management can be challenging. A 28-year-old man presented with headaches, visual impairment, and behavioral changes. The clinical assessment revealed hypogonadism and bitemporal hemianopsia. An MRI demonstrated a pituitary tumor measuring 76 mm in diameter, and blood tests revealed a serum prolactin level of 158,700 µU/mL (reference range: 58–254). Initially, a craniotomy was performed. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor identified a prolactinoma with a high proliferative index, and the patient was started on treatment with a dopamine agonist.

A year later, the neurological symptoms worsened due to the regrowth of the lesion's cystic component, necessitating further surgery. After 10 years of treatment with dopamine agonists, the prolactin levels decreased by 96.8%, there was an effective reduction in tumor size, and the neurological signs and symptoms resolved.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: A retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^1134oUpP]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Primary empty sella syndrome (PES) is an increasingly common disorder, mostly diagnosed incidentally during brain imaging scans. This study intended to review the clinical management and hormonal profile of patients with PES.

- **Methods**: The study included a ten-year retrospective analysis of a registry containing PES cases from 2007 to 2017 at a single tertiary care center. The keyword "primary empty sella" was used to retrieve patient details from the radiology unit. The clinical and biochemical profile of PES patients was analyzed, focusing on their case management and the rate of referral to endocrinologists.

- **Results**: The registry documented 765 cases, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:3.8, suggesting a female predominance nearly four times that of males. Although not significant, the onset of disease appeared earlier in males [Mean ± standard deviation (SD): 46.7 years ± 17.3 vs. 48.8 years ± 14.1, p = 0.110]. Approximately 79% of the cases were discovered incidentally during Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Of the total PES cases, only 20% were referred to endocrinologists, with the rest managed by general physicians. Hormonal evaluations for gonadal, growth, and adrenal hormones were performed in only 1–2.5% of cases by general physicians. Endocrinologists' hormonal evaluations were also found to be sub-optimal. Common presenting complaints included headache and visual disturbances, followed by menstrual abnormalities. Endocrine abnormalities such as thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadism, and hypocortisolism were highly prevalent among those assessed.

### Does pituitary compression/empty sella syndrome contribute to MRI-negative Cushing's disease? A single-institution experience [^116KwSmq]. Neurosurgical Focus (2020). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease arises from functioning adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas. These tumors can be very small and evade detection by MRI. Empty sella syndrome is a phenomenon by which an arachnoid outpouching of CSF into the sella leads to compression of the pituitary, likely due to intracranial hypertension (a common issue in Cushing's disease), further leading to difficulty in visualizing the pituitary gland that may contribute to difficulty in finding a tumor on MRI, known as MRI-negative Cushing's disease. The authors sought to examine the association between empty sella syndrome and MRI-negative Cushing's disease.

- **Methods**: A single-institution database of Cushing's disease cases from 2000 to 2017 was reviewed, including 197 cases in the analysis. One hundred eighty patients had a tissue diagnosis of Cushing's disease, and 17 had remission with surgery, but no definitive tissue diagnosis was obtained. Macroadenomas (tumors > 1 cm) were excluded. The degree of empty sella syndrome was graded on the degree of CSF visualized in the sella on midline sagittal T1-weighted MRI.

- **Results**: Of the 197 cases identified, 40 (20%) presented with MRI-negative disease, and empty sella syndrome was present in 49 cases (25%). MRI-negative disease was found in 18 (37%) of 49 empty sella cases versus 22 (15%) of 148 cases without empty sella syndrome present. Empty sella syndrome was significantly associated with MRI-negative disease (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.61–6.74, p = 0.0018). Decreased thickness of the pituitary gland was also associated with…

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: A retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^1161Uwcr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Empty sella (ES) is a rare pituitary condition often characterized by the herniated appearance of the pituitary, making it appear flattened with partial or complete filling of the sella turcica space by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although the term is referred to as 'empty', the pituitary may still function normally. The severity of the syndrome depends on the absence of one or more pituitary hormones due to the extent of involvement of the pituitary stalk. The empty sella has been categorized as primary empty sella or secondary empty sella based on the etiology, which is mostly unclear while many hypotheses have been proposed.

- **Primary empty sella (PES)**: The congenital absence of diaphragm sellae is the only established etiology for PES. Other causes may include relative changes in intracranial pressure from CSF.

- **Secondary empty sella**: This may result from secondary causes like traumatic factors, side effects of radiotherapy and drugs, infections and necrosis, pituitary tumors, or even autoimmune-related factors.

Although the term was first coined by Busch in 1951, Schaeffer, in 1924, first observed the sellae in 125 patients and described the radiological variations from dense to a small peripheral rim of the sellar space. In general, the etiology of empty sella is not clear and many hypotheses have been studied. The cause of empty sella is either primary (idiopathic) and most likely related to a congenital defect in the diaphragmatic sella or secondary (acquired) due to pituitary surgery, radiation, and pituitary apoplexy. The most common clinical presentation of empty sella syndrome…

### A comprehensive review of empty sella and empty sella syndrome [^117LhtCB]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Incidental radiographic findings of an empty sella are prevalent in up to 35% of the general population. While an empty sella was initially considered clinically insignificant, a subset of patients exhibits endocrine or neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations that are diagnostic of empty sella syndrome (ESS). Recent studies suggest that more patients are affected by ESS than previously recognized, necessitating a deeper understanding of this condition. This comprehensive review describes a practical approach to evaluating and managing ESS.

- **Methods**: A literature review was conducted on the etiologies and risk factors associated with primary and secondary empty sella, the radiologic features that differentiate empty sella from other sellar lesions, and the role of clinical history and hormone testing in identifying patients with ESS, as well as treatment modalities.

- **Results**: Pituitary function testing for somatotroph, lactotroph, gonadotroph, corticotroph, and thyrotroph abnormalities is necessary when suspecting ESS. While an isolated empty sella finding does not require treatment, ESS may require pharmacologic or surgical interventions to address hormone deficits or intracranial hypertension. Targeted hormone replacement, as directed by the endocrinologist, should align with guidelines and patient-specific needs. Treatment may involve multidisciplinary collaboration with neurology, neurosurgery, or ophthalmology to address patient symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: This review underscores the evolving understanding of ESS, stressing the significance of accurate diagnosis and tailored interventions.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^111Bbb3E]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The findings may indicate poor case referrals to endocrinologists and sub-optimal assessment of hormonal profiles. Evidence suggests that primary empty sella syndrome (PES) can often be an incidental finding without any symptoms. In our experience, PES was mostly an incidental finding diagnosed during radiological imaging of brain studies, and not all patients underwent endocrine evaluation. A significant finding of the research is the gross under-evaluation of hormonal assessment, although approximately 42% of the patients were symptomatic and presented with variable clinical features. This precludes the possibility of overlooking PES as merely an incidental finding and demonstrates that endocrinologists play a crucial role in the assessment and management of hormonal deficiencies.

Additionally, challenges in diagnosing central hormonal deficit arise because central hormones may be inappropriately normal or slightly below the lower normal range, which may lead to underdiagnosis of empty sella-related hormonal dysfunctions.

### Long-term follow-up of a large prospective cohort of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas: The outcome of a conservative management policy [^115QqSdW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the clinical outcome of a strategy of conservative monitoring of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) after pituitary surgery and in patients without surgery.

The research employed a retrospective study design, utilizing a clinical information system. It included an unselected clinical series of patients seen in a single center between 1989 and 2015.

Measurements involved a review of clinical information system data to obtain details and dates of surgery, radiotherapy, pituitary imaging, and outcomes.

Results showed that 190 cases of NFPA were identified. Trans-sphenoidal surgery (TSS) was performed as primary therapy in 132 cases, all involving macro-adenomas. At a mean follow-up of 7.6 years after TSS without immediate pituitary radiotherapy, recurrence occurred in 10.7% of cases with no visible postoperative residual adenoma, 38.8% with intrasellar, and 66.7% with extrasellar residuum. Recurrence was defined as growth of residual tumor requiring intervention. On survival analysis, at 10 years, recurrence-free survival was 75% in patients with no residual tumor and 40% with intrasellar residuum. Recurrence occurred in 12.5% of 24 patients who had received postoperative radiotherapy. Sixty-five patients were monitored conservatively without initial surgery. After a mean of 5-year monitoring, only 20% required intervention during follow-up (18.5% TSS), and 30.8% died of non-pituitary causes during follow-up.

The conclusion of the study suggests that a conservative approach may be safe and appropriate in patients with NFPA if followed up with appropriate imaging surveillance.

### Long-term follow-up of 84 patients with giant prolactinomas-a Swedish nationwide study [^111KmdPr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Overall response to treatment: The median follow-up after diagnosis was 9 years (IQR 4–15). At the last follow-up, the median serum PRL was 12 µg/L (IQR 4–126), with a median decrease in PRL of 99% (IQR 98–100) from diagnosis (P < 0.001). Forty-six patients (55%) had normalized PRL, and 54 (64%) had a PRL level < 2×ULN, with no significant difference between sexes (P = 1.0 and P = 0.48, respectively).

At the last follow-up, the median maximum tumor diameter had decreased to 22 mm (IQR 3–40), with a median tumor diameter reduction of 50% (IQR 23–94) (P < 0.001). Tumor response was reported in 58 patients (69%), of whom 16 had complete tumor regression on MRI. Tumor enlargement was observed in 1 patient. A combined response occurred in 36 patients (43%).

Visual field defects (VFD) showed improvement in 82% of the 49 patients (n = 40) with available follow-up data, no change in 14% (n = 7), and deterioration in 4% (n = 2). Among 33 patients with reduced visual acuity at diagnosis, the corresponding percentages were 73% (n = 24), 21% (n = 7), and 6% (n = 2).

Regarding the medical management of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically concerning watchful waiting, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining an MRI of the pituitary 6 months after the initial imaging if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma, and 1 year after the initial imaging if it is a microincidentaloma. Consider repeating the MRI if the incidentaloma does not change in size — annually for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 years for microincidentalomas — for the subsequent 3 years, and gradually less frequently thereafter.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111SM5Pt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: The evidence for, or against a recommendation for surgery due to the growth of a pituitary incidentaloma is limited. Surgery is suggested for incidentalomas that show clinically significant growth on follow-up imaging studies, particularly when such growth poses a risk to the patient's health, such as their vision. Growing incidentalomas typically continue to enlarge, and surgery is most effective for smaller lesions. A specific size cutoff for an incidentaloma is not deemed necessary for surgery, as some large incidentalomas are predominantly intra- and infrasellar.

	Although no established changes in size or growth rate automatically trigger the need for surgery, the growth pattern of the incidentaloma is considered more important. For instance, a 1-mm enlargement within the sella of a 5-mm intrasellar microadenoma is not clinically significant. However, a 1-mm enlargement towards the chiasm in a lesion only 3 mm from the chiasm is significant. Therefore, incidentalomas exhibiting significant growth specifically characterized by rapid growth over a 1- to 2-year period, and/or growth towards the optic chiasm, should be considered for surgery, especially if continued growth could threaten vision in the near future. The decision to proceed with surgery must incorporate consideration of the patient's clinical characteristics, including their age and other surgical risks.

### Clinical profile and long term follow up of children and adolescents with prolactinomas [^114ag4yu]. Pituitary (2009). Low credibility.

We report the clinical presentation, response to medical treatment, and long-term follow-up of 39 children and adolescents with prolactinoma (female:male ratio 30:9), including 30 macroadenomas and 9 microadenomas, diagnosed at the age of 9–20 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 56 months. All patients were treated with bromocriptine (BC) at doses ranging from 2.5 to 20 mg/day, or cabergoline at doses of 0.5 to 2 mg/week orally. Two patients received external conventional radiotherapy after surgery.

- **Macroprolactinoma symptoms**: In patients with macroprolactinoma (female:male ratio 21:9), headache and/or visual defects were the first symptoms encountered.
- **Amenorrhea and pubertal development**: All females experienced primary or secondary amenorrhea. However, growth arrest was not observed in any patient, and pubertal development was appropriate for their age.
- **Galactorrhea**: Spontaneous or provocative galactorrhea was observed in 23 patients (all females), while none of the male patients exhibited gynecomastia.

The mean serum prolactin (PRL) concentration at the time of diagnosis was 322.50 ng/ml in patients with microadenomas, 522.38 ng/ml in patients with macroadenomas, and 2,294.86 ng/ml in patients with macroadenomas with suprasellar extension. Bromocriptine normalized PRL levels in 25 patients and led to variable, but significant, tumor shrinkage. Cabergoline normalized PRL concentrations in 14 patients.

Pregnancy occurred in 6 patients during treatment. These pregnancies were uncomplicated, and the patients delivered normal newborns at term. Impairment of other pituitary hormone secretion was documented at the time of diagnosis in only one patient. Postoperatively, six patients experienced other pituitary hormone deficiencies.

### Giant prolactinomas: Clinical management and long-term follow up [^114C1mPX]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Giant prolactinomas are rare tumors whose treatment and outcome have only been addressed in isolated case reports. This study documents the long-term follow-up findings and clinical outcomes in a group of patients with giant prolactinomas.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective chart and clinical review of more than 2000 cases of pituitary tumors treated at the authors' institution, of which 10 met the criteria for inclusion (prolactin level > 1000 ng/ml, diameter > 4 cm on neuroimaging studies, and clinical signs of hyperprolactinemia/mass effect). The average follow-up duration was 6.7 years after initial treatment with either bromocriptine or transsphenoidal resection. In more than 90% of the patients in this series, the disease was controlled by medical treatment with bromocriptine alone; the other 10% required early surgery via transsphenoidal resection. All patients had improvement in visual symptoms. All tumors had extrasellar components, five of which exhibited frank invasion of the cavernous sinus. Tumor volume on magnetic resonance imaging decreased on average by 69%; this occurred at a faster rate and in larger amounts when treated with bromocriptine than has been reported in the literature for macroprolactinomas.

- **Conclusions**: According to long-term follow-up findings, giant prolactinomas are exquisitely responsive to dopamine agonist therapy. In giant prolactinomas, the prolactin level does not correlate with size. The main indication for early surgery is intratumoral hematoma, whereas the main indications for late surgery are cerebrospinal fluid leaks.

### Is a stable or decreasing prolactin level in a patient with prolactinoma a surrogate marker for lack of tumor growth [^112N5pvQ]. Pituitary (2014). High credibility.

The optimal interval for follow-up imaging of patients with prolactinomas is unclear. This study aims to determine the likelihood of tumor enlargement in patients with prolactinomas who have a stable or reduced prolactin (PRL) level over time, irrespective of dopamine agonist (DA) treatment. We identified 80 patients with prolactinomas (34 men, 46 women) who had at least two paired sets of serum PRL levels and pituitary MRIs, 3 or more months apart. Patients with hyperprolactinemia due to drug or stalk effects were excluded. The median (range) age was 45 (25–77) years.

Sixty-three patients (78.8%) were treated with DA. PRL levels (ng/mL) at the initial and latest sets were 114 (0.3–15,732) and 16 (0.3–1,204), respectively. In patients with identifiable tumors, the maximum tumor diameters (mm) at the initial and latest MRI studies were 12.5 (2–60) and 12.5 (2–39), respectively, with an interval of 2.9 (0.3–9.7) years.

Sixty percent of patients (n = 48) had a macroadenoma. Forty-two (52.5%) patients had either disappearance of the tumor (n = 22) or reduction (n = 20) in tumor size. In the remainder, tumor size was stable in 35 but increased in 3 patients. One of these patients, observed off therapy, had a concomitant rise in PRL level. The other 2 showed evidence of pituitary hemorrhage with no PRL increase.

Tumor growth in prolactinoma patients with a stable or decreasing PRL level, regardless of size, is a rare event. Repetitive pituitary imaging in these patients may not be warranted.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1117P25b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Remarks**: The recommendations for surgical therapy of a pituitary incidentaloma were based on the Task Force's expectations for outcome improvements in vision and endocrine function. These expectations were informed by known literature and Task Force members' clinical experience with surgery performed by a surgeon experienced in transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. The success of surgery for hormone-secreting tumors is highly dependent on the expertise, skill, and case volume of a pituitary surgeon supported by an experienced team. This is likely also true for pituitary surgery of other types of lesions. The availability of such a pituitary surgeon needs to be considered when following these guidelines.

- **Recommendation 3.2**: We suggest that surgery be considered for patients with a pituitary incidentaloma if they have the following conditions:

- Clinically significant growth of the pituitary incidentaloma
- Loss of endocrinological function
- A lesion close to the optic chiasm and a plan to become pregnant
- Unremitting headache

### Endocrine disturbances in empty sella syndrome: Case reports and review of literature [^116g4An8]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

To report five cases of empty sella syndrome (ESS) manifesting with varying degrees of pituitary dysfunction, we describe the initial manifestations in five patients with primary ESS and in previous cases of ESS reported in the English language literature.

A review of our recent medical records identified five patients referred for evaluation of pituitary deficiencies, in whom ESS was diagnosed. Glucocorticoid replacement was required in three patients, two of whom presented initially with symptoms of severe glucocorticoid deficiency. In each case, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated an empty sella.

Our cases suggest that endocrine abnormalities are not rare as the initial manifestation of ESS and that, contrary to many studies in the literature, the endocrine abnormalities may be quite severe.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114HFHVD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: The options for the treatment of patients with asymptomatic, clinically nonfunctioning pituitary incidentalomas include conservative follow-up without surgery or immediate surgery despite the lack of indications for this. Conservative follow-up is recommended with the recognition that the proper algorithm for this, as well as its appropriateness and safety, have not been tested prospectively. There are few data available for, or against a nonsurgical approach to the management of asymptomatic pituitary incidentalomas. Therefore, evidence in support of these guidelines also relied on the clinical experiences of the Task Force members.

	- The proper algorithm for endocrine testing during this follow-up has not been tested, as prospectively conducted endocrine testing of patients with pituitary incidentalomas who were followed without surgery has only been reported in 49 patients. Follow-up endocrine testing is recommended for patients with macroincidentalomas because they are at risk of developing hypopituitarism. Of the macroincidentalomas followed prospectively, worsening hypopituitarism developed in one of seven and three of 28 patients, all of whom had enlargement of their tumors. Hypopituitarism also developed in four of 37 and one of 248 patients who developed apoplexy on follow-up. Follow-up endocrine testing is recommended despite the paucity of data due to the potential high risk to the patient of untreated hypopituitarism. In a meta-analysis of incidentaloma studies, new endocrine dysfunction developed overall in 2.4% of patients per year.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: A Pituitary Society international consensus guideline statement [^112HyemM]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

This Pituitary Society Consensus article presents an evidence-based consensus on the management of pituitary incidentaloma, defined as an unexpected sellar or parasellar finding incidentally discovered on an imaging study not performed for a clinically suspected pituitary lesion. Recommendations are offered for when endocrinology, neurosurgery, and ophthalmology consultation, dedicated pituitary imaging, pituitary hormone testing, and visual assessment are warranted for macroadenomas, microadenomas, cystic lesions, and empty sella, as well as when surgical resection is indicated for incidental pituitary adenomas and cystic sellar lesions. Special considerations in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, children and adolescents, older people, and pregnant women are addressed. The consensus workshop concluded that diagnostic and management approaches should be individualized to the specific clinical context of an incidentally discovered pituitary lesion. Consultation with a multidisciplinary pituitary tumor center of excellence should be considered in the presence of new or deteriorating lesion-specific signs or symptoms, particularly when surgical or other adjuvant interventions are being considered and when there is uncertainty about the most appropriate subsequent management.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: A retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^116DEdix]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Primary empty sella (PES) syndrome is an increasingly common disorder, mostly diagnosed as an incidental finding during brain imaging scans. This study aimed to review the clinical management and hormonal profile of patients with PES.

- **Methods**: The study included a ten-year retrospective analysis of a registry containing PES cases from 2007 to 2017, sourced from a single tertiary care center. The keyword 'primary empty sella' was used to retrieve patient details from the radiology unit. The clinical and biochemical profile of PES patients was analyzed. The management of PES cases and their rate of referral to endocrinologists were explored.

- **Results**: The registry documented 765 cases with a male to female ratio of 1:3.8, indicating a female predominance by almost four times. Although not statistically significant, the onset of disease was earlier for males, with a mean age of 46.7 years ± 17.3 years compared to 48.8 years ± 14.1 years for females (p = 0.110). Approximately 79% of cases were identified incidentally during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Only 20% of PES cases were referred to endocrinologists, while the remaining were managed by general physicians. A mere 1–2.5% of cases were evaluated for gonadal, growth, and adrenal hormones by general physicians; the hormonal evaluation by endocrinologists was also suboptimal. The most common presenting complaints included headaches and visual disturbances, followed by menstrual abnormalities. Endocrine abnormalities such as thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadism, and hypocortisolism were highly prevalent among those assessed.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113iwuqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically concerning watchful waiting, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining visual field testing in patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that is enlarging to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on a follow-up imaging. Avoid obtaining visual field testing in patients with incidentalomas not situated close to the chiasm, who present no new symptoms, and are being followed closely by MRI.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113KpDLA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperprolactinemia, more specifically with respect to serum prolactin levels, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend performing serial dilution of serum samples. This is to eliminate an artifact that can occur with some immunoradiometric assays, leading to a falsely low prolactin value ("hook effect") in patients who have a discrepancy between a very large pituitary tumor and a mildly elevated prolactin level.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113HUKxm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, the Endocrine Society's 2011 guidelines recommend eliciting a complete history and performing a physical examination. This includes assessments for evidence of hypopituitarism and hormone hypersecretion syndrome in all patients with pituitary incidentaloma, including asymptomatic cases. Biochemical evaluation should be obtained in patients with evidence of either of these conditions.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: A retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^112DbCsS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Once considered a rare disorder, the diagnosis of empty sella syndrome (ES) has been increasing, as it is primarily regarded as an incidental finding on brain imaging scans, predominantly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or rarely, plain X-ray. However, patients may often present with various symptoms attributed to primary empty sella (PES) in the absence of any other likely causation. The clinical significance related to this incidental finding is ambiguous. Some studies suggest it is more than a mere incidental finding.

Several isolated case reports and series published over the last three decades, along with statistics from single-center and multi-center retrospective studies, have reported prevalence ranging from as low as 2.3% to as high as 38% in autopsy studies, with a large predominance in the female gender.

Studies from the Saudi Arabian region are scant, except for a report from the western region documenting a brief description of 537 patients with PES without exploring further details on clinical significance, symptoms, and hormonal assessments. Moreover, no specific guidelines or recommendations exist for the diagnosis and management of PES, resulting in the majority of cases being managed without referral to an endocrinologist. However, experts in the field have advised endocrine assessment even for asymptomatic cases and recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the management of PES. The objective of the present study is to report a 10-year retrospective review of primary empty sella from a single-center registry, aiming to determine the epidemiology, characteristics, and management strategies for PES.

### Serum prolactin overestimation and risk of misdiagnosis [^112XxaWG]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Falsely elevated prolactin measurements risk overdiagnosis and result in unnecessary imaging and treatment. We conducted a clinical audit of 18 patients who presented with hyperprolactinaemia, followed by a laboratory audit of 40 split samples across a range of serum prolactin (5‐5051 mIU/L). In each case (total n = 58), serum prolactin was measured on both Roche and Siemens platforms. Serum prolactin, as measured by Roche, was higher than the corresponding Siemens value in every case, despite similar reference ranges. The mean discrepancy in serum prolactin by Roche vs. Siemens was +81% in the clinical audit and +50% in the laboratory audit. This led to unnecessary interventions in 7 out of 18 patients (39%) in the clinical audit. Serum prolactin is overestimated on the Roche relative to the Siemens platform. Laboratories should review Roche reference intervals for serum prolactin, and clinicians should consider repeating serum prolactin on another platform if the serum prolactin is incongruent with the clinical scenario.

### Pituitary tumors in MEN1: Do not be misled by borderline elevated prolactin levels [^1127ucW8]. Pituitary (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this case report is to demonstrate that the simple expedient of measuring periodic prolactin levels in patients with MEN1 who have modest hyperprolactinemia and normal pituitary MRI scans is insufficient to monitor for the development of pituitary adenomas.

- **Methods**: Review of relevant literature and chart review.

- **Results**: A 25-year-old man with known MEN1, manifested by hyperparathyroidism and a gastrin-producing neuroendocrine tumor, was found to have a prolactin [PRL] level of 20.0 ng/mL [1.6–16 ng/mL] but a normal pituitary MRI scan. The impression then was that he had a prolactinoma too small to be visualized on the MRI. Over the next 3.5 years, his PRL levels remained in this mildly elevated range, but he then presented with severe headaches and visual field defects. An MRI showed a 3.1 × 1.7 × 1.9 cm pituitary adenoma with compression of the optic chiasm and invasion of the left cavernous sinus. Surgery revealed a gonadotroph adenoma, and he subsequently required gamma knife radiotherapy for residual tumor. Postoperative PRL levels were normal.

- **Conclusions**: Small, intrasellar microadenomas may be associated with elevated PRL levels due to possible direct hormone production [prolactinoma] or possibly to interference with portal vessel blood flow. In monitoring hyperprolactinemic MEN1 patients for the development of pituitary adenomas, measurement of PRL levels is insufficient, and periodic MRI scans are necessary at a more frequent interval than every 3–5 years. This may also pertain to patients with "idiopathic" hyperprolactinemia.

### ESE clinical practice guideline on functioning and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas in pregnancy [^113QXqYL]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperprolactinemia, particularly with respect to patients contemplating pregnancy, the ESE 2021 guidelines recommend initiating medical treatment as first-line therapy in patients with prolactinoma who are actively seeking pregnancy. Initiate a dopamine agonist to normalize prolactin concentrations and restore regular ovulatory cycles in these patients. Administer cabergoline at the lowest possible effective dose until pregnancy is confirmed. Consider performing transsphenoidal surgery in individual cases.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116fcDEU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the endocrine evaluation and treatment of pituitary incidentalomas. Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions through a series of conference calls and emails, plus one in-person meeting.

We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma undergo a complete history and physical examination, laboratory evaluations screening for hormone hypersecretion and hypopituitarism, and a visual field examination if the lesion abuts the optic nerves or chiasm. Patients with incidentalomas not meeting the criteria for surgical removal should be followed with clinical assessments, neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months for macroincidentalomas, 1 year for a microincidentaloma, and thereafter progressively less frequently if unchanged in size), visual field examinations for incidentalomas that abut or compress the optic nerve and chiasm (6 months and yearly), and endocrine testing for macroincidentalomas (6 months and yearly) after the initial evaluations.

Patients with a pituitary incidentaloma should be referred for surgery if they have a visual field deficit; signs of compression by the tumor leading to other visual abnormalities, such as ophthalmoplegia or neurological compromise due to compression by the lesion; a lesion abutting the optic nerves or chiasm; pituitary apoplexy with visual disturbance; or if the incidentaloma is a hypersecreting tumor other than a prolactinoma.

### Normal pituitary hypertrophy as a frequent cause of pituitary incidentaloma: a follow-up study [^113r2dFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Enlargement of the pituitary gland is a frequent cause of incidentalomas and referrals to endocrinologists for hormonal evaluation and therapeutic advice. In neuroradiological series, 25–50% of healthy women aged 18–35 years have a convex superior pituitary contour. However, pituitary height exceeds 9 mm in less than 0.5% of cases. This study aimed to provide thorough clinical and hormonal data, along with long-term endocrinological and imaging follow-up data, on subjects with incidentally discovered pituitary hypertrophy (height > 9 mm).

Seven eugonadal nulliparous women, aged 15–27 years, referred between 1989 and 1998 with incidentally diagnosed pituitary gland enlargement (height > 9 mm) and a suspected pituitary tumor, were studied. At presentation and at yearly intervals, PRL plasma levels and corticotropic, somatotropic, and thyrotropic pituitary function were measured. Pituitary dimensions and signals on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both before and after intravenous gadolinium-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid injection, were assessed.

PRL plasma levels were normal, and corticotropic, somatotropic, and thyrotropic pituitary functions were considered normal in all cases. In all women, the upper boundary of the pituitary was convex on MRI and touched the optic chiasm in four cases. The width and anteroposterior diameter of the gland were normal. The pituitary itself appeared normal, with a homogeneous signal, on both plain and dynamic studies with intravenous contrast injection. Despite normal initial hormone values, two women underwent surgery using the transsphenoidal approach.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1171T1Cy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: The decision to recommend surgery as initial therapy for a patient with a pituitary incidentaloma needs to be individualized (Fig. 1). Few data are available that specifically examine the outcome of surgery for incidentalomas. Some of the evidence considered in developing the recommended criteria for surgery was from transsphenoidal surgical series of symptomatic and often large pituitary lesions. From these data and based on the clinical experiences of the Task Force members, it is clear that substantial evidence supports the need for surgery for pituitary incidentalomas causing visual or neurological compromise. The presence of visual or neurological abnormalities due to compression of the optic nerves or chiasm by the incidentaloma is the strongest indication for surgery.

	- Although the risks of not performing surgery on tumors that abut the chiasm or those within certain proximity of the chiasm but where no visual field abnormalities are present have not been quantified, in the Task Force's experience, significant risk of future vision disturbance in these patients exists to warrant surgery. The age of the patient is also an important consideration. Surgery may be favored in younger versus older patients, given the higher lifetime probability of tumor enlargement in the former and the greater risks of surgical intervention in the latter group of patients. Some may elect to follow elderly patients with significant risks to surgery conservatively and closely for any deterioration in vision.

	- The decision to recommend surgery should also consider whether future fertility is a concern.

### Biochemical diagnosis in prolactinomas: some caveats [^1145k2GN]. Pituitary (2020). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas are the most frequently seen pituitary adenomas in clinical practice. A correct biochemical diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is a prerequisite for further investigation but may be hampered by analytical difficulties as well as a large number of potentially overlapping conditions associated with increased prolactin levels. Suspicion should rise in patients whose symptoms and biochemical results do not match.

- **Assay problems**: Macroprolactinemia and high-dose hook effect are discussed as possible reasons for false positive or false negative prolactin levels.
- **Physiological and pathological causes**: They are reviewed with their implications for interpreting prolactin results.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115oNMXV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Summary of recommendations**:
	1. **Initial evaluation of a patient with a pituitary incidentaloma**:
		- We recommend that patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma undergo a complete history and physical examination, including evaluations for evidence of hypopituitarism and a hormone hypersecretion syndrome. Patients with evidence of either condition should undergo an appropriately directed biochemical evaluation.

	1.1 **Hormone hypersecretion**:
		- We recommend that all patients with a pituitary incidentaloma, including those without symptoms, undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hormone hypersecretion.

	1.2 **Hypopituitarism**:
		- We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma with or without symptoms also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism.

	1.3 **Visual field examination**:
		- We recommend that all patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma abutting the optic nerves or chiasm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) undergo a formal visual field (VF) examination.

	1.4 **MRI evaluation**:
		- We recommend that all patients have an MRI scan if possible to evaluate the pituitary incidentaloma. This is important if the incidentaloma was initially only diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan, to better delineate the nature and extent of the incidentaloma.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115Kc1Rc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The goals of the endocrine evaluation of pituitary incidentalomas are to identify hormone hypersecretion and hypopituitarism. The recommendations for evaluation of pituitary function considered the likelihood of an abnormality in a given patient. However, valid estimates of the pretest probability of an abnormal test of pituitary function could not be definitively determined because literature on this topic is sparse. Therefore, recommendations for the evaluation relied heavily on clinical experience.

Data on the prevalence of hormone hypersecretion in patients with an incidentaloma are available from small observational studies (most retrospective) and estimated from autopsy data. Screening for hypersecretion is important to perform because the prevalence of clinically evident pituitary adenomas has recently been appreciated to be as high as 1/1000 in a Belgian population, and 0.776/1000 (of which 0.542/1000 were hormone secreting) in a region of the United Kingdom, or as low as 0.04/1000 in Finland. The incidence of incidentally discovered pituitary adenomas was recently reported as 0.016/1000 in a retrospective review from Finland.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1178pcVQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperprolactinemia, particularly in patients with drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining a pituitary MRI. This is important to differentiate between drug-induced hyperprolactinemia and symptomatic hyperprolactinemia due to a pituitary or hypothalamic mass if the medication cannot be discontinued and the onset of hyperprolactinemia does not coincide with therapy initiation.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^111jv7TU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The present study analyzed the clinical presentation and management of patients with primary empty sella syndrome (PES). The clinical picture of patients with PES is intricate due to the involvement of hormone ranges, from none to all. Since the causative mechanism is not established, it remains unclear whether the symptoms are directly due to PES or coincidental. The prevalence of endocrine abnormalities associated with PES varies greatly, ranging from normal pituitary function to various grades of pituitary dysfunction. This variation depends on factors such as pituitary stalk compression by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or intracranial hypertension.

Except for a few comprehensive reviews on the clinical diagnosis and management, no standard guidelines are available for diagnosing and managing PES. This lack of guidelines has led to case management by non-endocrinologists and under-evaluation of hormonal levels. PES is recognized as one of the causes of hypopituitarism. Structural causes of hypopituitarism, such as pituitary adenoma, abscess, apoplexy, and traumatic brain injury, are typically associated with a sequential pattern of hormonal deficiencies. This sequence generally begins with the loss of function in the somatotrophic axis, followed by dysfunction in the gonadotrophic, thyrotrophic, and finally the corticotrophic axes, in line with the anatomical locations of the respective cells.

Whether this sequence holds in cases of empty sella is uncertain. Usually, low IGF-1 levels are one of the initial signs of hypopituitarism.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112HLrFG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Patients who develop any signs or symptoms potentially related to the incidentaloma or who show an increase in size of the incidentaloma on MRI should undergo more frequent or detailed evaluations as indicated clinically.

- **Indications for surgical therapy of the pituitary incidentaloma**: We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma be referred for surgery if they have the following:
	- A visual field (VF) deficit due to the lesion
	- Other visual abnormalities, such as ophthalmoplegia or neurological compromise due to compression by the lesion
	- Lesion abutting or compressing the optic nerves or chiasm on MRI
	- Pituitary apoplexy with visual disturbance
	- Hypersecreting tumors other than prolactinomas, as recommended by guidelines of The Endocrine Society and The Pituitary Society

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^114Jigy6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a rare presentation in patients with partial empty sella, despite the association of an empty sella with other pituitary hormone abnormalities. The neurohypophysis is protected from excessive injury compared to the anterior pituitary due to the specific anatomical difference between the anterior and posterior pituitary. In particular, the vascular supply in the neurohypophysis has an anastomotic ring along the infundibular process from the medial and lateral arteries of the inferior hypophyseal arteries. This may be the reason why posterior pituitary involvement is less common than anterior pituitary involvement.

There is limited literature on arginine vasopressin deficiency associated with empty sella. The first of these was published in 1973 and described a 43-year-old woman with diabetes insipidus and postpartum galactorrhoea. Marano et al. described a posterior empty sella in two children with central diabetes insipidus. In our patient, the patient's anterior pituitary hormone function tests were all normal. She presented as a case of posterior pituitary deficiency and empty sella. The association could be coincidental.

Lambert et al. have also described a similar case but with both anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunction. They hypothesized that an empty sella may be due to necrosis of a previous pituitary adenoma, most commonly a prolactinoma, but again in our patient, we did not suspect this from the clinical presentation as the prolactin level was normal and the involvement was exclusively posterior pituitary.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1111aFv6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Values and preferences**: The recommendations for screening for hypersecretion needed to balance the potential benefits of early detection with the relatively low likelihood of finding certain abnormalities in a given patient and the costs and burden of potentially unnecessary testing. Screening for certain hormone hypersecretion syndromes was considered important, even if the patient was asymptomatic or if the abnormality was unlikely in the patient population. Screening for hyperprolactinemia was considered essential because of the potential for successful treatment with an oral dopamine agonist. Screening for GH excess with a serum IGF-I level was recommended because early detection of a GH-secreting tumor, which would likely be asymptomatic, could reduce long-term morbidity and increase the likelihood of surgical cure. Some consider screening also for glucocorticoid excess in all patients, but others may limit screening to patients for whom there is a clinical suspicion, due to the high false-positive rate and low rate of true-positive testing in the former group of patients.

- **Remarks**: The pros and cons of detailed vs. limited screening for hypersecretion syndromes (other than for prolactinoma) were debated, and the Task Force was split on this point. The quality of evidence for, or against one particular testing strategy was weak.

- **Recommendation**: We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma, with or without symptoms, also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

### Primary empty sella [^1147CTD6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The term primary empty sella (PES) refers to a number of endocrine and/or neurological disturbances that may be caused by the herniation of subarachnoid space within the sella.

The records of all patients with a diagnosis of empty sella between 1985 and 2002, seen at the Catholic University of Rome and University of Brescia, were examined retrospectively. In this study, we observed 171 female and 42 male patients affected by PES, resulting in a sex ratio of over 4:1. The mean age at diagnosis was 51.8 ± 2.1 years, and the mean body mass index was 27.3 ± 3.5 kg/m².

All patients were analyzed using either sellar computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. They also underwent neurological, ophthalmological, and baseline endocrine evaluation, with appropriate stimulation tests performed when hypopituitarism was suspected.

In the overall population, 40 of 213 patients had documented endocrine abnormalities, specifically 31 females and nine males. Twenty-two patients (10.3% of total patients; 18 women, 10.5% of all women, with a mean age of 38.6 ± 1.1 years, and four males, with a mean age of 46.5 ± 3.52 years) presented with hyperprolactinemia. Global anterior hypopituitarism was confirmed in nine patients. Additionally, eight patients presented an isolated GH deficiency. Among our patients, 138 presented with a so-called partial empty sella on computed tomography scan/magnetic resonance imaging, while 75 had total PES.

PES may be associated with variable clinical conditions ranging from mild endocrine abnormalities to more significant disturbances.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: A Pituitary Society international consensus guideline statement [^116EtSwT]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, specifically concerning endocrine evaluation, the PS 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining pituitary hormone testing in all patients with incidental sellar lesions at initial presentation, regardless of size, as well as in patients with incidentally discovered empty sella. It is important to recognize that the presence or absence of symptoms might not correlate with pituitary dysfunction at the initial presentation.
