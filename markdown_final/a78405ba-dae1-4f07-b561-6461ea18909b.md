## Question

can you get covid again right after having it. What's the earliest you can be reinfected?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how soon after a prior COVID-19 infection someone can get COVID again, what the earliest documented reinfection intervals are, and how to interpret positive tests within 90 days of a previous infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how reinfection is defined versus persistent shedding or reactivation. Then, I should verify the commonly used time thresholds (45 and 90 days) and their rationale. Next, I will examine the earliest documented reinfections and whether they were genetically confirmed. After that, I need to assess how variant circulation and immune status modify risk. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical and public health guidance, including testing strategy and vaccination timing, and summarize a cautious bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Reinfection is a new, discrete episode of acute COVID-19 occurring after recovery from a prior confirmed infection, ideally supported by molecular evidence that distinguishes it from prolonged RNA shedding or reactivation; in practice, many programs use a minimum interval from the prior positive test to separate potential reinfection from persistent detection, with CDC/IDSA-aligned criteria often using > 90 days and some research frameworks using > 45 days as a more sensitive threshold, recognizing that sequencing is the gold standard but not routinely available [^111ii9gF] [^113sXswy] [^1148w4Um].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for those thresholds before jumping ahead. Prolonged PCR positivity can persist for weeks to months after acute infection, and replication-competent virus is rarely recovered beyond about 10–15 days in mild-to-moderate cases, so a 45-day minimum helps exclude most prolonged shedding, while a 90-day minimum further reduces misclassification. Importantly, without genomic analysis, any early positive within these windows should be interpreted cautiously as possible shedding rather than proven reinfection [^113sXswy] [^115URrqH] [^116qHwiY].

> I will now examine the earliest credible reinfections. Initially, I thought the earliest confirmed reinfection was 45 days, but hold on, I should double-check the sequencing-confirmed literature. In fact, genetically verified reinfections have been documented as early as about 1.5 months (approximately 6 weeks), and a Spanish genomic series identified multiple reinfections occurring 20–45 days after a prior episode, with different lineages supporting true new infection rather than persistence, indicating that while rare, reinfection can occur before the 90-day mark when supported by sequencing and epidemiologic context [^114ouS5p] [^114DLeCr] [^1149AUNu].

> Next, I should review how variant circulation and immune status shift the risk landscape. Let me consider the Omicron era: population-level data show a marked rise in reinfections as immune-evasive sublineages predominated, with median intervals between infections shortening and a higher fraction of reinfections occurring among those previously infected in recent waves. This aligns with the biological plausibility that cross-variant protection is imperfect and wanes over time, especially in the face of antigenically distant strains [^1163C8hH] [^114RsyrC] [^112LTnLv].

> Hold on, I should verify how prior immunity modifies risk and timing. Large cohorts show that prior infection confers substantial protection against reinfection for months, but this protection is not absolute and declines with time and variant exposure. For example, Swedish registry data suggest durable protection for up to 20 months against reinfection and hospitalization, while other studies show that vaccination after infection further reduces reinfection risk, indicating that hybrid immunity provides the strongest shield, though breakthroughs still occur as variants evolve [^114cq1e8] [^113nVXiE] [^113R3kFm].

> Let me translate this into clinical guidance, and I need to ensure I'm precise. For patients with new symptoms or a new exposure within 90 days of a prior infection, antigen testing is preferred over PCR to assess for a new infection, because PCR may remain positive from the prior episode. If antigen is negative but suspicion remains high, repeating antigen in 48 hours improves sensitivity, and any early positive should be interpreted in clinical context, with sequencing considered in exceptional cases or public health investigations [^117Q6M4j] [^112J7jcS] [^113sXswy].

> But wait, what about vaccination timing after a recent infection? Should we delay boosters. I should confirm current thinking: while prior infection provides meaningful protection for several months, vaccination after recovery adds incremental benefit against reinfection. Some modeling and policy analyses suggest that if infection occurs late in the interval before a scheduled annual booster, delaying the booster by a few months may optimize benefit, but this is individualized and should follow local epidemiology and public health guidance, with the core message remaining that staying up to date reduces severe outcomes [^113V8hGa] [^117AxsgF] [^1163C8hH].

> I should double-check special populations and edge cases. Immunocompromised individuals may have blunted or atypical immune responses, prolonged shedding, and a higher risk of true reinfection or reactivation; in these patients, clinical judgment should supersede rigid time thresholds, and repeat testing or specialist input may be warranted when symptoms recur or new exposures occur soon after a prior episode [^111ii9gF] [^113sXswy].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. Yes, reinfection can occur, and although it is uncommon within the first 1–3 months, genetically confirmed cases have occurred as early as about 6 weeks, with growing evidence that early reinfections in the 20–45 day window can be legitimate when supported by sequencing. Most reinfections, however, cluster after 90 days and become more frequent as immunity wanes and new variants circulate, so the practical takeaway is that a new positive within 90 days is not automatically a reinfection, but in the right context — with new symptoms, a new exposure, and ideally variant data — it can be [^114ouS5p] [^114DLeCr] [^114jSrXC].

---

Yes, you can get COVID-19 again shortly after a prior infection, but **true reinfection within 90 days is uncommon** and usually involves a new exposure or a different variant [^114jSrXC] [^114ouS5p]. Most reinfections occur **after 90 days**, with risk rising as immunity wanes and new variants emerge [^1163C8hH] [^112LTnLv]. Early positives within 90 days often reflect persistent shedding rather than new infection, especially if symptoms are mild or absent [^113sXswy] [^115URrqH]. Reinfection risk is higher in immunocompromised individuals and with new variants, and vaccination after infection further reduces reinfection risk [^114cq1e8] [^114KdJRj].

## Earliest documented reinfection timeline

- **Earliest reinfections**: Confirmed reinfections have occurred as early as 20–45 days after the initial infection, typically with different variants or subvariants [^114DLeCr] [^114ouS5p].
- **Genomic confirmation**: These early reinfections are supported by sequencing showing distinct viral genomes between episodes, confirming true reinfection rather than persistent shedding [^114ouS5p] [^114DLeCr].
- **CDC guidance**: Reinfection can occur as early as several weeks after a prior infection, though this is rare [^114jSrXC] [^117Q6M4j].

---

## Factors influencing early reinfection

Several factors influence the likelihood and timing of **early reinfection**:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Immune response | - The strength and durability of innate, humoral, and cellular immunity vary among individuals <br/> - Weaker or waning immunity increases reinfection risk [^113pbcFV] [^114suyQN] [^112LTnLv] |
| Viral variants | - New variants (e.g. Omicron sublineages) can partially evade prior immunity, increasing reinfection risk [^114jSrXC] [^1163C8hH] [^112LTnLv] |
| Individual characteristics | - Immunocompromised individuals and those with comorbidities have higher reinfection risk [^115aFL67] |
| Exposure risk | - High exposure environments (e.g. healthcare, crowded settings) increase reinfection risk [^113nVXiE] [^116qVjh3] |

## Differentiating reinfection from persistent viral shedding

Distinguishing true reinfection from persistent viral shedding is critical; **persistent shedding** reflects prolonged detection of non-viable viral RNA after recovery and is common within 90 days, whereas **true reinfection** is a new infection confirmed by genomic sequencing or a distinct clinical episode after a symptom-free interval. PCR positivity can persist for weeks to months after infection, but **culturable virus is rarely detected beyond 10–20 days**, supporting that many early positives reflect shedding, not reinfection [^115URrqH] [^113sXswy] [^116qHwiY].

---

## Immune response and protection duration

- **Natural immunity**: Prior infection provides substantial protection against reinfection for several months, but this protection wanes over time and varies by variant exposure [^113pbcFV] [^114cq1e8] [^113R3kFm].
- **Vaccination**: Vaccination after infection (hybrid immunity) significantly reduces reinfection risk and severity compared to natural immunity alone [^114KdJRj] [^114cq1e8] [^113nVXiE].
- **Waning immunity**: Both natural and vaccine-induced immunity wane, increasing susceptibility to reinfection over time [^112LTnLv] [^111wW5PL].

---

## Clinical implications and public health recommendations

- **Testing strategy**: PCR can remain positive for weeks after recovery; antigen tests are preferred for detecting new infections within 90 days of prior infection [^117Q6M4j] [^113sXswy].
- **Isolation guidelines**: Follow current public health guidance for isolation and precautions after reinfection, typically based on symptom resolution and test results [^111RiMjz] [^116qHwiY].
- **Vaccination**: Stay up to date with vaccination, including boosters, to reduce reinfection risk and severity [^114KdJRj] [^114cq1e8] [^112nxtkw].

---

## Summary of key findings

- **Earliest reinfection**: 20–45 days after initial infection, confirmed by genomic sequencing [^114DLeCr] [^114ouS5p].
- **Common reinfection**: Most reinfections occur after 90 days, with risk rising as immunity wanes [^114jSrXC] [^113CMKVx].
- **Early positives**: Many early positives within 90 days reflect persistent shedding, not true reinfection [^113sXswy] [^115URrqH].
- **Risk factors**: Immunocompromise, new variants, and high exposure increase reinfection risk [^115aFL67] [^1163C8hH] [^116qVjh3].
- **Prevention**: Vaccination and boosters reduce reinfection risk and severity [^114KdJRj] [^114cq1e8] [^113nVXiE].

---

You can get COVID-19 again shortly after a prior infection, with the earliest confirmed reinfections occurring **20–45 days later**; however, most early positives within 90 days reflect persistent shedding rather than true reinfection. Reinfection risk rises over time as immunity wanes and new variants emerge, and vaccination after infection further reduces risk and severity [^1149AUNu] [^113CMKVx] [^115URrqH] [^114jSrXC] [^114cq1e8].

### Epidemiologic characteristics of cases with reinfection, recurrence, and hospital readmission due to COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112PKtgX]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent studies reported that some recovered COVID-19 patients have tested positive for virus nucleic acid again. A systematic search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to March 6, 2021. The pooled estimation of reinfection, recurrence, and hospital readmission among recovered COVID-19 patients was 3, 133, and 75 per 1000 patients, respectively. The overall estimation of reinfection among males compared to females was greater. The prevalence of recurrence in females compared to males was more common. Also, hospital readmission between sex groups was the same. There is uncertainty about long-term immunity after SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus, the possibility of reinfection and recurrence after recovery is not unexpected. In addition, there is a probability of hospital readmission due to adverse events of COVID-19 after discharge. However, with mass vaccination of people and using the principles of prevention and appropriate management of the disease, frequent occurrence of the disease can be controlled.

### The immunology of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection: what are the key questions? [^117NZksg]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2021). High credibility.

An important challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic has been to understand asymptomatic disease and the extent to which this may be a source of transmission. As asymptomatic disease is by definition hard to screen for, there is a lack of clarity about this aspect of the COVID-19 spectrum. Studies have considered whether the prevalence of asymptomatic disease is determined by differences in age, demographics, viral load, duration of shedding, and magnitude or durability of immunity. It is clear that adaptive immunity is strongly activated during asymptomatic infection, but some features of the T cell and antibody response may differ from those in symptomatic disease. Areas that need greater clarity include the extent to which asymptomatic disease leads to persistent symptoms (long COVID), and the quality, quantity and durability of immune priming required to confer subsequent protection.

### Recurrence or relapse of COVID-19 in older patients: a description of three cases [^1135q1nN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide, particularly in older adults. The first cases of possible reinfection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in April 2020 among older adults.

Design/Setting

In this brief report, we present three geriatric cases with two episodes of SARS-CoV-2 infection separated by a symptom-free interval.

Participants

The participants of this brief report are three cases of hospitalized geriatric women.

Measurements/Results

We note clinical and biological worsening during the second episode of COVID-19 for all three patients. Also, there is a radiological aggravation. The second episode of COVID-19 was fatal in all three cases.

Conclusion

This series of three geriatric cases with COVID-19 diagnosed two times apart for several weeks questions the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. It raises questions in clinical practice about the value of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection again in the event of symptomatic reoccurrence. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:2179–2183, 2020.

### How strong is the evidence that it is possible to get SARS-CoV-2 twice? A systematic review [^111qhWDQ]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

With a large number of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients being discharged from hospital with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2, it has been reported that several recovered cases tested positive after discharge (re-positive, RP). This finding has raised several important questions for this novel coronavirus and Covid-19 disease. In this review, we have discussed several important questions, including: (1) Can the virus re-infect recovered individuals? (2) What are the possible causes of the re-positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in recovered patients? (3) What are the implications of these re-positive cases concerning the spread of the virus? Understanding how recovery from Covid-19 confers immunity to decrease the risk of re-infection is needed to inform current efforts to safely scale back population-based interventions, such as physical distancing. We have also described what is currently known about the immune response to Covid-19, highlighted key gaps in knowledge, and identified opportunities for future research. Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor and we describe the features that should be described for future cases.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequence characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) persistence and reinfection [^114ouS5p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection and persistent infection have been reported, but sequence characteristics in these scenarios have not been described. We assessed published cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistence, characterizing the hallmarks of reinfecting sequences and the rate of viral evolution in persistent infection.

Methods

A systematic review of PubMed was conducted to identify cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistence with available sequences. Nucleotide and amino acid changes in the reinfecting sequence were compared with both the initial and contemporaneous community variants. Time-measured phylogenetic reconstruction was performed to compare intrahost viral evolution in persistent SARS-CoV-2 to community-driven evolution.

Results

Twenty reinfection and 9 persistent infection cases were identified. Reports of reinfection cases spanned a broad distribution of ages, baseline health status, reinfection severity, and occurred as early as 1.5 months or > 8 months after the initial infection. The reinfecting viral sequences had a median of 17.5 nucleotide changes with enrichment in the ORF8 and N genes. The number of changes did not differ by the severity of reinfection and reinfecting variants were similar to the contemporaneous sequences circulating in the community. Patients with persistent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrated more rapid accumulation of sequence changes than seen with community-driven evolution with continued evolution during convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody treatment.

Conclusions

Reinfecting SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes largely mirror contemporaneous circulating sequences in that geographic region, while persistent COVID-19 has been largely described in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with accelerated viral evolution.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^112mfMGv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^112J7jcS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing — serial testing and evidence gaps — had no empirical data identified to inform the value of serial versus single sample testing compared with molecular testing, so mathematical modeling suggested that repeat testing would improve sensitivity; on 11 August 2022, the FDA issued recommendations for repeat Ag testing to diagnose COVID-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. A cited preprint reported improved sensitivity when asymptomatic study participants tested 3 times at 48-hour intervals and symptomatic study participants tested 2 times within 48 hours. Evidence gaps included performance in vaccinated, previously infected, immunocompromised, or recent variant-infected individuals; in a literature search through April 2022, the panel identified only 1 study that included persons tested after November 2021, and all studies compared Ag with molecular test results with none using a clinical reference standard.

### SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk in persons with HIV, Chicago, Illinois, USA, 2020–2022 [^113RJkp8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We followed persons in the study from the earliest positive SARS-CoV-2 specimen collection date until the earliest specimen collection date of their second positive SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring > 90 days from the first infection; until death; or until May 31, 2022, whichever occurred first. We compared characteristics by HIV status to evaluate differences between the subset of persons who had 1 SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to public health and the subset of persons who had > 1 SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among PWH, we compared HIV characteristics by reinfection status.

We calculated SARS-CoV-2 reinfection incidence rates and incidence rate differences per 1,000 person-years by HIV status and for each variant phase and calendar quarter. We used nonparametric survival analyses to estimate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during the observation period. We tested for differences in cumulative incidence curves by HIV status by using Gray's tests.

To assess the effect of HIV infection on SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during the observation period, we compared crude and adjusted rate ratios using univariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with the log of person-time as the offset term. To account for overdispersion in the Poisson regression model, we calculated robust SEs using generalized estimating equations. We adjusted the model for age, sex at birth, race and ethnicity, region of residence, initial SARS-CoV-2 infection group, vaccination status at the time of first SARS-CoV-2 infection, type of first COVID-19 vaccination dose received at the time of first SARS-CoV-2 infection, and number of doses administered after the first SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc.) to conduct record matching and analyses.

Reinfection Clinical considerations for care of children and adults with confirmed COVID-19 ‹ View Table of Contents Studies suggest that reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 with the same virus variant as the initial infection or reinfection with a different variant are both possible; early reinfection within 90 days of the initial infection can occur. 99–101 Symptoms during reinfection are likely to be less severe than during the initial infection, but some people can experience more severe COVID-19 during reinfection. 99, 100, 102, 103 Both previous infection and vaccination have been shown to provide some protection against infection, although risk of reinfection varies by circulating variant. Strategies to diagnose and treat reinfection are no different than those used to diagnose and treat initial COVID-19 infection; early testing, isolation, and treatment as indicated are recommended for all people who experience symptoms of COVID-19.

### Is novel coronavirus 2019 reinfection possible? Interpreting dynamic SARS-CoV-2 test results [^116FTwN9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Since December 2019, COVID-19, the clinical syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, has infected more than 6.2 million people and brought the function of the global community to a halt. As the number of patients recovered from COVID-19 rises and the world transitions toward reopening, the question of acquired immunity versus the possibility of reinfection are critical to anticipating future viral spread. Here, we present a case of a patient previously recovered from COVID-19 who re-presents with new respiratory, radiographical, laboratory, and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) findings concerning for possible re-infection. We review this case in the context of the evolving discussion and theories surrounding dynamic RT-PCR results, prolonged viral shedding, and the possibility of developed immunity. Understanding how to interpret dynamic and late-positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results after primary infection will be critical for understanding disease prevalence and spread among communities worldwide.

### Quantifying the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time [^111bomfg]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite over 140 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic, relatively few confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have been reported. While immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection is probable, at least in the short term, few studies have quantified the reinfection risk. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to synthesise the evidence on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time. A standardised protocol was employed, based on Cochrane methodology. Electronic databases and preprint servers were searched from 1 January 2020 to 19 February 2021. Eleven large cohort studies were identified that estimated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time, including three that enrolled healthcare workers and two that enrolled residents and staff of elderly care homes. Across studies, the total number of PCR-positive or antibody-positive participants at baseline was 615,777, and the maximum duration of follow-up was more than 10 months in three studies. Reinfection was an uncommon event (absolute rate 0%-1.1%), with no study reporting an increase in the risk of reinfection over time. Only one study estimated the population-level risk of reinfection based on whole genome sequencing in a subset of patients; the estimated risk was low (0.1% [95% CI: 0.08–0.11%]) with no evidence of waning immunity for up to 7 months following primary infection. These data suggest that naturally acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity does not wane for at least 10 months post-infection. However, the applicability of these studies to new variants or to vaccine-induced immunity remains uncertain.

### Early SARS-CoV-2 reinfections involving the same or different genomic lineages, Spain [^114DLeCr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines consider SARS-CoV-2 reinfection when sequential COVID-19 episodes occur > 90 days apart. However, genomic diversity acquired over recent COVID-19 waves could mean previous infection provides insufficient cross-protection. We used genomic analysis to assess the percentage of early reinfections in a sample of 26 patients with 2 COVID-19 episodes separated by 20–45 days. Among sampled patients, 11 (42%) had reinfections involving different SARS-CoV-2 variants or subvariants. Another 4 cases were probable reinfections; 3 involved different strains from the same lineage or sublineage. Host genomic analysis confirmed the 2 sequential specimens belonged to the same patient. Among all reinfections, 36.4% involved non-Omicron, then Omicron lineages. Early reinfections showed no specific clinical patterns; 45% were among unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated persons, 27% were among persons < 18 years of age, and 64% of patients had no risk factors. Time between sequential positive SARS-CoV-2 PCRs to consider reinfection should be re-evaluated.

### Rate and severity of suspected SARS-cov-2 reinfection in a cohort of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients [^115aFL67]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the burden and severity of suspected reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Methods

A retrospective cohort of members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st March 2020 and 31st October 2020 was followed through electronic health records for subsequent positive SARS-CoV-2 tests (suspected reinfection) ≥ 90 days after initial infection, through 31st January 2021. Incidence of suspected reinfection was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the association of suspected reinfection with demographic and clinical characteristics, hospitalization, and date of initial infection.

Results

The cohort of 75 149 was predominantly Hispanic (49 648/75 149, 66.1%) and included slightly more females than males (39 736, 52.9%), with few immunocompromised patients (953, 1.3%); 315 suspected reinfections were identified, with a cumulative incidence at 270 days of 0.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7–1.0%). Hospitalization was more common at suspected reinfection (36/315, 11.4%) than initial infection (4094/75 149, 5.4%). Suspected reinfection rates were higher in females (1.0%, CI 0.8–1.2% versus 0.7%, CI 0.5–0.9%, p 0.002) and immunocompromised patients (2.1%, CI 1.0–4.2% versus 0.8%, CI 0.7–1.0%, p 0.004), and lower in children than adults (0.2%, CI 0.1–0.4% versus 0.9%, CI 0.7–1.0%, p 0.023). Patients hospitalized at initial infection were more likely to have suspected reinfection (1.2%, CI 0.6–1.7% versus 0.8%, CI 0.7–1.0%, p 0.030), as were those with initial infections later in 2020 (150-day incidence 0.4%, CI 0.2–0.5% September-October versus 0.2%, CI 0.1–0.3% March-May and 0.3%, CI 0.2–0.3% June-August, p 0.008). In an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, being female (hazard ratio (HR) 1.44, CI 1.14–1.81), adult (age 18–39, HR 2.71, CI 1.38–5.31, age 40–59 HR 2.22, CI 1.12–4.41, age ≥ 60 HR 2.52, CI 1.23–5.17 versus < 18 years), immunocompromised (HR 2.48, CI 1.31–4.68), hospitalized (HR 1.60, CI 1.07–2.38), and initially infected later in 2020 (HR 2.26, CI 1.38–3.71 September-October versus March-May) were significant independent predictors of suspected reinfection.

Conclusions

Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is uncommon, with suspected reinfections more likely in women, adults, immunocompromised subjects, and those previously hospitalized for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This suggests a need for continued precautions and vaccination in patients with COVID-19 to prevent reinfection.

### SARS-CoV-2 reinfection: "New baseline" imaging concept in the era of COVID-19 [^115hgmVr]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent reports have suggested COVID-19 relapse or reinfection may lead to readmission, which may cause a diagnostic challenge between recently infected patients and reinfections. Compounding this problem is the post-viral lung sequela that may be expected after COVID-19 pneumonia, similar to both SARS and MERS. Although chest imaging may play a role in the diagnosis of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, reinfection or relapse of COVID-19 will have similar imaging findings. A "new-baseline" imaging can be obtained from COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital discharge or clinical recovery. This new reference can not only determine if readmissions are from relapse or reinfection of COVID-19, resolving COVID-19 or potentially a different viral infection (influenza), but also for long term sequela of COVID-19 lung infection. Strategic use of imaging before discharge may be helpful in the subset of the population at the highest risk of a secondary viral infection such as influenza. Determining the residual abnormalities in post-discharge imaging can guide us in the long-term management of patients for many years to come.

### What is COVID-19 reinfection? archive… [^117Q6M4j]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

What is COVID-19 Reinfection. This information is intended for a general audience. Reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19 occurs when you are infected, recover, and then get infected again. You can be reinfected multiple times. Reinfections are most often mild, but severe illness can occur. If you are reinfected, you can also spread the virus to others. Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccine and treating COVID-19 illness within a few days of when symptoms start decreases your risk of experiencing severe illness. Once you have had COVID-19, your immune system responds in several ways. This immune response can protect you against another infection for several months, but this protection decreases over time. People with weakened immune systems who get an infection may have a limited immune response or none at all. Protection against severe COVID-19 illness generally lasts longer than protection against infection.

This means even if you get infected again, your immune response will help protect you from severe illness and hospitalization. As the virus evolves, new variants with the ability to evade your existing immunity can appear. This can increase your risk of reinfection. Reinfection can occur as early as several weeks after a previous infection, although this is rare. COVID-19 Testing for People with a Recent History of Infection Interpreting test results in the first 90 days after a previous infection can be challenging. CDC has developed testing guidance explaining which type of test you should take under different circumstances. If you have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 90 days and are testing for a possible new infection:

- Use an antigen test.
- Consult a healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns. What CDC is doing We continue to learn more about reinfections, especially as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge.

CDC is working with partners and using data to better understand reinfections, including:

- Who is at higher risk of reinfection, especially reinfections that lead to hospitalization
- How soon reinfections occur after a previous infection
- How severe reinfections are compared to initial infections
- How reinfections are associated with Long COVID.

### Insights from an N3C RECOVER EHR-based cohort study characterizing SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and long COVID [^112iTSwQ]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study uses individual EHR data stored in the N3C Data Enclave as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative. The RECOVER Initiative seeks to understand, treat, and prevent PASC. For more information on RECOVER, visit. The N3C Data Enclave provides access to harmonized EHRs from more than 75 health sites with data from over 16 million patients. We used N3C data from version 141 (9/14/2023), which has 68 contributing sites, for the current investigation. The N3C Data Enclave's Palantir Foundry platform (2021, Denver, CO), a secure analytics platform, was used for data access and analysis.

Institutional Review Board

The N3C data transfer is performed under a Johns Hopkins University Reliance Protocol # IRB00249128 or individual site agreements with NIH. The N3C Data Enclave is managed under the authority of the NIH; information can be found at. The N3C received a waiver of consent from the NIH Institutional Review Board under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy regulations for a Limited Data Set.

Key definitions

We describe the following key definitions for the study cohort, reinfection, COVID-19 variant epochs, and Long COVID.

Study Cohort definition, inclusion, and exclusion criteria

The study inclusion criteria include (1) having an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification (ICD-10) COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) or a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022; the earliest of these events was considered the COVID-19 index date; (2) reinfection events (if any) occurring before March 1, 2023; (3) being 18 years of age or older; (4) having at least two recorded healthcare visit in the year prior to index; (5) having at least one recorded healthcare visit more than 60 days after the COVID-19 index date; (6) being from a hospital partner with data that has been updated in the last three months prior to March 1, 2023; (7) being from a hospital partner with at minimum 100 hospitalizations related to a first known COVID-19 infection and at minimum 25 hospitalizations related to a COVID-19 reinfection. A total of 3,104,391 individuals met these criteria.

### Insights from an N3C RECOVER EHR-based cohort study characterizing SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and long COVID [^1111qWSb]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A fifth limitation is that the definition of reinfection only considers PCR or antigen tests after the COVID index date and does not consider COVID-19 ICD-10 diagnoses that occur in the EHR after the index date. We explored the inclusion of the COVID-19 ICD-10 diagnosis codes as reinfections but observed a dramatic and likely unrealistic increase in the number of patients with 5 or more supposed reinfections using this expanded definition. With available data, it was impossible to determine which new uses of a COVID-19 ICD-10 diagnosis code at a visit to the EHR reflected a new reinfection or new COVID symptoms as opposed to documentation of a historical experience that occurred at some unknown time prior to the visit. Authors chose to prioritize reinfections confirmed through testing with the acknowledgement that this decision likely undercounts reinfection. Future work using advances in modeling and natural language processing could help to better distinguish when a COVID ICD-10 diagnosis code alone signals a reinfection.

Reinfections are well documented in an EHR-based cohort from the RECOVER initiative and align with overall incidence rates in the literature. This work validates existing characterization of reinfection as most common in the Omicron epoch and contributes a novel characterization to the best of our knowledge of lower albumin levels after initial COVID-19 infection and leading up to reinfection. The severity of reinfection appears to be associated with the severity of initial infection, and Long COVID diagnoses appear to occur more often following initial infection than reinfection in the same epoch. We describe several opportunities for further research with these findings to better understand COVID-19 reinfections.

### The unnaturalistic fallacy: COVID-19 vaccine mandates should not discriminate against natural immunity [^116Z2onP]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

It is likely that natural immunity to COVID-19 wanes over time; indeed, there is evidence to suggest that naturally acquired antibodies diminish over time (although T-cell responses appear to be more robust). Because of that, an individual's proof of natural immunity should only be deemed valid for a limited period of time. This would need to be regularly revisited, in light of emerging evidence about the duration of natural immunity. However, in view of the aforementioned evidence suggesting the waning of vaccine-induced immunity, the same broad point is true of vaccination; a time limit should be adopted for policies requiring vaccine-induced immunity, based on the likely endurance of such immunity.

Necessity and uncertainty

One important and complicating factor in responding to a novel infectious threat is the challenge of empirical uncertainty and rapidly changing evidence. It is possible that vaccine mandates were designed at a time when the evidence about the protective benefit of natural immunity was insufficient. At that time, there may have been clear evidence of the benefit of vaccines and uncertainty about the relative protection offered by prior infection. Perhaps that justified an initial assumption that vaccines were superior. However, at this point in the pandemic, that is no longer the case, as significant evidence has accumulated about the about the impact of prior infection. That evidence does not establish that there is a high risk of reinfections leading to severe outcomes in the short-medium term — quite the opposite.

There remains some uncertainty about the relative protection (including particularly the duration of protection) of each form of immunity against COVID-19. A key ethical question is how we should respond to that uncertainty and what evidence we take as being sufficient. We have suggested that in the absence of clear evidence that vaccine-induced immunity is superior, governments should permit mandate exemptions for those with natural immunity. However, it might be argued that this standard is too low; perhaps it could instead be claimed that exemptions are only justified if we can prove that vaccinating those with natural immunity is definitely not necessary. This is a subtle change but a crucial one. Although we believe that the evidence base cannot establish that a vaccine mandate is necessary in those with natural immunity, we do not yet have sufficient evidence about the differences between natural and vaccine-induced immunity to prove that vaccines in this group are definitely not necessary.

Criteria to distinguish a new case from an existing case state that the following should be enumerated as a new case: SARS-CoV-2 sequencing results showing a different lineage from the most recent previous case; a prior confirmed or probable case with onset date (if available) or first positive specimen collection date for that classification > 90 d prior; or a person previously reported as suspect who now meets criteria for a confirmed or probable case, with repeat suspect cases not enumerated. Some individuals can shed SARS-CoV-2 detected by molecular amplification tests > 90 d after infection; for severely immunocompromised individuals, clinical judgment should be used, and CDC defines severe immunocompromise as certain conditions such as being on chemotherapy for cancer, untreated HIV infection with CD4 T lymphocyte count < 200, combined primary immunodeficiency disorder, and receipt of prednisone > 20 mg/d for > 14 d.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to serology, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies 3–5 weeks after symptom onset when evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is desired. Avoid obtaining SARS-CoV-2 IgM alone for this purpose.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — studies assessing natural infection found no direct evidence to correlate serologic testing with improved outcomes, but cohorts showed lower reinfection among those seropositive. The guideline identified 6 studies, 5 cohort and 1 case control, that evaluated relationships between antibody level and decreased SARS-CoV-2 reinfection; 5 studies assessed binding antibodies and 1 assessed neutralizing antibodies. Across the cohort studies, subjects with a seropositive result after infection appeared to have a lower likelihood of developing reinfection, and in the case control study, doubling of the antibody level was associated with reduced odds of reinfection, though study definitions, timing, tests used, and comparison groups varied.

### Reinfection rates among patients who previously tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective cohort study [^1175UJC2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Protection afforded from prior disease among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is unknown. If infection provides substantial long-lasting immunity, it may be appropriate to reconsider vaccination distribution.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of 1 health system included 150 325 patients tested for COVID-19 infection via polymerase chain reaction from 12 March 2020 to 30 August 2020. Testing performed up to 24 February 2021 in these patients was included. The main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection ≥ 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protection of prior infection against reinfection.

Results

Of 150 325 patients, 8845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141 480 (94.1%) tested negative before 30 August. A total of 1278 (14.4%) positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 62 had possible reinfection. Of those, 31 (50%) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 5449 (3.9%) were subsequently positive and 3191 of those (58.5%) were symptomatic. Protection offered from prior infection was 81.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.6–85.8) and against symptomatic infection was 84.5% (95% CI, 77.9–89.1). This protection increased over time.

Conclusions

Prior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. This protection increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection. As vaccine supply is limited, patients with known history of COVID-19 could delay early vaccination to allow for the most vulnerable to access the vaccine and slow transmission.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection induces sustained humoral immune responses in convalescent patients following symptomatic COVID-19 [^117Dqo7J]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In conclusion, antibodies appear to have antiviral effects in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the most symptomatic patients with COVID-19 remain positive for IgG-S and exhibit sufficient neutralizing activity at 6 months after the onset of illness. These results support the notion that naturally infected patients have the ability to combat reinfection and vaccines may be able to produce sufficient protection. Please note that analyses which terminated their observation earlier than ours and extrapolate the long-term trend based on this contraction phase without considering or determining the consolidation phase bear the inherent risk to come to wrong over-pessimistic conclusions concerning the durability of humoral immune responses.

### Effectiveness associated with vaccination after COVID-19 recovery in preventing reinfection [^113nVXiE]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study is among the first, to our knowledge, to examine VE among people who recovered from COVID-19 and were unvaccinated at the time of their first infection; that is, we examined the effectiveness associated with vaccination after a primary infection. This analysis provides important information for guideline development, particularly relating to residents of LTCC facilities and employees who work in these settings. Previous infection is now taken into account in the development of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelinesand has been used as an argument against vaccine requirements.

Using a statewide population cohort, we found that probability of reinfection within 9 months of recovery from primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 was approximately 2% in the unvaccinated general population, but 10% in LTCC employees and 13% among LTCC residents. Using a prospective event-history analysis with vaccine exposure as a time-varying covariate, we found that the VE associated with CPVS after recovery from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 62% for the general population and 49% for both residents and employees of LTCC facilities. These estimates adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, community COVID-19 risk, symptom and hospitalization status during the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, and timing of entry into the risk cohort relative to the onset of the pandemic (calendar time). The findings of our statewide cohort study suggest that vaccination after recovery from prior COVID-19 was associated with substantial benefit for preventing subsequent reinfection, with risk reduced by nearly half for all subpopulations. Among LTCC residents and employees, for whom the probability of reinfection at 9 months after primary infection among those who remained unvaccinated was at least 5-fold greater than in the general population (10%-13% vs 2%), this is a particularly notable finding.

### Trends in laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and associated hospitalizations and deaths among adults aged ≥ 18 years-18 U.S. jurisdictions, September 2021-December 2022 [^1174g1Nf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Higher percentages of reinfections among COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalizations and deaths were observed among younger adults compared with older adults, particularly in late 2022. The higher percentages in younger age groups might be attributable to multiple factors, including higher cumulative incidence of first infections, later eligibility for vaccination, lower vaccination coverage, increased exposure risk, and a possible survival bias because of less severe initial infections. Reinfections occurred at lower frequencies among persons who were hospitalized or died compared with cases, §§§§ consistent with evidence that previous infection-induced immunity provides better protection against severe outcomes than against subsequent infections. The risk of severe outcomes from reinfection can be reduced through vaccination, although vaccine effectiveness was not evaluated in this analysis.

The findings from this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, cases of COVID-19 might be increasingly underascertained by public health surveillance because of increasing use of at-home tests throughout 2022. Reinfections might not be captured by surveillance if either previous infections or reinfections are not laboratory-confirmed or cannot be linked (e.g. laboratory-confirmed in different jurisdictions). Second, trends in reinfections before September 1, 2021, were not determined because of the lack of a nationally standardized surveillance definition for reinfection before that time. Third, the use of the 90-day definition for reinfections based on national guidance excludes reinfections occurring ≤ 90 days, which would need to be confirmed using genomic sequencing to rule out prolonged viral shedding. Fourth, a subset of the 18 jurisdictions submitted data on reinfection-associated severe outcomes, and definitions and approaches used for ascertaining COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths varied by jurisdiction. Fifth, this ecologic analysis of epidemiologic changes in reinfection by period of SARS-CoV-2 variant predominance could not adjust for important confounders, including changes in immunity, behavior, and the population at risk over time. Finally, this descriptive analysis did not determine the impact of vaccination because it was not possible to adjust for confounding differences in testing behaviors or underlying health conditions by vaccination status.

### Disease severity during SARS-COV-2 reinfection: a nationwide study [^111dmVKm]. The Journal of Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to look at the burden of disease caused by SARS-COV-2 reinfections and identified potential risk factors for disease severity.

Methods

We used national surveillance data to collect information on all SARS-CoV-2 primary infection and suspected reinfection cases between January 2020 until early May 2021. Reinfection cases were positive COVID-19 PCR or antigen test, 90 days after their first COVID-19 positive test. We collected information on case demographics, hospital and ICU admission, immunisation status and if individuals were at risk of complication for COVID-19.

Results

Deaths reported within 28 days of testing positive were 61% (95% confidence interval: 56% to 65%) lower in suspected COVID-19 reinfection than primary infection cases. In the unvaccinated cohort, reinfections were associated with 49% (37% to 58%) lower odds of hospital admission in cases aged 50 to 65 years in the population not identified at risk of complication for COVID-19, and 34% (17% to 48%) in those at risk. ICU admission at reinfection compared to primary infection decreased 76% (55% to 87%). Individuals at risk and those aged below 50 years, who received at least 1 dose of vaccine against COVID-19, were 62% (39% to 74%) and 58% (24% to 77%) less likely to get admitted to hospital at reinfection, respectively.

Conclusion

Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with lower odds of dying, and both prior infection and immunisation showed a protective effect against severe disease in selected populations. Older age, sex and underlying comorbidities appeared as principal risk factors for illness severity at reinfection.

### Robust humoral and cellular immune responses and low risk for reinfection at least 8 months following asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 [^113pbcFV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emerging data support detectable immune responses for months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination, but it is not yet established to what degree and for how long protection against reinfection lasts.

Methods

We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses more than 8 months post-asymptomatic, mild and severe infection in a cohort of 1884 healthcare workers (HCW) and 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Possible protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was analyzed by a weekly 3-month polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening of 252 HCW that had seroconverted 7 months prior to start of screening and 48 HCW that had remained seronegative at multiple time points.

Results

All COVID-19 patients and 96% (355/370) of HCW who were anti-spike IgG positive at inclusion remained anti-spike IgG positive at the 8-month follow-up. Circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell responses were detected in 88% (45/51) of COVID-19 patients and in 63% (233/370) of seropositive HCW. The cumulative incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1% (3/252) among anti-spike IgG positive HCW (0.13 cases per 100 weeks at risk) compared to 23% (11/48) among anti-spike IgG negative HCW (2.78 cases per 100 weeks at risk), resulting in a protective effect of 95.2% (95% CI 81.9%-99.1%).

Conclusions

The vast majority of anti-spike IgG positive individuals remain anti-spike IgG positive for at least 8 months regardless of initial COVID-19 disease severity. The presence of anti-spike IgG antibodies is associated with a substantially reduced risk of reinfection up to 9 months following asymptomatic to mild COVID-19.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection associates with unstable housing and occurs in the presence of antibodies [^116qVjh3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The factors associated with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection remain poorly defined.

Methods

We identified patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and at least 1 repeat reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction result a minimum of 90 days after the initial positive test and before 21 January 2021. Those with a repeat positive test were deemed to have reinfection (n = 75), and those with only negative tests were classified as convalescents (n = 1594). Demographics, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and treatment histories were obtained from the Boston Medical Center electronic medical record. Humoral responses were analyzed using SARS-CoV-2-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and pseudovirus neutralizations in a subset of reinfection (n = 16) and convalescent samples (n = 32). Univariate, multivariate, and time to event analyses were used to identify associations.

Results

Individuals with reinfection had more frequent testing at shorter intervals compared with the convalescents. Unstable housing was associated with more than 2-fold greater chance of reinfection. Preexisting comorbidities and COVID-19 severity after the initial infection were not associated with reinfection. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G levels and pseudovirus neutralization were not different within the early weeks after primary infection and at a timepoint at least 90 days later in the 2 groups. In the convalescents, but not in those with reinfection, the late as compared with early humoral responses were significantly higher.

Conclusions

Reinfection associates with unstable housing, which is likely a marker for virus exposure, and reinfection occurs in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

### Will achieving herd immunity be a road to success to end the COVID-19 pandemic? [^115n5yMH]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the availability of several different new vaccines, their varying supply levels, effectiveness, and immunity duration across different ethnic populations, together with natural infection rates, will have an impact on when each country can reach herd immunity (ranging from 15.3% to 77.1%). Here we estimate the population proportions still required to gain immunity (ranging from 0.01% to 48.8%) to reach an overall herd immunity level to stop the exponential virus spread in 32 selected countries.

For the first 3 months of COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 was expected to be an immunizing non-relapsing disease. We report a national case series of 11 virologically-confirmed COVID-19 patients having experienced a second clinically- and virologically-confirmed acute COVID-19 episode. According to the clinical history, we discuss either re-infection or reactivation hypothesis. Larger studies including further virological, immunological and epidemiologic data are needed to understand the mechanisms of these recurrences.

### Time-dependent contraction of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses in convalescent individuals [^116zxu5z]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Convalescent individuals exhibit solid T-cell immunity, although the generation and persistence of long-term immunity remains poorly understood. To date, only a few longitudinal studies have explored the longevity of T-cell immunity. So far, studies dedicated to the analysis of promiscuous peptides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome have described different patterns of immunodominance. Responsive polyfunctional CD4 + and CD8 + T cells can be found at least 6 months after the onset of COVID-19; however, the responsiviness is reduced compared with that at the first sampling right after the infection. The decrease in T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 that occurs over time is a concern to be addressed, because the incidence of reinfection is increasing worldwide, mostly because of the emergence of VOCs. In this sense, an in-depth analysis of long-term immunity to different antigens found in SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the development of promising new vaccine candidates. Herein, we report a comprehensive analysis of the magnitude and breadth of T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens encompassing in silico –predicted peptides from SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescent individuals on days 30 and 180 after infection.

### Trends in laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and associated hospitalizations and deaths among adults aged ≥ 18 years-18 U.S. jurisdictions, September 2021-December 2022 [^1163C8hH]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Although reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have occurred in the United States with increasing frequency, U.S. epidemiologic trends in reinfections and associated severe outcomes have not been characterized. Weekly counts of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, total infections, and associated hospitalizations and deaths reported by 18 U.S. jurisdictions during September 5, 2021-December 31, 2022, were analyzed overall, by age group, and by five periods of SARS-CoV-2 variant predominance (Delta and Omicron [BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/BA.5, and BQ.1/BQ.1.1]). Among reported reinfections, weekly trends in the median intervals between infections and frequencies of predominant variants during previous infections were calculated. As a percentage of all infections, reinfections increased substantially from the Delta (2.7%) to the Omicron BQ.1/BQ.1.1 (28.8%) periods; during the same periods, increases in the percentages of reinfections among COVID-19-associated hospitalizations (from 1.9% [Delta] to 17.0% [Omicron BQ.1/BQ.1.1]) and deaths (from 1.2% [Delta] to 12.3% [Omicron BQ.1/BQ.1.1]) were also substantial. Percentages of all COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths that were reinfections were consistently higher across variant periods among adults aged 18–49 years compared with those among adults aged ≥ 50 years. The median interval between infections ranged from 269 to 411 days by week, with a steep decline at the start of the BA.4/BA.5 period, when > 50% of reinfections occurred among persons previously infected during the Alpha variant period or later. To prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes, including those following reinfection, CDC recommends staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination and receiving timely antiviral treatments, when eligible.

### Symptomatic relapse and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 in a previously healthy 30-year-old man [^113tU4p6]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Much has been reported on the clinical course of severe COVID-19, but less is known about the natural history and sequalae of mildly symptomatic cases and the prospects of reinfection or recurrence of symptoms. We report a case of a patient with mildly symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who, after being symptom-free for 2 weeks, redeveloped symptoms and was found to be PCR-positive again > 4 weeks from original testing. Surprisingly, IgG and IgM antibody testing was negative 2 months after reinfection. Although no negative testing was performed between the two symptomatic bouts, this case raises the possibility of reinfection after controlling the virus and highlights the long period with which a patient can shed virus and experience symptoms after initial infection. Characterising variations in clinical symptoms and length of viral shedding after improvement is essential for informing recommendations on patients safely resuming contact with others.

### Reduced odds of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection after vaccination among New York city adults, July 2021-November 2021 [^115FAmyy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Belief that vaccination is not needed for individuals with prior infection contributes to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy. Among individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before vaccines became available, we determined whether vaccinated individuals had reduced odds of reinfection.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study among adult New York City residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020 and had not died or tested positive again > 90 days after an initial positive test as of 1 July 2021. Case patients with reinfection during July 2021-November 2021 and controls with no reinfection were matched (1:3) on age, sex, timing of initial positive test in 2020, and neighborhood poverty level. Matched odds ratios (mORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression.

Results

Of 349 827 eligible adults, 2583 were reinfected during July 2021-November 2021. Of 2401 with complete matching criteria data, 1102 (45.9%) were known to be symptomatic for COVID-19-like illness, and 96 (4.0%) were hospitalized. Unvaccinated individuals, compared with individuals fully vaccinated within the prior 90 days, had elevated odds of reinfection (mOR, 3.21; 95% CI, 2.70 to 3.82), of symptomatic reinfection (mOR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.31 to 3.83), and of reinfection with hospitalization (mOR, 2.09; 95% CI, .91 to 4.79).

Conclusions

Vaccination reduced odds of reinfections when the Delta variant predominated. Further studies should assess risk of severe outcomes among reinfected persons as new variants emerge, infection- and vaccine-induced immunity wanes, and booster doses are administered.

### The effect of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection on long-term symptoms in the innovative support for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections registry (INSPIRE) [^115vJwxy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Our reinfection group was enrolled earlier in the pandemic than the single-infection group. While this would have less effect on our models as we stratified by the variant of initial infection, it does limit our ability to characterize differences between single-infection and reinfection groups, as our findings might reflect the risk factors for early infection rather than reinfection.

Because our survey design did not allow us to temporally place administration of vaccine doses after the initial illness in the reinfection timeline, our analysis does not account for vaccines received after the initial infection or the time between infection and vaccination. Although vaccination may offer some protection, the risk of long COVID remains even after vaccination, so it remains unclear how much receiving vaccines between infection episodes affects outcomes.

Despite these limitations, our results suggest that the timing of reinfection and the variants involved play important roles in the longer-term clinical outcomes. Individuals who experienced their initial and reinfection episodes during the Omicron period exhibit both shorter intervals between disease episodes and increased risk of long-term symptoms following reinfection.

Table 1
Descriptive characteristics of reinfected and non-reinfected COVID-19-positive patients

The second approach to characterizing reinfection is with biomarkers. We explored the trajectories of various biomarkers around COVID-19 initial and subsequent index dates from patients with and without reinfection. Biomarker measurements included laboratory values of ferritin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, D-dimer, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and serum creatinine. Units were harmonized across data partners, and clinically infeasible values were excluded according to standard N3C data quality protocols. Measurements were taken from 100 days prior to and 180 days after the COVID-19 index date in patients with and without reinfection. The same time frame was used for collection around the first reinfection index date in individuals with at least one reinfection. Laboratory values were reported separately for hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The median laboratory value of each biomarker, with upper (75%) and lower (25%) quartiles, was binned by 7-day intervals and visualized according to time from COVID-19 infection or reinfection index date. For patients with more than one measurement of the same laboratory test in a day, values were averaged.

Analysis of severity of reinfection

We compared the severity of the first COVID-19 infection versus the severity of the first reinfection using a pivot table with selected row, column, and table percentages along with a chi-square test for association. Cramer's V is used to assess effect size for the chi-square test. Death after initial infection or reinfection is also included in the table.

Reinfections and Long COVID

The subcohort of individuals described in the section "Study Cohort definition, inclusion, and exclusion criteria" was used for the analysis of reinfections and Long COVID. Kaplan–Meier curves were calculated to explore the differences in time to Long COVID diagnosis following initial infection versus reinfection. Time-to-event analysis was performed using the initial COVID-19 index date and with the first reinfection index date (for those with one or more reinfections) to the first B94.8 or U09.9 diagnosis.

### COVID-19 and your health… [^111TSKDX]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What Is COVID-19 Reinfection. This information is intended for a general audience. Reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19 occurs when you are infected, recover, and then get infected again. You can be reinfected multiple times. Reinfections are most often mild, but severe illness can occur. If you are reinfected, you can also spread the virus to others. Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccines and treating COVID-19 illness within a few days of when symptoms start decrease your risk of experiencing severe illness. Once you have had COVID-19, your immune system responds in several ways. This immune response can protect you against reinfection for several months, but this protection decreases over time. People with weakened immune systems who get an infection may have a limited immune response or none at all. Protection against severe COVID-19 illness generally lasts longer than protection against infection.

This means even if you get infected again, your immune response should help protect you from severe illness and hospitalization. As the virus evolves, new variants with the ability to evade your existing immunity can appear. This can increase your risk of reinfection. Reinfection can occur as early as several weeks after a previous infection, although this is rare. COVID-19 Testing for People with a Recent History of Infection Interpreting new positive test results in the first 90 days after a previous infection can be challenging. CDC has developed testing guidance explaining which type of test you should take under different circumstances. Protecting Yourself and Others – What You Can Do CDC recommends that all people use core prevention strategies to prevent COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, including if you have previously had COVID-19.

### Insights from an N3C RECOVER EHR-based cohort study characterizing SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and long COVID [^1135Snwp]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has persisted for over 3 years, reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 are not well understood. We aim to characterize reinfection, understand development of Long COVID after reinfection, and compare severity of reinfection with initial infection.

Methods

We use an electronic health record study cohort of over 3 million patients from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative. We calculate summary statistics, effect sizes, and Kaplan-Meier curves to better understand COVID-19 reinfections.

Results

Here we validate previous findings of reinfection incidence (6.9%), the occurrence of most reinfections during the Omicron epoch, and evidence of multiple reinfections. We present findings that the proportion of Long COVID diagnoses is higher following initial infection than reinfection for infections in the same epoch. We report lower albumin levels leading up to reinfection and a statistically significant association of severity between initial infection and reinfection (chi-squared value: 25,697, p-value: < 0.0001) with a medium effect size (Cramer's V: 0.20, DoF = 3). Individuals who experienced severe initial and first reinfection were older in age and at a higher mortality risk than those who had mild initial infection and reinfection.

Conclusions

In a large patient cohort, we find that the severity of reinfection appears to be associated with the severity of initial infection and that Long COVID diagnoses appear to occur more often following initial infection than reinfection in the same epoch. Future research may build on these findings to better understand COVID-19 reinfections.

### Reduced odds of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection after vaccination among New York city adults, July 2021-November 2021 [^114d41Wq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Cases and Controls

To assess VE against reinfection, we defined case patients as individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during 1 July 2021–30 November 2021. In a subset analysis, we restricted to case patients with symptomatic reinfection to reduce bias from differential ascertainment of asymptomatic infections among populations with frequent testing (eg, as an occupational requirement), which could vary by vaccination status. Symptomatic reinfections were defined as case patients who met the clinical criteria for COVID-19–like illness, per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition. Controls were selected from the study population as having had no documented reinfection through 30 November 2021.

To assess protection by vaccination against reinfection resulting in severe illness, we further defined case patients as individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during July 2021–November 2021 and who met criteria for COVID-19 hospitalization. COVID-19 hospitalization was defined as a hospitalization within ± 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or at time of COVID-19 death (which was defined as death within ± 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or where COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death on the death certificate). Controls for this analysis were selected from the study population as having had either no reinfection through November 2021 or a reinfection during July 2021–November 2021 but no hospitalization or death. We did not separately assess protection by vaccination against reinfection resulting in death because only 9 individuals from the study population who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during July 2021–November 2021 died.

Three controls were matched to each case patient on sex, age within ± 3 years, specimen collection date in 2020 of initial positive SARS-CoV-2 test within ± 1 week (to control for temporal trends and waning infection-induced immunity), and neighborhood poverty level. Neighborhood poverty (based on census tract of residence as of initial laboratory report in 2020) was defined as the percent of residents with incomes below the federal poverty level, per the American Community Survey 2015–2019. The controls that matched most closely on age and specimen collection date in 2020 were selected.

### Reduced risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19 vaccination-Kentucky, may-June 2021 [^111imtoM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that among Kentucky residents who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, those who were unvaccinated against COVID-19 had significantly higher likelihood of reinfection during May and June 2021. This finding supports the CDC recommendation that all eligible persons be offered COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status.

Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has been documented, but the scientific understanding of natural infection-derived immunity is still emerging. The duration of immunity resulting from natural infection, although not well understood, is suspected to persist for ≥ 90 days in most persons. The emergence of new variants might affect the duration of infection-acquired immunity, and laboratory studies have shown that sera from previously infected persons might offer weak or inconsistent responses against several variants of concern. For example, a recent laboratory study found that sera collected from previously infected persons before they were vaccinated provided a relatively weaker, and in some cases absent, neutralization response to the B.1.351 (Beta) variant when compared with the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Sera from the same persons after vaccination showed a heightened neutralization response to the Beta variant, suggesting that vaccination enhances the immune response even to a variant to which the infected person had not been previously exposed. Although such laboratory evidence continues to suggest that vaccination provides improved neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants, limited evidence in real-world settings to date corroborates the findings that vaccination can provide improved protection for previously infected persons. The findings from this study suggest that among previously infected persons, full vaccination is associated with reduced likelihood of reinfection, and, conversely, being unvaccinated is associated with higher likelihood of being reinfected.

### Clinical and laboratory findings in patients with potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection, may-July 2020 [^113CMKVx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated patients with potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection in the United States during May-July 2020.

Methods

We conducted case finding for patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 reinfection through the Emerging Infections Network. Cases reported were screened for laboratory and clinical findings of potential reinfection followed by requests for medical records and laboratory specimens. Available medical records were abstracted to characterize patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical course, and laboratory test results. Submitted specimens underwent further testing, including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture, whole genome sequencing, subgenomic RNA PCR, and testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody.

Results

Among 73 potential reinfection patients with available records, 30 patients had recurrent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms explained by alternative diagnoses with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR, 24 patients remained asymptomatic after recovery but had recurrent or persistent RT-PCR, and 19 patients had recurrent COVID-19 symptoms with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR but no alternative diagnoses. These 19 patients had symptom recurrence a median of 57 days after initial symptom onset (interquartile range: 47–76). Six of these patients had paired specimens available for further testing, but none had laboratory findings confirming reinfections. Testing of an additional 3 patients with recurrent symptoms and alternative diagnoses also did not confirm reinfection.

Conclusions

We did not confirm SARS-CoV-2 reinfection within 90 days of the initial infection based on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cases in this investigation. Our findings support current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance around quarantine and testing for patients who have recovered from COVID-19.

### Robust humoral and cellular immune responses and low risk for reinfection at least 8 months following asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 [^1111AyCg]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population and study design

The COMMUNITY study enrolled 2149 HCW and 118 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients at Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 9 April and 8 June 2020. Blood samples were first obtained at study inclusion and are from then on collected prospectively approximately every 4 months (mean [SD] 125 [8] and 121 [15] days until first follow‐up of HCW and patients respectively, and mean [SD] 263 [8] and 260 [15] days until second follow‐up of HCW and patients, respectively). Detailed symptomatology is obtained through a smartphone app system using standardized questionnaires prior to each blood sampling. Clinical, demographic and serological data at study inclusion have been presented elsewhere. At the 8‐month follow‐up, a total of 1884 HCW and 51 COVID‐19 patients remained in the study, rendering an 88% follow‐up rate of HCW and 43% follow‐up for patients (Fig. 3). COVID‐19 patients who did not come for the follow‐ups were either diseased (n = 14) or did not answer repeated invitations (n = 53). HCW who did not come for follow‐up did not answer on repeated invitations (n = 265). The majority of HCW were women (85%, 1606/1884), and the median age was 46 (IQR 35–54) years. A total of 1669/1884 HCW (89%) worked with patients, of which 1344 of 1669 HCW (81%) had COVID‐19 patient contact. HCW were stratified into four groups depending on serostatus; seropositive at study inclusion (i.e. ≥ 8 months post‐infection, n = 370), seroconversion between study inclusion and the 4‐month follow‐up (i.e. 5–8 months post‐infection, n = 116), seroconversion between the 4‐month follow‐up and the 8‐month follow‐up (i.e. ≤ 4 months post‐infection, n = 259), and seronegative at all timepoints (n = 1076). HCW who were seronegative at study inclusion and did not attend the 4‐month follow‐up (n = 63) were excluded from the current analyses. Among the 370 HCW who were seropositive at study inclusion, 9% (33/370) reported to have had no symptoms, 78% (286/370) reported to have had mild symptoms and 13% (47/370) reported to have had moderate symptoms. The COVID‐19 patient group was predominantly male (67%, 34/51), and the median age was 60 (IQR 50–66) years. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (dnr 2020‐01653), and informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

### A new positive SARS-CoV-2 test months after severe COVID-19 illness: reinfection or intermittent viral shedding? [^1121QfVw]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present a case of a patient who had a history of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 4months prior to this current presentation and, after a long asymptomatic period, subsequently tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by a RNA PCR assay, after several interval negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. We present this potential case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in order to incite discussion around differentiating persistent infection with intermittent viral shedding and reinfection, as well as to discuss evolving knowledge and approaches to the clinical management, follow-up molecular testing and treatment of COVID-19 reinfection.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^117AxsgF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

COVID-19 booster vaccinations mitigate transmission and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infection. However, the optimal date for booster administration remains uncertain. Geographic variation in infection rates throughout the year makes it challenging to intuit the best yearly booster administration date to effectively prevent infection, and also challenging to provide best guidance on how to alter booster administration in response to a breakthrough infection.

Methods

We leveraged longitudinal antibody and reinfection probabilities with spatiotemporal projections of COVID-19 incidence to develop a geographically informed approach to optimizing the timing of booster vaccination. We assessed the delay in booster vaccination that is warranted following breakthrough infections whenever they occur during the year, enabling a personalized assessment of optimal timing that acknowledges and respects diversity of COVID-19 immune status, addressing a substantial barrier to uptake.

Results

Yearly booster vaccination on any date is beneficial to prevention of infection. However, each location exhibits as much as a 3–4-fold range in degree of protection by date of uptake. Optimal COVID-19 booster vaccination dates are location-specific, typically in early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Infection late in the interval between boosts substantially alters the optimal boosting date.

Conclusions

Considerable benefit accrues from aptly timing COVID-19 booster vaccination campaigns, which can be tailored to specific locations. Individuals can acquire the greatest benefit from booster vaccination by timing it optimally, including delaying in cases of infection late in the interval between boosts. These results provide location-specific guidance for public health policy, healthcare provider recommendations, and individual decision-making.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^11712jbg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — summary statement and benefits/harms note that the overall quality of evidence was very low because of risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision, and it is unclear if patient outcomes are any different because of testing; it is therefore unclear if serologic testing provides any benefit for patient care decisions or to patients. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests help identify people who may have been infected or were vaccinated, but a universal antibody level predictive of protection from reinfection after infection or vaccination has not been identified. The panel did not identify any benefits to antibody testing in most individuals to inform management decisions, though there may be selected scenarios for immunocompromised hosts where serologic testing could be considered, such as patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and significant humoral immune impairment being evaluated for treatment with convalescent plasma.

### Elucidating reasons of COVID-19 re-infection and its management strategies [^112WZsoK]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Reinfection is gradually being recognised after symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. We try to elucidate various explanations behind COVID-19 reinfection and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat.

Methods

We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'Reinfection', 'Vaccines' and 'India' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in March 2021 and first half of April 2021 during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiology, risk factors and trends of reinfection were assessed.

Results

A multitude of factors have been associated with rising incidence of COVID-19 reinfection in India and across the world. Emergence of 'Variants of Concern (VOC)', pandemic fatigue and disregard of infection prevention strategies appear to be the most obvious reasons.

Conclusions

COVID-19 reinfection is an emerging concern amongst the worldwide population with newer mutant strains demonstrating increasing transmissibility and responsible for continuing waves of the pandemic. COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB), improvised vaccines and enhanced vaccination drives are necessary to mitigate global threat.

### Early SARS-CoV-2 reinfections involving the same or different genomic lineages, Spain [^1149AUNu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines consider SARS-CoV-2 reinfection when sequential COVID-19 episodes occur > 90 days apart. However, genomic diversity acquired over recent COVID-19 waves could mean previous infection provides insufficient cross-protection. We used genomic analysis to assess the percentage of early reinfections in a sample of 26 patients with 2 COVID-19 episodes separated by 20–45 days. Among sampled patients, 11 (42%) had reinfections involving different SARS-CoV-2 variants or subvariants. Another 4 cases were probable reinfections; 3 involved different strains from the same lineage or sublineage. Host genomic analysis confirmed the 2 sequential specimens belonged to the same patient. Among all reinfections, 36.4% involved non-Omicron, then Omicron lineages. Early reinfections showed no specific clinical patterns; 45% were among unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated persons, 27% were among persons < 18 years of age, and 64% of patients had no risk factors. Time between sequential positive SARS-CoV-2 PCRs to consider reinfection should be re-evaluated.

### Proper assignation of reactivation in a COVID-19 recurrence initially interpreted as a reinfection [^11749GVZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

A 77-year-old man (case R) with previous diagnosis of a mild COVID-19 episode was hospitalized 35 days later. On day 23 postadmission, he developed a second COVID-19 episode, now severe, and finally died. Initially, case R's COVID-19 recurrence was interpreted as a reinfection due to the exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive roommate. However, whole-genome sequencing indicated that case R's recurrence corresponded to a reactivation of the strain involved in his first episode. Case R's reactivation had major consequences, leading to a more severe episode, and causing subsequent transmission to another 2 hospitalized patients, 1 of them with fatal outcome.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^115WUsZ9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing in patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) offers low clinical benefit with very low-certainty evidence; reported positivity varied widely (IgM or IgG 11% to 62%; PCR-negative/total antibody-positive 0% to 60%), studies varied by assay and timing (eg, < 20 days vs > 15 days), and in unvaccinated or previously uninfected individuals the negative predictive value is high when testing is performed more than 2 weeks after symptom onset. In this instance, negative serologic results should prompt further evaluation for alternative etiologies if symptoms persist. Serology cannot distinguish recent from remote infection or vaccine response from infection, and assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies provides no added benefit over repeat NAATs for diagnosing acute COVID-19 and may lead to diagnostic uncertainty.

### Assessment of the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection in an intense reexposure setting [^112aC1qc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, swabs with Ct < 30 (suggestive of recent active infection) at least 45 days after the first positive swab were considered as showing strong evidence for reinfection. Swabs with Ct ≥ 30 at least 45 days after the first positive swab were considered as showing good evidence for reinfection if PCR positivity was associated with contextual evidence that supported the status of "reinfection", including appearance of symptoms (often as proxied by being diagnosed at a health facility), if the infection was diagnosed through contact tracing (indicating recent exposure to an infected person), if the change in Ct value from the last swab was to a lower Ct value (indicating increasing viral load), and/or if the repeated swabbing did not follow a regular pattern and the time interval between repeated swabs was not short (to exclude cases under clinical management that are indicative of poor control of first infection).

Shorter durations bordering the 45-day cutoff with Ct values ≥ 30 and no contextual evidence supporting the status of reinfection were indicative of some evidence for reinfection but not strong or good evidence for reinfection as they are more likely to reflect the long tail of the prolonged PCR positivity distribution (Figure 1). Age ≥ 70 years, repeated swabs on hospitalized patients, and severe or critical WHO disease classifications were considered as contextual factors indicative of poor control of the first infection rather than reinfection. Cases that had such contextual factors (and implicitly did not fit the criteria of strong, good, or some evidence for reinfection) were considered to have weak (or no) evidence for reinfection.

Of note is that hospitalized COVID-19 cases often had multiple subsequent swabs administered as part of clinical care. Repeated swabbing was standard earlier in the epidemic, as the criteria for discharge from an isolation facility required at least 2 subsequent PCR-negative swabs. This was changed later to a time-based criteria per updated WHO recommendation.

### Risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and COVID-19 hospitalisation in individuals with natural and hybrid immunity: a retrospective, total population cohort study in Sweden [^114cq1e8]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Background

Real-world evidence supporting vaccination against COVID-19 in individuals who have recovered from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is sparse. We aimed to investigate the long-term protection from a previous infection (natural immunity) and whether natural immunity plus vaccination (hybrid immunity) was associated with additional protection.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we formed three cohorts using Swedish nationwide registers managed by the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the National Board of Health and Welfare, and Statistics Sweden. Cohort 1 included unvaccinated individuals with natural immunity matched pairwise on birth year and sex to unvaccinated individuals without natural immunity at baseline. Cohort 2 and cohort 3 included individuals vaccinated with one dose (one-dose hybrid immunity) or two doses (two-dose hybrid immunity) of a COVID-19 vaccine, respectively, after a previous infection, matched pairwise on birth year and sex to individuals with natural immunity at baseline. Outcomes of this study were documented SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 20, 2020, until Oct 4, 2021, and inpatient hospitalisation with COVID-19 as main diagnosis from March 30, 2020, until Sept 5, 2021.

Findings

Cohort 1 was comprised of 2039106 individuals, cohort 2 of 962318 individuals, and cohort 3 of 567810 individuals. During a mean follow-up of 164 days (SD 100), 34090 individuals with natural immunity in cohort 1 were registered as having had a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared with 99168 infections in non-immune individuals; the numbers of hospitalisations were 3195 and 1976, respectively. After the first 3 months, natural immunity was associated with a 95% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0·05 [95% CI 0·05–0·05] p < 0·001) and an 87% (0·13 [0·11–0·16]; p < 0·001) lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation for up to 20 months of follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 52 days (SD 38) in cohort 2, 639 individuals with one-dose hybrid immunity were registered with a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, compared with 1662 individuals with natural immunity (numbers of hospitalisations were eight and 113, respectively). One-dose hybrid immunity was associated with a 58% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (aHR 0·42 [95% CI 0·38–0·47]; p < 0·001) than natural immunity up to the first 2 months, with evidence of attenuation thereafter up to 9 months (p < 0·001) of follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 66 days (SD 53) in cohort 3, 438 individuals with two-dose hybrid immunity were registered as having had a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, compared with 808 individuals with natural immunity (numbers of hospitalisations were six and 40, respectively). Two-dose hybrid immunity was associated with a 66% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (aHR 0·34 [95% CI 0·31–0·39]; p < 0·001) than natural immunity, with no significant attenuation up to 9 months (p = 0·07). To prevent one reinfection in the natural immunity cohort during follow-up, 767 individuals needed to be vaccinated with two doses. Both one-dose (HR adjusted for age and baseline date 0·06 [95% CI 0·03–0·12]; p < 0·001) and two-dose (HR adjusted for age and baseline date 0·10 [0·04–0·22]; p < 0·001) hybrid immunity were associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation than natural immunity.

Interpretation

The risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and COVID-19 hospitalisation in individuals who have survived and recovered from a previous infection remained low for up to 20 months. Vaccination seemed to further decrease the risk of both outcomes for up to 9 months, although the differences in absolute numbers, especially in hospitalisations, were small. These findings suggest that if passports are used for societal restrictions, they should acknowledge either a previous infection or vaccination as proof of immunity, as opposed to vaccination only.

Funding

### Prevalence and predictors of COVID-19 long-term symptoms: a cohort study from the amazon basin [^111B4nfu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

In the current study, 32 participants (2.3%) had a second episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by RT-PCR, variants as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, known during the study period, may be responsible for reinfection. These persons were evaluated 2.3 months after the reinfection and were more likely to report persistent symptoms. After the sensitivity analysis, we found similar findings to those of the primary analysis, suggesting persistence of symptoms beyond the period of convalescence from the second episode. It is possible that reinfection enhances pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Potential contributing factors to the development of post-COVID-19 syndrome include long-term tissue damage and pathological inflammation (e.g. viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity).

Our study presented the prevalence of late symptoms of COVID-19 in an ethnically diverse population. We found that 64% of patients developed post-COVID-19 syndrome, which was relatively high compared with previous reports from Asia and Europe. The high proportion of non-White individuals (brown, black, and another race) in our study may partially explain these differences because non-White race was an independent predictor of late COVID-19 symptoms. No individual self-declared as Asian in our cohort.

This study has limitations. Because there is still complexity in the case definition of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, our findings should be considered with caution. We used Poisson regression to count any symptom as an end point because post-COVID-19 syndrome lacks a strict definition. Although the questionnaire addresses the possible alternative diagnoses and patients were asked to report only de novo symptoms, we cannot assume that all self-reported late symptoms are related to COVID-19.

### Current meta-analysis does not support the possibility of COVID-19 reinfections [^116P8LNy]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reinfections could be a major aggravating factor in this current pandemic, as this would further complicate potential vaccine development and help to maintain worldwide virus pockets. To investigate this critical question, we conducted a clinical meta-analysis including all available currently reported cases of potential COVID-19 reinfections. We searched for all peer-reviewed articles in the search engine of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. While there are over 30,000 publications on COVID-19, only about 15 specifically target the subject of COVID-19 reinfections. Available patient data in these reports was analyzed for age, gender, time of reported relapse after initial infection and persistent COVID-19 positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results. Following the first episode of infection, cases of clinical relapse are reported at 34 (mean)± 10.5 days after full recovery. Patients with clinical relapse have persisting positive COVID-19 PCR testing results until 39 ± 9 days following initial positive testing. For patients without clinical relapse, positive testing was reported up to 54 ± 24 days. There were no reports of any clinical reinfections after a 70-day period following initial infection.

### Recurrent COVID-19 including evidence of reinfection and enhanced severity in thirty Brazilian healthcare workers [^114Xuzug]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is growing concern about individuals reported to suffer repeat COVID-19 disease episodes, these in a small number of cases characterised as de novo infections with distinct sequences, indicative of insufficient protective immunity even in the short term.

Methods

Observational case series and case-control studies reporting 33 cases of recurrent, symptomatic, qRT-PCR positive COVID-19. Recurrent disease was defined as symptomatic recurrence after symptom-free clinical recovery, with release from isolation > 14 days from the beginning of symptoms confirmed by qRT-PCR. The case control study-design compared this group of patients with a control group of 62 patients randomly selected from the same COVID-19 database.

Results

Of 33 recurrent COVID-19 patients, 26 were female and 30 were HCW. Mean time to recurrence was 50.5 days which was associated with being a HCW (OR 36.4 (p < 0.0001)), and blood type A (OR 4.8 (p = 0.002)). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were signifcantly lower in recurrent patients after initial COVID-19 (2.4 ± 0.610; p < 0.0001) and after recurrence (6.4 ± 11.34; p = 0.007). Virus genome sequencing identified reinfection by a different isolate in one patient.

Conclusions

This is the first detailed case series showing COVID-19 recurrence with qRT-PCR positivity. For one individual detection of phylogenetically distinct genomic sequences in the first and second episodes confirmed bona fide renfection, but in most cases the data do not formally distinguish between reinfection and re-emergence of a chronic infection reservoir. These episodes were significantly associated with reduced Ab response during initial disease and argue the need for ongoing vigilance without an assumption of protection after a first episode.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^116ZeHMc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — regulatory and assay limitations note that although current EUA indications do not preclude use of antibody tests in vaccinated individuals, none of the currently authorized tests has been authorized to assess humoral immunity after vaccination or to define a threshold of protection after infection; therefore, the FDA recommends against SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to assess immunity. Detection of anti-RBD-bAbs correlates with emergence of nAbs and nAbs have been associated with protection against COVID-19, yet a definitive correlate of protection has not been identified. Currently, only 1 commercial test has been authorized to detect nAbs from individuals with recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, but although calibrated against the WHO standard, it was not validated for testing after vaccination or for predicting protection from reinfection. Assays designed to quantify T-cell immune function are not widely available for clinical use.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection cases corroborated by sequencing [^111GHmz7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In total, 60 reported cases were identified that met inclusion criteria through our search strategy, emphasizing that although there may be a bottleneck in capturing and reporting these data, reinfection continues to be a relatively rare event after more than a year since the pandemic began. We identified potential reinfection clinical phenotypes based on the timing of reinfection (before or after 90 days since initial positive PCR test), similar Ct values across illnesses, presence of variants of concern (VOC) and non-VOCs, and nearly uniform seroconversion after 28 days from reinfection. These findings suggest that reinfection occurs across a wide population demographic. There continues to be a need for a structured investigation of reinfection cases to determine natural history and causal determinants of reinfection on a population level. In particular, a study assessing the dynamics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers at three primary time points (following recovery from initial infection, at presentation of reinfection, and following recovery from reinfection), viral genetic sequences of initial and reinfection strains, symptom burden, and comorbid conditions of individuals experiencing reinfection would help to elucidate some of the questions that emerge from this analysis. An essential feature of such a study would be a detailed assessment of time points prior to reinfection. This underscores the need for large-scale active surveillance programs to be able to capture these data points. These findings may also offer some insight into planning for long-term investigation of vaccine efficacy and the risk of subsequent infection as well as the potential need for booster immunization on a regular basis.

### Reduced risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19 vaccination-Kentucky, may-June 2021 [^114KdJRj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Although laboratory evidence suggests that antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination provide better neutralization of some circulating variants than does natural infection (1,2), few real-world epidemiologic studies exist to support the benefit of vaccination for previously infected persons. This report details the findings of a case-control evaluation of the association between vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in Kentucky during May-June 2021 among persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. Kentucky residents who were not vaccinated had 2.34 times the odds of reinfection compared with those who were fully vaccinated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.58–3.47). These findings suggest that among persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, full vaccination provides additional protection against reinfection. To reduce their risk of infection, all eligible persons should be offered vaccination, even if they have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.

### Protection conferred by SARS-CoV-2 infection across a spectrum of reinfection symptoms and severities [^116xcQ3R]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Protection of preomicron infection against preomicron reinfection

The effectiveness of a preomicron infection in preventing asymptomatic and symptomatic reinfections with a preomicron virus was 80.9% (95% CI: 79.1% to 82.6%) and 87.5% (95% CI: 86.1% to 88.9%), respectively (table 2 and figure 1A). The median time between the previous infection and the study test was 236.5 days (IQR: 164–301.5 days) for asymptomatic reinfection and 249 days (IQR: 179–302 days) for symptomatic reinfection.

Table 2
Effectiveness of (A) a preomicron infection in preventing asymptomatic, symptomatic, severe COVID-19, critical COVID-19 and fatal COVID-19 reinfections with a preomicron virus and (B) an omicron infection in preventing asymptomatic, symptomatic, severe COVID-19, critical COVID-19 and fatal COVID-19 reinfections with an omicron virus

The effectiveness of a preomicron infection in preventing each of severe, critical and fatal COVID-19 reinfections with a preomicron virus showed all very high effectiveness at nearly 100% (table 2 and figure 1A). However, estimates for fatal COVID-19 reinfection lacked sufficient statistical precision due to the small number of cases.

The effectiveness by time since previous infection showed no discernible decline in protection over time against all forms of reinfection (table 3). Similar patterns of effectiveness were observed among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (online supplemental figure S4).

Pemivibart — dosing, timing after vaccination, and harm–benefit considerations are specified as follows: Per the FDA EUA, pemivibart is authorized to be given at 4,500 mg IV every 3 months, and per the FDA EUA, in individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, pemivibart should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients who place a higher value on potential harms, specifically, the observed 0.6% risk of anaphylaxis, and a lower value on the uncertain benefits of prevention of severe COVID-19 would reasonably decline pemivibart. Because susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation. Conditional recommendations are made when the suggested course of action would apply to the majority of people with many exceptions, and shared decision-making is important.

### About reinfection… [^114jSrXC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19 occurs when you are infected, recover, and then get infected again.
- You can get reinfected multiple times.
- Staying up to date on vaccines and seeking treatment for a COVID-19 infection can help decrease the risk of experiencing severe illness. Overview Reinfections with the virus that causes COVID-19 are most often mild, but severe illness can occur. If you are reinfected, you can also spread the virus to others. Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccines and treating COVID-19 illness within a few days of when symptoms start decrease your risk of experiencing severe illness. Once you have had COVID-19, your immune system responds in several ways. This immune response can protect you against reinfection for several months, but this protection decreases over time. People with weakened immune systems who get an infection may have a limited immune response or none at all.

Protection against severe COVID-19 illness generally lasts longer than protection against infection. This means even if you get infected again, your immune response should help protect you from severe illness and hospitalization. As the virus evolves, new variants with the ability to evade your existing immunity can appear. This can increase your risk of reinfection. Reinfection can occur as early as several weeks after a previous infection, although this is rare. How to protect yourself and others CDC recommends that all people use core prevention strategies to prevent COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, including if you have previously had COVID-19. Keep ReadingHow to Protect Yourself and Others. COVID-19 testing for people with a recent history of infection Interpreting new positive test results in the first 90 days after a previous infection can be challenging.

The development, validation, and appropriate application of serological assays to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are essential to determining seroprevalence of this virus in the United States and globally and in guiding government leadership and the private sector on back-to-work policies. An interagency working group of the US Department of Health and Human Services convened a virtual workshop to identify knowledge gaps and key outstanding scientific issues and to develop strategies to fill them. Key outcomes of the workshop included recommendations for (1) advancing serology assays as a tool to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) conducting crucial serology field studies to advance an understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, leading to protection and duration of protection, including the correlation between serological test results and risk of reinfection.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection cases corroborated by sequencing [^1176T9ZF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Future research questions.

The true prevalence of reinfection and its relative symptom burden remain unclear given that routine repeat testing is not performed for individuals (particularly if asymptomatic) and samples from initial infection are not routinely stored for paired sequencing analysis.

Furthermore, the natural history and causal determinants of reinfection are not well characterized. The timing of reinfection, the degree of infectiousness at the time of reinfection, as well as the dynamics of the immune response triggered by a second exposure have not been clearly elucidated. Similarly, given the variability in testing and the limited number of individuals who had serologic testing prior to presentation with reinfection, the immune response to initial infection in this particular population is not well characterized. Therefore, large population-based surveillance studies and/or more rigorous observational cohorts in which systematic blood sampling occurs before reinfection will be greatly informative of the natural history and casual determinants of reinfection.

It also remains to be seen how relevant these findings may be to understanding the protection from infection conferred by vaccination and whether asymptomatic infection with associated viral shedding may be occurring in that population as well. This would have broad implications on our understanding of the role of vaccination in the effort to reduce the spread and ultimately eradicate this condition.

Some data sources used for this analysis, including test results from electronic laboratory reporting data, have changed or have been discontinued with the expiration of the public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023. However, continued monitoring of reinfections using alternative data sources remains important to characterize trends in severe outcomes following reinfection. To reduce the risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes, including those after reinfection, CDC recommends staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination and receiving early antiviral treatment, when eligible.

### Organizational strategies for managing COVID-19 survivors who return for care [^116qHwiY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The goal of initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is to identify patients who have active COVID-19 for clinical decision making and to identify patients who require transmission-based precautions to prevent the spread of infection. Once a patient has a positive RT-PCR result, 2 options exist for discontinuing transmission-based precautions: (1) test-based strategies, which generally require 2 negative tests at least 24 hours apart to end isolation and (2) symptom-based strategies, which discontinue isolation typically 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours without antipyretics and improvement in respiratory symptoms. We now have accumulated evidence that SARS-CoV-2 remains detectable by RT-PCR for an average of 3 weeks; however, we also have evidence demonstrating that, for uncomplicated, recovering COVID-19 patients, replication-competent virus cannot be cultured > 9–11 days after onset of illness. – The CDC's unpublished data indicate that the statistically estimated likelihood of recovering replication-competent virus approaches zero by 10 days, which is the basis for their symptom-based strategy for discontinuing isolation precautions. In May 2020, the Korean CDC published evidence that patients with COVID-19 who had late positive (ie, "re-positive") RT-PCR testing after interim negative tests did not transmit the infection to close household contacts. Of 285 monitored cases with 790 contacts, no case was found that was newly infected solely from contact with a "re-positive" case. They obtained respiratory samples from 108 of these patients and were unable to culture viable virus from any of them. For 23 patients, blood samples were also obtained, and all were positive for neutralizing antibodies. These data support the US CDC's symptom-based strategy by demonstrating that close contacts of patients with prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR did not become infected and, thus, that these patients were not contagious despite having repeated positive RT-PCR results.

### Genomic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the republic of Korea [^111WExmS]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, reinfection is likely to become increasingly common. However, confirming COVID-19 reinfection is difficult because it requires whole-genome sequencing of both infections to identify the degrees of genetic differences. Since the first reported case of reinfection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Republic of Korea in April 2020, four additional cases were classified as suspected reinfection cases. We performed whole-genome sequencing of viral RNA extracted from swabs obtained at the initial infection and reinfection stages of these four suspected cases. The interval between initial infection and reinfection of all four suspected cases was more than 3 months. All four patients were young (10–29 years), and they displayed mild symptoms or were asymptomatic during the initial infection and reinfection episodes. The analysis of genome sequences combined with the epidemiological results revealed that only two of the four cases were confirmed as reinfection, and both were reinfected with the Epsilon variant. Due to the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, the possibility of reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 variants is increasing, as reported in our study. Therefore, continuous monitoring of cases is necessary.

### Duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity: when is It safe to discontinue isolation? [^115URrqH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining the duration of infectivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has major implications for public health and infection control practice in healthcare facilities. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions.

### Serial interval of COVID-19 among publicly reported confirmed cases [^111Gi8Yr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We note 4 potential sources of bias. First, the data are restricted to online reports of confirmed cases and therefore might be biased toward more severe cases in areas with a high-functioning healthcare and public health infrastructure. The rapid isolation of such case-patients might have prevented longer serial intervals, potentially shifting our estimate downward compared with serial intervals that might be observed in an uncontrolled epidemic. Second, the distribution of serial intervals varies throughout an epidemic; the time between successive cases contracts around the epidemic peak. A susceptible person is likely to become infected more quickly if they are surrounded by 2 infected persons instead of 1. Because our estimates are based primarily on transmission events reported during the early stages of outbreaks, we do not explicitly account for such compression and interpret the estimates as basic serial intervals at the outset of an epidemic. However, if some of the reported infections occurred amid growing clusters of cases, then our estimates might reflect effective (compressed) serial intervals that would be expected during a period of epidemic growth. Third, the identity of each infector and the timing of symptom onset were presumably based on individual recollection of past events. If recall accuracy is impeded by time or trauma, case-patients might be more likely to attribute infection to recent encounters (short serial intervals) over past encounters (longer serial intervals). In contrast, the reported serial intervals might be biased upward by travel-related delays in transmission from primary case-patients that were infected in Wuhan or another city before returning home. If their infectious period started during travel, then we might be unlikely to observe early transmission events with shorter serial intervals. The mean serial interval is slightly higher for the 218 of 301 unique infectors reported to have imported cases.

Given the heterogeneity in type and reliability of these sources, we caution that our findings should be interpreted as working hypotheses regarding the infectiousness of COVID-19, requiring further validation. The potential implications for COVID-19 control are mixed. Although our lower estimates for R₀ suggest easier containment, the large number of reported asymptomatic transmission events is concerning.

### Distinguishing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 persistence and reinfection: a retrospective cohort study [^113sXswy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA weeks to months after initial infection. Therefore, positive NAATs obtained several weeks after an initial diagnosis pose a clinical dilemma — these results may reflect delayed clearance of non-viable virus, chronic active infection with viable virus, or SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, each of which carries different implications for treatment, contact tracing, and transmission-based precautions. In addition to aiding clinical decision making, distinguishing reinfection from persistent RNA detection related to the initial infection is of public health importance, because reinfections may indicate viral escape due to waning immunity or signal the emergence of novel variants. However, without viral genomic analysis, which is not yet widely available for clinical use, it is challenging to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 reinfection from persistent RNA detection using routinely available clinical and laboratory data alone.

Previous attempts to identify SARS-CoV-2 reinfection incidence and associated clinical characteristics have mostly relied on time-based definitions for reinfection (ie, having a repeat positive test at some interval after diagnosis), rather than genomic analysis, leading to potential misclassification of reinfection cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigative criteria for suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection prioritizes genomic evaluation of viral specimens from individuals with a repeat positive NAAT ≥ 45 days after initial diagnosis to distinguish reinfection from persistent RNA detection (Supplementary Table 1). These criteria have been applied to many individual cases, but they have not been used to systematically identify SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in large, well-characterized cohorts.

We report clinical, laboratory, and genomic characterization of a large cohort of individuals with repeat positive NAATs ≥ 45 days after initial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis at an academic medical center in Boston. We also describe the strengths and limitations of clinical, laboratory, and genomics-based assessment for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the clinical setting.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^11381bU1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Such an alternate approach has been enabled by recent research based on ample coronavirus incidence data that documented substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity in peak incidence across the Northern Hemisphere. These results largely match typical respiratory virus incidence patterns, featuring peaks of "flu and cold season" with some specificity in each locality. However, in isolation, these results give no direct guidance regarding when to administer booster vaccinations. The optimal timing of booster vaccinations depends jointly on the risk of infection due to seasonality and on the long-term waning of protection subsequent to booster vaccination. Rigorous estimates of long-term protection subsequent to booster vaccination have been obtained by leveraging longitudinal antibody and reinfection data from the close evolutionary relatives of SARS-CoV-2 as well as infection and antibody data on SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the durability of immunity following natural infection, primary vaccination, and boosting. These analyses, subsequently validated by comparison to empirical data, indicate that statistical approaches derived from evolutionary medicine can illuminate reinfection risks with high accuracy and precision. Yet, the impact on yearly infection of administering yearly booster vaccinations at specific times in specific locations remains unknown — as does the impact of breakthrough infections at specific times of the year on the optimal timing of booster vaccination.

Here we integrated the waxing probabilities of infection subsequent to antigen exposure with projections of the expected seasonal variation in frequency of infection for endemic SARS-CoV-2 to perform a high-resolution investigation of prospective timings of booster vaccinations that maximally curtail infection. We evaluated the optimal boosting date over the year for individuals who have not been infected over the previous year. Then we analyzed similar optimal timings for individuals who have been infected during that year to determine any advantage to delaying the booster, depending on the date of infection. Such knowledge of optimal booster vaccination timing will be helpful for physician and individual decision-making in the context of ongoing endemic disease, and is crucial for effective vaccination policy that suppresses morbidity and mortality as a consequence of COVID-19.

### SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune responses in convalescent individuals over 12 months reveal severity-dependent antibody dynamics [^11678NUy]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While some studies suggest that more severe COVID-19 disease correlates with higher antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2, other studies found no differences in antibody levels between individuals with different illness severities. The difference in findings in the existing literature may relate to variation in study design, such as inclusion of small cohorts, focus on short-term follow-up of up to 6 months, lack of inclusion of asymptomatic individuals, or primary focus on either N, RBD, or S antibody dynamics. Also, few studies have directly compared SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in the same cohort of individuals prior to and post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Given that different SARS-CoV-2 antibodies serve different functions, it continues to be important to discern the time course that specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies follow and whether these patterns vary in individuals with different initial peak disease severities. Understanding these temporal kinetics and longevity of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will continue to inform strategies to minimize infectious surges and their severity, aid in vaccination and therapy approaches, and provide tailored clinical advice to patients on timing of vaccinations.

In this study, we show that antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes exhibit distinct dynamics over 12 months. Anti-RBD titers remain elevated in most individuals, indicating long-lived responses associated with protection against severe disease, while anti-N titers decline more rapidly. Our findings reveal differential antibody trajectories by disease severity and vaccination status and highlight the potential of vaccination to enhance immunity. These insights may offer valuable guidance for optimizing vaccine timing and strategies to mitigate reinfections.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^112xH3Wr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA serologic testing — background on seroprevalence and timing: As of December 2022, more than 96% of the US population was estimated to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and the utility of antibody testing has declined as seroprevalence due to vaccination and natural infection has increased. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies typically become detectable more than 2 weeks after onset of symptoms; consequently, serology lacks sufficient sensitivity in the acute phase and positive results may reflect vaccination or distant history rather than acute or recent infection.

### Does infection with or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 lead to lasting immunity? [^112LTnLv]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Many nations are pursuing the rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as an exit strategy from unprecedented COVID-19-related restrictions. However, the success of this strategy relies critically on the duration of protective immunity resulting from both natural infection and vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits an adaptive immune response against a large breadth of viral epitopes, although the duration of the response varies with age and disease severity. Current evidence from case studies and large observational studies suggests that, consistent with research on other common respiratory viruses, a protective immunological response lasts for approximately 5–12 months from primary infection, with reinfection being more likely given an insufficiently robust primary humoral response. Markers of humoral and cell-mediated immune memory can persist over many months, and might help to mitigate against severe disease upon reinfection. Emerging data, including evidence of breakthrough infections, suggest that vaccine effectiveness might be reduced significantly against emerging variants of concern, and hence secondary vaccines will need to be developed to maintain population-level protective immunity. Nonetheless, other interventions will also be required, with further outbreaks likely to occur due to antigenic drift, selective pressures for novel variants, and global population mobility.

### COVID-19 disease incidence and severity in persons previously infected and unvaccinated vs previously uninfected and vaccinated [^116op1eb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Using the national COVID-19 database of the US Department of Veterans Affairs, we matched pairs of individuals who were previously uninfected and vaccinated (≥ 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine) and previously infected and unvaccinated. The incidence rate of breakthrough infection among vaccinated individuals (per 1000 person-days, 0.30; 95% CI, .29-.32) was similar to the reinfection rate among unvaccinated individuals (0.31; 95% CI, .30-.32; p = 0.5). The incidence rate of hospitalization/death was higher after reinfection (7.31; 95% CI, 6.66–8.03) as compared with the rate after breakthrough infection (4.69; 95% CI, 4.06–5.42; P < .0001). The incidence of hospitalization/death is significantly higher after reinfection among unvaccinated individuals as compared with breakthrough infection after vaccination.

### Assessment of the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection in an intense reexposure setting [^1148w4Um]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Inclusion Criteria

All SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least 1 PCR-positive swab that was ≥ 45 days after a first positive swab were considered as suspected cases of reinfection. The 45-day cutoff was informed by data from observational cohorts of SARS-CoV-2–infected persons and was set to account for the duration of prolonged PCR positivity of several weeks in these patients. Cutoff determination was further informed by the distribution of the time difference between the first positive swab and subsequent positive swabs among SARS-CoV-2 cases with multiple swabs (Figure 1). The tail of this distribution indicates that a cutoff of 45 days (at the 99th percentile) provides an appropriate mark for defining the end of prolonged PCR positivity; a subsequent positive swab within 45 days of the first positive swab is likely to reflect prolonged PCR positivity (due to nonviable virus fragments) rather than reinfection and thus should not be included in analysis.

The cutoff of 45 days was at the 99th percentile and thus provides an appropriate mark for defining the end of the prolonged polymerase chain reaction positivity.

Suspected Reinfection Case Classification

Suspected cases of reinfection, that is, cases that fit the above-indicated inclusion criteria, were classified as showing strong evidence, good evidence, some evidence, or weak (or no) evidence for reinfection (Box 1). Classification was based on holistic quantitative and qualitative criteria applied to each investigated case. Criteria included the pattern and magnitude of the change in PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value across repeated swabs, time interval between subsequent swabs, PCR testing site (such as outpatients at primary care, hospital emergency, or inpatient hospitalization), purpose of PCR testing (such as appearance of symptoms, contact tracing, or survey/testing campaign), age, history of COVID-19–related hospital admission, and case severity per WHO classification.

### Persistence and baseline determinants of seropositivity and reinfection rates in health care workers up to 12.5 months after COVID-19 [^116knjrv]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, despite the large heterogeneity in antibody levels induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, most HCW patients remained seropositive for anti-S antibodies up to 12.5 months after COVID-19. The findings that after PCR reversion, 2 out of 13 seronegative individuals had another symptomatic episode, and that one low responder had a second (asymptomatic) infection, are consistent with a protective role of antibodies. Considering that antibody levels achieved by COVID-19 immunization are usually higher than those elicited following natural infection, based on this study, it could be speculated that immune memory induced by the first-generation vaccines could also be long-lasting; therefore, reducing the probability that periodic boosters might be required to sustain protective immunity, at least within the first year. Furthermore, data indicates that naïve people should be prioritized for vaccination over those who had suffered COVID-19, since the latter maintain antibodies for at least a year.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^114neyAN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Infection probabilities were associated with antibody levels based on empirical data supplemented by an ancestral and descendent states analysis of long-term antibody data on healthy individuals who experienced other human-infecting coronaviruses. This analysis used a maximum-likelihood molecular phylogeny of human-infecting coronaviruses and their peak-normalized optical density levels of blood-based immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and whole-virus lysate over time, coupled with reinfection data. The resulting probabilities of reinfection provided probabilistic times to reinfection after recovery under conditions of endemic transmission for SARS-CoV-2. The antibody waning profiles and infection probabilities from this approach have proven consistent with multiple time points reported in subsequent, but shorter-term, wholly empirical studies.

For each day of the year, we calculated the cumulative yearly probability of infection, wherein the probabilities of infection each day were computed as the probability of not being infected all previous days multiplied by the probability of being infected on the day of interest. The booster vaccination date on which the cumulative yearly probability of infection is at its lowest represents the optimal yearly booster vaccination date.

To examine optimal delays of boosting in the case of a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, we modified our approach above to address breakthrough infections occurring on each date by renewing protection at the point of breakthrough infection. During the first month after breakthrough infection, reductions in the probabilities of breakthrough infection were set to be consistent with observations for the BNT162b2 booster clinical trial, after which waning antibody levels from Townsend et al were paired with corresponding infection probabilities. Optimality of delayed boosting was then evaluated as the cumulative probability of infection spanning from the yearly optimal booster vaccination date following the infection through to the following yearly optimal booster vaccination date.

Other considerations — waning of antibody levels over time after natural infection and vaccination has been noted, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies may be more short-lived in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals; comparing results between studies is often difficult because of the different antibody assays used.

### Rates of COVID-19 among unvaccinated adults with prior COVID-19 [^113R3kFm]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Among 121 615 patients with more than 10 million days of follow-up, unvaccinated individuals with prior symptomatic COVID-19 had 85% lower risk of acquiring COVID-19 than unvaccinated individuals without prior COVID-19. Prior studies investigating protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection found similar results, with protection associated with natural immunity ranging from 80.5% to 100%. This level of protection is similar to that reported for mRNA vaccines. The findings that patients with prior COVID-19 had 88% protection against hospitalization for COVID-19 and 83% protection against COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization suggest that natural immunity was associated with similar protection against mild and severe disease. mRNA vaccines are associated with similar prolonged protection from severe COVID-19 as found in our study, although vaccine-associated protection from mild COVID-19 has been shown to wane at 6 months.

Limitations include possible COVID-19 testing or vaccination at outside health care facilities, but undetected infection should have been balanced between cases and controls. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may behave differently from those without immunity, potentially confounding results. Strengths include large sample size, long duration of follow-up, and inclusion of only unvaccinated individuals with symptomatic COVID-19. The findings of this study may have important implications for vaccine policy and public health.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^113V8hGa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 booster vaccinations mitigate transmission and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infection. However, the optimal date for booster administration remains uncertain. Geographic variation in infection rates throughout the year makes it challenging to intuit the best yearly booster administration date to effectively prevent infection, and also challenging to provide best guidance on how to alter booster administration in response to a breakthrough infection.

Methods

We leveraged longitudinal antibody and reinfection probabilities with spatiotemporal projections of COVID-19 incidence to develop a geographically informed approach to optimizing the timing of booster vaccination. We assessed the delay in booster vaccination that is warranted following breakthrough infections whenever they occur during the year, enabling a personalized assessment of optimal timing that acknowledges and respects diversity of COVID-19 immune status, addressing a substantial barrier to uptake.

Results

Yearly booster vaccination on any date is beneficial to prevention of infection. However, each location exhibits as much as a 3–4-fold range in degree of protection by date of uptake. Optimal COVID-19 booster vaccination dates are location-specific, typically in early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Infection late in the interval between boosts substantially alters the optimal boosting date.

Conclusions

Considerable benefit accrues from aptly timing COVID-19 booster vaccination campaigns, which can be tailored to specific locations. Individuals can acquire the greatest benefit from booster vaccination by timing it optimally, including delaying in cases of infection late in the interval between boosts. These results provide location-specific guidance for public health policy, healthcare provider recommendations, and individual decision-making.

### Sustained seropositivity up to 20.5 months after COVID-19 [^1152Ywn1]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The maintenance and effectiveness of adaptive immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection are key questions in understanding and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and any future emerging new coronavirus threat. Despite the global start of vaccination campaigns by the end of 2020, a substantial percentage of the world's population remains unvaccinated, and their capacity to resist infections relies only on naturally acquired immunity. We have previously shown that 90% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain seropositive 1 year after discharge. To our knowledge, the duration of antibody responses following natural infection has not been assessed beyond 13–20 months to date.

SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust humoral immune responses, including production of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG. IgM and IgA isotypes dominate the early effector antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, and IgA greatly contributes to virus neutralization at mucosal sites. In serum, the three isotypes display neutralizing activity, with IgM and IgG1 (predominant subclass of IgG) being the most important contributors.

Reinfection and COVID-19 disease rates, including severe cases, may increase if immunity wanes in those who do not get vaccinated. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) with high transmissibility and potentially lower susceptibility to antibodies has raised the question of whether antibodies induced by the original Wuhan strain will still protect against reinfections or only against severe COVID-19. Therefore, data on the long-term persistence and efficacy of the immune response is of vital importance to foresee the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic especially with more contagious emerging variants like Delta and Omicron. Data could also be useful to infer the potential duration of vaccine-elicited immunity, which started to be studied a year after the onset of the pandemic.

### COVID-19 pathogenesis, prognostic factors, and treatment strategy: urgent recommendations [^116wmTEH]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is not yet close to being over, more than 8 months after the first cases, but researchers are making great progress in fighting the disease. We have conducted a brief review of the geographic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19, the updated pathological findings, prognostic factors, and treatments for disease prevention and improvement of prognosis. Although hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have been recommended by some researchers, many clinical trials have failed to confirm any beneficial effect of these and other drugs on COVID-19, in terms of improved clinical status or reduced patient mortality. Currently, glucocorticoid is the only drug that reduces the mortality of COVID-19 in a randomized controlled trial; however, it is still necessary to establish the optimal timing of administration. It is also urgent to set up an international or national cohort to address the risk factors associated with infection, the natural history of COVID-19, including the disease type, surrogate markers for critically ill, long-term sequelae, and reinfection after exposure, identify responders to glucocorticoid, and establish optimal treatment strategies for disease control.
