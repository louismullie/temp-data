## Question

A 54-year-old man with a history of decompensated cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C presents with increasing shortness of breath and right-sided chest discomfort. He has known ascites and has required multiple large-volume thoracenteses over the past three months for recurrent right-sided pleural effusions. Despite optimal diuretic therapy and sodium restriction, his symptoms persist. He has no evidence of cardiac or pulmonary disease on recent workup. His MELD-Na score is 18. He is currently not listed for liver transplantation.

Based on current expert guidelines, what should be considered as a management option for this patient with hepatic hydrothorax?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best management option for a 54-year-old man with decompensated cirrhosis and refractory hepatic hydrothorax, including how to sequence therapies and when to pursue liver transplantation evaluation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging of hepatic hydrothorax. Then, I should verify that first-line medical therapy has been optimized. Next, I will consider second-line options, especially TIPS, and weigh benefits versus risks. After that, I need to check the role of liver transplantation and whether MELD-Na 18 changes candidacy. Finally, I will outline alternatives if TIPS is contraindicated and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan with monitoring and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. Hepatic hydrothorax is a transudative pleural effusion in cirrhosis due to portal hypertension, typically right-sided, with a serum-to-pleural albumin gradient greater than 1.1 g/dL and exclusion of cardiopulmonary disease; refractory disease persists despite optimized salt restriction and diuretics, which fits this case given recurrent large effusions requiring repeated thoracenteses despite maximal medical therapy [^6746ebac] [^9ad164f7].

> Wait, let me verify that first-line therapy has truly been optimized. Guidelines recommend dietary sodium restriction to about 2 g/day and combination diuretics, usually spironolactone 100–400 mg/day with furosemide 40–160 mg/day, titrated to response while monitoring renal function and electrolytes; therapeutic thoracentesis is used for symptomatic relief, but repeated procedures carry risks such as pneumothorax, infection, and re-expansion edema, so we should minimize frequency when possible [^9ad164f7] [^93f09b24] [^170a3267].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about next steps before establishing candidacy for definitive therapies. I should confirm that there are no absolute contraindications to TIPS or transplant, including severe hepatic encephalopathy, uncontrolled infection, severe cardiac failure, or severe pulmonary hypertension, and I should screen for spontaneous bacterial empyema if infection is suspected, because these factors materially alter risk–benefit and sequencing of interventions [^fa0eb4ac] [^420ce7a4].

> Next, I should review TIPS as the preferred second-line therapy for refractory hepatic hydrothorax. Multiple high-quality guidelines endorse TIPS in selected patients after failure of medical therapy, with pooled response rates around 56–73% for complete or partial resolution and meaningful reductions in thoracentesis needs; however, early mortality can be substantial in advanced liver disease, and patient selection is critical, with better outcomes in those with MELD less than about 15–18 and preserved hepatic reserve [^4df5c49d] [^88adf512] [^c8001505] [^ba58fb63].

> I need to ensure we address liver transplantation candidacy explicitly. Initially, I thought MELD-Na 18 might preclude listing, but wait, I should double-check current guidance: both AASLD and AGA recommend that all patients with refractory ascites or hepatic hydrothorax be considered for liver transplantation evaluation regardless of MELD-Na, because hepatic hydrothorax signals decompensation and is associated with high mortality that may be underestimated by MELD-Na alone; indeed, observational data show liver-related death occurs at lower MELD-Na in refractory hydrothorax compared with refractory ascites, reinforcing the need for early referral [^2f25c9ae] [^2570ceba] [^868e3730] [^b26c8289].

> Let me consider alternatives if TIPS is contraindicated or declined. Indwelling tunneled pleural catheters can palliate symptomatic effusions and may lead to spontaneous pleurodesis in about half of patients, but they carry infection and protein-loss risks and should be reserved for carefully selected patients after multidisciplinary review; pleurodesis has limited success due to rapid fluid reaccumulation, and chest tube placement is discouraged because of high complication and mortality rates in cirrhosis [^fe09831a] [^51071eec] [^fdc82195] [^7a9580bb].

> I should confirm the procedural and peri-TIPS plan. Pre-TIPS assessment should include liver function, renal function, platelets, and evaluation for encephalopathy risk; covered stents reduce dysfunction and are preferred, and post-TIPS surveillance for encephalopathy and shunt patency is essential; in patients with higher MELD or advanced decompensation, early mortality risk is real, so counseling and coordination with transplant teams are crucial [^fa0eb4ac] [^c8001505] [^1200e7e8].

> But wait, what if the patient is unstable or has ACLF features. In critically ill patients with respiratory compromise from hydrothorax, supportive care including oxygenation strategies and, when indicated, high-flow nasal cannula are recommended; thoracentesis remains first-line for symptom relief, and TIPS decisions should be individualized within a multidisciplinary framework that includes hepatology, pulmonology, and transplant surgery [^9944ea47] [^6c845975].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan. First, confirm refractory hepatic hydrothorax and reassess adherence and diuretic optimization. Second, refer urgently for liver transplantation evaluation at a transplant center regardless of MELD-Na. Third, if no contraindications, proceed with TIPS in a timely fashion as a bridge to transplant or as definitive symptom control. Fourth, if TIPS is not feasible, consider a tunneled pleural catheter with infection-prevention protocols and close follow-up. Fifth, continue sodium restriction and diuretics as tolerated, and use thoracentesis for breakthrough symptoms while minimizing frequency to reduce complications [^2570ceba] [^4df5c49d] [^fe09831a] [^9ad164f7].

> In summary, I should emphasize that the most evidence-aligned next step for this 54-year-old with refractory hepatic hydrothorax is to pursue simultaneous liver transplantation evaluation and consider TIPS placement in a suitable candidate, because both strategies address pathophysiology and prognosis, whereas repeated thoracenteses alone are insufficient and carry cumulative risk; this approach aligns with contemporary AASLD, AGA, and EASL guidance and reflects the poor long-term outcomes of untreated refractory hydrothorax [^2f25c9ae] [^2570ceba] [^40e9b398] [^868e3730].

---

For a 54-year-old man with decompensated cirrhosis and refractory hepatic hydrothorax despite optimal diuretics and sodium restriction, **TIPS is the next best step** [^4df5c49d] to reduce effusion recurrence and thoracentesis needs [^c8001505], with expected response in 60–80% of cases [^faeced56]. If TIPS is contraindicated or unavailable, **indwelling pleural catheter** is a reasonable alternative for palliation [^fe09831a] [^fdc82195], but it carries infection and protein-loss risks [^8596a4a7]. Chest tubes should be avoided due to high complication rates [^fe09831a] [^7a9580bb]. All patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax should be **referred for liver transplantation evaluation** regardless of MELD-Na, as this is the only definitive therapy [^2570ceba] [^2f25c9ae] [^868e3730].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical significance

Hepatic hydrothorax results from **ascitic fluid migrating into the pleural space** through diaphragmatic defects, driven by negative intrathoracic pressure [^09893b97]. It is a marker of advanced liver disease and portal hypertension, with a prevalence of 4–12% in cirrhosis [^6746ebac]. Refractory hepatic hydrothorax is associated with significant morbidity, including respiratory compromise, infection, and malnutrition, and carries a poor prognosis without definitive therapy [^868e3730].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines from AASLD, AGA, and EASL provide a **stepwise approach** to managing hepatic hydrothorax:

| **Step** | **Recommended therapy** | **Rationale and evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| First-line | - Sodium restriction < 2 g/day <br/> - Diuretics (spironolactone ± furosemide) <br/> - Therapeutic thoracentesis as needed | - Reduces fluid accumulation <br/> - Provides symptomatic relief [^9ad164f7] [^8fbc0f49] [^182b3ce7] |
| Second-line | Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) | - Reduces portal pressure <br/> - Decreases effusion recurrence <br/> - 60–80% response rate [^4df5c49d] [^88adf512] [^c8001505] [^faeced56] |
| Third-line | Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) | - Palliative option for refractory cases <br/> - Allows outpatient drainage <br/> - Risk of infection and protein loss [^fe09831a] [^fdc82195] [^8596a4a7] |
| Definitive therapy | Liver transplantation | - Only curative option <br/> - Improves survival <br/> - Recommended for all patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax [^2570ceba] [^2f25c9ae] [^868e3730] |

---

## Evidence supporting TIPS

TIPS is the **most effective second-line therapy** for refractory hepatic hydrothorax, with response rates of 60–80% and significant reductions in the need for repeated thoracenteses [^c8001505] [^faeced56]. However, TIPS carries risks, including hepatic encephalopathy, shunt dysfunction, and procedural complications, necessitating careful patient selection and close follow-up [^8a24e823].

---

## Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)

IPC placement is a **reasonable alternative** for patients who are not candidates for TIPS or transplantation. IPCs provide effective symptom control and reduce hospitalizations, but they are associated with infection, protein loss, and catheter-related complications [^fdc82195] [^8596a4a7]. Recent studies suggest spontaneous pleurodesis in approximately 50% of cases, though high-quality evidence remains limited [^fdc82195].

---

## Liver transplantation

Liver transplantation is the **only definitive cure** for refractory hepatic hydrothorax, with significantly improved survival compared to non-transplanted patients [^aa61cddc]. Current guidelines recommend evaluating all patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax for transplantation, regardless of MELD-Na score, given the poor prognosis associated with this condition [^2570ceba] [^2f25c9ae].

---

## Contraindications and considerations

TIPS is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy, severe cardiac failure, or severe pulmonary hypertension. IPCs should be used cautiously in patients with high infection risk or severe coagulopathy. Chest tube placement is **strongly discouraged** due to high rates of complications, including empyema, fistula formation, and mortality [^fe09831a] [^7a9580bb].

---

## Recommended management plan for the patient

Given the patient's refractory hepatic hydrothorax despite optimal medical therapy, the following **stepwise approach** is recommended:

- **Refer for liver transplantation evaluation**: Immediate referral to a transplant center is indicated, as this is the only definitive therapy [^2570ceba] [^2f25c9ae].
- **Consider TIPS placement**: If the patient is a suitable candidate, TIPS should be pursued as the next best step to reduce effusion recurrence and thoracentesis needs [^4df5c49d] [^88adf512].
- **Alternative palliative options**: If TIPS is contraindicated or unavailable, consider IPC placement for symptom control, with careful monitoring for complications [^fe09831a] [^fdc82195].
- **Avoid chest tube placement**: Due to high complication rates, chest tube placement should be avoided [^fe09831a] [^7a9580bb].

---

## Conclusion

For a 54-year-old man with decompensated cirrhosis and refractory hepatic hydrothorax, **TIPS is the next best step** after failed medical therapy, with liver transplantation evaluation as the definitive goal. IPCs are a reasonable alternative when TIPS is not feasible, while chest tubes should be avoided.

### Refractory hepatic hydrothorax is associated with increased mortality with death occurring at lower MELD-Na compared to cirrhosis and refractory ascites [^868e3730]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Although refractory hepatic hydrothorax (RH) is a serious complication of cirrhosis, waitlisted patients do not receive standardized Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) exemption because of inadequate evidence suggesting mortality above biochemical MELD. This study aimed to examine liver-related death (LRD) associated with RH compared to refractory ascites (RA).

Approach and Results

This was a retrospective cohort study of Veterans with cirrhosis. Eligibility criteria included participants with RH or RA, followed from their first therapeutic thoracentesis/second paracentesis until death or transplantation. The primary outcome was LRD with non-LRD or transplantation as competing risk. Of 2552 patients with cirrhosis who underwent therapeutic thoracentesis/paracentesis, 177 met criteria for RH and 422 for RA. RH was associated with a significantly higher risk of LRD (adjusted HR [aHR] 4.63, 95% CI 3.31–6.48) than RA overall and within all MELD-sodium (MELD-Na) strata (< 10 aHR 4.08, 95% CI 2.30–7.24, 10–14.9 aHR 5.68, 95% CI 2.63–12.28, 15–24.9 aHR 4.14, 95% CI 2.34–7.34, ≥ 25 aHR 7.75, 95% CI 2.99–20.12). LRD was higher among participants requiring 1 (aHR 3.54, 95% CI 2.29–5.48), 2–3 (aHR 4.39, 95% CI 2.91–6.63), and ≥ 4 (aHR 7.89, 95% CI 4.82–12.93) thoracenteses relative to RA. Although participants with RH and RA had similar baseline MELD-Na, LRD occurred in RH versus RA at a lower MELD-Na (16.5 vs. 21.82, p = 0.002) but higher MELD 3.0 (27.85 vs. 22.48, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

RH was associated with higher risk of LRD than RA at equivalent MELD-Na. By contrast, MELD 3.0 may better predict risk of LRD in RH.

Purpose Of Review

Treatment of hepatic hydrothorax is challenging because of its rapid symptomatic recurrence. This review will focus on potential therapeutic approaches to hepatic hydrothorax.

Recent Findings

Hepatic hydrothorax is refractory to salt restriction and diuretics in approximately 25% of cases. Primary management options for these patients include serial thoracenteses, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, and insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). Response rate to TIPS, being the first choice whenever possible, is about 80%. IPC is emerging as a feasible alternative in patients who require frequent therapeutic thoracenteses, particularly if TIPS is contraindicated. Pleurodesis is not advocated because of the low likelihood of a pleural symphysis owing to the rapid re-accumulation of pleural fluid. The only cure for hepatic hydrothorax, a defined complication of end-stage liver disease, is liver transplantation.

Summary

No single treatment option for refractory hepatic hydrothorax is ideal. However, in patients with contraindications to or who are awaiting liver transplantation, TIPS seems the most beneficial therapy, whereas IPC promises to be an alternative second-line consideration.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^ba58fb63]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatic hydrothorax

Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is accumulation of transudative fluid in the pleural space in the absence of cardiac, pulmonary or pleural disease, affecting approximately 5–12% of patients with advanced liver disease. The first-line management of hydrothorax is based on controlling ascites with diuretics and/or LVP as discussed previously. However, pleural effusion can persist despite successful treatment of ascites, defined as refractory hydrothorax.

Therapeutic thoracentesis is required to provide symptomatic relief from dyspnoea but the effect is transient. Repeated procedures increase the risks of complications, including pneumothorax, bleeding and pleural infection.TIPSS has been suggested either as a definitive treatment or as a bridge to transplantation in patients with refractory hydrothorax. Meta-analysis of six retrospective studies with a total of 198 patients reported a response rate of 56%. Mortality within 45 days of TIPSS placement was 18%, mainly related to older age and the severity of liver disease. However, without any data on comparison with standard treatment, it is difficult to interpret the impact of TIPSS on survival. It is also worth noting that only one of these studies reported on patients treated with PTFE-covered stents. In patients with contraindications to TIPSS or liver transplant, a permanent indwelling pleural catheter can be considered in conjunction with the patient and the multidisciplinary team taking into account the infection risk.

Recommendation

TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)

### Pleural interventions in the management of hepatic hydrothorax [^6c845975]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatic hydrothorax can be present in 5% to 15% of patients with underlying cirrhosis and portal hypertension, often reflecting advanced liver disease. Its impact can be variable, because patients may have small pleural effusions and minimal pulmonary symptoms or massive pleural effusions and respiratory failure. Management of hepatic hydrothorax can be difficult because these patients often have a number of comorbidities and potential for complications. Minimal high-quality data are available for guidance specifically related to hepatic hydrothorax, potentially resulting in pulmonary or critical care physician struggling for best management options. We therefore provide a Case-based presentation with management options based on currently available data and opinion. We discuss the role of pleural interventions, including thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy, indwelling tunneled pleural catheter, pleurodesis, and surgical interventions. In general, we recommend that management be conducted within a multidisciplinary team including pulmonology, hepatology, and transplant surgery. Patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax that are not transplant candidates should be managed with palliative intent; we suggest indwelling tunneled pleural catheter placement unless otherwise contraindicated. For patients with unclear or incomplete hepatology treatment plans or those unable to undergo more definitive procedures, we recommend serial thoracentesis. In patients who are transplant candidates, we often consider serial thoracentesis as a standard treatment, while also evaluating the role indwelling tunneled pleural catheter placement may play within the course of disease and transplant evaluation.

### International survey among hepatologists and pulmonologists on the hepatic hydrothorax: plea for recommendations [^aa61cddc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver transplantation (LT)

LT is the definitive treatment for a refractory hydrothorax. This treatment was known by 78% of the responders and more frequently by the HG. A liver transplantation was the treatment chosen by our responders especially if there was another indication for a transplantation in the presence of the hydrothorax. A large MELD, a history of ascites fluid infection or a spontaneous bacterial empyema should be referred to a LT center. In this regard, it is important to note that the collegial discussion when treating a refractory hydrothorax included a liver transplant team for our responders.

The survival rate after a LT in patients with a hydrothorax is not different from that of other patients, 70% after 8 years. In a recent study, the LT was the key element to a short- and long-term survival after a hydrothorax.

The mortality rate after 1 to 3 years reached 77% in non-transplanted patients and 21% in transplanted patients.

Hepatic hydrothorax occurs in approximately 5 to 12% of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Various therapeutic modalities ranging from dietary and pharmacologic interventions to surgical approaches are available for the management of this condition. Treatment must be individualized based on the patient's response to conservative management as well as the severity of the underlying liver disease. Hepatic hydrothorax may be complicated by spontaneous bacterial empyema, which portends a poor prognosis with a mortality rate of up to 20%. All patients with hepatic hydrothorax should be evaluated for possible liver transplantation.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

Treatment and overall survival without transplantation

There were 131 patients at first diagnosis, of whom 20 (15%) were treated with drug management alone, with a mean age of 53.35 ± 11.91 years, a median MELD score of 10.14 (0.47–24.76) and an estimated median time of 19 months. A total of 111 (75%) patients were treated with medication and thoracic intubation, with a mean age of 57.32 ± 11.83 years, a median MELD score of 10.22 (0.0–30.50), and an estimated median time of 22 months. During the later stages of treatment, one patient was treated with TIPS, with a MELD score of 16 and a survival time of 32 months, and three patients were treated with liver transplantation, with a mean MELD score of 18, all of whom are currently alive (see Table 3). For overall survival without transplantation, the median follow-up time was 45 (interquartile range [IQR]: 25–96) months, the estimated median survival time was 21 (95% CI:18–25) months, and the survival rates at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years were 77.2%, 62.4%, and 29.7%, respectively (Fig. 2).

TIPS

In the treatment of a refractory hydrothorax, most of the responders resorted to TIPS in the absence of contraindications in the treatment of a refractory hydrothorax. The difference in the answers was highly significant between the PN and the HG and these ones were more aware of this technique.

Numerous studies and a recent meta-analysis showed the interest of TIPS in the management of a refractory hydrothorax.

Although the number of studies related to the treatment with TIPS is limited, the use of a TIPS leads to an improvement with a disappearance of the pleural effusion or a reduction of it with a sensitivity to diuretics in 60 to 90% of the cases.

In a large retrospective study of 40 patients with a CP score B or C and a refractory hydrothorax, 90% of the patients who underwent a treatment with TIPS showed an improvement of the hydrothorax with a complete resolution in 70% of the cases. In this study, the 1-year surveillance rate was of 64% but 50% of the patients developed a TIPS malfunction with the need for a TIPS revision in 90% of the cases.

Recently, a meta-analysis of 6 studies related to TIPS use for a refractory hydrothorax has been published. This study which included 198 patients showed that the procedure resulted in the resolution of the hydrothorax in 73% of the cases, a complete resolution in 56% of the cases and a partial one in 7% of the cases. The average follow-up time was 10 months.

Up to 15–25% of the patients could develop a hard-to-control hepatic encephalopathy. Nevertheless, it has recently been shown that covered TIPS preceded by the administration of rifaximine and lactulose would decrease the incidence of post-TIPS encephalopathy.

A pre-therapeutic workup is important before deciding on performing TIPS and it is usually done during a discussion with a liver transplant team. In our survey, the responders favoured TIPS when it was possible and when the patient had no other indication than a HA for a liver transplantation.

Finally, the patients who can benefit from TIPS do not preclude the need for a liver transplant.

Recommendations: TIPSS for ascites

In patients who are eligible for liver transplantation, TIPSS for ascites should only be undertaken after discussion with the regional transplant centre (strong recommendation, very low quality evidence).
In selected patients with refractory or recurrent ascites, we recommend insertion of TIPSS provided there are no contraindications to the procedure (strong recommendation, high quality evidence).
In addition to the standard TIPSS contraindications, patients who may not benefit from TIPSS for ascites include those with bilirubin > 50 µm/L and platelets < 75×10⁹, pre-existing encephalopathy, active infection, severe cardiac failure or severe pulmonary hypertension (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Recommendation: TIPSS for hydrothorax

Selected patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax may be considered for TIPSS insertion. (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation: TIPSS for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)

Although, renal function has been observed to improve following TIPSS, TIPSS for HRS (type 1 and type 2) remains experimental (weak recommendation, very low level of evidence).

Recommendations: TIPSS for Budd–Chiari syndrome

It is recommended that all patients with Budd–Chiari syndrome (BCS) are managed in centres of high expertise which are either transplant centres or have formal links with a liver transplant centre (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
TIPSS is recommended where patients fail to respond to medical therapy with anticoagulation or hepatic vein interventions (strong recommendation, moderate- quality evidence). TIPSS can be considered where hepatic vein interventions is not technically feasible (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).
Patients with poor prognostic scores (see text), or those who do not respond to anticoagulation and radiological therapies, have a poor prognosis and should be considered for liver transplant assessment (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation: prophylactic TIPSS

There is insufficient data to recommend TIPSS prior to non-hepatic surgery, although in compensated cirrhotic patients undergoing curative surgery for cancer there may be a role (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Further research is recommended, with the focus on careful patient selection.

Recommendation: TIPSS for idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension

The indications for TIPSS in idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) should be similar to cirrhosis, and covered stents are preferred. The selection criteria should also be similar to cirrhosis with particular attention to risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Octreotide infusion as a treatment for hepatic hydrothorax in a hospital-at-home program: case report from mayo clinic [^81ab27a4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment strategies typically include fluid and salt restriction, diuretic therapy, and repeated thoracentesis. While these measures provide symptomatic relief, they do not address the underlying pathophysiology. More invasive interventions, such as indwelling tunneled pleural catheters (IPC), pleurodesis, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, may be considered in refractory cases. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease advises against the usage of large-bore chest tubes in the management of HH, citing increased mortality and higher complications, including empyema, clinical deterioration, and fistula formation.

For refractory cases, IPCs are preferred over large-bore chest tubes, either for palliative management or as a bridge to liver transplant (LT), as they reduce the frequency of thoracentesis in this population. However, despite their relative advantage, IPCs are associated with risks such as infection, protein loss, malnutrition, and dehydration. – Ultimately, LT remains the only definitive treatment for HH.

Indications for Treatment and Contraindications

TIPS Indications

Generally, patients with a Child-Pugh score of > 12 are in high risk of postprocedural death. A thorough selection of patients is the key to successful treatment with TIPS. Scoring of patients by the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been validated to predict early mortality after TIPS. Patients with MELD scores of > 15–18 or a bilirubin level of > 60 μmol/L (3.5 mg/dl) should be informed of their poor prognosis, and TIPS should only be performed in the absence of any other treatment possibilities.

Refractory Ascites

Refractory ascites is the most frequent indication for TIPS. Refractory ascites is defined as an abdominal fluid collection that cannot be mobilized or the early recurrence of abdominal fluid that cannot adequately be prevented by medical therapy. The term refractory ascites has two different meanings: diuretic-resistant ascites and diuretic-intractable ascites. Diuretic-resistant ascites does not respond to an intensified diuretic treatment of up to 400 mg/day spironolactone, up to 160 mg/day of furosemide, and sodium restriction to a maximum intake of 5.2 g of salt/day. Diuretic-intractable ascites cannot be mobilized or their early recurrence cannot be prevented because of the development of diuretic-induced complications that preclude the use of an effective diuretic dosage.

Two important complications occur in patients with cirrhotic ascites: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Hepatic hydrothorax occurs in patients with ascites when there is direct communication between the peritoneal and pleural cavities. In most patients, the defect is in the diaphragm that overlies the dome of the liver. Hepatic hydrothorax is due to an accumulation of ascitic fluid migrating through the diaphragmatic defect.

Variceal Bleeding

The causes of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a patient with portal hypertension may be variceal rupture, portal hypertension gastropathy, postsclerotherapy ulcers, peptic ulcer disease, hemorrhagic gastritis, and Mallory-Weiss tear. TIPS is generally accepted as a second-line therapy after failure of endoscopic and medical therapy of bleeding from gastroesophageal varices.

Massive Thrombosis of the Hepatic Veins

TIPS is indicated when medical therapy fails. TIPS is technically feasible in most patients with thrombosis of the hepatic veins. A direct puncture from the intrahepatic inferior vena cava into the liver parenchyma is possible in patients without a remaining hepatic vein stump. The rationale of the use of TIPS is to decompress the liver from venous congestion using the portal vein and TIPS as an outflow tract.

### Analysis of clinical features and prognostic factors in patients with hepatic hydrothorax: a single-center study from China [^2337dffc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

HH as a complication in patients with decompensated cirrhosis can often be combined with other complications, with peritoneal effusion being the most common, followed by electrolyte disturbances, but with hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure being the most severe and having a poor prognosis, which is in general agreement with the data reported in the literature.

We performed a statistical analysis of treatment modalities at the time of first diagnosis in 131 patients with HH and found that HH management was similar to portal hypertensive ascites, with restriction of sodium intake and the use of diuretics, drainage of puncture placement, and TIPS and liver transplantation as options for later treatment. Pleural catheter drainage has been previously reported, and no significant efficacy has been observed, but it is notable that none of our patients received this treatment. Successful treatment of patients with refractory hepatic pleural fluid who did not meet the criteria for TIPS by repairing the diaphragmatic defect with televised thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has also been reported in the literature, but none of our patients attempted this treatment. Among our patients, 20 (15%) were treated with drugs alone, and 111 (75%) were treated with drugs combined with thoracic intubation, which suggests that most pleural effusions were massive and required puncture and drainage to relieve the compression of lung tissue and thereby relieve the symptoms of difficulty in breathing. There was no statistically significant difference in MELD scores or survival time between patients first diagnosed with drugs alone and those with drugs combined with thoracic intubation. Only one patient in our study was found to have undergone TIPS at a later stage of treatment, and three patients finally underwent liver transplantation. The three patients who underwent liver transplantation remain alive today.

TIPSS for hepatic hydrothorax

Hepatic hydrothorax is an uncommon complication of end-stage liver disease, affecting approximately 10% of individuals. Refractory hepatic hydrothorax is defined by a failure to control symptomatic fluid accumulation through optimisation of sodium intake and diuretic treatment. Management is challenging: thoracocentesis is recommended where there is respiratory compromise but where repeated intervention is required, TIPSS has been suggested. The published evidence supporting this approach is comprised of a number of case reports and six case series including 208 participants. These studies have been pooled in a meta-analysis. It is worth noting that the mortality estimates are different from those of the individual studies, and interpretation of the pooled estimates must take this into account. Good clinical responses are observed in a substantial proportion of patients treated with TIPSS and patient selection is critical to that. These studies indicate a probability of complete response of the hydrothorax of between 42% and 79%. However, there was appreciable early mortality reported in all but one of these series. There is clearly a risk of early mortality related to TIPSS for hepatic hydrothorax that appears related to progressive liver disease. The studies reported were done more than a decade ago and only one includes patients treated with PTFE covered TIPSS. Furthermore, since there are no studies comparing TIPSS with standard treatment, consequently, there is no available information on the impact of TIPSS on comparative survival in this population. Improvements in patient selection for TIPSS in general are likely to have reduced the reported early post-TIPSS mortality in patients with hydrothorax but there are no published data to support this.

Recommendation: TIPSS for hydrothorax

Selected patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax may be considered for TIPSS insertion. (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### TIPS for the treatment of refractory ascites, hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic hydrothorax: a critical update [^26949717]. Gut (2010). Low credibility.

Refractory ascites is a frequent complication of advanced cirrhosis and is associated with hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic hydrothorax. Large volume paracentesis and pleurodesis are regarded as first-line treatments in patients who do not respond adequately to diuretics. These treatments, however, do not prevent recurrence and carry the risk of worsening of the circulatory dysfunction leading to hepatorenal syndrome. The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been proposed as an alternative to paracentesis. TIPS reduces the rate of ascites recurrence mainly due to the reduction in the filtration pressure. In addition, TIPS results in a positive effect on renal function, including hepatorenal syndrome, demonstrated by a rapid increase in urinary sodium excretion, urinary volume, and improvement in plasma creatinine concentration. Furthermore, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and noradrenalin concentrations improve gradually after TIPS insertion suggesting a positive effect on systemic underfilling, the factor of hepatorenal syndrome. As demonstrated recently in two meta-analyses including five randomised studies, TIPS also improves survival when compared with paracentesis. However, the evidence is based on relatively few studies with only 305 patients included. The positive effects of the TIPS are opposed by an increased frequency and severity of episodes of hepatic encephalopathy which may be reduced by both patient selection and reduced shunt diameter. Based on the present knowledge the recommended hierarchy of treatments for refractory ascites may be reconsidered upgrading TIPS in suitable candidates.

### Mortality risk factors among patients with cirrhosis and a low model for end-stage liver disease sodium score (≤ 15): an analysis of liver transplant allocation policy using aggregated electronic health record data [^b26c8289]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Although the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease sodium (MELD Na) score is now used for liver transplant allocation in the United States, mortality prediction may be underestimated by the score. Using aggregated electronic health record data from 7834 adult patients with cirrhosis, we determined whether the cause of cirrhosis or cirrhosis complications was associated with an increased risk of death among patients with a MELD Na score ≤ 15 and whether patients with the greatest risk of death could benefit from liver transplantation (LT). Over median follow-up of 2.3 years, 3715 patients had a maximum MELD Na score ≤ 15. Overall, 3.4% were waitlisted for LT. Severe hypoalbuminemia, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic hydrothorax conferred the greatest risk of death independent of MELD Na score with 1-year predicted mortality > 14%. Approximately 10% possessed these risk factors. Of these high-risk patients, only 4% were waitlisted for LT, despite no difference in nonliver comorbidities between waitlisted patients and those not listed. In addition, risk factors for death among waitlisted patients were the same as those for patients not waitlisted, although the effect of malnutrition was significantly greater for waitlisted patients (hazard ratio 8.65 [95% CI 2.57–29.11] vs. 1.47 [95% CI 1.08–1.98]). Using the MELD Na score for allocation may continue to limit access to LT.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts: an update [^58a0e8b7]. Liver Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) have been used in the treatment of complications of portal hypertension. TIPS is used for the control of acute variceal bleeding and for the prevention of vericeal rebleeding when pharmacologic therapy and endoscopic therapy have failed. Patients with refractory ascites with adequate hepatic reserve and renal function who fail to respond to large volume paracentesis may be reasonable candidates for TIPS. Promising indications for TIPS are Budd-Chiari syndrome uncontrolled by medical therapy, severe portal hypertensive gastropathy, refractory hepatic hydrothorax, and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS cannot be recommended for preoperative portal decompression solely to facilitate liver transplantation. Special care should be taken to insure proper placement of the stent to avoid increasing the technical difficulty of the transplantation procedure. The major limiting factors for TIPS success are shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy. Because shunt stenosis is the most important cause of recurrent complications of portal hypertension, a surveillance program to monitor shunt patency is mandatory. The MELD score may be useful in predicting post-TIPS survival, and also in counseling patients and their families.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications… [^6edc6463]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for hepatic encephalopathy include provision of supportive care, identification and removal of precipitating factors, reduction in the nitrogenous load from the gut, and optimization of long-term therapy. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Increases in the ratio of plasma aromatic amino acids to branched-chain amino acids as a consequence of hepatic insufficiency also may contribute to encephalopathy. One meta-analysis suggested that mental recovery was consistently more rapid in patients whose treatment included a branched-chain amino acid infusion; three studies found lower mortality rates in patients who received this treatment, and two others suggested that the treatment increased mortality.

Portal Hypertension and Variceal Bleeding Regardless of the etiology of cirrhosis, the development of portal hypertension is nearly universal and results from an increased resistance to portal flow secondary to scarring, narrowing, and compression of the hepatic sinusoids. When the portal pressure exceeds a certain threshold, it results in the development of varices. Approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis develop varices, most commonly in the distal 2 to 5 cm of the esophagus. The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of variceal hemorrhage recommend that patients with cirrhosis who present with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding undergo an urgent upper endoscopic evaluation. 9 If no varices are observed, these patients should have repeat endoscopy at three-year intervals. If small varices are diagnosed, patients should have repeat surveillance at one-year intervals.

Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is aimed at reducing the portal pressure gradient, azygous blood f low, and variceal pressure. The goals of treatment in acute variceal bleeding include hemodynamic resuscitation, treatment of active bleeding, and prevention of rebleeding. Band ligation is the standard for the control of variceal bleeding. 9 If banding is difficult because of continued variceal bleeding, endoscopic sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors or a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube insertion may be used until TIPS or surgical treatment can be arranged.
9. 9 This treatment option should be performed in medical centers with particular expertise. TIPS has been shown to reduce portal hypertension and can be effective in converting patients with diuretic-resistant ascites to diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage.

Evidence regarding whether or not TIPS improves survival is conflicting. 3 Compared with large-volume paracentesis plus albumin, TIPS improves survival without liver transplantation in patients with refractory or recidivant ascites.
17. After the cessation of active variceal hemorrhage, the subsequent six weeks carry a high risk of recurrent hemorrhage. The greatest risk of rebleeding is within the first 48 to 72 hours, with more than 50 percent of episodes occurring within the first 10 days. 18 Risk factors for early rebleeding include age older than 60 years, renal failure, large varices, and severe initial bleeding. 18 A retrospective study showed that in-hospital mortality of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding decreased from 43 percent in 1980 to 15 percent in 2000, in concurrence with an early and combined use of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies and short-term antibiotic prophylaxis. 19.

### Hepatic hydrothorax does not increase the risk of death after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in cirrhosis patients [^3509ecc3]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study had the following limitations: First, this was a retrospective study. Second, the main clinical problem in most patients was not HH but other decompensated events accompanied by HH. Therefore, it was impossible to evaluate the response of HH to diuretic and/or thoracocentesis treatment, and it was difficult to accurately distinguish the stage of HH. Third, although we matched age, sex, MELD score, and other clinical characteristics between patients with and without HH, rigorous prospective controlled studies are needed to validate our findings.

In conclusion, our study suggested that, when patients with decompensated events are indicated for TIPS, the presence of HH should not affect the choice of TIPS treatment, since there was no increased risk of death after TIPS compared with patients without HH.

### Hepatic hydrothorax… [^8e2a24cb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Significant pleural effusions are infrequently noted in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. A large effusion occasionally appears during the course of the disease. The fluid in the pleural space is believed to be derived from ascitic fluid that may accompany hepatic cirrhosis. Although the exact mechanism is somewhat controversial, it appears that the ascitic fluid is transported directly into the pleural space. A therapeutic thoracentesis, usually accompanied by a paracentesis, may be necessary to relieve acute symptoms. Long-term management, however, centers around eliminating or reducing the formation of ascites. When this is not successful, tube thoracostomy followed by chemical pleurodesis, primary repair of diaphragmatic defects with pleural sclerosis, or peritoneovenous shunting in conjunction with chemical pleurodesis may be attempted. These interventions may or may not be successful. Management of hepatic hydrothorax remains a clinical challenge.

### Attitudes towards transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in Australia: a national survey of TIPS centres [^2fdca6e9]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Institutional clinical practice guidelines or protocols for TIPS

Thirteen respondents (56.5%) reported that their centres do not have a documented TIPS model of care, standard of care protocols, or clinical practice guidance for any aspect of TIPS, while 10 (43.5%) said they have a guideline for some aspects of the TIPS procedure. When asked which of the following aspects of TIPS these guidelines related to, the 10 respondents with available guidelines answered as follows: TIPS indications (7, 30.5%), patient selection (6, 26%), pre-TIPS workup (8, 34.8%), TIPS procedure (7, 30.5%), postoperative complications (4, 17.4%), postoperative care < 72 hours (6, 26%), postoperative follow-up > 72 hours (4, 17.4%), and post-TIPS anticoagulants (2, 8.7%).

Patient selection and indications

Tables 1 and 2 summarise respondents' feedbacks regarding scenarios where TIPS should be indicated.

Table 1
Respondent feedback regarding scenarios where TIPS for hypertensive portal bleeding should be considered

Table 2
Respondent feedback regarding scenarios where TIPS should be considered (other indications)

TIPS for portal hypertensive bleeding

There was marked variation in response regarding indications of TIPS for portal hypertensive bleeding management and prophylaxis across institutions.

TIPS for ascites, HRS and hepatic hydrothorax

All respondents agreed that TIPS insertion is recommended for selected patients with cirrhosis and refractory or recurrent ascites, provided there is no contraindication to the procedure. The majority (22, 95.6%) indicated that TIPS can be considered in patients with hepatic hydrothorax on maximal medical therapy requiring frequent thoracentesis or with significant clinical symptomatology. There was a noticeable difference between surveyed experts on TIPS consideration for non-refractory ascites. 78.3% (18 centres) commented on the futility of TIPS in patients with ascites that is not refractory; however, three (13%) of respondent advocated that TIPS can be indicated for selected cohorts of patients with no refractory ascites.

In the context of HRS, almost three-quarters of respondents (17, 74%) have not considered TIPS for the management of patients with HRS-acute kidney injury. Only six (26%) centres have performed TIPS in patients with HRS type 1 and/or type 2.

### International survey among hepatologists and pulmonologists on the hepatic hydrothorax: plea for recommendations [^bfb571ed]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Low salt diet — diuretics

Regarding the treatment of the hydrothorax, most of the responders answered that the treatment of hepatic hydrothorax relies primarily on the combination of a low salt diet and diuretics. It should be noted, however, that our questionnaire did not specify whether a combined use of furosemide and spironolactone associated with a low-sodium diet was preferable to the use of only one diuretic whereas most studies recommend the co-administration of furosemide 40 mg and spironolactone 100 mg per day to obtain a greater mobilisation of the hydrothorax, with a stepwise increase in this combination of diuretics.

20 to 30% of the patients may have a persistent or recurrent hydrothorax despite the gradual and well-conducted use of diuretics and a low salt diet, however there was no clear definition of what a refractory hydrothorax is for 45% of the responders.

Furthermore, the use of diuretics can lead to hydro-electrolytic disorders, renal failures, hemodynamic instability for fragile patients.

The number of repeated pleural punctures that should lead to the discussion of other treatments was in median 4 without significant difference between the answers originated by the PN and the HG. This number is high due to the risk of developing a pneumothorax and hemothorax as stated above.

Most responders recommended a collegial discussion among the HG, PN, liver and thoracic surgeons for patients with difficult -to -treat HH.

Pleural drain

Although several publications have shown that a pleural drain placement for a hydrothorax was associated with a high rate of complications; it has been observed that it was performed by 38% responders in this study.

In a recent study, it was reported that the in-hospital mortality after a pleural drain placement for a hydrothorax occurred for 40% of cirrhotic patients with a cirrhosis classified as Child Pugh (CP) C and 16% of stage B patients.

Moreover, in a very important recent study carried out on more than 140,000 cirrhotic patients, among whom 1,981 presented a HH requiring repeated pleural punctures, 905 patients had a pleural drain placed inside them and for these patients the length of hospitalisation and the mortality rate were twice as high as for patients with a simple thoracic resection.

Thus, for all these reasons, the AASLD recommendations state that a pleural drain placement is contraindicated for patients with a hepatic hydrothorax.

### Pulmonary manifestations of chronic liver disease: a comprehensive review [^170a3267]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Management

Treatment of HH is similar to the treatment of ascites and aims at the elimination of the fluid in both peritoneal and pleural cavities. Maintaining a negative sodium balance, through dietary sodium intake and diuretics, may lead to reduction in ascites and HH. It is estimated that 20–25% of patients with HH do not respond to medical treatment and these are considered to have refractory HH. LT constitutes the only effective treatment for refractory HH, while other therapeutic choices aim to relieve the patient from symptoms and prevent pulmonary complications.

Thoracentesis is an effective procedure for the management of symptomatic patients with recurrent or refractory hydrothorax. Because of the recurrence of HH, the benefits of thoracentesis are short-term and repetition of the procedure is often needed. Frequent performance of therapeutic thoracentesis increases the risk of complications from the procedure, including pneumothorax, hemothorax, vasovagal episodes, hemoptysis, air embolism, laceration of the liver or spleen, empyema, and subcutaneous emphysema. Re-expansion pulmonary edema constitutes another rare complication of thoracentesis, which may develop after evacuation of a high pleural fluid volume over a short time and is associated with a history of pulmonary disease. Therefore, evacuation of more than 2000 mL of pleural fluid is not recommended. Moreover, massive fluid loss should be avoided because of the risk of acute renal injury.

### Comparison of treatment of hepatic hydrothorax with catheter drainage versus serial thoracentesis [^7a9580bb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hepatic hydrothorax is a nonmalignant pleural effusion associated with portal hypertension that may cause increased morbidity or mortality in cirrhotic patients. For patients who are refractory to salt restriction and diuretics, thoracentesis and catheter drainage are necessary for symptomatic relief. This review aimed to identify the best drainage method in patients with hepatic hydrothorax.

Recent Findings

Chest tube placement is discouraged in cases of hepatic hydrothorax due to high complication and mortality rates. Although the complication rate associated with smaller caliber catheter drainage appears lower than with chest tube drainage, patients treated with catheter drainage still had a higher 30-day mortality compared with patients treated by thoracentesis. Catheter drainage was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in cirrhotic patients with pleural effusion after adjusting for age, hepatic dysfunction, and other comorbidities. Treating the underlying disorder with liver transplantation can dramatically improve survival in these patients.

Summary

The recent evidence supports series thoracentesis as the first-line drainage method in cases of hepatic hydrothorax compared with catheter drainage. Further prospective, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to further evaluate the mortality and complication rates of catheter drainage compared with thoracentesis in cirrhotic patients.

Case presentation

We present a case of a 75-year-old White woman admitted for cough and dyspnea. The cough was non-productive and not associated with fever or chest pain. Her dyspnea was constant, worsening with activity and when lying supine. Both symptoms were present for 2 months, with significant exacerbation 48 h prior to admission.

Her medical history was significant for class I obesity, insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cirrhosis secondary to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease, with a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) sodium score of 25 (14%–15% estimated 90-day mortality). She was a lifelong non-smoker and reported no alcohol or illicit drug use. Her prescribed medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, rifaximin, lactulose, and both short- and long-acting insulin. The patient had multiple cirrhosis-related complications, including hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices with prior bleeding, thrombocytopenia, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and portal vein thrombosis. She had a history of intolerance to anticoagulation with enoxaparin due to recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Diuretics had been discontinued due to recurrent hyponatremia and associated acute kidney injury. Although her ascites was effectively managed through serial paracentesis, this did not result in a corresponding improvement in her HH.

Six months prior to this admission, the patient was diagnosed with recurrent HH, confirmed by a transudative right-sided pleural effusion and technetium-99 sulfur colloid imaging. She underwent multiple therapeutic interventions, including repeated thoracentesis, IPC placement (PleurX — Becton; Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and ultimately chemical talc pleurodesis. However, these measures failed to achieve long-term control of her large, recurrent right-sided HH. Consideration was given to TIPS placement and referral for LT; however, the patient declined both options, expressing a desire to focus on palliative medical management. Prior to admission, she continued to experience excessive fluid output through the persistent fistula in the right chest wall, which had failed to heal following IPC removal done prior to the talc pleurodesis. This fluid was normally collected and volume monitored by an external ostomy bag attached to the thoracic defect site.

### A novel surgical approach to refractory hepatic hydrothorax [^8e454fbf]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatic hydrothorax is defined as the presence of a pleural effusion in a patient with liver cirrhosis in the absence of cardiopulmonary disease, and it is a devastating complication impairing quality of life in the end stage of liver disease. The management of the effusion is challenging, and chest tube drainage can sometimes cause more serious complications by removing massive amounts of protein-rich fluid. Though the most plausible mechanism is the influx of ascites to the pleural cavity through a small diaphragmatic defect, the defect often cannot be found. Hepatic hydrothorax could be controlled by repairing an invisible defect of the diaphragm. With pneumoperitoneum after intraperitoneal administration of indocyanine green, the defect, clearly dyed green, appeared on the diaphragm. This novel combination technique could be useful for ensuring the surgical repair of an invisible diaphragmatic defect.

Diagnosis and definitions

Cirrhosis was diagnosed according to the results of liver biopsy or a combination of medical history, aetiology, clinical presentation, and imaging examinations.

HH was diagnosed based on the following criteria: (1) cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension had radiographically proven pleural effusion, accompanied by chest tightness, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, and even respiratory failure; (2) echocardiography was used to rule out heart failure, and chest CT was used to rule out pulmonary and pleural diseases; and (3) transudative hydrothorax was diagnosed according to Light's criteria. When patients were treated with diuretics and the pleural fluid/serum albumin ratio was < 0.6, pleural effusion was still diagnosed as HH even though it was considered exudate based on Light's criteria. Refractory HH was defined as pleural effusion persisting despite successful treatment of ascites.

The quantification of HH was performed by using the picture archiving and communication system (PACS)–based volumetric tools. Each patient was measured by 2 senior imaging specialists and averaged. The response of HH to TIPS was assessed according to clinical symptoms or radiographic evidence of hydrothorax post-TIPS. Responses were categorised as complete, partial, or absent. The detailed evaluation criteria were listed in supplementary methods.

### Management of patients with liver diseases on the waiting list for transplantation: a major impact to the success of liver transplantation [^f9e6a44c]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Management of patients with intermediate MELD score

In many countries, patients with a MELD score between 18 and 25 have difficulty obtaining access to liver transplantation. The waiting time for these patients is long and may exceed 1 year, with a risk of acute deterioration of their liver condition. The position of most organ-sharing agencies is that patients will be offered transplantation as soon as the MELD score increases. However, some patients may deteriorate rapidly and die following new gastrointestinal bleeding or a septic shock episodes. The other option, not yet considered by organ-sharing agencies, is to assign these patients additional points in relation to the length of waiting time on the list, taking into account the natural history of liver cirrhosis. We find it logical to provide such patients with the possibility to increase their priority in the waiting list. During this waiting time, patients should be maintained in the best possible condition until transplantation, being followed on a regular basis either by the transplant centre or by the referring centre. For this, several actions have to be taken, as follows: (1) in hepatitis C virus cirrhotic patients, an antiviral treatment with interferon-free direct antiviral agents should be discussed; (2) patients should be regularly screened with Doppler ultrasound of the liver for emergence of HCC; (3) prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding by routine endoscopy should be performed; and (4) patients with refractory ascites should be treated either by TIPS or by iterative paracentesis to avoid malnutrition and other complications of refractory ascites. Additionally, it has been shown that physical activity during the waiting time is beneficial for the patient and may improve its VO₂.

### Predicting morbidity and mortality after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement: a review of existing models and future directions [^8a24e823]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a key therapeutic intervention in the management of portal hypertension and its complications, such as variceal bleeding, hepatic hydrothorax, and refractory ascites. TIPS has historically been used as a lifesaving measure or as a bridge to liver transplantation (LT). Despite its efficacy, creation of a TIPS can be associated with significant morbidity, particularly in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Complications include hepatic encephalopathy (HE), progressive liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular compromise. As such, accurate patient selection and risk stratification are essential to optimize clinical outcomes. This review synthesizes current evidence on predictive models for post-TIPS mortality. Traditional scoring systems such as the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) remain widely used, with newer iterations such as the MELD-Na and MELD 3.0 demonstrating improved prognostic accuracy. Notably, MELD 3.0 offers enhanced prediction of long-term mortality. In contrast, the Freiburg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) has become a valuable tool for short-term mortality prediction. Additional models, including the Bilirubin-Platelet (Bili-PLT) score, offer further refinement. At the same time, the role of sarcopenia has gained attention as an independent and synergistic predictor of poor outcomes, especially when combined with MELD-based scores. Beyond mortality, this review explores the multifactorial pathophysiology of post-TIPS complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, and right heart dysfunction that can cause significant morbidity. These outcomes are influenced by a spectrum of patient-related and procedural factors. Novel predictive approaches-encompassing clinical, radiological, and machine learning-based models-are being developed to better anticipate these risks.

### International survey among hepatologists and pulmonologists on the hepatic hydrothorax: plea for recommendations [^0106d861]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The Hepatic hydrothorax is a pleural effusion related to portal hypertension; its diagnosis and therapeutic management may be difficult. The aims of this article are which follows: To gather the practices of hepatogastroenterologists or pulmonologists practitioners regarding the diagnosis and management of the hepatic hydrothorax.

Methods

Practitioners from 13 French- speaking countries were invited to answer an online questionnaire on the hepatic hydrothorax diagnosis and its management.

Results

Five hundred twenty-eight practitioners (80% from France) responded to this survey. 75% were hepatogastroenterologists, 20% pulmonologists and the remaining 5% belonged to other specialities. The Hepatic hydrothorax can be located on the left lung for 64% of the responders (66% hepatogastroenterologists vs 57% pulmonologists; p = 0.25); The Hepatic hydrothorax can exist in the absence of clinical ascites for 91% of the responders (93% hepatogastroenterologists vs 88% pulmonologists; p = 0.27). An Ultrasound pleural scanning was systematically performed before a puncture for 43% of the responders (36% hepatogastroenterologists vs 70% pulmonologists; p < 0.001). A chest X-ray was performed before a puncture for 73% of the respondeurs (79% hepatogastroenterologists vs 54% pulmonologists; p < 0.001). In case of a spontaneous bacterial empyema, an albumin infusion was used by 73% hepatogastroenterologists and 20% pulmonologists (p < 0.001). A drain was used by 37% of the responders (37% hepatogastroenterologists vs 31% pulmonologists; p = 0.26). An Indwelling pleural catheter was used by 50% pulmonologists and 22% hepatogastroenterologists (p < 0.01). TIPS was recommended by 78% of the responders (85% hepatogastroenterologists vs 52% pulmonologists; p < 0.001) and a liver transplantation, by 76% of the responders (86% hepatogastroenterologists vs 44% pulmonologists; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The results of this large study provide important data on practices of French speaking hepatogastroenterologists and pulmonologists; it appears that recommendations are warranted.

Hepatic hydrothorax is a complication seen in up to 10% of patients with advanced liver disease, which typically presents with recurrent pleural effusions. Current available therapeutic options are limited. We demonstrate this condition in a 52-year-old female, and discuss the diagnostic and management difficulties we encountered. Through introducing an intrapleural catheter we successfully enabled resolution of symptoms, reduced hospital admissions and significantly improved our patient's quality of life, with no recurrence of an effusion at 9-month follow-up.

### Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) for the management of hepatic hydrothorax: the known and the unknown [^fdc82195]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is described as pleural effusion secondary to liver cirrhosis after ruling out other etiologies. We aim to assess the efficacy of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) placement in refractory HH in this systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

A comprehensive search of literature was performed from inception to December 2020. The authors reviewed, selected, and abstracted the data from eligible studies into Covidence, a systematic review software. Cochrane criteria was used to rate each study for the risk of bias. The data abstracted were described using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 test.

Results

Ten studies involving a total of 269 patients were included. The studies were analyzed for the proportion of pleurodesis achieved, the average time to pleurodesis, total complication rate, pleural infection rate, and mortality. A proportion of 47% of the total subjects included achieved spontaneous pleurodesis in an average duration of 104.3 days. The frequency of total complication rate was noted to be 30.36%. The incidence of pleural cavity infection was described to be 12.4% and death resulting from complications of IPC was 3.35%.

Conclusion

The current management options for the refractory pleural effusion in HH include repeated thoracenteses, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, surgical repair of defects in the diaphragm, and liver transplantation. However, the cost, eligibility, and availability can be some of the major concerns with these treatment modalities. With this meta-analysis, we conclude that IPCs can provide an alternative therapeutic option for spontaneous pleurodesis.

### Hepatic hydrothorax [^09893b97]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A hepatic hydrothorax is a pleural effusion that develops in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension in the absence of cardiopulmonary disease. The pleural effusion is derived from ascitic fluid that enters the chest because of the negative pressure within the pleural space via defects in the diaphragm. The peritoneal-to-pleural flow of fluid can be demonstrated by nuclear scanning, even when the ascites is not clinically apparent. The pleural fluid usually has the characteristics of a transudate. However, an occasional patient with hepatic hydrothorax will develop spontaneous bacterial pleuritis manifest by increased pleural fluid neutrophils or a positive bacterial culture and will require antibiotic therapy. Treatment of the hydrothorax is directed at the underlying liver disease but a dyspneic patient can obtain relief from a thoracentesis or paracentesis. When medical therapy fails, liver transplantation is the treatment of choice. Both transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting and thoracoscopic repair of diaphragmatic defects with pleural sclerosis can provide symptomatic relief, but the morbidity and mortality of these procedures are high because of the fragile nature of the patients.

### Hepatic hydrothorax does not increase the risk of death after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in cirrhosis patients [^466e1139]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis showed that the 1-year mortality rate in patients with refractory HH receiving TIPS was as high as 50%. However, the 1-year mortality rate in patients with HH receiving TIPS was only 12% in our study. One reason for the inconsistent results may be the different timing of TIPS application. We used TIPS at the time patients had not yet developed refractory HH. Of course, the indications for TIPS in these patients are not HH, but they are accompanied by HH. The early use of TIPS can improve the survival of high-risk patients with cirrhosis complications. For example, early TIPS can improve survival in high-risk patients with acute bleeding, as well as ascites. Therefore, the early application of TIPS in the treatment of HH is also worth exploring. Previous studies have shown that patients with HH under 60 years old with good liver function respond well to TIPS treatment and have a high survival rate. These results support the early use of TIPS for HH. However, the optimal timing for TIPS intervention requires large, multicentre prospective studies.

Previous studies found that poor liver function was a predictor of death in patients with refractory HH treated with TIPS. While we found that patients with HH had worse liver function, their mortality after TIPS did not increase in this study. The effect of liver function on the long-term survival of patients with HH treated with TIPS was not consistent with previous studies. This was mainly because the object of the previous studies was refractory HH, while the object of our study was nonrefractory HH. Most of the patients with HH in our study had an earlier course of decompensated liver cirrhosis and had not reached the refractory HH stage. Therefore, although nonrefractory HH was associated with worse liver function, it did not increase the mortality of TIPS. Of course, further studies are needed to confirm this.

### Analysis of clinical features and prognostic factors in patients with hepatic hydrothorax: a single-center study from China [^afca51de]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is a pleural effusion that is generally higher than 500 mL in size and is related to cirrhosis and portal hypertension in the absence of any cardiac, pulmonary, or pleural illness. HH occurs in approximately 5–15% of cases, is a rare complication of end-stage liver disease, can lead to hypoxia, respiratory distress, and infection, predicts a poor prognosis, and occurs independently of the specific cause of cirrhosis. HH is more prevalent on the right side of the chest (85%), although it can also occur on the left side (13%) and bilaterally (2%), even in the absence of clinical ascites. Most studies suggest that the pathophysiological pathway through which HH occurs is through the formation of peritoneal-pleural defects through microscopic and macroscopic diaphragmatic defects. These diaphragmatic abnormalities are more prevalent in the right diaphragm, which is more fibrous and prone to collagen fiber degradation, and contribute to the prevalence of right-sided pleural effusions in HH patients. Treatment of HH usually includes medical management with diuretics and sodium restriction and therapeutic thoracentesis as necessary. Dietary sodium restriction and diuretics are preferred for long-term management or mild pleural effusion, while therapeutic thoracentesis is usually used for the acute relief of symptoms. However, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), liver transplantation (LT), and surgical repair of diaphragmatic defects are also advocated for some patients, particularly those with refractory HH.

In recent years, HH with hepatopulmonary syndrome and pulmonary hypertension have been recognized as the main pulmonary manifestations of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Patients with HH are more likely to have acute kidney injury, hepatic encephalopathy, infectious shock and higher mortality. A recent study showed that HH is an independent decompensated event associated with long-term mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Although HH usually occurs in end-stage liver disease, the prognostic impact on HH is currently unknown. In this study, we further explored the clinical characteristics and factors associated with the prognosis of patients by retrospectively analyzing 131 patients with HH admitted to our hospital.

Results

Baseline characteristics

From January 2015 to June 2021, 1793 consecutive patients with portal hypertension complications were treated with TIPS. In total, 190 patients with malignant tumours, 288 patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension, and 23 patients lost to follow-up were excluded. Then, 1292 patients with decompensated cirrhosis who received TIPS were included in this study. There were 255 patients with HH and 1037 patients without HH (Fig. 1). Among all patients, 789 (61.1%) patients were male and 771 (59.7%) patients were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). A total of 1116 (91.0%) patients received TIPS due to repeated variceal bleeding, 97 (7.5%) patients received TIPS due to refractory ascites, and 3 (0.2%) patients received TIPS due to refractory HH. A total of 357 (27.6%) patients had main portal vein thrombosis, and the clot obstructed > 50% of the original vessel lumen. A total of 166 (12.8%) patients underwent splenectomy (Table 1).

HH is associated with worse liver function, but does not increase the mortality of TIPS

An analysis of the baseline data of patients with and without HH showed that patients with HH had worse liver function (higher MELD score, 12 vs. 10, p < 0.001). The patients with HH were treated more often with TIPS for refractory ascites and pleural effusion than patients without HH (Table 2). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis suggested that the MELD score was a risk factor for HH (p < 0.001, OR = 2.121, 95% CI, 1.589~2.832) (Table 3). These results suggest that HH is more likely to occur in cirrhotic patients with ascites and poor liver function.

### International survey among hepatologists and pulmonologists on the hepatic hydrothorax: plea for recommendations [^bd27fba4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is defined by the presence of a pleural effusion of a transudative nature greater than 500 mL secondary to some portal hypertension in a cirrhotic patient, in the absence of any causes of cardiopulmonary or malignant origins. The HH occurs in 5% to 15% of patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis and is associated with a significant mortality rate. The poor tolerance of the HH makes its therapeutic management difficult, which can be a source of iatrogenic complications. The treatment of HH is mainly determined by whether or not a liver transplantation is feasable. The mechanism of the HH formation is related to a unidirectional transfer of abdominal ascites to the pleural cavity through diaphragmatic breaches. These breaches range in size from 0.03 to 6 mm in terms of diameter. We can observe a unidirectional passage of ascites formed on the surface of the liver from the peritoneal cavity to the pleura under a hydrostatic pressure gradient, and the HH will surface when the accumulation of ascites in the pleural space exceeds the resorptive capacities of the pleura. This mecanism leads to different treatments possibilities. Although there exists an extensive literature on the hepatic hydrothorax and a recent very complete published review, there are no established and internationally recognized recommendations on the modalities of diagnosis and therapeutic management. The aim of this international multicenter French-speaking study conducted among pulmonologists (PN) and/or hepatogastroenterologists (HG) was to evaluate the knowledge and practices of physicians regarding the hydrothorax diagnosis and management in order to lead secondary to the possibility of establishing scientific recommendations.

### Evolving indications for tips [^dcbb7bb6]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation is a well-established therapy for refractory variceal bleeding and refractory ascites in patients who do not tolerate repeated large volume paracentesis. Experience and technical improvements including covered stents have led to improved TIPS outcomes that have encouraged an expanded application. Evidence for other less frequent indications continues to accumulate, including the indications of primary prophylaxis in patients with high-risk acute variceal bleeding, gastric and ectopic variceal bleeding, primary treatment of medically refractory ascites, recurrent refractory ascites following liver transplantation, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and portal vein thrombosis. Treatment of patients with high-risk acute variceal bleeding with early TIPS and using transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts as a primary therapy rather than large volume paracentesis for refractory ascites would likely be the 2 circumstances that permit expansion in the frequency of TIPS procedures. The remaining populations discussed above are relatively rare.

### Indwelling tunneled pleural catheters for the management of hepatic hydrothorax [^8596a4a7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hepatic hydrothorax is a complication of end-stage liver disease that may have significant associated morbidity. Sodium restriction and diuretic therapy are the mainstays of treatment, though up to a quarter of patients will become refractory to this and will require a pleural drainage procedure. Thoracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and chemical pleurodesis all have variable success rates and associated complications in the management of hepatic hydrothorax. Indwelling tunneled pleural catheters (ITPC) have been successfully used to manage recurrent symptomatic malignant pleural effusions, and there is growing interest regarding their use in the management of hepatic hydrothorax.

Recent Findings

Evidence regarding the use of ITPC for nonmalignant pleural effusions has been limited to retrospective studies and small feasibility trials. A recent meta-analysis regarding the use of IPTC for nonmalignant pleural effusions demonstrated a rate of spontaneous pleurodesis of 51%, whereas a small, prospective study demonstrated spontaneous pleurodesis rates of 33% and an infection rate of 16.7% in 24 patients with ITPC placed for hepatic hydrothorax in patients suitable for liver transplant evaluation.

Summary

ITPC may be an acceptable treatment option for the management of hepatic hydrothorax which are refractory to conventional medical management. Larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of these catheters for the management of nonmalignant pleural effusions.

### Risks and benefits of TIPS in HCC and other liver malignancies: a literature review [^217660ac]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

TIPS for refractory ascites or hydrothorax in HCC

There is evidence that TIPS can sufficiently control ascites in patients with HCC. A multicentre study evaluating the efficacy of TIPS in HCC and CSPH included 51 patients with variceal bleeding, 49 patients with refractory ascites and 23 patients with both variceal bleeding and refractory ascites. A control rate of 87% was achieved for refractory ascites due to TIPS, contributing to a significant improvement of the median Child-Pugh scores from 8 to 6 pts (p < 0.001). These findings were supported by two other, smaller studies reporting a response of ascites to TIPS in 20/27 patients (74.1%), and in 19/20 patients (95%).

In the setting of liver cirrhosis without HCC, TIPS is judged to be equally effective for refractory ascites and hydrothorax. In a retrospective trial enrolling 73 patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis and hydrothorax, but without HCC, TIPS placement succeeded technically in all the patients, and a clinical response was shown in 79% (58/73) of the patients enrolled one month after TIPS placement and in 75% (30/40) 6 months after the TIPS intervention. The median survival among clinical responders within 1 month was 728 days (with a range of 320 to 1,135), while among nonresponders, it was 85 days (with a range of 0 to 209) (p = 0.001). Hepatic hydrothorax is a rather rare complication of cirrhosis, so there is only little data about TIPS in patients with hydrothorax and HCC. In a retrospective trial including eight patients with hydrothorax the latter was decreased in all patients after TIPS, but it is not clear whether further thoracocenteses were necessary. Another retrospective study investigating the efficacy of TIPS in patients with HCC, PVTT and CSPH enrolled 50 patients with refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax. 25 patients received a TIPS procedure resulting in a complete remission of ascites and/or hydrothorax in 72.0% (18/25) and a partial remission in 20.0% (5/25) during follow-up until death. In comparison, another 25 patients with similar baseline characteristics received conservative treatment of their CSPH, leading to a complete remission in 0% and a partial remission in 28.0% (7/25) of cases (p < 0.001). ln the context of this study, complete remission was defined as the complete disappearance of ascites and/or hydrothorax, while partial remission referred to the presence of ascites and/or hydrothorax without the need to be punctured. An interpretation of these data for hydrothorax is not possible, as the authors did not report separate data on hydrothorax, presumably due to the low number of subjects.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 24-year-old male with hepatitis C contracted at birth developed cirrhosis complicated by variceal bleeding, portal hypertension, ascites, and a persistent right-sided hepatic hydrothorax that required thoracenteses every four to six weeks. The effusions were transudative in nature (fluid to serum total protein ratio 0.4, fluid to serum LDH ratio 0.5) and without evidence of infection, pleural, or parenchymal abnormalities consistent with a hepatic hydrothorax. Given his refractory effusions, an indwelling pleural cavity drainage catheter was placed at an outside hospital 8 months prior to his orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for self-drainage of the effusion at home. The pleural catheter was removed 1 month after its placement when he was referred for OLT in order to minimize the chance of infectious complications. He was subsequently managed successfully with diuretics and therapeutic thoracenteses as needed for symptomatic relief. At the time of liver transplantation he had undergone approximately ten thoracenteses.

Other treatments

It should be noted that in the methods leading to the prevention of fluid transfer into the pleural space, our questionnaire did not evaluate the following treatments: continuous pressure ventilation CPAP nor the repair of diaphragmatic breaches because these procedures have been little evaluated so far and are not used as a common practice in the countries participating in the study. This is clearly a limitation in our study. This procedure is still a very marginal practice in France. Other treatment possibilities (reviewed in 8) were not assessed in our survey.

### Safety and efficacy of outpatient continuous terlipressin infusion for the treatment of portal hypertensive complications in cirrhosis [^8c9c1cef]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Aim

Therapeutic options are limited for patients with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), diuretic refractory ascites and hepatic hydrothorax who are awaiting liver transplant. We assessed the safety and efficacy of continuous terlipressin infusion (CTI) for treating these conditions in an outpatient setting.

Method

All patients treated with CTI from May 2013 through March 2018 at our institution were initiated in-hospital on bolus dose terlipressin therapy for 24-72h prior to commencing CTI for home therapy. Daily home visits for clinical assessment and medication administration were provided. Adverse events, effects of treatment on renal function, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and paracentesis/thoracentesis requirements were assessed.

Results

Twenty-three patients were included (HRS = 17; refractory ascites = 4; refractory hepatic hydrothorax = 2). Median (range) duration of outpatient CTI was 50 (1–437) days with a total of 2482 patient days of treatment. Fourteen patients (60.9%) received a liver transplant; of whom 13 (92.9%) were alive at the end of the study period. There were no cardiac or ischemic complications and no serious adverse events reported. In patients with HRS, median serum creatinine significantly decreased from 202.0μmol/L at baseline to 125.5μmol/L at day 14 of CTI (P = 0.0003) and remained stable thereafter. Median MELD score decreased from 22.5 to 19.0 at end of CTI (P = 0.008). Median frequency of paracentesis/thoracentesis was 4 per month prior to CTI versus 1.52 during treatment.

Conclusion

Transplant-eligible and otherwise stable patients can be managed with CTI at home for an extended duration under supervision without adverse consequences.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for symptomatic refractory hepatic hydrothorax in patients with cirrhosis [^028376a2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to study effectiveness, survival, and complications after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in patients with cirrhosis and symptomatic refractory hepatic hydrothorax.

Methods

Consecutive patients who underwent TIPS between January 1992 and December 2008 for refractory hydrothorax were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical, laboratory, and procedural data were collected for all patients by retrospective chart review. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables and t-test to compare continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test.

Results

Seventy-three patients were included in the study, and their mean age at TIPS creation was 55.62 years (s.d. 11.65). The mean pre- and post-TIPS portosystemic gradients were 18.9 (s.d. 4.7) mm Hg and 5.7 (s.d. 2.4) mm Hg (P < 0.001), respectively. The rates of favorable clinical response within 1 month and at 6 months after TIPS were 79% (58/73) and 75% (30/40), respectively. Median survival of the study group was 517 days (95% CI 11–626). The short-term survival rates at 30, 60, and 90 days were 81, 78, and 72%, respectively. The long-term survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 48, 26, and 15%, respectively. Multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazards method showed that pre-TIPS model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (P = 0.039, HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.0–3.7)) and clinical response (P = 0.003, HR 2.5 (95% CI 1.4–4.5)) were significantly and independently associated with overall survival. The 30-day mortality rate was 19%. Pre-TIPS creatinine levels (P = 0.024, HR 3.42 (95% CI 1.2–9.9)) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality.

Conclusions

TIPS can be successfully used to achieve symptomatic relief in patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax. Better clinical response after TIPS and pre-TIPS MELD score less than 15 were associated with longer survival after TIPS.
