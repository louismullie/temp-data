## Question

Intusususception management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intussusception management across pediatric and adult populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and stabilization priorities. Then, I should verify the optimal diagnostic imaging strategy and how it differs by age. Next, I will examine pediatric nonoperative management, including enema technique, sedation/analgesia, and recurrence risk. After that, I need to consider pediatric surgical indications and operative choices. Then, I will review adult-specific management, including malignancy risk and resection strategies. Finally, I should integrate special populations, quality metrics, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and early recognition of peritonitis, shock, or sepsis, because these mandate immediate surgical consultation and preclude enema attempts. I need to ensure I do not delay resuscitation or antibiotics when infection is suspected, and I should remember that the classic triad of pain, vomiting, and currant-jelly stool is present in a minority of children, so a high index of suspicion is essential [^115yhbA4] [^115wSkA2].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — CT is not the first test in children. Ultrasound is the preferred initial modality in pediatrics due to high sensitivity and specificity, avoidance of radiation, and ability to identify lead points and complications, whereas in adults CT is the gold standard because it delineates anatomy, detects lead points, and guides operative planning. I should double-check that both approaches align with contemporary practice, which they do [^114R6BKK] [^115yhbA4] [^1174KRZi].

> For pediatric nonoperative management, I will now examine enema reduction. Air enema under fluoroscopy and ultrasound-guided hydrostatic enema are both acceptable, with RCT data suggesting air enema may have higher success, though the evidence quality is low and practice varies by center. I should confirm that success rates commonly exceed 80–90% in experienced hands, which is supported by large series and systematic reviews, and I need to ensure that contraindications such as perforation, peritonitis, or hemodynamic instability are screened before attempting enema [^114xBPPT] [^114R6BKK] [^115yhbA4].

> Wait, let me verify the role of sedation and analgesia. I initially thought opioids might impair reduction success, but the PAINT multicenter data show that neither fentanyl nor morphine increases failed reduction or perforation, and fentanyl may be advantageous due to rapid onset and favorable adverse effect profile. I should confirm that intranasal fentanyl is a practical option where IV access is difficult, which is supported by recent analyses [^116PeHVu] [^113NQqCG].

> I need to check recurrence expectations and post-reduction care. Meta-analytic data suggest overall recurrence around 7–13% with early recurrence within 48 hours in roughly 2–7%, and multiple series support safe ED observation and discharge after 4–6 hours in stable children with reliable follow-up. I should confirm that cost and length of stay improve without compromising safety, which is corroborated by QI initiatives and observational studies [^111jyBVC] [^116ykEk5] [^114obz1d].

> Now, regarding pediatric surgical indications, I should confirm that failure of enema, signs of perforation, peritonitis, shock, or suspected pathologic lead point are clear triggers for operative management. Laparoscopy is increasingly preferred when feasible, with systematic reviews suggesting shorter length of stay and acceptable success, though open reduction remains appropriate in unstable patients or when laparoscopy is unavailable. I need to ensure I do not overstate laparoscopic superiority without randomized data, which we lack [^116Gkmzv] [^115vGEhC].

> But wait, what if the first enema partially reduces the intussusception? I should consider delayed repeat enema strategies, which can salvage a meaningful proportion of cases when the child is stable and the initial attempt achieved partial reduction. I should double-check that success is higher when the apex reaches the ileocecal valve, which is supported by retrospective series and institutional protocols [^116xcGwC] [^113DWk66] [^112CCc2B].

> Turning to adults, I need to ensure I emphasize malignancy risk. Colocolic intussusceptions harbor malignancy in roughly two-thirds of cases, ileocolic around half, and small bowel about 9%, so enema reduction is generally contraindicated in colonic disease and reduction before resection risks intraluminal seeding. En bloc resection without prior reduction is the standard for colonic involvement, whereas small-bowel intussusceptions may be reduced if viability is preserved and malignancy is not suspected. I should confirm that these principles are consistent across contemporary series and reviews [^115SpqEL] [^115Y4vRJ] [^1174KRZi].

> Hold on, I should verify operative strategy nuances. When malignancy is suspected or confirmed, oncologic resection with appropriate margins is indicated, whereas in benign small-bowel disease, manual reduction can limit the extent of resection. I need to ensure I balance the risk of dissemination against the benefit of bowel preservation, and I should remember that transient or asymptomatic small-bowel intussusceptions may be observed if no lead point is identified and the patient is stable [^115SpqEL] [^1174KRZi] [^115escaj].

> Next, I should review special populations. In infants under 3 months, presentation is often atypical and progression to ischemia can be rapid, so I need a lower threshold for surgical consultation and careful enema pressure selection. In Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, radiologic or endoscopic reduction is contraindicated when obstruction is present due to the risk of polyp-related lead points, mandating surgical management. I should confirm these distinctions to avoid inappropriate nonoperative attempts [^115Ub968] [^114AjBEW] [^114B3UUq].

> I will now examine quality metrics and system factors. Success rates for nonoperative reduction vary with operator experience and center volume, with tertiary centers achieving higher enema success and lower surgery rates. I should double-check that standardized outcome reporting using a composite reduction rate better reflects real-world performance than selective rates, and that cost analyses consistently show lower expenditures with successful nonoperative care and early discharge protocols [^1126k2mB] [^113LQCSA] [^112g4B5h].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency: stabilize and exclude peritonitis or perforation. Obtain ultrasound in children or CT in adults. Attempt enema reduction in eligible pediatric cases with consideration of analgesia. Observe 4–6 hours post-reduction and discharge stable patients with return precautions. Escalate to surgery for failed reduction, instability, or suspected lead point. In adults, favor en bloc resection for colonic disease and tailor small-bowel management to viability and malignancy risk. I should confirm that this aligns with the cited evidence base, which it does [^114R6BKK] [^115SpqEL].

> Finally, I should double-check areas of controversy and correct any overstatements. While air enema may outperform liquid in small RCTs, the evidence quality is low and technique selection should be guided by local expertise. Similarly, although dexamethasone may reduce recurrence, the data are limited and not universally adopted. And although I initially implied that immediate surgeon presence is mandatory for all enemas, some centers safely perform reductions with rapid surgical access rather than on-site presence, provided teams are prepared to manage perforation or instability expeditiously [^114xBPPT] [^114yEt6M].

Intussusception management is **age-specific**: in children, ultrasound is first-line [^114R6BKK] and nonoperative enema reduction is preferred [^117QKtEF]; in adults, CT is essential [^1174KRZi] and surgery is often required due to lead points and malignancy risk [^115SpqEL]. Immediate care includes **IV fluids, nasogastric decompression, and antibiotics** if infection is suspected [^1177GB4U]. Nonoperative options include air or hydrostatic enemas [^114xBPPT]; surgery is indicated for failure, perforation, peritonitis, or suspected malignancy [^114ciNzb]. Recurrence is common after enema reduction [^111jyBVC]; early recurrence is usually managed with repeat enema, whereas late recurrence or a lead point warrants surgical evaluation [^111kTXhu].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

Immediate assessment and stabilization are **critical** to prevent complications:

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Intravenous fluids and electrolyte correction are essential, especially in dehydrated or septic patients [^notfound].

- **Nasogastric decompression**: Reduces intestinal distension and vomiting.

- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: Administer if bacterial translocation or perforation is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is **essential** for confirming the diagnosis and guiding management:

| **Age group** | **Preferred imaging modality** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Children | Ultrasound (US) | - High sensitivity (98–100%) [^115yhbA4] <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Can identify lead points [^113DWk66] |
| Adults | Computed tomography (CT) | - Identifies lead points [^117Se4QS] <br/> - Assesses bowel viability <br/> - Guides surgical planning [^117Se4QS] |

---

## Nonoperative management

Nonoperative management is the **first-line approach** in pediatric cases:

- **Enema reduction**: Air or hydrostatic enemas under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance are preferred [^117QKtEF]. Air enemas have higher success rates and lower perforation risk compared to liquid enemas [^114xBPPT].

- **Adjunctive medications**: Glucagon or dexamethasone may be used to relax smooth muscle and reduce recurrence, although evidence is limited [^114xBPPT].

- **Observation**: After successful reduction, observe for 4–6 hours [^112PtHLq] to monitor for recurrence before discharge [^114obz1d].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is **indicated** in the following scenarios:

- **Failed nonoperative reduction**: Persistent intussusception after multiple enema attempts [^114ciNzb].

- **Perforation or peritonitis**: Clinical signs of bowel perforation, peritonitis, or sepsis [^114ciNzb].

- **Suspected lead points**: Pathological lead points, especially in adults, due to high malignancy risk [^115SpqEL].

- **Recurrent intussusception**: Multiple recurrences or late recurrences (> 48 hours) after successful reduction [^116yJLuc].

---

## Surgical techniques

Several **surgical techniques** are employed based on patient age, clinical presentation, and surgeon expertise:

- **Manual reduction**: Gentle manipulation to reduce the intussusception, reserved for viable bowel segments without lead points [^111X5cd1].

- **Bowel resection**: Indicated for irreducible intussusception, gangrenous bowel, or suspected malignancy. Primary anastomosis is preferred if the patient is stable [^112xdk5H].

- **Laparoscopic approach**: Minimally invasive technique with shorter hospital stay and faster recovery, increasingly used in pediatric patients [^116Gkmzv].

---

## Management of recurrence

Recurrence is **common** after nonoperative reduction, occurring in approximately 8–12% of cases [^111jyBVC]. Early recurrence (< 48 hours) is typically managed with repeat enema reduction, whereas late recurrence (> 48 hours) or multiple recurrences warrant surgical evaluation to identify and address underlying lead points [^116yJLuc].

---

## Special considerations

- **Adult intussusception**: High likelihood of lead points and malignancy necessitates surgical exploration and resection without prior reduction [^115SpqEL].

- **Pediatric intussusception**: Most cases are idiopathic and managed nonoperatively. Persistent or recurrent cases require evaluation for lead points [^116yJLuc].

- **Pain management**: Adequate analgesia, including intranasal fentanyl, is recommended during enema reduction procedures [^1156wdNV].

---

Intussusception management is **tailored to age and clinical context**, with pediatric cases prioritized for nonoperative enema reduction and adults often requiring surgical intervention due to lead points and malignancy risk.

### Management of recurrent ileocolic intussusception [^114LPy8s]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this study were to evaluate the need for surgical intervention for patients with recurrent ileocolic intussusception (RICI), especially for multiple recurrences, and to investigate whether early and late recurrence patterns were associated with surgery.

Methods

Patients with ileocolic intussusception (ICI) during the years 2007–2019 were included. Demographic data, recurrences, and outcomes were analyzed. Early RICI was defined as recurrence within 48 h.

Results

Overall, 604 episodes of ICI were confirmed in 491 patients. The recurrence rate was 13.8%, with 113 episodes in 68 patients. There were no statistically significant differences in age, reduction success rate, operation, or pathological lead points (PLPs) between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups. There was no significant association between the number of recurrences and the presence of a PLP or between the number of recurrences and whether the recurrences were early or late. The presence of PLPs was not significantly associated with age or recurrence, but the reduction success rate was significantly lower (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Each recurrence should be managed as a first episode, regardless of early or late recurrence. Operative reduction should be considered when nonoperative reduction fails, a PLP is suspected, or there are signs of peritonitis.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^116oFqzF]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Adult intussusception is a rare clinical entity, representing 1%–5% of intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis is challenging, as symptoms may be acute or chronic and are often non‐specific. Because of the rarity of this disease, no clinical guidelines currently exist for its management, and randomized‐controlled trials are not feasible within realistic timeframes. As a result, debates continue regarding both surgical and conservative management, especially with the widespread use of CT scans for diagnosis. When surgery is indicated, debate remains about the type of procedure, the necessity of reduction, and whether resection should follow oncological standards.

The primary outcome of interest of this systematic review was the etiology causing the intussusception.

Even though considering a substantial risk of bias in this systematic review, especially due to publication and reporting bias, lack of etiological data in conservatively treated patients, and the predominance of large surgical series, the high percentage of malignancies in colocolic intussusceptions remains striking. Whereas the majority of intussusceptions are enteric and benign, malignancy was identified in 68% of colocolic intussusceptions. These finding are further supported by a multicentric retrospective study from Korea including 77 adult intussusceptions. In their cohort, the authors found that 61.5% of colonic intussusceptions had underlying malignancies and on multivariable analysis, colonic intussusception was found as an independent predictor of malignancy (OR 5.5, 95%CI 1.2‐24.3, p = 0.026) along with chronic symptoms (OR 4.6, 95%CI 1.2‐18.1, p = 0.031).

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome — small bowel surveillance schedule: We recommend that baseline small bowel surveillance using capsule endoscopy or magnetic resonance enterography be performed between ages 8–10 years or earlier if the patient is symptomatic. If no polyps are found at initial examination, surveillance should resume at age 18. Because of the risk of small bowel intussusception, small bowel evaluation in adulthood is recommended to continue throughout life every 2–3 years. (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Diagnosis and treatment intussusception-a surgical condition… [^115Q2UkA]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

THE gradual increase in the employment of hydrostatic pressure reduction of intussusception with the use of the barium enema has resulted in a gratifying decrease in the number of laparotomies performed. It can also be expected, on the basis of past experience, to result in a decrease of the number of resections required, since some resections have been done on bowel mistakenly thought to be non-viable, and in other instances resection has been required for bowel traumatized by the manual reduction itself. The other advantages of hydrostatic pressure reduction are familiar. If the possibility of intussusception is merely entertained, the diagnosis can be made with certainty and the treatment instituted at the same time by barium enema.

When immediate operation is the standard treatment for intussusception there may be an understandable tendency to delay operation until the clinical diagnosis has been made unequivocally. Specific lesions causing intussusception, such as polyps, Meckel's diverticula, etc., are not in themselves significant and occur in only 5 or 6% of cases of intussusception. Intussusceptions of long duration may still be totally reducible and, in any case, in practically all of them the intussusceptum is reduced around to the cecum so that if operation is required a right lower quadrant exposure is sufficient and one is spared the necessity of manipulating the bowel around from the left colon to the right colon. Finally, it has been shown in a number of series that, in children who have operative reductions of intussusception, there is a significant incidence of late mechanical intestinal obstruction due to adhesions resulting from the intra-abdominal manipulation.

### Delayed repeat enema in the management of intussusception [^116xcGwC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of children with intussusception and failed initial air enema reduction who were managed by delayed repeat enema attempts and identify predictors associated with successful reduction.

Methods

This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of children diagnosed with intussusception who received care at an urban 110-bed children's hospital. Patients who had failed initial enema reduction attempts under fluoroscopic guidance and had subsequent delayed (≥ 2 hours from the initial attempt) repeat enemas made up the study population. The primary outcome variable was success of delayed repeat enema reduction. Predictor variables included duration of presenting symptoms (≤ 1 day vs ≥ 2 days), gross bloody stools, dehydration, altered mental status, ileus per radiograph, time from initial to delayed repeat enema, and lack of partial reduction to the ileocecal valve with the first attempt.

Results

During a 74-month period, 20 patients with 21 intussusception events managed by delayed repeat air enemas were identified. Of the 20 patients, there were 12 boys (60%). Distribution of race was as follows: 9 white (45%), 7 African Americans (35%), and 4 Hispanics (20%). Of the 21 events, the mean (SD) age at the time of intussusception was 14.4 (12.8) months, with a median of 8 months and ranging from 2.5 to 43 months. Of the first 21 attempted delayed repeat enemas, 9 (43%) were successful. Of the 12 unsuccessful attempts, 4 had a second delayed repeat enema attempt and 3 were successful. Overall delayed repeat enemas were successful in 12 patient events (57%). For the total 25 delayed repeat enemas, 12 (48%) were successful. Surgical reduction was performed in 9 patient events (43%). Of these, manual reduction was performed in 7 and surgical incision was performed in 2, with resection of a portion of the distal ileum. There were 19 ileocolic (90%) and 2 ileoileocolic (10%) intussusceptions. There were no pathologic lead points and no patient deaths. In comparing the successful from the failed delayed repeat enema reduction groups, there was no significant difference in demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, or time from initial enema to first repeat enema. However, there was a trend toward a significant difference regarding the failed group having a greater rate of bloody stools, dehydration, or altered mental status. There was a significant difference for the degree of partial reduction achieved on the initial enema. For the successful delayed repeat enema reduction group, the location of the lead point of the intussusceptum after the initial enema was at the ileocecal valve for 9 patients (90%) versus 3 patients (33%) in the failed group. Although not significantly different, the successful versus failed delayed repeat enema reduction group trended toward significance regarding more patients with clinical improvement after initial enema (82% vs 43%).

Conclusions

With the coordinated care of emergency medicine, surgery, and radiology services, delayed repeat enema seems to be an option to consider in the management of clinically stable children who, on initial air enema, have partial reduction. Our study showed that the success rate of delayed repeat enemas was greatest when the intussusceptum was initially reduced to the ileocecal valve.

### Laparoscopic versus open reduction of idiopathic intussusception in children: an updated institutional experience [^115vGEhC]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute intussusception was one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain in children, and it was the most frequent cause of intestinal obstruction in children aged 3 months to 5 years. The vast majority (nearly 95%) of intussusception lacked a definite pathologic lead point and were classified as idiopathic intussusceptions. China was one of the countries with a high incidence of intussusception in the world. The image-guided pneumatic reduction was the first-line management in our institution, and the success rate was 91.9%. Operation was indicated when pneumatic air enema was unsuccessful or who was contraindicated. Traditionally, a large right-sided transverse incision was needed for manual reduction. With the advancement of minimally invasive surgery in children, the laparoscopic approach was increasingly used in the management of intussusception. However, no randomized, controlled, and prospective clinical trials focused on the two methods. More evidence to confirm the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic approach in intussusception was needed.

This study aims to compare the results of laparoscopy and open reduction of idiopathic intussusception in children as well as to elaborate some skills for the management of intussusception laparoscopically.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^1137rZNL]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Intussusception is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain and vomiting in infants and children. Its etiology and management have changed significantly over the last decades. Hypertrophic Peyer patches, polyps, seasonality, viral factors and postnatal changes in the enteric nervous system have been considered responsible. Nonsurgical treatment is the first-line management at present, with a high reduction rate. Currently, there are numerous methods of treatment for intussusception management. The purpose of the study is to analyze the characteristics of intussusception in children and to evaluate the effects of different management strategies, to initiate appropriate treatment as early as possible and to protect intussuscepted children from medicinal injury.

### Adult ileocolic intussusception secondary to ileocaecal valve polyp [^116mtPzy]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Intussusception is relatively common in children, but it is a rare cause of abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction in adults. The aetiology, clinical presentation and management of this condition differs in adults and children. Preoperative clinical diagnosis is usually difficult due to the non-specific and intermittent nature of the symptoms. Ultrasound and computed tomography can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. We present a case of adult ileocolic intussusception with classical radiological signs and operative findings. In adults the diagnosis of intussusception should be considered in a case of intermittent abdominal pain, especially with clinical signs of intermittent bowel obstruction.

### Management of intussusception in infants and children… [^114xz3yX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction Intussusception is the telescoping of a portion of the intestine into an adjacent segment of bowel. The occurrence of this in infants and children constitutes one of the commonest abdominal emergencies and is seen most frequently in the first two years of life. This telescoping of the intestine may occur at any level in the intestinal tract, but most frequently at the ileocolic junction. When the intussusception originates in the colon, ileocolic junction, or lower ileum, it may be reduced by air insufflation or enemata. When irreducible by conservative measures, or when the intussusception is proximal to the terminal ileum it constitutes a surgical emergency. At the time of operation, many of these intussusceptions can be reduced by manual taxis, as first advocated by Hutchinson. 1 However, a certain number will be found to be irreducible or gangrenous, and until the past decade these carried an exceedingly high mortality.

### Intussusception: past, present and future [^113eo5LU]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Intussusception is a common etiology of acute abdominal pain in children. Over the last 70 years, there have been significant changes in how we diagnose and treat intussusception, with a more recent focus on the role of ultrasound. In this article we discuss historical and current approaches to intussusception, with an emphasis on ultrasound as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality.

### Opioid administration and reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^113NQqCG]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The original global multicenter study of intussusception in children (PAINT) found that only a minority of patients (< 15%) received analgesia or sedation for reduction. In the present cross-sectional substudy, we found no association between either fentanyl or morphine and failed reduction. Our results suggest that fentanyl may be considered a safe therapeutic option to manage children's intussusception and subsequent reduction-related pain. In addition, current practice with morphine administration was considered safe, as we found no increased risk of failed reduction of intussusception associated with morphine administration. However, mounting evidence shows that morphine is associated with adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and respiratory depression. Fentanyl may be a better option than morphine because of greater potency, fewer adverse effects, and, specifically, minimal adverse cardiovascular effects. Moreover, fentanyl can be administered intranasally, making it ideal to quickly and effectively reduce pain in children undergoing reduction of intussusception in settings that lack adequate personnel and resources to sedate children.

In our sample, 15.20% of patients experienced a failed reduction, consistent with the published frequency of 6%-40%. Successful nonoperative reduction by hydrostatic or pneumatic enema can obviate the need for surgical intervention and its associated complications for most children. Our findings largely agree with prior reports in which children under 12 months of age were at increased risk for failed reduction. Consistent with prior literature, we also found that longer duration of symptoms was associated with failed reduction. The positive association between preexisting gastrointestinal anomalies and failed reduction was described in the original PAINT study. While prior studies have not described this association, 2 retrospective studies found that a pathological lead point increased the likelihood of failed reduction. The reason for these associations is not entirely clear but suggests the need for tailored approaches to management of intussusception for children at risk of failure of reduction, such as early surgical consultation and specifically for younger children, decreasing the time to reduction using care pathways for expedited diagnostic ultrasound. The latter has been shown to be beneficial in suspected pediatric appendicitis. In keeping with the original PAINT study, neither fentanyl nor morphine administration was associated with failed reduction in this substudy. Fentanyl is arguably a better choice because it is more potent and has a better adverse event profile. Further, it can be given through a variety of routes, including intranasal, which is becoming increasingly popular due to the desire to avoid painful intravenous administration.

### Intussusception revisited: is immediate on-site surgeon availability at the time of reduction necessary? [^114yEt6M]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Radiology recommends that fluoroscopically guided intussusception reduction be performed with a surgeon readily available. At many institutions, this may not be feasible. The purpose of this study was to assess the utilization of immediate surgical services at the time of radiologic intussusception reduction.

Materials and Methods

All radiologic intussusception reductions at a tertiary care children's hospital from November 2007 through August 2012 were reviewed to determine method, complications, clinical status of the child, and time between unsuccessful reduction and operative intervention.

Results

Among 433 patients with intussusception referred for fluoroscopic reduction, 86.1% (n = 373) had successful reductions, and 13.9% (n = 60) had unsuccessful reductions. Five perforations represented 8.3% (5/60) of the unsuccessful and 1.2% (5/433) of the total reduction attempts. Six patients' conditions became hemodynamically unstable during attempted reduction (four perforations, two unsuccessful reductions without perforation), representing 10% (6/60) of unsuccessful and 1.4% (6/433) of total reduction attempts. Percutaneous needle decompression and cardiopulmonary resuscitation restored hemodynamic stability in all cases. The mean time to surgery after perforation was 1.3 hours, after unsuccessful reduction complicated by hemodynamic instability was 2.2 hours, and after unsuccessful radiologic reduction without complication was 4.3 hours.

Conclusion

In this series, complications requiring immediate medical or surgical attention were rare, occurring in 1.6% of cases (five bowel perforations, two cases of hemodynamic instability without perforation). On-site surgeon presence may not be necessary at the time of radiologically guided reduction attempts provided that the attending physician is facile with percutaneous needle decompression and management of hemodynamic instability and that ultimate surgical care can be arranged expeditiously.

### Adult intussusception: a retrospective review [^113NWJbC]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Sarr et al. at the Mayo Clinic recently questioned the accepted notion that preoperative reduction of intussusception was not recommended because it was associated with malignant disease. Tumor cells are always flowing out of primary lesions, and the reduction of intussusception causes little damage to the intestinal mucosa. Patients with enteric and ileocolic intussusceptions do not have leading points, so there is no need for removal. Preoperative reduction serves several functions, including avoidance of emergency surgery, allowing radical surgery for cancer, and reducing the extent of the intestinal resection. It also allows time for preoperative preparation of the bowel. Careful radiologic or endoscopic evaluation can detect strangulated intussusception that is impossible to reduce preoperatively. These observations have resulted in a shift in the clinical paradigm for reducting the intussusception.

In this study, intussusceptions were reduced before surgery in 14 patients followed by preoperative examination. In another 14 patients, intussusceptions were reduced intraoperatively, thereby decreasing the extent of the resected intestine. We believe that the benefits of intussusception reduction are great unless the local lesion has signs of necrosis. In all, 28 patients (63.6%) underwent intussusception reduction preoperatively and intraoperatively using this policy. Two patients experienced a small perforation intraoperatively, but it did not result in postoperative complications.

### The cost of childhood intussusception in Ontario from 2003 to 2016: a population-based study [^112g4B5h]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of pediatric intussusception has evolved to favor non-surgical reduction with potential outpatient management. The overall impact of these changes on healthcare costs is unknown.

Methods

A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted utilizing population-based universal-access administrative healthcare data to identify patients < 18 years treated for intussusception January 2003-December 2016 in Ontario, Canada. Hospital-associated cost included emergency department and cost of hospitalization, while total cost also included billable physician costs. All costs are presented in 2016 Canadian Dollars.

Results

The median hospital-associated costs for each modality were: non-surgical $2467, failed non-surgical $6508, and surgical only $8863 (p < 0.0001). Costs associated with non-surgical or surgical only management did not change over the study period, whereas costs associated with failed non-surgical management increased from $3842 in 2003 to $12,350 in 2016 (p = 0.0003). Similar trends were observed when physician billing data was included. Costs were $1076.95 higher in community hospitals than academic hospitals (95% CI: $344, $1810; p = 0.004).

Conclusion

The cost of care for intussusception is dependent upon treatment modality and was lowest for non-surgical management and highest for patients treated in community hospitals. Efforts to standardize care to promote successful non-surgical management and to facilitate early discharge could provide cost savings to the healthcare system.

### Small bowel intussusception-aetiology&management [^117Se4QS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Adult small bowel intussusception (SBI) differs in incidence, symptomatology and management from the more commonly encountered paediatric intussusception. This review spans across the multitude of causes of adult SBI, and summarises the diagnostic work-up and management options according to recent literature.

Recent Findings

There has been an increase in use of small bowel capsule endoscopy and point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute adult SBI.

Summary

A high degree of suspicion of a malignant cause of SBI is required in the adult population. Alarm clinical features include weight loss, history of malignancy, and iron deficiency anaemia. CT remains the gold standard imaging technique as it may identify the lead point and thus aid in endoscopic or surgical management. If malignancy is excluded and no lead point is identified, serology and histology may be helpful to look for inflammatory, infective and autoimmune aetiology.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^1128SnZW]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, this study comprehensively summarizes the existing evidence on intussusception in adults. Current data remain of low quality because of the limited experience and rare presentation of this clinical entity. In the meantime, we propose an algorithm based on the present systematic review and institutional clinical practice to guide decision making when confronted with intussusception. In case of colic intussusception, a high degree of suspicion for an underlying malignancy is warranted, and in that regard, an oncological surgical resection without reduction is recommended. Enteric intussusception should be managed according to the length, clinical presentation, and interoperative findings of lead points.

### Recurrent intussusception [^113edpSF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent intussusception is defined as an occurrence of intussusception of a bowel loop in a patient with a prior resolution of intussusception, either spontaneously or with an intervention. It is not rare to develop a subsequent episode after a successful reduction of intussusception. We report the cases of 2 children who presented to the emergency department with recurrent intussusception and review the pertinent literature.

### Clinical entity and treatment strategies for adult intussusceptions: 20 years' experience [^116uAaVr]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Intestinal intussusception in adults is rare and the optimal management of this problem remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the causes of intussusceptions in adults and to assess their treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients older than aged 18 years who were diagnosed with intestinal intussusception at Tri-Service General Hospital between July 1984 and July 2004 was conducted.

Results

During the 20-year period, there were 292 patients with intussusception, 24 (8.2 percent) of which were adults. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting complaint (79.2 percent). The diagnosis of adult intussusception was made preoperatively in 18 cases (75 percent) and intraoperatively in 6 cases (25 percent). Of the 24 patients, 20 (83.3 percent) had a defined lesion; 11 (55 percent) lesions were benign and 9 (45 percent) were malignant. In eight patients (33.3 percent), the intussusception was reduced; perforation occurred in one patient (12.5 percent). Segmental resections were performed on 14 patients (58.3 percent), right hemicolectomies on 6 patients (25 percent), laparoscopic low anterior resection on 1 patient (4.2 percent), appendectomy on 1 patient (4.2 percent), and diverticulectomy on 1 patient (4.2 percent). Intraoperative colonoscopy was performed on three patients (12.5 percent) before reduction (lipomas were noted in 2 of the patients (66.7 percent) with limited resection of the ileum and preservation of the antireflux ileocecal valve. There was one perioperative mortality (4.2 percent) and seven postoperative morbidities (29.2 percent).

Conclusions

Adult intussusception is an unusual and challenging condition and is a preoperative diagnostic problem. We discuss our 20 years of experience in treatment strategies for dealing with such unusual problems.

### Intussusception: hospital size and risk of surgery [^111P5ZMS]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the risk of operative management of children with intussusception varies by hospital pediatric caseload.

Design

A cohort of all children with intussusception in Washington State from 1987 through 1996.

Setting

All hospitals in Washington State.

Methods

Five hundred seventy children with a hospital discharge diagnosis of intussusception were identified. Sixty-two were excluded because of missing data. Procedure codes for operative management and radiologic management were also identified.

Results

Fifty-three percent of the children had operative reduction and 20% had resection of bowel. Children with operative reduction did not differ from those with nonoperative care by median age or gender; however, children with operative care were significantly more likely to receive care in hospitals with smaller pediatric caseloads and to have a coexisting condition associated with intussusception. Sixty-four percent of children who received care in a large children's hospital had nonoperative reduction, compared with 36% of children who received care in hospitals with 0 to 3000 annual pediatric admissions and 24% of children who had care in hospitals with 3000 to 10 000 annual pediatric admissions. Median length of stay and charges were significantly less in the large children's hospital, compared with other centers.

Conclusions

Children who received care for intussusception in a large children's hospital had decreased risk of operative care, shorter length of stay, and lower hospital charges compared with children who received care in hospitals with smaller pediatric caseloads.

### Conservative management resulting in complete resolution of a double intussusception in an adult haemophiliac [^112FtTvw]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in haemophiliacs should be approached as haemorrhage until proven otherwise. With advancements in factor repletion and coagulopathic management a conservative approach should be considered. We describe a case of double colo-colonic intussusception lead by an intramural haematoma occurring spontaneously and resolving with conservative management in a young haemophiliac. This demonstrates that intussusception in these cases may be transient, and does not require surgical intervention.

### A comprehensive scoring system for the better prediction of bowel resection in pediatric intussusception [^117NipWm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient population

This collaborative, multidisciplinary program was dedicated to optimizing intussusception management. Participating institutions included the pediatric general surgery departments of Qingdao Maternity and Child Care Hospital, Yangchuan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Chongqing Maternity and Child Care Hospital, and Chongqing Children's Hospital. Medical data from patients diagnosed with intestinal intussusception across these hospitals were retrospectively reviewed from April 2008 to December 2020.

In our practice, patients initially undergo assessment via sonography, followed by further evaluation through air reduction enemas or surgical findings. Air reduction procedures, conducted promptly upon clinical or sonographic diagnosis, are performed by both surgeons and radiologists. Surgical management is pursued if air-enema reduction is unsuccessful. During exploratory laparotomy, assessing the viability of the affected bowel segment is crucial, following established operating room procedures. Ultimately, the decision to remove intestinal sections rests with the attending surgeon.

This study encompassed all intussusception cases that underwent surgical management, categorizing them into bowel resection and no-bowel resection groups. Inclusion criteria were an age range of over 1 month to under 3 years and being a first admission. Pathological lead points (PLPs) responsible for intussusception were excluded from the study. Due to its observational nature, patient consent was not required. Comprehensive reviews of available medical records were conducted, encompassing demographic, clinical features, and the entire spectrum of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data. Additionally, the study explored the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte-CRP ratio (LCR), to predict intestinal resection in intussusception patients.

### Contemporary management of adult intussusception: who needs a resection? [^111FF994]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical resection is often recommended in adults with intestinal intussusception (AI) because of its potential association with malignancy. We provide a contemporary algorithm for managing AI by focusing on the probability of discovering a lead point.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of adult patients with computed tomography (CT)-confirmed intussusception who underwent operative management of AI between 1996 and 2011 at a single academic institution.

Results

Sixty-four patients were diagnosed with AI by CT scan and then managed operatively. The incidence of colonic (CI), small bowel (SBI), and retrograde intussusception (RI) was 14, 55, and 31%, respectively. All patients with CI had a lead point, whereas none were found among patients with RI. Some 46% of patients with SBI had a lead point. The probability of discovering a lead point in SBI was increased by past history of malignancy (RR, 3.7, p < 0.001), a mass seen on preoperative CT scan (RR, 2.9, p = 0.005), and age over 60 years (RR, 2.2, p = 0.07).

Conclusions

A pathologic lead point is likely with CI but not with RI. Patients with SBI who are over the age of 60 years and have a history of malignancy or a mass noted on CT scan have a higher likelihood of harboring a pathologic lead point.

3.3 Etiology of the Intussusception

Intussusceptions were classified as idiopathic when managed conservatively without a lead point visualized on imaging studies, or when no pathological lead point or intussusception was found during surgical exploration. Idiopathic intussusceptions accounted for 39% of the cases (789/1991 patients based on 29 articles).

In patients who underwent operative management, a pathological lead point was identified in 58% (1331/2294 intussusceptions based on 33 studies with 2193 patients). Benign lesions were the cause of intussusception in 19% of intussusceptions (407/2180 intussusceptions based on 31 articles with 2080 patients). Benign tumors were the cause in 20% of intussusceptions (407/2180 intussusceptions based on 31 articles with 2080 patients). A malignant lead point was found in 25% of intussusceptions (591/2402 intussusceptions based on 36 studies with 2300 patients).

When comparing intussusceptions due to malignant origin based on location (Table 2), enteric intussusceptions were malignant in 9% of enteric intussusceptions (97/1047 enteric intussusceptions based on 29 studies), 46% of ileocolic intussusceptions (93/203 ileocolic intussusceptions based on 15 studies), and 68% of colocolic intussusceptions (204/298 colocolic intussusceptions based on 25 studies).

TABLE 2
List of reported malignant pathologies.

The most frequent malignant etiologies reported in our studies were adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and metastasis. Further details concerning etiologies according to location are described in Table 2. The most frequently reported benign lesions were polyps (92/332 benign lesions), lipomas (85/332), and adenomas (28/332), as depicted in Supporting Information S2.

### Clinical outcomes following bowel resection versus reduction of intussusception [^116fnzrx]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is most commonly managed with air-contrast reduction. However, when this fails, emergent operation with resection or manual reduction is indicated. It is not known if there are advantages to resection compared with manual reduction.

Methods

A retrospective review of all patients receiving operative care for intussusception from February 2000 to December 2011. Patients undergoing intestinal resection were compared with those treated with manual reduction alone.

Results

Of 111 patients, 49 underwent resection and 62 underwent manual reduction. Mean (± SD) time to oral intake favored manual reduction (2.1 ± 1.2 versus 2.6 ± 1.2 d, respectively, P = 0.05). Manual reduction was associated with a greater need for repeat imaging (47% versus 18%, P = 0.002) and the only recurrences were with manual reduction (8% versus 0%, P = 0.1). Mean duration of stay was no different (P = 0.36), nor was the need for reoperation (P = 0.9).

Conclusions

Patients undergoing manual reduction have an increased number of radiographic imaging procedures. The surgeon should have a low threshold for resection for intussusceptions requiring operative management.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding&intussusception [^113sr63U]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Relatively uncommon compared with the adult population, lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children requires expeditious evaluation and management because of the variety of causes ranging from benign to life-threatening conditions. The causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) vary with patient age. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and management of LGIB in children. Because intussusception is one of the most common sources of LGIB, particular attention will be given to its diagnosis and management.

### Intussusception: the use of delayed, repeated reduction attempts and the management of intussusceptions due to pathologic lead points in pediatric patients [^113DWk66]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The nonoperative management of intussusception continues to evolve and is the subject of ongoing debate. Our purpose was to assess our current enema reduction rate and to focus on two specific issues that have received little attention in the literature: first, the value and safety of using delayed, repeated reduction attempts and, second, the management of intussusceptions due to lead points.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of all intussusception cases seen at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, a tertiary pediatric hospital, from May 1999 to December 2002.

Results

There were 163 children with a total of 219 intussusceptions. Enema reduction was attempted in 211 (96%). Reduction rate with air enema was 90.2%. Delayed reduction attempts were used in 25 patients (15.3%) in 26 intussusceptions (12.3%) and were successful in 50% of the cases. Lead points were documented in 13 children (8%); sonography depicted the lead points in seven (53.8%) of the 13. The reduction rate of intussusceptions due to lead points was 63.6% (14/22).

Conclusion

Air enema associated with the use of delayed, repeated reduction attempts is a safe and effective approach for intussusception reduction with a high success rate. Delayed, repeated reduction attempts should be considered when the initial attempt manages to move the intussusceptum and the patient remains clinically stable. The management of intussusceptions due to lead points remains a challenge. Sonography does not depict all lead points, and the indication for other imaging studies should be tailored according to each particular patient. We recommend attempted enema reduction in all patients with lead points.

### Early discharge after nonoperative management of intussusception is both safe and cost-effective [^114obz1d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

We implemented a quality improvement (QI) initiative to safely reduce post-reduction monitoring for pediatric patients with ileocolic intussusception. We hypothesized that there would be decreased length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs, with no change in intussusception recurrence rates.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of pediatric ileocolic intussusception patients who underwent successful enema reduction at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital from January 2015 through June 2020. In September 2017, an intussusception management protocol was implemented, which allowed discharge within four hours of reduction. Pre- and post-QI outcomes were compared for index encounters and any additional encounter beginning within 24 h of discharge. An economic evaluation was performed with hospital costs inflation-adjusted to 2020 United States Dollars ($). Cost differences between groups were assessed using multivariable regression, adjusting for Medicaid and transfer status, P < 0.05 significant.

Results

Of 90 patients, 37(41%) were pre-QI and 53(59%) were post-QI. Patients were similar by age, sex, race, insurance status, and transfer status. Pre-QI patients had a median LOS of 23.4 h (IQR: 16.1–34.6) versus 9.3 h (IQR 7.4–14.2) for post-QI patients, P < 0.001. Mean total costs per patient in the pre-QI group were $3,231 (95% CI, $2,442-$4,020) versus $1,861 (95% CI, $1,481-$2,240) in the post-QI group. The mean absolute cost difference was $1,370 less per patient in the post-QI group (95% CI, [-$2,251]-[-$490]). Five patients had an additional encounter within 24 h of discharge [pre-QI: 1 (3%) versus post-QI: 4 (8%), p = 0.7] with four having intussusception recurrence [pre-QI: 1 (3%) versus post-QI: 3 (6%), p = 0.6].

Conclusions

Implementation of a quality improvement initiative for the treatment of pediatric intussusception reduced hospital length of stay and costs without negatively affecting post-discharge encounters or recurrence rates. Similar protocols can easily be adopted at other institutions.

### Air contrast enema reduction of single and recurrent ileocolic intussusceptions in children: patterns, management and outcomes [^111kTXhu]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no consensus as to when surgical intervention should be considered for recurrent ileocolic intussusceptions in a stable patient after previous successful air contrast enema.

Objective

To review the patterns of ileocolic intussusceptions, air contrast enema success rates, and pathologic lead point rates in patients with and without recurrence to evaluate whether treatment outcomes depend on the number and timing between episodes.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 683 children with air contrast enema performed for ileocolic intussusception between January 2000 and May 2018. Recurrent intussusceptions were separated into mutually exclusive categories: short-term only (≤ 7 days between episodes) and long-term (> 7 days between episodes) intussusceptions. Long-term recurrences included both long-term only and long- and short-term intussusceptions.

Results

Of the 683 patients, 606 (89%) had at least 1 successful air contrast enema. Of the 606, 115 (19%) had recurrent intussusceptions after successful reduction. The air contrast enema success rate for a single intussusception was 86% (491/568) and for recurrent intussusceptions was 96% (110/115) (P = 0.004). Single and recurrent intussusceptions had similar pathologic lead point rates (3.5% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.593). Short-term and long-term recurrences did not differ in air contrast enema success rates (96% vs. 95%). Long-term recurrences had higher pathologic lead point rate compared to short-term only (13% vs. 0%; P = 0.003). Of short-term recurrences, 99% (76/77) were ≤ 5 intussusceptions; 92% had successful air contrast enema without surgery.

Conclusion

The majority of recurrent intussusceptions were successfully treated by air contrast enema. Short-term recurrences have lower pathologic lead point rates, suggesting that a higher surgical threshold may be plausible relative to long-term recurrences. In the appropriate clinical context, repeat air contrast enemas are a safe option for short-term recurrences, which can be attempted at least five times, potentially precluding the need for surgical intervention.

### A comprehensive scoring system for the better prediction of bowel resection in pediatric intussusception [^114thuSk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this current study, we explored various variables associated with bowel loss, including clinical symptoms, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and ultrasonographic findings. Bloody stool, prolonged illness duration, fever, abdominal muscle rigidity, severe inflammation, and the location of intussusception emerged as independent predictors for bowel loss in intussusception patients. Additionally, we developed a new scoring system for bowel resection in these patients, integrating as many variables as possible. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report of a precise diagnostic benchmark that definitively predicts the need for bowel resection in pediatric intussusception cases.

Intussusception is a common cause of bowel resection in infants and young children. It is well-established that prompt identification and management are crucial for reducing the incidence of intestinal necrosis resulting from intussusception. However, a significant number of patients experience delays in diagnosis due to the rapid progression of intussusception in cases lacking classic early-stage characteristics. In this study, among the 660 patients who underwent surgery, 33.0% of those with intussusception required intestinal resection, constituting 2.7% (218/8,138) of all intussusception cases managed. Other centers in China reported a bowel resection rate of 24.1% (76/316) in patients with intussusception who underwent exploratory laparotomy. In Canada, 28% of cases involving operations required resection. Differences in basic characteristics among these reports may explain the higher proportion of intestinal loss in the latter study. For instance, I preferred and made efforts to perform air reduction, attempting it twice in some cases. Furthermore, management decisions were made by attending surgeons in various institutes with varying criteria, contributing to these disparities. More than 30% of patients in this series exhibited intussusceptum necrosis, primarily due to mesenteric entrapment, indicating that a substantial number of cases in this study were managed relatively late. It is plausible to infer that earlier intervention could have benefited these patients.

### Management of recurrent intussusception: nonoperative or operative reduction? [^116yJLuc]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine how to manage children with recurrence of intussusception.

Methods

Medical records of patients treated for intussusception from 1976 to 2008 at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health were reviewed. Information on patients who developed recurrent intussusception was extracted to study patterns of recurrent attack and suitable management procedures. The statistical differences were analyzed by the χ² and the Student t test, with a P value < .05 considered significant.

Results

During the study period, 1340 patients were treated for 1448 episodes of intussusceptions, with an average of 40 cases per year. There were 108 episodes of recurrent intussusception in 75 patients (45 males and 30 females). The overall recurrence rate was 8%. Patient age at the first episode ranged from 3 months to 12 years (average, 14.9 months). The time interval before each recurrence ranged from 1 day to 3.2 years (average, 7.8 months). The number of recurrences ranged from 1 to 5 attacks. Recurrent intussusception occurred in 35 (15.8%) of 222 children following successful hydrostatic barium enema (BE) reduction and in 55 (11.4%) of 482 after successful pneumatic or air enema (AE) reduction. There was no statistical difference between the recurrence rates after the 2 nonoperative procedures (P = .08). Recurrent intussusception developed in 14 (3.0%) of 457 patients after operative manual reduction. Recurrence was not observed after intestinal resection for initial irreducible intussusception in 175 patients. The remaining 4 recurrent episodes occurred after spontaneous reduction. Of the 108 episodes of recurrence, BE and AE reductions were successful in 25 (96.2%) of 26 attempts and in 57 (92%) of 62 attempts, respectively. Seven patients had their first episode of intussusception treated surgically. All 7 when they recurred were successfully treated with either BE or AE reduction. Operative intervention was needed in 23 episodes of recurrent intussusception; 18 were reduced manually, and 5 required intestinal resection. Overall, 7 (9.3%) of the 75 recurrences had a pathologic lead point: colonic polyps in 4 cases and Meckel diverticulum in 3 cases. There were no deaths among the 75 patients with recurrent intussusception.

Conclusions

Recurrent intussusception should be initially treated by nonoperative reduction. Laparotomy is needed in cases with failure of BE or AE reduction, in cases with suspicion of a pathologic lead point, and in selected cases with several episodes of recurrence. The treatment of recurrent intussusception, in general, should be similar to that of primary intussusception.

### Recurrence rates after intussusception enema reduction: a meta-analysis [^111jyBVC]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Reported rates of recurrence after enema reduction for intussusception are variable. Concerns for recurrence influence postreduction management. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate overall, 24-hour, and 48-hour recurrence rates after enema reduction in children.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Database, and OVID Medline were searched from 1946 through December 2011 using the search terms: intussusception, recurrence, and enema. Sixty-nine studies of patients age 0 to 18 years with radiographically proven intussusception reduced by enema that report the number of enema reductions and the number of recurrences were included. Extraction was done by the primary author (M.P.G.) with 10% of included studies independently audited to ensure concordance.

Results

Overall recurrence rates were 12.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.1%-14.4%, I2 = 28.8%) for contrast enema (CE), 7.5% (95% CI: 5.7%-9.8%, I2 = 52.4%) for ultrasound-guided noncontrast enema (UGNCE), and 8.5% (95% CI: 6.9%-10.4%, I2 = 50.1%) for fluoroscopy-guided air enema (FGAE). Recurrence rates within 24 hours were 3.9% (95% CI: 2.2%-6.7%, I2 = 47.0%) for CE, 3.9% (95% CI: 1.5%-10.1%, I2 = 0.0%) for UGNCE, and 2.2% (95% CI: 0.7%-6.5%, I2 = 59.8%) for FGAE. Recurrence rates within 48 hours were 5.4% (95% CI 3.7%-7.8%, I2 = 32.3%) for CE, 6.6% (95% CI: 4.0%-10.7%, I2 = 0.0%) for UGNCE, and 2.7% (95% CI: 1.2%-6.5%, I2 = 73.8%) for FGAE. Most included studies are retrospective and vary in quality of reporting. Few studies reported detailed patient characteristics including timing of recurrences.

Conclusions

The risk of early (within 48 hours) recurrence after enema reduction is low, suggesting outpatient management of well-appearing patients should be considered.

### Intussusception in a child with COVID-19 in the USA [^117FGTmw]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in late 2019, has resulted in a global pandemic. COVID-19 was initially believed to occur less frequently in children with relatively mild disease. However, severe disease and varied presentations have been reported in infected children, one of such being intussusception. There have only been three reported cases of intussusception in the pediatric population infected with COVID-19. In this paper, we will discuss the management and treatment of a novel fourth case of COVID-19-associated intussusception. This case is the first reported in the USA and suggests that COVID-19 may be implicated in the development of intussusception. Pediatricians should consider the possibility of intussusception when a child with COVID-19 presents with abdominal pain.

### Sedation and analgesia for reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^1168MqXo]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Ileocolic intussusception refers to the invagination of the ileum through the ileocecal valve into the cecum. With a yearly incidence of approximately 56 of 100 000, ileocolic intussusception is an important cause of acute intestinal obstruction in children younger than 6 years. If untreated, intussusception can result in tissue ischemia, potentially leading to bowel necrosis, perforation, and shock. In countries with higher resources, case fatality is less than 1%, while it may be as high as 9% in nations with fewer resources. Transabdominal ultrasonography is the diagnostic modality of choice due to its high sensitivity (98%), safety, and availability. Emergent reduction of ileocolic intussusception using air or hydrostatic enema is the standard of care to prevent complications. Reduction involves inserting a French Foley catheter into the rectum and instilling water or air under pressure into the colon. No studies have objectively quantified pain during reduction, but it is believed to be painful based on analogies with colonoscopy, where the bowel is also distended with gas and children usually require sedation. In contrast, reduction of ileocolic intussusception is usually performed on awake children without sedation or analgesia. In the United States, only 7% of children with ileocolic intussusception receive sedation during reduction. The risk of bowel perforation during reduction is less than 1%.

Although some studies report that sedation improves the success of intussusception reduction, most American and European radiologists do not support this practice. This may be due to requirements for specialized equipment, personnel skilled in airway maneuvers, or the belief that sedation may increase the risk of perforation during reduction. The management and complications of reduction of intussusception vary considerably by country, highlighting the importance of a global perspective of practice patterns to evaluate the risks of perforation during reduction and failed reduction related to sedation and analgesia. Our objective was to characterize practice patterns surrounding opioid analgesia and sedation for the reduction of ileocolic intussusception in children and to assess their association with intestinal perforation and failed reduction in an exploratory analysis.

### Adult intussusception: a six-year experience at a single center [^111X5cd1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

AI is an infrequent problem. The diagnosis of this condition can be difficult as symptoms are often non-specific and episodic. It is important to have a high index of suspicion as there is no 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Treatment usually requires resection of the involved bowel segment. Reduction can be attempted in small bowel intussusception if the segment involved is viable or malignancy is not suspected; however, a more careful approach is recommended in colonic intussusception because of a significantly higher chance of malignancy. In contrast to its pediatric counterpart, the treatment almost always is surgical.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Adult intussusception (AI) is a rare entity and differs from childhood intussusceptions in its presentation, etiology, and treatment
It requires a high index of suspicion

What the new findings are:

Small-bowel intussusceptions should be reduced before resection whenever possible if the underlying etiology is suspected to be benign or if the resection required without reduction is deemed to be massive
Large bowel should generally be resected without reduction because pathology is mostly malignant

### Opioid administration and reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^112pBBmH]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Ileocolic intussusception is the most common type of intussusception in infantsand children and is a leading cause of bowel obstruction. The mechanism involves a proximal segment of bowel invaginating into a distal segment. Nonoperative management with hydrostatic or pneumatic enema is the treatment standard. Although there is yet to be an objective quantification of children's pain and distress during reduction of intussusception, it is widely believed to be painful and distressing based on both adult and pediatric experience with colonoscopy, where the bowel is also distended with gas and sedation is routinely provided. Several national position statements have strongly emphasized the importance of adequate management of children's pain and distress during painful procedures. Unfortunately, sedation and analgesia for reduction of intussusception have traditionally been avoided by most US and European radiologists, in part due to a belief that opioid-related reduced gastrointestinal motility may reduce the rate of success for reduction of intussusception.

In the original global Pain Management and Sedation in Pediatric Ileocolic Intussusception (PAINT) study, members of our team demonstrated that neither analgesia nor sedation was associated with failed reduction or intestinal perforation. Intravenous morphine was provided to nearly 70% of patients. Intravenous fentanyl was the second most frequently administered analgesic in the PAINT study. Intranasal and intravenous fentanyl are increasingly being used in children as an alternative to intravenous morphine in acute care settings, due to their wide availability, ease of administration, tolerability, and rapidity of onset. Determining whether fentanyl is associated with failed reduction is crucial to enable clinicians to make evidence-based decisions in providing comfort to children undergoing reduction of intussusception, particularly in settings in which sedation is not feasible. With a large global sample, our primary objective was to determine whether fentanyl was associated with failed reduction of intussusception in children. Our secondary objectives were to determine whether other opioids and clinical factors were associated with failed reduction of intussusception.

### Clinical management and recommendations for children with more than four episodes of recurrent intussusception following successful reduction of each: an institutional review [^112WVYfJ]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe patterns and risk factors of multiple recurrences to optimise management for pediatric patients with more than four episodes of intussusception.

Materials and Methods

Following IRB approval, all sonographic evaluations for intussusception in patients < 18 years over a 6-year period were reviewed. Data extracted included age at onset of first intussusception, gender, presenting symptoms, symptoms upon recurrence, presence of pathological lead points, and surgical findings.

Results

During a 6-year period, five cases had four or more instances of recurrence after enema reduction attempts. All patients were male with an average age of 16 months. Two of the five cases resolved after the fourth enema reduction and no lead points were identified. Two other cases involved surgical reduction with intraoperative findings of Meckel's diverticulum and juvenile polyp. The final case had five recurrence episodes and six separate enema reductions. Ultimately, lymphoid hyperplasia was discovered on colonoscopy and the patient never recurred after being treated with steroids.

Conclusion

Given the favorable reduction rate in re-recurrent cases and complete lack of perforation observed, up to four attempts at enema reduction is recommended before considering an alternative strategy. If recurrence continues past the fourth reduction attempt, computed tomography (CT) is recommended to identify a lead point. If CT remains inconclusive, then consider exploratory laparotomy.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^115SpqEL]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Management of intestinal intussusception remains controversial with regards to conservative versus operative management, as well as choice of surgical procedure.

Methods

A systematic review on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SCOPUS/EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed. Articles published between 2004 and 2024 were collected. Case reports and case series < 20 patients were not considered.

Results

After screening of 2286 articles, 37 studies totaling 2330 patients were included. All studies were retrospective case series except for one prospective case series and one prospective and retrospective case series. There were 20% of colocolic intussusceptions, 21% of ileocolic intussusceptions, and 65% of enteric (small bowel) intussusceptions. A radiological lead point of the intussusception was described in 31% of patients. Intussusceptions were idiopathic in 39%, and caused by a pathological lead point in 58% of cases. Underlying malignancy was present 25% of cases and was more frequent in case of colocolic intussusceptions (68%), versus 9% in small bowel intussusceptions, and 46% of ileocolic intussusceptions. Operative management was performed in 49% of intussusceptions, mainly through open access (72%). Based on these findings, a comprehensive algorithm is provided to guide treatment decisions in adult patients with intussusception.

Conclusion

Data regarding surgical management of the intussusception were heterogenous and poorly reported. In case of colic intussusception, a high degree of suspicion for an underlying malignancy is warranted, and in that regard, an oncological surgical resection without reduction is recommended. Enteric intussusception should be managed according to length, clinical presentation, and interoperative findings of lead points.

### Management for intussusception in children [^114xBPPT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is a common abdominal emergency in children with significant morbidity. Prompt diagnosis and management reduces associated risks and the need for surgical intervention. Despite widespread agreement on the use of contrast enema as opposed to surgery for initial management in most cases, debate persists on the appropriate contrast medium, imaging modality, pharmacological adjuvant, and protocol for delayed repeat enema, and on the best approach for surgical management for intussusception in children.

Objectives

To assess the safety and effectiveness of non-surgical and surgical approaches in the management of intussusception in children.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to September 2016); Ovid Embase (1974 to September 2016); Science Citation Index Expanded (via Web of Science) (1900 to September 2016); and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to September 2016). We examined the reference lists of all eligible trials to identify additional studies. To locate unpublished studies, we contacted content experts, searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (September 2016), and explored proceedings from meetings of the British Association of Paedatric Surgeons (BAPS), the American Soceity of Pediatric Surgery, and the World Congress of Pediatric Surgery.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing contrast media, imaging modalities, pharmacological adjuvants, protocols for delayed repeat enema, and/or surgical approaches for the management of intussusception in children. We applied no language, publication date, or publication status restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted study selection and data extraction and assessed risk of bias using a standardised form. We resolved disagreements by consensus with a third review author when necessary. We reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis and evaluated the overall quality of evidence supporting the outcomes by using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 822 participants. Two trials compared liquid enema reduction plus glucagon versus liquid enema alone. One trial compared liquid enema plus dexamethasone versus liquid enema alone. Another trial compared air enema plus dexamethasone versus air enema alone, and two trials compared use of liquid enema versus air enema. We identified three ongoing trials. We judged all included trials to be at risk of bias owing to omissions in reported methods. We judged five of six trials as having high risk of bias in at least one domain. Therefore, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for outcomes was low. Interventions and data presentation varied greatly across trials; therefore meta-analysis was not possible for most review outcomes. Enema plus glucagon versus enema alone It is uncertain whether use of glucagon improves the rate of successful reduction of intussusception when compared with enema alone (reported in two trials, 218 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.26; low quality of evidence). No trials in this comparison reported on the number of children with bowel perforation(s) nor on the number of children with recurrent intussusception. Enema plus dexamethasone versus enema alone Use of the adjunct, dexamethasone, may be beneficial in reducing intussusception recurrence with liquid or air enema (two trials, 299 participants; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.60; low quality of evidence). This equates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 13 (95% CI 8 to 37). It is uncertain whether use of the adjunct, dexamethasone, improves the rate of successful reduction of intussusception when compared with enema alone (reported in two trials, 356 participants; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10; low quality of evidence). Air enema versus liquid enema Air enema may be more successful than liquid enema for reducing intussusception (two trials, 199 participants; RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.49; low quality of evidence). This equates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 6 (95% CI 4 to 19). No trials in this comparison reported on the number of children with bowel perforation(s) or on the number of children with recurrent intussusception nor any intraoperative complications, such as bowel perforation, or other adverse effects. Only one trial reported postoperative complications, but owing to the method of reporting used, a quantitative analysis was not possible. We identified no studies that exclusively evaluated surgical interventions for management of intussusception.

Authors' Conclusions

This review identified a small number of trials that assessed a variety of interventions. All included trials provided evidence of low quality and were subject to serious concerns about imprecision, high risk of bias, or both. Air enema may be superior to liquid enema for successfully reducing intussusception in children; however, this finding is based on a few studies including small numbers of participants. Dexamethasone as an adjuvant may be more effective in reducing intussusception recurrence rates following air enema or liquid enema, but these results are also based on a few studies of small numbers of participants. This review highlights several points that need to be addressed in future studies, including reducing the risk of bias and including relevant outcomes. Specifically, surgical trials are lacking, and future research is needed to address this evidence gap.

### Factors associated with in-hospital recurrence of intestinal intussusception in children [^116H5Etb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intussusception describes the intussusception of a segment of intestine into the lumen of a more distant segment of the bowel and is one of the most common acute abdominal disorders in infancy. Intestinal intussusception occurs most frequently at the age of 6 months, and the incidence of intussusception in China during 2009–2013 was estimated to be 112.9 per 100,000 children aged < 2 years-old. Intussusception in children is a medical emergency that necessitates timely diagnosis and treatment. The main presenting symptoms of intestinal intussusception in children under 2 years of age include vomiting, abdominal pain and blood in the stools. The diagnosis of intussusception is most often made using ultrasonography, but other useful investigations include X-ray, computed tomography and barium/air enema. Management strategies include reduction by pneumatic (air) enema, hydrostatic (liquid) enema, laparoscopic surgery and open surgery.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^114ciNzb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The clinical features of intussusception may include any one or more among sudden, intermittent abdominal pain (every 10–15 min), palpable abdominal mass, usually in the right upper quadrant, bilious vomiting, the rectal passage of mucus or blood ("currant jelly" stools), and altered mental status including irritability, crying, lethargy, apathy and/or profound listlessness. The presence of normal bowel sounds does not exclude intussusception. Less common clinical features include painless intussusception, hypovolemic shock, visible peristalsis, diarrhea or constipation, tenesmus, fever, obstruction, sepsis, syncope, and transient hypertension.

Intussusception should be treated without delay due to the risk of bowel ischemia and perforation. Intravenous hydration should be given, and surgical consultation should be performed before any attempt. Image-guided pneumatic enema is the preferred first treatment in most cases of intussusception. Hydrostatic enema can also be used for both diagnosis and treatment. Delayed repeat enema can be indicated in cases where the patient remains clinically stable, and the initial enema partially reduces the intussusception, or the intussusception is recurrent. Surgical intervention is indicated in certain cases of intussusception, including peritonitis, free air, shock, sepsis, perforation, repeat enema failure, and persistent symptomatic small-bowel obstruction. Small bowel intussusceptions are not common in children and are often associated with a spontaneous reduction. The risk of mortality following successful treatment of intussusception is low. Recurrent intussusception occurs in up to 10% of cases following enema reduction and 1% of cases following surgical reduction. Repeat enemas are reported to be safe and effective for treating recurrent intussusception if the child remains clinically stable. A recurrence is seen within 48 h in 2.5% of the patients after initial successful air enema reduction.

### Management of intussusception in the pediatric emergency department: risk factors for recurrence [^112PtHLq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The standard treatment for intussusception is air reduction enema (ARE) with inpatient observation for 24 to 48 hours to monitor for recurrence. More recent but limited observations suggest that patients who have undergone successful ARE can safely be discharged after 4 to 6 hours of observation. Our primary objective was to identify risk factors associated with early recurrence. Our secondary objectives included validating risk criteria from prior studies and identifying risk factors for ARE failures.

Design/Methods

A retrospective cohort study of children discharged from a large urban quaternary hospital with a final diagnosis of intussusception (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 560.0) or who underwent ARE from 2005 to 2015 was identified. Demographic data, radiology images, and clinical course were recorded. Repeat visits, cases with incomplete medical records, and those with incorrect diagnoses were excluded.

Results

A total of 250 cases were identified. Two hundred cases were included for analysis. Fifty were excluded. Of the 163 who had successful reduction with ARE, 22 patients (13.5%) recurred, and 12 (7.3%) recurred within 48 hours. Fever (odds ratio, 4.25; P = 0.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–17.3) and female sex (odds ratio, 7.94; P = 0.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.82–34.6) were independently associated with early recurrence. No radiologic features were associated with early recurrence.

Conclusions

Early recurrence after successful ARE was low, although more frequent in girls and in those with fever over 100.4°F. We therefore advocate for prospective studies to validate these risk criteria to identify patients who are at low risk for early recurrence and may qualify for early discharge from the emergency department.

### Intussusception… [^1177GB4U]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Signs and symptoms Children with intussusceptions suddenly develop severe abdominal pain with vomiting at frequent intervals. During the episodes of pain, they may draw their knees up to their abdomen while crying. They may appear well in between episodes of pain. If the intussusception is not treated, symptoms can worsen to include bilious vomit and bloody stool. Diagnosis A history of intermittent severe abdominal pain with vomiting and bloody diarrhea is highly suggestive of an intussusception. On physical examination, the doctor may feel a sausage-shaped mass in the area of the abdomen that corresponds to the small or large intestine. An abdominal ultrasound can confirm a case of intussusception. The doctor may see evidence of bowel telescoping on itself. On an ultrasound, this is called a target sign. Treatment Once an ileocolic intussusception is diagnosed, it should be treated as soon as possible.

Physicians often check electrolyte and hemoglobin levels in the child's blood and may give intravenous fluids. A radiological reduction of the intussusception is usually attempted first. This involves a contrast enema. Using a catheter, the doctor pushes air or contrast material into the bowel through the child's rectum. This forces the affected segment of intestine out and into a normal position. Surgery is performed when a contrast enema is unsuccessful or the doctor is concerned about damage to the intestines. Surgery may involve reducing the intussusception or removing the involved intestine. The appendix is often also removed during this operation. Prognosis Early recognition and treatment of intussusception are important to reduce the risk of damage to the intestine. Children who have had an intussusception are at higher risk of having a recurrence soon after reduction.

### Current radiological management of intussusception in children [^117QKtEF]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Intussusception is the most common abdominal emergency situation in infants and small children. There has been great progress in diagnostic and therapeutic management of intussusception. Ultrasound (US) has been shown to be the first-choice imaging technique in diagnosing intussusception for reasons of high accuracy, simultaneous exclusion of differential diagnoses, and disclosure of additional pathologies. Controversial opinions exist worldwide concerning the nonoperative treatment of intussusception in infants and children. Pneumatic reduction under fluoroscopic guidance and hydrostatic reduction under US monitoring are the preferred techniques. The aim should be a success rate of at least 90% in idiopathic intussusception. This review summarizes different types of intussusception and outlines diagnostic aspects as well as several treatment concepts.

RESULTS

Demographics and Characteristics of Sex and Age

A retrospective study was performed with a total of 726 children (782 episodes) managed for intussusception between January 2019 and December 2020. Most children came to the hospital within 24 hours of symptom onset. In all, 394 (54.27%) children were boys. The male-to-female ratio was 1.19:1. The mean age of all children was 3.86 ± 1.85 years (range, 2 months to 12 years). The majority of cases were younger than 4 years. Of them, the highest percentage occurred in children aged between 3 and 4 years (n = 332; 42.46%), and only 8.7% of children were younger than 1 year. The basic characteristics of the children are shown in Table 1.

### Practical imaging strategies for intussusception in children [^114R6BKK]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in young children. Radiology has a key role in its diagnosis and treatment. This systematic review summarizes the currently available evidence for best practices in radiologic management of pediatric intussusception. CONCLUSION. High diagnostic accuracy and lack of ionizing radiation make ultrasound (US) the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing intussusception. For intussusception reduction, fluoroscopy-guided pneumatic enema and US-guided hydrostatic enema are equally dependable and safe techniques. The areas that warrant further research in this field include the efficacy and safety of the US-guided pneumatic enema, potential benefits of sedation and general anesthesia for the reduction procedure, and the optimal management of intussusceptions potentially involving pathologic lead points.

### Intussusception [^115wSkA2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children between 3 months and 6 years. Intussusception occurs when a more proximal portion of bowel invaginates into more distal bowel. These patients often present with a wide range of non-specific symptoms, with less than one quarter presenting with the classic triad of vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody stools. Thus, the diagnosis continues to rely on clinical suspicion. This review article discusses the clinical presentation of intussusception and the state-of-the art diagnostic and treatment options, as well as a review of the pertinent literature.

### Adult intussusception: a retrospective review [^112p6EdF]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Whereas intussusception is relatively common in children, it is clinically rare in adults. The condition is usually secondary to a definable lesion. This study was designed to review adult intussusception, including presentation, diagnosis, and optimal treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of 22 cases of intussusception occurring in individuals older than aged 18 years encountered at two university-affiliated hospitals in Winnipeg between 1989 and 2000. The 22 cases were divided to benign and malignant enteric, ileocolic, colonic lesions respectively. The diagnosis and treatment of each case were reviewed.

Results

There were 22 cases of adult intussusception. Mean age was 57.1 years. Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were the commonest symptoms. There were 14 enteric, 2 ileocolic, and 6 colonic intussusceptions. Eighty-six percent of adult intussusception was associated with a definable lesion. Twenty-nine percent of enteric lesions were malignant. All ileocolic lesions were malignant. Of colonic lesions, 33 percent were malignant and 67 percent were benign. All cases required surgical interventions except one.

Conclusions

Adult intussusception is a rare entity and requires a high index of suspicion. Our review supports that small-bowel intussusception should be reduced before resection if the underlying etiology is suspected to be benign or if the resection required without reduction is deemed to be massive. Large bowel should generally be resected without reduction because pathology is mostly malignant.

### The role of glucocorticoids in recurrent idiopathic intussusception: a retrospective cohort study [^1118uUPk]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Our center is a tertiary pediatric specialty hospital that performs over 1,000 air enemas annually for the management of intussusception, with a reduction success rate as high as 97.8%. Thus, the sample size of recurrent intussusception cases is considerable. However, to the best of our knowledge, studies investigating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the prevention of intussusception recurrence are scarce, and high-quality evidence supporting a unified protocol remains lacking. Notably, clinical practice varies among on-duty surgeons at our center, especially concerning the type of glucocorticoid administered. However, it is worthwhile acknowledging that the treatment durations and dosages were similar. Therefore, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to explore the role of glucocorticoids in children with recurrent idiopathic intussusception, laying the foundation for randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the management of intussusception.

TABLE 2
Size Comparisons of Single Intussusceptions

There were 51 episodes of multiple intussusceptions, and the number of intussusceptions was 105 in total. For successful reduction, the mean diameter of single intussusception was 22.45 ± 7.15 mm and that of multiple intussusceptions was 20.60 ± 4.96 mm. There was a significant difference between them (P = 0.002). The mean length of single intussusception was 33.41 ± 11.95 mm and that of multiple intussusceptions was 32.12 ± 10.17 mm. There was no significant difference between them (P = 0.467).

Recurrent Intussusception and Surgery

Fifty-three (7.53%) children, with 117 (14.96%) episodes, had recurrent intussusception, and all of them were following successful reduction enemas. The age of 53 patients at the first intussusception ranged from 10 months to 8 years (median, 33.06 ± 17.86 months), and the interval between attacks ranged 1 day to 21 months. Thirty-one (3.40%) episodes were found to have spontaneously reduced. Five patients (0.7%) underwent surgery after the failure of an air enema or B-USGHE. There was neither perforation nor mortality (Table 1).

### Presentation, aetiology and treatment of adult intussusception in a tertiary sub-saharan hospital: a 10-year retrospective study [^113QjyTe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is the invagination of a segment of the intestine into the lumen of another immediately adjacent segment. This is usually in a proximal-to-distal fashion. Adult intussusception (AI) is relatively uncommon, constituting less than 5 percent of intussusception cases. In high-income countries, there is an incidence of two to three per 1,000,000 per year representing 1 to 3 percent of all cases of intestinal obstructions. It is estimated that only 5% of all intussusceptions occur in adults and approximately 5% of bowel obstructions in adults are the result of intussusception. There is a demonstrable cause in the majority of cases, usually an intraluminal neoplasm. Previous studies point to a 70 to 90 percent existence of an underlying gut pathological cause. These are mainly polyps and colonic malignancies. In contrast, childhood intussusception is a leading cause of intestinal obstruction.

### Adult intussusception: a retrospective review [^113WKcQo]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We reviewed the diagnosis and treatment of 44 adult intussusception patients. Historically, investigators have suggested that it is difficult to diagnose intussusception in adults because it is a subacute disease with nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms. However, current technology allows an easy diagnosis via US, CT, or endoscopy. In addition, the preoperative and intraoperative reduction of intussusception will likely become a standard approach because it offers greater benefits than traditional methods.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^112GunVK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

The flowchart (Fig. 1) for the management of pediatric intussusception was performed in our hospital for 3 years. This retrospective study reviewed data of younger than 12 years from our hospital database who were diagnosed with intussusception and managed with cleansing enemas, air enemas, or B-ultrasound–guided hydrostatic enemas (B-USGHE) from January 2019 to December 2020. Children who were given a detailed B-ultrasound description of the ultrasound parameters of intussusception were categorized into 4 groups based on the reduction methods. The data extracted included demographic data (sex, age, date of onset, and date of birth), size of intussusception (transverse diameter and longitudinal length of the involved segment), treatment method, and effects. The diagnosis of intussusception was determined by high-frequency ultrasound, with a descriptive report given in our hospital that included transverse diameter, length of involved segment, number and location of the intussusception, but these data may lack in other hospitals. Single intussusception means that only 1 intussusception was found by B-ultrasound. Multiple intussusceptions refer to the discovery of more than 2 intussusceptions at a time. Recurrent intussusception refers to children with repeated attacks within an uncertain time, and age statistics were evaluated according to the time of first attack. Children with peritonitis and ileus and delayed symptoms for more than 48 hours were prohibited from undergoing any enema treatment.

### Conservative operative management of intussusception of the appendix… [^112b8WZv]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Intussusception of the appendix is uncommon. When identified at the time of operation, reduction of the intussusception and appendectomy should be performed, if technically possible. Report of a Case. — A 71-year-old man was hospitalized because of anemia and guaiacpositive stools. Barium enema examination revealed a small filling defect in the cecum, possibly carcinoma. At the time of operation, the distal appendix was intussuscepted into the proximal appendix and cecum. The intussusception was released by sharp dissection of adhesions on the appendiceal surface and an appendectomy was performed. The midappendix contained a cystic mass diagnosed as mucocele. Comment. — Appendiceal intussusception is more common in children, but has occurred in patients aged from 10 months to 85 years.

Although the appendix may be normal, intraluminal abnormalities, such as foreign bodies, fecaliths, and parasitic worms, have been described, as well as such intramural lesions as mucoceles, malignant neoplasms, endometrial.

### Prospective surveillance for intussusception in Indian children aged under two years at nineteen tertiary care hospitals [^114J3fLt]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

From the limited period of post-RVV (Rotavac™) introduction at four sites (from three states), no increase in the intussusception case load and case rate per 1000 paediatric surgery admission were observed. Intussusception within 1–21 days was observed mostly after the third RVV dose, which also overlaps with the age of natural occurrence. Under the NIP, RVV is given at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age and allowed before 12 months of age. A delay in RVV administration may coincide with the high case load age of natural intussusception (4–7 months age), which may make the interpretation of association with the vaccine difficult. In routine practice, documentation of vaccine exposure should improve and appropriate guidance to parents be given regarding the subsequent RVV vaccination. Monitoring of intussusception risk is recommended for countries as part of the RVV introduction program. In the absence of any specific population denominator for tertiary care hospitals, estimation of incidence in Indian context is difficult. The intussusception case rate per 1000 paediatric surgery admissions may be a proxy indicator for monitoring and comparison across the sites and regions with RVV introduction.

Early suspicion, case detection and referral to appropriate hospital are critical for minimizing the surgical interventions and favourable outcomes. Efforts are needed to equip and enable the public health facilities for non-surgical management in children, though this depends on the timing of the presentation to hospital.

The epidemiology, clinical presentation and management of intussusception in children across the regions may serve as baseline for future studies. The regional representation and mix of private- and public-sector hospitals were the advantages for this surveillance.

This study had some limitations. In absence of definite catchment population and referral pattern, population-based incidence or case rate estimation was not possible. The etiologies and risk factors for intussusception were not studied.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^111FEGRh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Pediatric intussusception in our region showed a sex ratio difference and age difference of onset. More and more intussusception in children with abdominal pain might be found by B-ultrasound examination. Not all pediatric intussusceptions must be reduced by air enema or B-USGHE. For single and multiple intussusceptions, the successful reduction rate of cleansing enemas with warm saline meant that some children may avoid radiation exposure and unnecessary suffering. The diameter and length of intussusception were related factors influencing successful reduction in the cleansing enema. There might be no statistically significant differences in the successful reduction between air enemas and B-USGHE. The length was not the factor affecting the success rate in the air enema and B-USGHE. Whether the diameter is a factor affecting intussusception reduction needs to be confirmed by a further prospective study. Most recurrent intussusceptions can still be reduced by nonoperative methods. This study was limited by the nature of retrospective studies and the single-center design.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^114tF6L9]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The present study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. Existing data is heterogeneous and derived from retrospective studies with inherent limitations. Although the level of evidence supporting the suggested treatment algorithm is low, it intends to serve as a general guide in day‐to‐day practice but should be adapted to the clinical scenario of every patient. There is a risk of selection bias as most of the included series were surgical or radiological cohorts, causing disparities in collected data and making comparison of these studies difficult. The majority of the patients in these studies had undergone surgery, inducing a potential selection bias with possible overestimation of malignancy rates. In that sense, this review might also be impacted by a publication bias: patients treated conservatively were less likely to be published in surgical series, whereas the opposite is true in radiological series. Furthermore, the lack of data on the success and timing of conservative treatment approaches hindered a more in‐depth analysis of different management strategies. Another potential selection bias may be related to the minimum requirement of 20 patients for study eligibility for this systematic review. The aim was to include more robust data, therefore excluding case reports and small case series that constitute most of the literature on this rare clinical entity. Moreover, the quality of data remains suboptimal, as all included studies were retrospective case series with highly heterogeneous data. Despite achieving a median score of 9/10 on the JBI critical appraisal tool for case series studies, the variability in the data impeded conducting a meta‐analysis of outcomes. However, the present study incorporates a comprehensive review of existing literature and presents succinctly the best published evidence to date. Prospective multicenter trials are required to refine management strategies, together with surgical studies providing in‐depth description of surgical management and related outcomes. In addition, the suggested pragmatic algorithm proposes standardized management to help clinicians with guidance of this rare pathology in their daily practice.

### Adult intussusception: a retrospective review [^1163Cikb]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is common in children but rare in adults. The goal of this study was to review retrospectively the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of intussusception in adults.

Methods

From 1997 to 2013, we experienced 44 patients of intussusception in patients older than 18 years. The patients were divided into enteric, ileocolic, ileocecal, and colocolonic (rectal) types. The diagnosis and treatment of these patients were reviewed.

Results

Of the 44 patients of adult intussusception, 42 were diagnosed with abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography. There were 12 patients of enteric intussusception, six patients of ileocolic intussusception, 16 patients of ileocecal type intussusception, and 10 patients of colonic (rectal) intussusception. Among them, 77.3% were associated with a tumor. Among 12 patients of enteric intussusception, three were associated with a metastatic intestinal tumor, and one was associated with a benign tumor. Among six patients of ileocolic intussusception, two patients were associated with malignant disease. Also, 93.8% of ileocecal intussusceptions were associated with tumors, 80.0% of which were malignant. Similarly, 90.0% of colonic intussusceptions were associated with malignant tumors. Intussusception was reduced before or during surgery in 28 patients. Surgery was performed in 41 patients, and laparoscopy-assisted surgery was performed for ab underlying disease in 12 patients.

Conclusions

Preoperative diagnoses were possible in almost all patients. Reduction greatly benefited any surgery required and the extent of the resection regardless of the underlying disease and surgical site.

### Delay of ileocolic intussusception reduction is safe and may confer benefit [^112CCc2B]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of ileocolic intussusception has evolved through the years. This retrospective observational study examined the relationship of time to initial reduction on outcomes and the implementation of a guideline standardizing selective, delayed repeat imaging and fluoroscopic reduction.

Materials and Methods

All ileocolic intussusception encounters 5 y prior to and 21 mo after practice guideline implementation (June 2022) were identified. Outcomes included spontaneous reduction, need for surgery, type of surgery (laparoscopy versus laparotomy), need for bowel resection, 30-d emergency department visits, 30-d readmission rate, and administration of intravenous pain medication (a guideline compliance metric).

Results

Among 243 included encounters (181 preguideline and 50 postguideline implementation), 164 patients had an initially successful fluoroscopic reduction. Twenty-two patients had a partially successful initial reduction (18 preguideline and 4 postguideline). Neither delay of initial ileocolic reduction attempt nor guideline implementation for selective repeat reduction attempt was associated with need for operation, need for resection, 30-d emergency department visits nor 30-d readmission rate. More patients received intravenous pain medication postguideline.

Conclusions

Neither increased time to initial fluoroscopic reduction of ileocolic intussusception nor guideline implementation for selective repeat delayed reduction attempt are associated with poor patient outcomes and may confer benefit as it allows for spontaneous reduction. The need for surgical intervention among patients with initial partial fluoroscopic reduction of intussusception can frequently be obviated using delayed repeat ultrasound and repeat fluoroscopic reduction attempts.

### Incidence of recurrent intussusception in young children: a nationwide readmissions analysis [^114etPYb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Recurrent intussusception following successful nonoperative reduction has previously been reported with a frequency of 8%-12% based on data from individual institutions. Meanwhile, the timing of discharge after successful reduction continues to be debated. Here, we evaluate readmissions for recurrent intussusception in young children using a large-scale national database.

Methods

The National Readmissions Database (2010–2014) was queried to identify young children (age < 5 years) diagnosed with intussusception. We compared procedures performed during the index admission and frequency of readmissions for recurrent intussusception. Results were weighted for national estimates.

Results

We identified 8289 children diagnosed with intussusception during an index admission. These patients received definitive treatment with nonoperative reduction alone (43%), surgical reduction (42%), or bowel resection (15%). Readmission for recurrent intussusception was required for 3.7% of patients managed with nonoperative reduction alone, 2.3% of patients that underwent surgical reduction, and 0% of those that underwent bowel resection. Median time to readmission was 4 days after nonoperative reduction, and only 1.5% of these patients experienced recurrence within 48 h of discharge.

Conclusions

Recurrent intussusception may be substantially less common than previously reported. Our findings support the practice of discharge shortly after successful nonoperative reduction.

Type Of Study

Retrospective, prognosis study.

### Management of the child after enema-reduced intussusception: hospital or home? [^116ykEk5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Standard practice has been to admit children for an observation period after enema-reduced intussusception. However, the utility of such routine practice has not been clearly justified.

Study Objectives

The main objective was to determine the rate and timing of recurrent intussusception after successful enema reduction and describe any associated complications.

Methods

The study was a retrospective chart review identifying children with enema-reduced intussusception during a 7-year period from 2002 through 2008. Subjects were children ages 0 to 17 years presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary care, free-standing children's hospital with confirmed and uncomplicated enema-reduced intussusception.

Results

During the study period there were 98 children with successful enema reduction of intussusception. There were 10 episodes of recurrence in 7 patients, for an overall recurrence rate of 7.1%. Three patients had two recurrences each, and the remainder had single recurrences. Two patients had early recurrences (< 48 h) at 3 and 5 h, for an early recurrence rate of 2.0%. The late recurrence rate (> 48 h) was 5.1%. No adverse events were noted in any of the recurrences.

Conclusions

Given the low early recurrence rate for enema-reduced intussusception and the minimal risk of adverse outcomes, ED observation for a 6-h period seems to be a safe alternative to inpatient management. These results support previous work and suggest that these patients can be managed on an outpatient basis.

### Adult intussusception: a six-year experience at a single center [^112LMP2G]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Adult intussusception (AI) is a rare entity and differs from childhood intussusception in its presentation, etiology, and treatment. It accounts for 1/30,000 of all hospital admissions, 1/1300 of all abdominal operations, 1/30–1/100 of all cases operated for intestinal obstruction and one case of AI for every 20 childhood ones. This study was designed to review the mode of presentation, diagnosis and appropriate treatment and finally the etiology of cases presenting in our hospital over a period of 6 years.

Methods

A retrospective review of 15 cases of intussusceptions in individuals older than 18 years presenting to a tertiary referral center of South India during a period of 6 years (2004–2010) was done in respect to mode of presentation, diagnosis, etiology and treatment.

Results

There were 15 cases of AI. Mean age was 45.5 years. Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting were the commonest symptoms. There were 8 enteric, 6 ileocolic, and 1 colonic intussusceptions. 73% of AIs were associated with a definable lesion. Only 1 case of enteric lesions had malignancy. All ileocolic lesions were malignant. Twelve of 15 patients underwent surgical intervention.

Conclusion

AI is a rare entity and requires a high index of suspicion. Small-bowel intussusception should be reduced before resection whenever possible if the underlying etiology is suspected to be benign or if the resection required without reduction is deemed to be massive. Large bowel should generally be resected without reduction because pathology is mostly malignant.

### Ileocolonic intussusception presenting as chronic diarrhea in an elderly woman [^1135g9W5]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Chronic intussusception without clinically evident intestinal obstruction is an uncommon endoscopic finding in adults. The diagnosis of intussusception is commonly missed or delayed only to be established intraoperatively through direct visualization.

The primary treatment option is an intraoperative reduction of the intussuscepted loop and surgical resection of the bowel segment with a lead point. This approach differs from management in children, where pneumatic or hydrostatic reduction is the preferred choice.

Recognition of endoscopic features of intussusception is crucial for expedited management. Early surgical intervention is important for good outcomes. Attempts to reduce the intussuscepted segments may cause adverse events like perforation and should be avoided.

### Adult intussusception: diagnosis and clinical relevance [^1174KRZi]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Intussusception is relatively rare in the adult population and differs substantially from pediatric intussusception. Most adult intussusceptions identified at surgery are caused by a definable structural lesion, a substantial proportion of which are malignant, particularly in the colon. Small bowel intussusceptions, however, have a lower prevalence of malignancy. Diagnosis of adult intussusception can be made reliably with noninvasive imaging techniques. CT is now widely regarded as the modality of choice for diagnosing intussusception in adults, but ultrasound and MR imaging have also been used effectively. Determination of the presence of a malignant lead point remains problematic because an edematous or hemorrhagic intussuscipiens may mimic a mass on each modality. Markers for bowel viability have been described but are not precise. Treatment of the persistent symptomatic intussusception in which neoplasia is suspected is surgical, and preoperative reduction is contraindicated. Transient relatively asymptomatic enteric intussusceptions discovered by imaging may not require intervention.

### Reduction of intussusception: defining a better index of successful non-operative treatment [^113LQCSA]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The reported non-operative reduction rate for intussusception is usually the proportion of attempted non-operative (radiological) reductions that succeed, which we term the "selective reduction rate". This value shows wide variation that may result from selection bias that is difficult to quantify because data regarding primary operative treatment are frequently lacking. The proportion of patients with late clinical presentation or pathological lead points can also distort the apparent efficacy of non-operative treatment. We found no definitions of outcome measures in the literature or practice guidelines to inform analysis. Based on analysis of our own audit data we derived a "composite reduction rate" from first principles that can account for variations in radiological and surgical treatment thresholds that might bias other measures of successful non-operative treatment. This index is the proportion of intussusceptions not requiring resection that are successfully reduced non-operatively. We propose that the composite reduction rate be used as a key component of standardised multidisciplinary outcome reporting for intussusception rather than the selective reduction rate. The reduced bias and confounding would allow fairer comparisons and lead to better outcome standards.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^114826ry]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

What is the association between the diameter, length of intussusception and the successful reduction rate? Ultrasound has a high sensitivity of 95% to 100% and specificity of 78% to 100%. Spontaneous reduction of intussusception, which is usually limited to the small bowel, has been frequently found by high-frequency ultrasound. Ultrasound plays an important role in the management of intussusception. In the current data, the diameter and length were the factors affecting the success rate in the cleansing enema. One-way ANOVA showed that the diameter and length were not significant differences between spontaneous reduction, B-USGHE and cleansing enemas. So, the hydrostatic pressure were the factors affecting the success rate between B-USGHE and cleansing enemas. Intussusception with a diameter of approximately 20 mm was more easily reduced spontaneously. The cleansing enema was effective because the warm normal saline (35–40°C) used for it may play an important role, except for hydrostatic pressure, which helped intussusception to reduce spontaneously by relieving spasm of the intestinal smooth muscle. Therefore, cleansing enemas might exert therapeutic effects in both single and multiple intussusceptions. Some multiple intussusceptions might become single intussusceptions after cleansing enema in practice and then be reduced by air or B-USGHE. Length was not the factor affecting the success rate in the air enema and B-USGHE groups. Diameter was the factor affecting the success rate in the B-USGHE groups, but not in air enema. Although the mean diameter and length of intussusception in air enemas were larger than that in the B-USGHE, there may be a deviation because of the nature of the retrospective studies. A further prospective study is needed to confirm the observation and improve the evidence.

### Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on pediatric intestinal intussusception in the United States [^115KPd1C]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Masking and social distancing to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus curbed the spread of other viruses. Given a potential link between viral illnesses and ileocolic intussusception, the purpose of this study is to characterize trends in incidence, diagnosis and management of pediatric intussusception in the United States in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Materials and Methods

This cross-sectional retrospective study used the Pediatric Hospital Information System and included children (ages 0–17 years) with a primary diagnosis of intussusception (ICD-10 [International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision]: K56.1) from January 2018 to December 2021. Descriptive statistics and chi-square analyses were used to characterize and compare proportions pre-COVID (2018 and 2019) to 2020 and 2021.

Results

Eight thousand one hundred forty-three encounters met inclusion criteria. Intussusception diagnoses declined in 2020 (n = 1,480) compared to 2019 (n = 2,321) and 2018 (n = 2,171) but returned to pre-COVID levels in 2021 (n = 2,171). Patient age was similar across years (mean age in years: 2018: 2.3; 2019: 2.1; 2020: 2.3; 2021: 2.3). There was no significant change in the proportion of patients who underwent imaging in 2020 (96% [1,415/1,480]) compared to the other years in the study (2018: 96% [2,093/2,171], P = 0.21; 2019: 97% [2,253/2,321], P = 0.80; 2021: 96% [1,415/1,480], P = 0.85). There was a statistically significant but minimal increase in the proportion of cases treated with surgery in 2020 compared to 2019 (2020: 17.8% vs. 2019: 15%, P = 0.02); however, this was not replicated in the pairwise comparison of 2020 to 2018 (2020: 17.8% vs. 2018: 16.4%, P = 0.23). There was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of cases treated with surgery in 2020 compared to 2021 (2020: 17.8% vs. 2021: 14%, P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Pediatric intussusception diagnoses decreased at a national level in 2020 compared to previous years, with a rebound increase in 2021. This may reflect a secondary benefit of public health interventions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.

### A comprehensive scoring system for the better prediction of bowel resection in pediatric intussusception [^1141JbsL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The present research exhibits several potential limitations that necessitate consideration when attempting to generalize the current findings. Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge the retrospective nature of this study, which inherently carries a risk of selection bias due to the data collection methodology. Furthermore, the study's extended duration may have introduced management bias, potentially leading to confounding factors. Additionally, variations in protocols regarding surgical intervention decision-making, which were based on individual surgeon experience rather than randomization, may have influenced the results. Consequently, it is crucial not to haphazardly interpret the current data as a definitive justification for aggressive surgical interventions. To establish a more robust foundation, future multicenter prospective clinical trials with standardized criteria for bowel resection should be conducted to verify the optimal timing of interventions.

### Management of adult intussusception – A case series experience from a tertiary center [^1141iJEw]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of intussusception is controversial. Clinical presentation, with the aid of imaging modalities, enables a better selection of patients for the appropriate treatment algorithm. Conservative management versus surgical intervention with bowel resection is considered accordingly.

Methods

Retrospective review of a computerized database of patients who were admitted with intussusception between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020, in a single tertiary center in Israel. Patients who were treated conservatively were compared to those who underwent surgery. Patients who underwent bowel resection were compared to those that had surgery without a resection.

Results

A total of 76 patients were diagnosed with intussusception, and 49 were operated. Bowel resection was performed in 32 cases. 20/76(26%) were successfully managed conservatively. Patients with a lead point (OR = 5.59) and colonic involvement (OR = 13.72) had a higher likelihood for resection. The likelihood of bowel resection was found to be significantly lower with proximal small bowel intussusception (OR = 0.071).

Conclusion

Young patients presenting with intussusception may be treated conservatively when adequate criteria are met in order to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions.

### Ileocolic intussusception – A rare cause of acute intestinal obstruction in adults; case report and literature review [^117U8sXZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Colonic Intussusception although common in children, is a rare cause of acute intestinal obstruction in adults. The etiology, clinical presentation and management of this condition is different in adults as compared to children. Pre-operative diagnosis is usually difficult due to the non specific and intermittent nature of the symptoms. CT scan can be a helpful adjunct in establishing the diagnosis. We present a case report of adult ileocolic intussusception with classical radiological signs and operative findings. A brief literature review is also presented with emphasis on the controversy of reduction of the intussusception before resection.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^113ayuy5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The mean diameter of single intussusception was larger than that of multiple intussusceptions. This means that multiple intussusceptions may be mainly small intussusceptions. Park et alreported that the mean diameter was 16.8 ± 5.2 mm with small bowel intussusception and 27.4 ± 4.3 mm with ileocolic intussusception. Demirel et alreported that the mean length of spontaneously reduced intussusception was 23 ± 3.02 mm, and the median length of successful hydrostatic reduced intussusception was 45 mm (range, 27–160 mm). Rajagopal et alreported that the mean diameter of intussusception requiring surgical reduction was 33 mm (range, 29–54 mm), and the length was 56 mm (range, 23–78 mm). The mean diameter of transient small bowel intussusception was 12 mm (range, 8–23 mm), and the length was 22.5 mm (range, 18–45 mm). The assessment of the intussusception size by B-ultrasound examination may be useful in the management of intussusception.

There is not much evidence to support that air enemas may be more effective than hydrostatic enemas for reducing intussusception in children. The greatest advantage of B-USGHE is that it does not involve radiation exposure in children; therefore, reduction can be attempted repeatedly and patiently. The successful reduction rate is determined by local management patterns, selection criteria, and the skill of operators. In the current data, only 5 (0.7%) children underwent emergency surgery after failed reduction, and we did not determine how many children underwent surgery due to underlying causes in a later period of time by follow-up.

### Intussusception in traditional pediatric, nontraditional pediatric, and adult patients [^1147G72P]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

We sought to determine the rate of intussusception in 3 age groups (traditional pediatric-age [T], nontraditional pediatric-age [N], and adult-age [A]) and to compare group characteristics.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective records review for patients discharged with diagnosis of intussusception between October 1999 and June 2008.

Results

Ninety-five cases of intussusception were diagnosed as follows: 61 T (64%), 12 N (13%), and 22 A (23%). Bloody stool was more common in T patients (P = .016). Air contrast enema (36%) and ultrasound (33%) were the most common diagnostic tests in T, whereas computed tomography was most common in N (83%) and A (68%) patients. Bowel resection occurred more often in older (T) patients (P = .001). The most frequent causative pathologic conditions were adenitis (T), Peutz-Jeghers polyp (N), and carcinoma (A) and prior gastric bypass in 10 A patients.

Conclusions

The incidence of intussusception is substantially higher in nontraditional age groups than previously reported. Symptoms, management strategies, and causative pathologic conditions varied with age. All adults with intussusception require definitive diagnostic testing to determine the cause, given the concerning list of possibilities we observed.

### Adult intussusception: presentation, management, and outcomes of 148 patients [^113T1AK9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is a predominantly pediatric diagnosis that is not well characterized among adults. Undiagnosed cases can result in significant morbidity, making early recognition important for clinicians.

Study Objectives

We describe the presentation, clinical management, disposition, and outcome of adult patients diagnosed with intussusception during a 13-year period.

Methods

A retrospective study of consecutive adult patients diagnosed with intussusception at a tertiary academic center was carried out from 1996 to 2008. Cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9(th) Revision codes and a document search engine. Data were abstracted in duplicate by two independent authors.

Results

Among 148 patients included in the study, the most common symptoms at presentation were abdominal pain (72%), nausea (49%), and vomiting (36%). Twenty percent were asymptomatic. Sixty percent of cases had an identifiable lead point. Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) (31%) had higher rates of abdominal pain (relative risk [RR] 5.7) and vomiting (RR 3.4), and were more likely to undergo surgical intervention (RR 1.8) than patients diagnosed elsewhere. There were 77 patients who underwent surgery within 1 month; patients presenting with abdominal pain (RR 2.2), nausea (RR 1.7), vomiting (RR 1.4), and bloody stool (RR 1.9) were more likely to undergo surgery.

Conclusions

Adult intussusception commonly presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting; however, approximately 20% of cases are asymptomatic and seem to be diagnosed by incidental radiologic findings. Patients presenting to an ED with intussusception due to a mass as a lead point or in an ileocolonic location are likely to undergo surgical intervention.

### Management of intussusception in children: a systematic review [^1128tfEX]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of this systematic review by the American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence-Based Practice Committee was to develop recommendations for the management of ileocolic intussusception in children.

Methods

The ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases were queried for literature from January 1988 through December 2018. Search terms were designed to address the following topics in intussusception: prophylactic antibiotic use, repeated enema reductions, outpatient management, and use of minimally invasive techniques for children with intussusception. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Consensus recommendations were derived based on the best available evidence.

Results

A total of 83 articles were analyzed and included for review. Prophylactic antibiotic use does not decrease complications after radiologic reduction. Repeated enema reductions may be attempted when clinically appropriate. Patients can be safely observed in the emergency department following enema reduction of ileocolic intussusception, avoiding hospital admission. Laparoscopic reduction is often successful.

Conclusions

Regarding intussusception in hemodynamically stable children without critical illness, pre-reduction antibiotics are unnecessary, non-operative outpatient management should be maximized, and minimally invasive techniques may be used to avoid laparotomy.

Rectal intussusception — operative management may be considered after failed nonoperative treatments. Repair of rectal intussusception may be considered in patients with severe obstructed defecation in whom nonoperative treatments were unsuccessful. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence. Outcomes include a Delorme series of 100 patients with improved Cleveland Clinic Constipation and ODS scores at 6 months compared to baseline (18.9 to 5 and 18.5 to 5, respectively; p < 0.0001) and a recurrence rate of 6%; early studies of ventral rectopexy report improvement in constipation in 80% to 95% of patients with a 5% recurrence rate; and a retrospective series of 40 patients undergoing ventral mesh rectopexy without sigmoid resection showed 65% cured and another 33% improved with a mean follow-up of 38 months.

### Intussusception. part 2: an update on the evolution of management [^113yzNgs]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Children with symptomatic ileocolic or ileo-ileocolic intussusceptions can be successfully managed in one of a number of different ways. The nonoperative enema reduction technique has major advantages over surgical reduction and high success rates can be achieved using pneumatic or hydrostatic reduction techniques under fluoroscopic or sonographic guidance. This article highlights current concepts and some controversial issues related to management of intussusception, including patient selection for attempted enema reduction, the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, complications, the value of delayed, repeated reduction attempts, the role of imaging after attempted enema reduction, and recurrence of intussusception.

### Comparative outcome analysis of the management of pediatric intussusception with or without surgical admission [^1119mExM]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy persists about the need to admit patients after successful reduction of intussusception. Our hypothesis is that pediatric intussusception can be managed with discharge from the emergency department (ED) after reduction without increasing morbidity, yielding significant cost savings.

Methods

A chart review over 10 years was performed at two Canadian institutions. Data abstracted included: demographics, length of stay (LOS), initial and recurrence management. Primary outcome was early recurrence and resultant management, including LOS and need for operative intervention. Costs were calculated using hospital-specific data.

Results

584 patient records were assessed: 329 patients were managed with admission after reduction, 239 as outpatients. In the admission group, 28 patients had at least one recurrence (8.5%), with 8 after discharge. In the outpatient group, 21 patients had at least one recurrence (8.8%), with 19 after discharge. The difference post-discharge was significant (p = 0.004). Outcomes of recurrence did not differ, with 2 patients in each group requiring operative intervention. Average LOS in the admission group was 90 h, with additional average cost of $1771 per non-operated patient.

Conclusions

Pediatric intussusception can be safely managed as an outpatient with reliable follow up. Discharge from the ED reduces hospital charges without increasing morbidity. This approach should be considered in managing patients with intussusception.

### Laparoscopic treatment of intussusception in children: a systematic review [^116Gkmzv]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intussusception is one of the most common causes of small bowel obstruction in children. In the event of failed radiological reduction, laparotomy remains the treatment of choice. There is still no agreement in pediatric surgery about safety and effectiveness of the use of minimally invasive surgery in this common pediatric condition. By reviewing available data we aimed to establish whether laparoscopy should be the primary technique in the surgical reduction of intussusception.

Methods

A systematic review of all publications on the laparoscopic treatment of pediatric intussusception from January 1990 to April 2012 was performed. The following variables were analyzed: age, laparoscopic success rate, reason for conversion, enterotomy rate, operative time, complications, and length of stay (LOS).

Results

Ten retrospective studies treating 276 cases of laparoscopically reduced intussusception were identified. A total of 80 conversions corresponded to a 71.0% laparoscopic success rate. Only one case of intraoperative iatrogenic intestinal perforation was reported (0.4%). Postoperative complications occurred in 8 patients (2.9%), and adhesive small bowel obstruction was reported in 1 case (0.4%). Recurrence rate after laparoscopy was 3.6%. Three of 10 papers compared results between laparoscopic and open reduction of intussusception showing a shorter mean LOS in the former group (4.0 vs. 7.1 days, p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Laparoscopy is safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric intussusception. Tertiary centers with adequate minimally invasive skills should establish laparoscopy as the primary surgical technique in the treatment of this condition.

### Total ileocolic intussusception with rectal prolapse presenting in an adult: a case report and review of the literature [^11524TjU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Intussusception is an uncommon etiology of bowel obstruction in adults and can be attributed to benign and malignant pathologies. Despite advancements in diagnostic accuracy, a high index of suspicion and clinical acumen is required for timely diagnosis and therapy of this condition in adults. Total ileocolic intussusception with rectal prolapse, found at the end of the adult intussusception spectrum, may be predisposed by an embryological variant lacking zygosis. For the acute care surgeon who may encounter this rare surgical emergency, the diagnosis should be considered in the differential of a prolapsing rectal mass and be expeditiously managed to optimize patient outcomes. Assessing for the absence of zygosis should be an adjunct to the operative procedure as well.

### Management of gangrenous intussusception in infants… [^112xdk5H]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

DISCUSSION continues at the present time as to the best means of dealing with the young child who has an irreducible or gangrenous segment of ileum or cecum resulting from intussusception. Three methods are employed and are still debated: primary resection and anastomosis; two-stage resection and anastomosis, and lateral anastomosis leaving the intussusception in situ. Primary resection and anastomosis is obviously the ideal method of treatment if it can be performed safely, but before accepting it as the routine treatment it is advisable to consider the problem in two ways:

1. The local hazard: the technical difficulties and risks involved in anastomosing the bowel immediately after excision of the infarcted or gangrenous segment.
2. The general hazard: the state of illness of the child. The first danger is not insuperable. The literature contains several accounts of single cases in which primary resection and anastomosis has succeeded BENTLEY FH.

1 Introduction

Intussusception is defined as the telescoping or invagination of one segment of the gastrointestinal tract into an adjacent segment. This condition can lead to various complications, such as bowel obstruction, ischemia, and even perforation. It is most commonly observed in children, where it is typically primary and benign, often resolving with nonoperative reduction using a water‐soluble contrast enema. In contrast, intussusception is rare in adults, accounting for approximately 5% of all cases of intussusception and accounting for approximately 1%–5% of intestinal obstructions. Pediatric intussusception is characterized by the classic triad of abdominal pain, a palpable mass, and 'red currant jelly' stool, although this triad is present in only a minority of cases. In adults, diagnosis is more challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, which can be acute or chronic and often require further diagnostic work‐up, such as imaging or endoscopy. Whereas nonoperative management represents the initial treatment strategy in pediatric intussusceptions; adult intussusceptions involve a lead point in up to 92% of patients, potentially related to a malignant tumor and therefore requiring different management. Whereas surgery is often required to determine the underlying etiology, the optimal surgical strategy remains a subject of debate. Although surgical reduction may prevent unnecessary bowel resection, it carries risks, including intraluminal seeding or venous tumor dissemination in cases of malignancy, or spillage in cases of perforation. Currently, there are no established guidelines for the surgical management of intussusception in adult patients, with most available data derived from individual institutional case series.

With advancements in technology and the widespread use of CT‐scans in both emergency and elective settings, the detection rate of incidental or small intussusceptions is increasing. This has further fueled debate concerning their treatment and the possibility of conservative management.

For these reasons, the primary objectives of this study were to conduct a systematic review of the literature on adult intussusception and secondly to propose a management algorithm to guide surgeons in their daily practice.

### MDCT and 3D imaging in transient enteroenteric intussusception: clinical observations and review of the literature [^115escaj]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This article will review the current role of MDCT and 3D imaging in the diagnosis and management of adults with enteroenteric intussusception.

Conclusion

Because of significant advancements in CT along with its increasing use, detection of enteroenteric intussusceptions by CT has increased. These findings are sometimes in asymptomatic patients, often transient, and without an identifiable lead point. This has complicated the management of adult patients with intussusception because not every patient with intussusception may need surgery.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^113siay6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This was a retrospective analysis of the epidemiological features of pediatric intussusception, the effects of different management strategies and the factors affecting successful reduction.

Methods

Using our hospital database, data on pediatric intussusception from January 2019 to December 2020 were extracted for analysis, including demographic data, size of intussusception, treatment method, and effects.

Results

The number of children diagnosed with intussusception was 726 (782 episodes). In all, 394 (54.27%) of these children were male. The male to female ratio was 1.19:1. The peak of the onset age was between 3 and 4 years. In the single intussusception group, the successful reduction rate of cleansing enemas was 65.25%, that of air enemas was 95.80%, and that of B-ultrasound–guided hydrostatic enemas (B-USGHEs) was 96.04%. In the multiple intussusceptions group, the successful reduction rate of cleansing enemas was 43.9%, air enemas were 75%, and B-USGHE was 57.6%. There were no significant differences between the air enema and B-USGHE groups. The diameter and length were related factors influencing successful reduction (P ≤ 0.05). Fifty-three (7.53%) children had recurrent intussusception within 4 years, and all of them were following successful enemas. Thirty-one (3.40%) episodes were found to have spontaneously reduced. Five patients (0.7%) underwent surgery after the failure of air enemas or B-USGHE.

Conclusions

Pediatric intussusception in our region showed a sex ratio difference and age difference of onset. For single intussusceptions and multiple intussusceptions, the successful reduction rate of cleansing enemas means that some children may avoid radiation exposure. The diameter and length of intussusception were related factors influencing successful reduction in cleansing enema. There were no significant differences in successful reduction between air enemas and B-USGHE. Most recurrent intussusceptions can still be reduced, avoiding surgery.

### Process management of intussusception in children: a retrospective analysis in China [^117ETLmk]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The recurrence rate of intussusception varies greatly, with reported rates of 2% to 20%. The incidence of pathological lead point (PLP) in all children with intussusception was 3.9% to 10%. PLP was present in 14% of the children who had 2 or more recurrences compared with 4% of those children who had only 1 recurrence.– There is universal consensus that PLP is a risk factor for recurrence. Instead, some documents think that the rates of PLP among children with 1 or more episodes of intussusception is similar, and there is no association between recurrent intussusceptions and PLP. The enema success rate of recurrent intussusceptions was 96% to 100%. In the current data, 53 (7.53%) children had recurrent intussusception within the age from 10 months to 8 years, all of which were after successful enema or conservative treatment. Nonoperative treatment was still the first choice, regardless of which treatment they have previously received.

Nonoperative reduction should be attempted in most patients with acute primary intussusception. Air enema reduction under fluoroscopy or B-USGHE has been the main procedure. The reduction success rate based on published literature achieved at least 80% and even as high as 100%.– In our data, there was a cleansing enema for intussusception reduction that was initially used for intestinal preparation before an air enema. We occasionally found that some intussusceptions were reduced after cleansing enema on repeat B-ultrasound. For single intussusception, the success rate of cleansing enema was 65.25%, that of air enema was 95.80% and that of B-USGHE was 96.04%, meanwhile, the success rate of cleansing enema was 43.90%, the of air enema was 75.00% and that of B-USGFE was 57.60% for multiple intussusceptions. There was no difference in success rate between the air enema group and the B-USGHE group. Although the success rate in the cleansing enema group was lower than that in the air enema and B-USGHE groups, it had great significance in protecting some children from radiation exposure and avoiding unnecessary suffering.

### Current methods for reducing intussusception: survey results [^1138djNb]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is a common pediatric abdominal emergency, treated with image-guided reduction. Available techniques include fluoroscopic and ultrasonographic monitoring of liquid and air.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine current practices and establish trends by comparing our findings with reports of previous surveys.

Materials and Methods

This study is based on an e-mail survey sent to all 1,538 members of the Society for Pediatric Radiology. It included questions about demographics, presence of parents/surgeon during procedure, patient selection/preparation, use of sedation, preferred methods of reduction and technical details, approach to unsuccessful reduction, and self-reported incidence of success/perforation.

Results

The 456 respondents (30%) reported attempting 3,834 reductions in the preceding 12 months. Of these, 96% use fluoroscopy and 4% use US guidance for reduction; 78% use air, 20% prefer fluid; 75% require intravenous access; 63% expect a surgeon to be present in hospital; 93% do not sedate. Although inflating a rectal balloon is controversial, 39% do so, and 50% employ a pressure-release valve. Seventy-two percent attempt reductions three times in the same position. In case of unsuccessful reductions, 64% wait and re-attempt later, 19% apply manual pressure, and 15% try again in left decubitus position. About 20% reattempt reduction after waiting 2 h or more.

Conclusion

By providing a better understanding of both trends in and diversity of current practice, we hope to increase the confidence with which the individual practitioner will approach each case.

### Intestinal intussusception in adults: a systematic review [^111wSAQE]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 Management

Operative management was performed in 65% of intussusceptions (1581/2432 intussusceptions, 2330 patients, based on 37 studies). Excluding studies including only surgically operated patients, conservative management was performed in 851/1683 intussusceptions (51%). Data regarding surgical access through open or minimally invasive surgery were available in 14 studies for 778 patients. Most patients (n = 564, 72%) underwent open management, whereas 214 (28%) underwent minimally invasive surgery. Data regarding surgical management of the intussusception were heterogenous and poorly reported (available in only 23 studies). En bloc resection without prior reduction was carried out in 676/1063 intussusceptions (64%), reduction and resection were performed in 206/972 (21%), and reduction alone was performed in 66/1063 (6%). Regarding spontaneously reduced intussusceptions, 31 studies reported whether they had negative findings upon exploratory surgery. This was the case in 214/1250 intussusceptions (17%).

Data regarding conservative and surgical treatment can be found in Table 1, whereas Table 3 summarizes the details of surgical management.

Operative management.

3.5 Treatment Algorithm

Based on the results of this systematic review, we propose a pragmatic treatment algorithm for management of intussusception (Figure 2). Because of high malignancy rates for both ileocolic and colocolic intussusceptions, these types were grouped under "large bowel".

### Opioid administration and reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^116PeHVu]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this global multicenter cross-sectional study add important new knowledge to the body of evidence characterizing specific factors associated with failed reduction of intussusception in children. Importantly, fentanyl, whether used as analgesia or a sedative adjunct, was not associated with failed reduction, suggesting that it should be considered for primary analgesia and, in settings where sedation may not be feasible, for pain management during reduction of intussusception.

Influencing Factors of Intussusception Reduction

Of 782 episodes of intussusception, there were 570 episodes with a descriptive report that included the diameter, length of involved segment, and number of intussusceptions. Statistical analysis was performed on the relationship between the reduction rate and size of intussusception among the different groups (Table 2). There were 519 episodes of single intussusception that were categorized into 4 groups based on the reduction method, which included cleansing enema, air enema, B-USGHE, and spontaneous reduction groups. The mean diameter of intussusception with successful reduction was smaller than that with failed reduction in the cleansing enema group, air enema group, and B-USGHE group. There were significant differences between them in the cleansing enema group and B-USGHE group (P < 0.001), but not in air enema group (P ≤ 0.05). The mean length of intussusception with successful reduction was smaller than that with failed reduction in the cleansing enema group, air enema group, and B-USGHE group. There were significant differences between them in the cleansing enema group (P < 0.001), but not in air enema group and B-USGHE group (P ≤ 0.05). One-way ANOVA and t test showed that diameter, length, and different enema methods were related factors influencing successful reduction (P ≤ 0.05). There were no significant differences in failed reduction (P > 0.05). The mean diameter of air enemas with successful reduction was larger than that of cleansing enemas, B-USGHE, and spontaneous reduction, and there were significant differences between them (P ≤ 0.05). There was no significant difference in diameter between spontaneous reduction, B-USGHE, and cleansing enemas (P > 0.05). The mean length in air enemas with successful reduction was larger than that in cleansing enemas, B-USGHE, and spontaneous reduction, and there was a significant difference between them (P ≤ 0.05). There was no significant difference between cleansing enemas, B-USGHE, and spontaneous reduction (P > 0.05).

### An interactive teaching device simulating intussusception reduction [^115mZZDt]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intussusception is an important cause of acute abdomen in infancy and childhood. The incidence of intussusception is estimated to be 0.5–2.3 cases per 1,000 live births in the USA. However, it is likely that the incidence is actually higher, as some cases resolve spontaneously before being confirmed either radiographically or surgically. The relative rarity of this condition limits radiology residents' opportunity to gain supervised experience in the non-surgical reduction of intussusception. A recent survey found that 22% of senior radiology residents have had no experience in reducing intussusception, while 21% have been involved with only one case during their entire residency. However, Meyer et al. demonstrated that a radiologist must be involved in at least four air intussusception reductions to become skillful with this technique.

Nonsurgical reduction of intussusception is the preferred method of treatment, and both air and liquid reduction have been shown to be safe and effective. Hence, it falls squarely on the radiologist to be familiar with and proficient at performing this procedure so that patients avoid unnecessary surgery. Since the judgment, confidence and skill involved in reducing intussusception are best gained with experience, radiology residents — and any other practicing radiologists who might be asked to treat a patient's intussusception — will benefit from the training tool we describe here to supplement their caseload. Simulation tools such as this intussusception reduction simulator constitute a major revolution in medical education.

### Management of intussusception [^115yhbA4]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Intussusception represents the most common abdominal emergency in infancy. The classical clinical triad, consisting of abdominal colics, red jelly stools and a palpable mass, is only present in approximately 50% of cases, 20% of patients are symptom free at clinical presentation. Primary imaging modality of choice is ultrasound scanning, which enables the diagnosis or exclusion of an intussusception at a sensitivity of 98–100%, specificity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 100%. In emergency cases, additional plain films are necessary to detect potential intestinal perforation, to identify intestinal obstruction or other diseases mimicking the clinical presentation. Once the diagnosis of an intussusception is established, non-surgical reduction (NSR) is used. A surgical approach is chosen in patients with signs of perforation, shock or peritonitis. Depending on the choice of guiding imaging technique, different contrast media are used for NSR. Barium suspension or air with fluoroscopic guidance, or saline only or mixed with water-soluble contrast under sonographic guidance, has to be used. Regardless of the used contrast medium, NSR is an effective technique, being successfully employed in more than 90% of cases.

### Clinical manifestation and treatment of intussusception in children aged 3 months and under: a single centre analysis of 38 cases [^115Ub968]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intussusception is a pathological process in which a segment of bowel twists and retracts on itself into the adjacent intestine, resulting in an intestinal obstruction. Its the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants and young children, with a prevalence of 0.5 per 1,000 to 2 per 1,000, common in children aged 4 months to 24 months, with peak incidence at 4–9 months of age, with a very low incidence in infants under 3 months of age. The clinical presentation of intussusception in young infants is often atypical, with the disease typically being acute and rapidly progressive, frequently leading to severe complications such as intestinal necrosis, peritonitis, and even death.

Currently, the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception have been standardised, and ultrasound (US) diagnosis and non-surgical treatment with enemas have been widely accepted. However, there is still controversy as to whether conservative treatment with enemas is appropriate for small infants. The difficulty lies in the limitations of using low to medium pressure for enema reduction, which often fails to achieve complete reduction, as excessive or improper attempts may aggravate the condition and result in intestinal perforation. Intussusception in infants, especially those under 3 months of age, remains underreported in both domestic and international literature. Moreover, there is limited global consensus on the best management strategies for this age group, particularly in regions with variable healthcare infrastructure.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies for intussusception in small infants, so as to reduce the complication rate and improve the outcomes. The goal is to contribute to the global body of knowledge on this condition, highlight the challenges in its management, and offer insights into improving outcomes for affected infants.

### Scoring system to evaluate risk of nonoperative management failure in children with intussusception [^116tnYLk]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Typical first-line management of children with intussusception is enema reduction; however, failure necessitates surgical intervention. The number of attempts varies by clinician, and predictors of failed nonoperative management are not routinely considered in practice. The purpose of this study is to create a scoring system that predicts risk of nonoperative failure and need for surgical intervention.

Methods

Children diagnosed with intussusception upon presentation to the emergency department of a tertiary children's hospital between 2019 and 2022 were retrospectively identified. Univariable logistic regression identified predictors of nonoperative failure used as starting covariates for multivariable logistic regression with final model determined by backwards elimination. Regression coefficients for final predictors were used to create the scoring system and optimal cut-points were delineated.

Results

We identified 143 instances of ultrasound-documented intussusception of which 28 (19.6%) required operative intervention. Predictors of failed nonoperative management included age ≥ 4 y (odds ratio [OR] 32.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.91–564.23), ≥ 1 failed enema reduction attempts (OR 189.53, 95% CI: 19.07–1884.11), presenting heart rate ≥ 128 (OR 3.38, 95% CI: 0.74–15.36), presenting systolic blood pressure ≥ 115 mmHg (OR 6.59, 95% CI: 0.93–46.66), and trapped fluid between intussuscepted loops on ultrasound (OR 17.54, 95% CI: 0.77–397.51). Employing these factors, a novel risk scoring system was developed (area under the curve 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93–0.99). Scores range from 0 to 8; ≤ 2 have low (1.1%), 3–4 moderate (50.0%), and ≥ 5 high (100%) failure risk.

Conclusions

Using known risk factors for enema failure, we produced a risk scoring system with outstanding discriminate ability for children with intussusception necessitating surgical intervention. Prospective validation is warranted prior to clinical integration.

### Is it safe to discharge intussusception patients after successful hydrostatic reduction? [^117BhZjh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether discharge from the emergency department (ED) after successful hydrostatic reduction (HR) of intussusception is safe.

Methods

We conducted a single institution review of patient records with a diagnosis code of intussusception from 1995 to 2006. Data collected included age, clinical presentation, imaging, surgical interventions, pathology, recurrence, and disposition. Statistical analysis utilized chi(2) tests, where P ≤ .05 was considered significant.

Results

A total of 309 patients with intussusception were identified. One hundred twenty-three patients (39.8%) required surgical intervention, 138 (44.6%) patients were managed nonoperatively as inpatients, and 48 (15.5%) were treated nonoperatively and discharged from the ED. There were 18 recurrences (5.8%). Recurrence rates did not significantly differ between patients who required operative reduction and those who were managed nonoperatively with HR and either observed as inpatients or discharged from the ED. Seven patients with recurrences required surgical intervention, and 1 of those children had a pathologic lead point, which was nonneoplastic.

Conclusions

Recurrence rates do not differ between children observed as inpatients and those discharged home after successful HR. Missed neoplastic pathologic lead points were not found in the patients who required an operation after a recurrence. Our data suggests that it is safe to discharge patients selectively from the ED after successful HR.

### Intussusception: a 14-year experience at a UK tertiary referral centre [^116uCgZ9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Intussusception is the most common cause of acute intestinal obstruction in infants. First line management in uncomplicated cases at our centre is fluoroscopy guided air enema reduction. This study reports a 14 year UK single centre experience highlighting management and outcomes of intussusception in children.

Methods

All cases of intussusception (ICD 10-code K56.1) at a single tertiary referral centre from 2004 to 2017 were analyzed. Data evaluated included patient demographics, clinical presentation, treatment modality(s), complications and outcome(s).

Results

Two hundred ninety confirmed cases (69% male) of intussusception were identified during the study period. The median age at presentation was 9.5 months (range 4 days-15 years). One hundred eighty-six (64%) cases occurred in children who were transferred to Alder Hey from peripheral district hospitals. One hundred ninety-six cases (68%) proceeded directly to air enema reduction and successful reduction was achieved in 129 cases (66%). A single case (0.5%) of attempted air enema reduction was complicated by perforation. Early recurrence rate following air enema reduction was 9%. Operative management was indicated in 140 (48%) cases of which 66 required bowel resection (47%). There were no deaths.

Conclusions

We highlight one of the largest single centre UK studies defining practice outcomes for intussusception across the British Isles. Our centre has achieved a 66% success rate of non-operative reduction over 14 years in line with the British Society Pediatric Radiology (BSPR) recommendations and within 5% of the national median metric (71%). Moreover these outcomes were achieved with a very low complication rate (0.5%) from air enema reduction and no mortality in the series.

### Diagnosis and treatment of childhood intussusception from 1997 to 2016: a population-based study [^1126k2mB]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Describe changes in the diagnostic approach and treatment for pediatric intussusception over two decades.

Study Design

Administrative universal healthcare data were used to conduct a population-based cohort study of intussusception between January 1997 and December 2016 in Ontario, Canada. A validated case definition was used to identify all patients (< 18 years) treated for intussusception in the province at community or tertiary care centers. Treatment modality was determined using physician billing data and databases linked at ICES; it was categorized as nonoperative alone, surgical alone, or failed nonoperative. Descriptive statistics, Cochrane-Armitage for trend analyses, and graphical and multinomial logistic regression were performed.

Results

Over 20 years, 1895 pediatric patients were treated for intussusception. Pretreatment imaging use rose from 57.5% to 99.3%. Nonoperative management increased from 23.4% to 75.2%. However, 43% of children who presented to a community hospital underwent immediate surgical management, compared with just 11% of children at tertiary centers (RR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.25–0.62). Among children who underwent surgery, there was an increase in bowel resection over time (41.7% to 57.6%).

Conclusions

Over the 20 year period of study, pretreatment imaging became universal, and management shifted from predominantly surgical to nonoperative reduction in Ontario. The rate of surgical intervention remains higher in community versus tertiary centers.

### Opioid administration and reduction of pediatric ileocolic intussusception [^1156wdNV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Only a minority of patients received any opioid within 120 minutes of attempted reduction (13.38%). This finding may reflect a general reluctance to provide analgesia to young childrenfor painful and distressing procedures, a misconception that analgesia may mask the signs of a surgical condition, preverbal children's difficulty with expressing the need for analgesia, or clinician uncertainty with behavioral pain assessment, dosing, and adverse events. This is in sharp contrast to adults, who receive analgesia for a similar procedure (colonoscopy) that is often performed as a screening test for asymptomatic patients. In the context of our findings, there is now little rationale for withholding fentanyl for children with intussusception.

Both the American Academy of Pediatricsand Canadian Pediatric Societyhave recommended therapeutic approaches to reduce pain and distress in children undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, although none specifically discuss reduction of intussusception. Intranasal fentanyl has been shown to be equipotent to intravenous morphine for analgesia. Administration is well toleratedand can be performed by nurses, with little training required. An intranasal fentanyl protocol has even been shown to decrease time to analgesia administration in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics' recent clinical practice guideline for opioid prescribing in outpatient settings emphasized that management should involve a multimodal approach including nonpharmacologic strategies and nonopioids, with opioids administered on an as needed basis, and cited that reluctance to prescribe opioids has potentially led to undertreatment of children's pain. In settings that lack experience and resources to safely sedate children, fentanyl may be a viable option for reduction of intussusception, but it is critical that clinicians adopt multimodal approaches and develop practice parameters to optimize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse events. Future work should urgently focus on how to optimize routine pain assessments in young children using observational scales during clinical presentation and during reduction of intussusception, with a goal to quantify the efficacy of analgesics such as fentanyl.
