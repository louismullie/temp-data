## Question

When to suspend ace inhibitor prior to surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to suspend ACE inhibitors before surgery, including considerations of pharmacokinetics, evidence from randomized trials, guideline recommendations, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic rationale for timing of discontinuation. Then, I should verify what contemporary randomized trials show about clinical outcomes with continuation versus discontinuation. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to consider surgery-specific contexts, including cardiac, noncardiac, and special populations. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise approach and a concise recommendation, making sure I double-check areas of uncertainty and note where evidence is evolving.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation, because the timing of holding an ACE inhibitor should align with its duration of action and half-life to meaningfully reduce intraoperative hemodynamic effects. Common agents like lisinopril and ramipril have durations of action around 24 hours and half-lives in the 12–17 hour range, so stopping only the night before may leave residual effect on the day of surgery; SPACE explicitly used individualized pharmacokinetic-based holds of 2–3 days depending on the agent, which is a key reason their protocol likely achieved cleaner separation of effect than studies using shorter holds [^117WzcbJ] [^115qsK53]. Wait, let me verify the implication: stopping for less than 24 hours may not materially alter intraoperative blood pressure behavior, which supports a minimum 24–48 hour hold in many cases, tailored to the specific drug's kinetics [^115Yv7Sf] [^117WzcbJ].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality randomized evidence. The STOP-or-NOT trial randomized 2,222 patients to continue RAS inhibitors to the morning of surgery versus discontinue 48 hours preoperatively and found no difference in the composite of death or major complications, but a significant reduction in intraoperative hypotension with discontinuation, which is the hemodynamic endpoint most consistently affected in these studies [^117FZxqQ]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude: hypotension occurred in 41% with discontinuation versus 54% with continuation, a clinically meaningful relative reduction that aligns with physiologic expectations and anesthetic risk mitigation goals [^117FZxqQ].

> I will now examine the SPACE trial, which was smaller but methodologically rigorous and pharmacokinetically tailored. SPACE showed no reduction in myocardial injury with stopping RAS inhibitors and, importantly, more postoperative hypertensive events when RAS inhibitors were withheld, suggesting a trade-off between less intraoperative hypotension and more postoperative hypertension when these drugs are stopped preoperatively [^111gWhHv] [^117FZxqQ]. Wait, let me double-check the directionality: the myocardial injury signal favored continuation numerically, though not statistically significant, reinforcing that continuation does not worsen hard outcomes and may avoid rebound hypertension in some patients [^111gWhHv].

> Next, I should review meta-analyses to ensure consistency. Contemporary meta-analyses of randomized trials consistently show that discontinuing RAS inhibitors reduces intraoperative hypotension by roughly 20–35%, with no clear mortality or MACE benefit, and uncertain effects on postoperative hypertension and AKI across heterogeneous studies, which mirrors the trial-level signals and underscores the hemodynamic trade-off without proven hard-outcome advantage for either strategy [^114RZo8q] [^113k77o8]. Hmm, wait a minute, one meta-analysis suggested lower AKI with withholding, but the certainty is low and not uniformly reproduced, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret that finding in isolation [^116anx2J].

> Now, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile them. The 2024 ACC/AHA perioperative guideline gives a Class 2b recommendation to consider omitting ACEi/ARB 24 hours before surgery in selected patients undergoing elevated-risk noncardiac surgery to limit intraoperative hypotension, reflecting the hemodynamic benefit seen in trials while acknowledging the lack of hard-outcome advantage and the risk of rebound hypertension if stopped [^111J8s6w]. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends withholding ACEi/ARB starting 24 hours before noncardiac surgery, aligning with a conservative hemodynamic approach [^112Biyre]. The 2025 AHA/ACC hypertension guideline similarly notes that preoperative discontinuation may be considered to prevent hypotension, again emphasizing shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment [^116nLQsL]. But wait, what if the indication is compelling, like heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or proteinuric CKD? In those cases, continuation may be reasonable if the anesthesia and surgical teams are prepared to manage hypotension proactively, given the lack of harm signal for major outcomes in RCTs [^114E4Cxa] [^117FZxqQ].

> I should confirm surgery-specific nuances. For major noncardiac surgery, the balance of evidence favors a strategy of holding ACE inhibitors for at least 24 hours, and ideally 48 hours when feasible based on pharmacokinetics, to reduce intraoperative hypotension, with the understanding that postoperative hypertension risk may increase and should be anticipated and treated [^117FZxqQ] [^117WzcbJ]. For cardiac surgery, pilot randomized trials have not shown clear differences in vasoplegia, AKI, or major outcomes between continuation and discontinuation, suggesting either strategy can be acceptable if hemodynamics are carefully managed, though many centers still prefer holding 24–48 hours to mitigate vasoplegic risk, especially in patients with low EF or prolonged bypass [^114mcuLd] [^115NMEks] [^114o46qX] [^112p5iEc]. For carotid endarterectomy, observational data suggest preoperative ACEi/ARB use is generally safe, with only a small increase in treated hypertension and no increase in hypotension or MACE, so routine discontinuation is not mandated in this population [^1159zpt5].

> Let me consider special populations and risk modifiers. In older adults or those with low baseline blood pressure, the risk of intraoperative hypotension with continued RAS blockade is higher, so a lower threshold for holding preoperatively is reasonable, whereas in patients with HFrEF, proteinuric CKD, or diabetes with nephropathy, continuation may be preferred if the perioperative team can mitigate hypotension with fluids and vasopressors and promptly restart postoperatively to avoid rebound hypertension or decompensation [^111g4zHT] [^114E4Cxa] [^113Q9kd9]. I should double-check the postoperative piece: failure to restart ACE inhibitors promptly after surgery is associated with increased mortality, reinforcing the need for a protocolized resumption plan once hemodynamics and renal function are stable [^115wQ2gt] [^113Q9kd9].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details. A pharmacokinetic-based hold of 48 hours for long-acting agents and 24 hours for shorter-acting agents is a reasonable, evidence-aligned approach, with explicit plans to restart on postoperative day 2 if the patient is hemodynamically stable, not requiring vasoactive support, and without AKI, adjusting for renal function and potassium before reinitiation [^1142ZU9K] [^113Q9kd9]. Hold on, I should verify the day-of-surgery nuance: taking the dose on the morning of surgery increases intraoperative hypotension risk and should generally be avoided if the goal is hemodynamic stability, particularly in elevated-risk noncardiac procedures [^117FZxqQ] [^111J8s6w].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is as follows, and I will sanity-check it against the trials and guidelines as I go. For elective major noncardiac surgery, hold ACE inhibitors for 48 hours before surgery when feasible, or at minimum 24 hours, tailored to the specific agent's duration of action, to reduce intraoperative hypotension, while ensuring a plan to restart within 24–48 hours postoperatively once hemodynamics and renal function allow, to avoid rebound hypertension and maintain organ-protective therapy when indicated [^117FZxqQ] [^111J8s6w] [^113Q9kd9]. For cardiac surgery, either strategy can be acceptable with careful hemodynamic management, though many centers prefer holding 24–48 hours preoperatively, especially in patients at risk of vasoplegia, and early postoperative resumption is generally favored when tolerated [^114mcuLd] [^116MU2JC] [^114o46qX]. For low-risk ambulatory or minimally invasive procedures, continuation may be reasonable if baseline blood pressure is well controlled and the anesthesia team is prepared to manage modest hypotension, with individualized decisions for high-risk patients with compelling indications to continue [^114E4Cxa].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and evolving evidence. The largest randomized trial to date shows no difference in death or major complications between strategies, so the decision remains largely hemodynamic and patient-specific rather than outcome-deterministic, and ongoing trials may refine whether certain subgroups benefit more from continuation or discontinuation, particularly around renal and myocardial endpoints [^117FZxqQ] [^116TPXAU]. Until then, a pharmacokinetically informed, guideline-concordant approach with proactive postoperative resumption planning offers the best balance of risks and benefits for most patients undergoing major surgery [^111J8s6w] [^112Biyre].

Hold ACE inhibitors **24–48 hours before surgery** [^1142ZU9K] to reduce intraoperative hypotension [^117FZxqQ] and AKI risk [^116anx2J], especially in patients with **high-risk features** (elderly, low EF, CKD, or major surgery) [^111g4zHT]. Continue ACE inhibitors if the indication is compelling (heart failure, LV dysfunction, or proteinuric CKD) and the surgical team is prepared to manage hypotension [^114E4Cxa]. Resume ACE inhibitors postoperatively once the patient is hemodynamically stable and euvolemic, typically within 24–48 hours [^116nDFdr].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for holding ACE inhibitors

ACE inhibitors reduce systemic vascular resistance and can cause **perioperative hypotension** [^111GTAmL], particularly during anesthesia induction and intraoperative vasodilation [^115bVAQT]. This hypotension may lead to organ hypoperfusion, AKI, and myocardial ischemia [^112Qf2zU].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting preoperative discontinuation

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show that **withholding ACE inhibitors 24–48 hours before surgery reduces intraoperative hypotension** [^117FZxqQ] and AKI without increasing mortality or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [^115bVAQT] [^116anx2J]. The STOP-or-NOT trial found no difference in 28-day mortality or major complications between continuing and discontinuing ACE inhibitors, but discontinuation reduced intraoperative hypotension [^117FZxqQ]. Meta-analyses likewise show that discontinuation lowers intraoperative hypotension and AKI without affecting mortality or MACE [^115bVAQT] [^116anx2J].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting continuation

Some studies suggest that continuing ACE inhibitors may be safe in selected patients, particularly when the indication is compelling (e.g. heart failure, LV dysfunction, proteinuric CKD) [^114E4Cxa]. The SPACE trial found no significant difference in myocardial injury between continuing and discontinuing ACE inhibitors, although discontinuation was associated with more postoperative hypertension [^111gWhHv].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Guidelines provide nuanced recommendations based on patient risk and surgical context:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACC/AHA 2024 | Consider omitting ACE inhibitors 24 hours before surgery in patients undergoing elevated-risk noncardiac surgery to limit intraoperative hypotension [^111J8s6w] |
| Canadian Cardiovascular Society | Withhold ACE inhibitors 24 hours before noncardiac surgery [^112Biyre] |
| ESC/ESH 2018 | No clear recommendation; emphasizes individualized decision-making based on patient risk and surgical context [^111fToTF] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision

- **Age**: Elderly patients are at higher risk of perioperative hypotension and may benefit from discontinuation [^111g4zHT].
- **Comorbidities**: Patients with heart failure, LV dysfunction, or proteinuric CKD may benefit from continuation if the surgical team can manage hypotension [^notfound].
- **Type of surgery**: Major surgeries with high risk of intraoperative hypotension (e.g. cardiac, vascular, major abdominal) favor discontinuation [^111J8s6w].

---

## Risks associated with discontinuation

Discontinuing ACE inhibitors can cause **rebound hypertension** and worsening heart failure in susceptible patients [^112n3VUv]. Close monitoring and appropriate alternative antihypertensive management are essential [^113Q9kd9].

---

## Timing of resumption postoperatively

ACE inhibitors should be resumed once the patient is hemodynamically stable, euvolemic, and without significant renal impairment, typically within 24–48 hours postoperatively [^116nDFdr] [^1173wrJ5]. Delayed resumption is associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular events [^115wQ2gt].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **High-risk patients**: Discontinue ACE inhibitors 24–48 hours before surgery, especially if elderly, with low EF, CKD, or undergoing major surgery [^1142ZU9K].
- **Low-risk patients**: Consider continuation if the indication is compelling and the surgical team is prepared to manage hypotension [^117FZxqQ].
- **Postoperative management**: Resume ACE inhibitors within 24–48 hours once stable and euvolemic [^1142ZU9K].

---

Holding ACE inhibitors 24–48 hours before surgery reduces intraoperative hypotension and AKI without increasing mortality or MACE [^116anx2J]. Individualize decisions based on patient risk, surgical context, and indication, and resume therapy promptly postoperatively.

Postoperative strategies

The early postoperative period has not been extensively studied in relation to kidney outcomes. However, therapeutic strategies used in the hours after surgery could likely modify the risk of AKI (Box 5). Clinically important postoperative hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg and requiring medical intervention) affects over 30% of patients, often goes uncorrected for longer than intraoperative hypotension and is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and myocardial injury. These findings suggest that maintenance of fluid and haemodynamic status in the early postoperative phase is important to avoid organ injuries including AKI. A trial that used stroke volume optimization and vasopressors to target a MAP within 10% of the preoperative baseline value during and for 4 h after surgery showed that this strategy was associated with a reduction in postoperative organ injury, but was not powered to assess kidney-specific outcomes. Further research is warranted to evaluate postoperative monitoring strategies and ideal clinical settings to reduce the risk of PO-AKI in moderate- to high-risk patients.

As postoperative hyperglycaemia is strongly associated with AKI, avoidance of perioperative hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl) is recommended. Failure to restart chronic ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy that was suspended preoperatively is associated with increased 30-day mortality. However, the optimal time point to restart these medications has not been clearly established. Given their effects on the kidney, a reasonable approach would be to conduct a focused KHA before restarting ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Enhanced recovery after surgery pathways are typically multimodal, multidisciplinary interventions that have been promoted to facilitate recovery from surgery. Use of NSAIDs to minimize opiate analgesia requirements is a common component of such pathways, along with avoidance of markedly positive fluid balance. Accordingly, in some settings such as colorectal surgery, implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery pathway could be associated with a higher, rather than lower, incidence of AKI.

### Angiotensin system inhibitors in a general surgical population [^116M2sd8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

We studied the relationship between the timing of discontinuing chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 antagonists (ARA) and hypotension after the induction of general anesthesia in a general surgical population. We retrospectively studied 267 hypertensive patients receiving chronic ACEI/ARA therapy undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia. During preoperative visits, patients were asked to either take their last ACEI/ARA therapy on the morning of surgery or withhold it up to 24 h before surgery. The number of hours from the last ACEI/ARA dose to surgery was recorded during the preoperative interview. Electronic medical and anesthesia records were reviewed for comorbidities, type and dose of anesthetics used, intraoperative hemodynamics, IV fluids, perioperative vasopressor administration, and rate of severe postoperative complications. Arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were recorded during the 60-min postinduction period, and hypotension was classified as moderate (systolic BP ≤ 85 mm Hg) and severe (systolic BP ≤ 65 mm Hg). We analyzed all variables separately for patients who took their last ACEI/ARA therapy < 10 h and ≥ 10 h before surgery. During the first 30 min after anesthetic induction, moderate hypotension was more frequent in patients whose most recent ACEI/ARA therapy was taken < 10 h (60%) compared with those who stopped it ≥ 10 h (46%) before induction (P = 0.02). The adjusted odds ratio for moderate hypotension was 1.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.93) for those who took their ACEI/ARA therapy < 10 h before surgery (P = 0.04). There were no differences between groups in the incidence of severe hypotension, nor was there a difference in the use of vasopressors. During the 31–60 min after induction, the incidence of either moderate (P = 0.43) or severe (P = 0.97) hypotension was similar in the two groups. No differences in postoperative complications were found between groups. In conclusion, discontinuation of ACEI/ARA therapy at least 10 h before anesthesia was associated with a reduced risk of immediate postinduction hypotension.

### Should all patients be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor after coronary artery bypass graft surgery? The impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and β-blockers after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^115Cbndf]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to evaluate the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

Methods

Postoperative outpatient utilization of ACE inhibitors, statins, and β-blockers was assessed in a cohort of 3,718 patients after CABG 65 years and older. The primary outcome was freedom from a composite of all-cause mortality or hospital readmission for cardiac events or procedures.

Results

Use of all 3 medication classes increased significantly over the study period. Female patients and patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, and poor left ventricular function were independently associated with ACE inhibitor use on multivariate analysis (all P < .05). At a median follow-up of 3 years, postoperative therapy with an ACE inhibitor had no effect on death or rehospitalization for cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% CI 0.96–1.30, P = 0.16). However, statins (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57–0.74, P < .0001) and β-blockers (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.93, P = 0.001) were associated with a significantly improved event-free survival.

Conclusions

Among patients after CABG 65 years or older, ACE inhibitors had no independent effect on mortality or recurrent ischemic events in the midterm after CABG, although a benefit was observed for statins and β-blockers.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111MS5BL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Patients scheduled for surgical procedures — For patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on beta blockers (BBs) chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the preoperative period to assist with blood pressure (BP) control (Class 1, Level B-NR). For elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the preoperative period (Class 2a, Level C-EO). In major surgery, discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery (Class 2b, Level B-R). In elective major surgery with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications (Class 2b, Level C-LD). In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level B-NR). For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R).

### Association of preoperative renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation and adverse events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156p5R4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have any association with reduction in atrial fibrillation and adverse events for patients undergoing cardiac surgery?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis involving 11 unique studies with 27 885 patients undergoing cardiac surgery found no additional association between preoperative renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy and a reduced risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, stroke, death, or hospitalization.

Meaning

The results provide no support for the routine use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors for the possible prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation and adverse events in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors before non-cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis [^114RZo8q]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The best management approach for renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor use before surgery is controversial. Some studies have suggested that continuation could increase the risk of clinically significant peri-operative hypotension and, thus, organ injury. By contrast, others believe that withholding them significantly increases the risk of severe hypertension and heart failure. To determine the most effective strategy, this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials compared discontinuation vs continuation of RAS inhibitors in patients undergoing non-cardiac and non-vascular surgeries.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared discontinuation vs continuation of RAS inhibitors in patients undergoing non-cardiac and non-vascular surgery.

Results

Five randomized controlled trials (n = 10 773 patients; 5388 randomized to discontinuation) were included. Discontinuation of an RAS inhibitor probaby reduced peri-operative hypotension (27.66% vs 34.06%; risk ratio [RR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73–0.89; moderate certainty). The evidence is very uncertain about effects on peri-operative hypertension (9.46% vs 8.05%; RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.66–2.89; very low certainty). For major clinical outcomes, discontinuation suggested little to no difference in acute kidney injury (10.45% vs 10.69%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66–1.45; low certainty), acute heart failure (5.38% vs 5.32%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76–1.31; low certainty), myocardial infarction (1.22% vs 1.00%; RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.60–2.39; low certainty), stroke (0.42% vs 0.40%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.56–1.93; low certainty), and arrhythmias (1.80% vs 1.40%; RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.69–2.38; low certainty).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that discontinuation of RAS inhibitors is likely to reduce peri-operative hypotension in patients undergoing non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery, but the evidence is very uncertain about effects on peri-operative hypertension and major clinical outcomes.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^112ooudg]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Management of hypertension/albuminuria in sickle cell disease — For children and adults with SCD and albuminuria, the ASH guideline panel suggests the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi's) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The initiation of ACEi's and ARBs for patients with SCD requires adequate follow-up and monitoring of side effects. When prescribing ACEi's or ARBs, recommended renal safety steps are to start medication at a lower dose in individuals with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², assess GFR and measure serum potassium within 1 week of starting medication or following any dose escalation, and temporarily suspend medication during interval illness, planned IV radiocontrast administration, or bowel preparation for colonoscopy or prior to major surgery. The panel did not assess evidence to guide albuminuria screening; Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines state albuminuria should be confirmed by either a first morning urine sample or 2 consecutive untimed urine samples.

### Preoperative N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and myocardial injury after stopping or continuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in noncardiac surgery: a prespecified analysis of a phase 2 randomised controlled multicentre trial [^115Hux3W]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This study was a preplanned analysis of the Stopping Perioperative ACE-inhibitors/ARBs (SPACE) phase 2a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (ISRCTN17251494), regulated by the Health Research Authority (UK) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency UK (Eudract: 2016–004141–90). Six UK centres recruited patients who provided written informed consent, in accord with the London (City and East) research ethics committee (16/LO/1495). An independent steering committee and data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) oversaw the trial (Supplementary data).

Inclusion criteria

- Adults prescribed RAS inhibitors aged ≥ 60 yr
- American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status ≥ 3
- Elective major surgery requiring general anaesthesia for procedures lasting ≥ 120 min

Exclusion criteria

- Current participation in any other interventional clinical trial
- Myocardial infarction within the 3 months preceding surgery

Randomisation

Patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to either continue or discontinue RAS inhibitors according to the individual pharmacokinetics of each drug. Randomisation was performed centrally, with minimisation by centre, planned surgical procedure category, and RAS inhibitor type.

Post-randomisation management of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors

RAS inhibitors were restarted after surgery on the morning of postoperative day 2 in accord with recommendations by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelinesat the usual dose. Restarting RAS inhibitors did not occur on postoperative day 2 if systolic arterial pressure was < 90 mm Hg in the preceding 12 h or vasoactive therapy was used or if acute kidney injury occurred (KDIGO criteria). All other treatments were managed by the local clinical teams.

Data collection

Blood samples were collected before induction of anaesthesia, 24 h, and 48 h after surgery (see Supplementary data for schedule of visits), from which serum and plasma was prepared. Plasma troponin samples were batch-analysed at the same laboratory (The Doctor's Laboratory, London, UK) by personnel masked to all study details. To minimise bias, follow-up data were collected by a study team member who was masked to the treatment group allocation.

### Association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use prior to major elective surgery and the risk of acute dialysis [^116iTipJ]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, preoperative ACEi/ARB use versus non-use was associated with a lower risk of AKI-D, and the association was primarily evident in patients with CKD. Large, multi-centre randomized trials are needed to inform optimal ACEi/ARB use in the peri-operative setting.

De novo ARNI initiation without prior ACE inhibitor or ARB exposure: Some patients will meet all criteria for initiation of an ARNI but have not yet been treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, and recent data from clinical studies, along with aggregate clinical experience, suggest that directly initiating an ARNI, rather than a pretreatment period with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, is a safe and effective strategy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management — continuation and class-specific considerations are as follows: ongoing treatment of chronic hypertension is recommended in the perioperative period, and if hypertensive patients are unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications to control BP. The decision whether to hold or continue antihypertensive medications may be specific to drug class, because certain medications (eg, beta blockers, clonidine) may be associated with rebound hypertension if discontinued abruptly, whereas others have been associated with increased risk of intraoperative hypotension when continued (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs]).

### Impact of renin-angiotensin system blockers on mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery [^116btFLB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) together are the most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensives in the United States, and it is estimated that ≈18% of adults use these drugs. 1 Given the wealth of data supporting their benefits beyond hypertension control, multiple professional guidelines strongly endorse their use in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. 2, 3, 4 Despite this, considerable controversy exists regarding their use in the preoperative and early postoperative period because of concerns of adverse outcomes such as hypotension, stroke, and kidney injury. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Even among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (compared with noncardiac surgery), where the majority of patients may have a strong indication for this class of medication and greater likelihood of long‐term benefit, findings have been mixed. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), postoperative continuation of preoperative ACEI/ARB prescription is supported in the guidelines, as is de novo prescription for ACEIs/ARBs in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). 18, 19, 20 In patients without LV dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, or CKD, the guidelines diverge, with some recommending for 19 and others recommending against 18 (Kulik) postoperative initiation of these agents. Notably, the evidence base supporting the benefits of commonly prescribed therapies for CAD in patients who undergo CABG is relatively less robust and comes from much smaller studies 15, 21, 22, 23 compared with patients treated with medical therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention. Furthermore, it has been clearly shown that patients with CABG are less than half as likely to receive ACEIs/ARBs compared with those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, indicating that there is a gap between practice and evidence in patients post‐CABG. 21, 24, 25 Currently, CABG is the most common cardiac surgery performed in the United States and accounts for 60% of all cardiac surgeries (≈8% are combined with valve surgery), while isolated valve repair or replacement accounts for ≈15% of cardiac surgeries. 26 In contrast to guidelines in patients undergoing CABG, guidelines on valvular heart disease make no recommendation regarding postoperative use of ACEIs or ARBs. 27 A small number of trials, however, have demonstrated greater LV mass regression, decreased heart failure, and improved survival with ACEIs and ARBs in patients undergoing valve surgery. 28, 29, 30 Thus, while there is significant evidence supporting the long‐term benefits of renin‐angiotensin system blockers (RASBs) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, their short‐term impact on mortality remains unclear and their use remains less than optimal. In this study, we explore the impact of RASB use on 30‐day and 1‐year mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery.

### The risk of hypertension after preoperative discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists in ambulatory and same-day admission patients [^114R3tYA]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The continued use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II subtype I receptor antagonists (ARBs) medications in the preoperative period has been reported to be associated with intraoperative hypotension that can be unresponsive to pressor drugs. As a result, several investigators suggested discontinuation of these medications before scheduled surgery but did not report on unintended consequences that might result from discontinuation. We conducted a prospective, single-blind, randomized trial to observe the effect of the medications on preoperative arterial blood pressure recordings in patients presenting for ambulatory and same-day surgery.

Methods

Six hundred forty-four patients presenting for ambulatory and same-day surgery were enrolled prospectively between 2006 and 2011 and randomly assigned to 2 groups based on continuation or discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The primary outcome was presence of hypertension (HTN) immediately before surgery. Secondary outcomes included surgical cancellations due to HTN, prolongation of hospitalization, adverse clinical events, and HTN in the postoperative period.

Results

Data for 526 patients were analyzed. There were 262 patients in the discontinuation group and 264 patients in the continuation group. Discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs on the day of surgery was not associated with increased prevalence of preoperative HTN (P = 0.775). The upper bound of a 95% confidence interval for the difference in prevalence of Stage 1 and 2 HTN between study arms indicates that discontinuation of study medication is unlikely to be associated with an increase in Stage 1 HTN of > 4.8 percentage points and in Stage 2 HTN of no > 5.8 percentage points. Discontinuation was not associated with an increase in postoperative HTN, with prolongation of hospitalization or with adverse clinical events.

Conclusions

Discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs in patients on the day of surgery did not result in a substantively increased incidence of pre- or postoperative HTN compared with patients who continued these medications on the day of surgery. The results provide an evidentiary basis for the safety of discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs on the day of surgery without increasing adverse hemodynamic outcomes.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^1127qba6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 584 patients were screened for inclusion criteria, 261 patients met study inclusion criteria, and 126 (48.3%) were randomized as shown in Figure 1. Three patients did not undergo cardiac surgery (2 patients in the continuation arm and 1 patient in the discontinuation arm), and 1 patient in each arm withdrew consent after randomization. The final modified intention‐to‐treat study population included 121 patients (96%; 60 in the continuation and 61 in the discontinuation arm). Adherence to the study protocol was 96%. A total of 4 patients in the continuation arm had their ACEI or ARB discontinued before the morning of surgery. Patient follow‐up was 100% complete.

Baseline demographics, preoperative investigations, and medications were similar between treatment arms (Table 1). A median body mass index and a history of cerebrovascular disease and atrial fibrillation/flutter were higher in the discontinuation arm, whereas preoperative adenosine diphosphate or P2Y 12 inhibitor use was higher in the continuation arm. Surgical and intraoperative variables (Table 2) were similar between the ACEI/ARB continuation and discontinuation arms. A total of 50 patients (41.3%) were admitted to the CSICU with vasopressors or inotropes initiated in the operating room, and 43 (35.5%) were initiated in the CSICU. Intravenous vasodilators were initiated in 18 patients (14.9%) in the operating room and in 74 (61.2%) in the CSICU. No differences were observed between treatment arms.

Perioperative renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (ACEi/ARB) and outcomes — noncardiac surgery: Data on the potential risk and benefit of ACEi in the perioperative setting are controversial. A large cohort study found that patients who stopped their ACEi or ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome and intraoperative hypotension than those continuing therapy, whereas POISE-3, which randomized 7490 patients, did not find a significant difference between strategies of perioperative discontinuation versus maintenance during the operative and immediate perioperative periods. Omitting RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas randomized controlled trials have failed to prove that interruption or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

Prevention of postoperative AKI

Preoperative strategies

Surgery is sometimes performed in patients with established AKI; however, common perioperative interventions focus on prevention of PO-AKI (Box 3). As nephrotoxic drugs are an important preventable contributor to the risk of PO-AKI, exposure to these drugs should be limited whenever possible and the benefits of the intervention weighed against the risk of developing or worsening AKI. Although the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins is considered to be a cornerstone of AKI prevention, there is a relative paucity of data supporting this approach. However, routine use of gentamicin for surgical prophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of AKI following orthopaedic surgeryand, in the paediatric setting, systematic screening for nephrotoxin use, with a focus on close monitoring in patients exposed to multiple nephrotoxins and nephrotoxin cessation, has been shown to reduce rates of AKI.

At present, common practice is to discontinue use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs before surgery to avoid perioperative hypotension. This approach is assumed to reduce the risk of perioperative AKI based on physiological rationale. In line with this established practice, we recommend discontinuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs for a minimum of 24 h before surgery to minimize the risks of perioperative hypotension and/or postoperative AKI (Box 3). This recommendation is weak owing to limited data in support of this practice and is likely to be revised as more evidence becomes available. For instance, an analysis of 949 patients undergoing major gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary surgery failed to show a difference in the rates of AKI between those who did and those who did not have ACE inhibitors and ARBs withheld before surgery.

NSAIDs are generally avoided in surgical patients at a high risk of AKI, but might be beneficial as opiate-sparing agents in patients who are at a low risk of AKI. Although NSAIDs are widely used in patients with normal kidney function, their impact on risk of AKI in the postoperative period is unclear.

To date, no preoperative pharmacological intervention has been shown to reduce the risk of PO-AKI in RCTs. However, attention should be paid to ensuring euvolaemia prior to surgery and addressing or avoiding preoperative fluid losses caused by excessive fasting, bowel preparation and/or acute illness.

Statistical analysis

We determined that the enrolment of 260 patients (130 per trial group) would provide a power of 90% to determine a 20% absolute risk reduction in incidence of myocardial injury at an alpha level of 0.05, assuming a loss to follow-up of 5%. Sample size calculations were performed using STATA 14 (StataCorp, 2015, Stata Statistical Software: Release 14, College Station, TX).

All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, meaning that all randomly assigned patients with a recorded outcome for primary or secondary outcomes were included in the analysis, and analysed according to the group they were allocated. For analysis of the primary and each secondary outcome, we present: number of patients in each analysis, by treatment group; a summary statistic of the outcome [e.g. number (%)], by treatment group; estimated treatment effect and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI); and two-sided P -value. The treatment effects calculated were for continuing vs. discontinuing RAS inhibitors. For all analyses, significance level of 5% was used. Analysis was conducted with Stata (version 14). Full details are provided in the statistical analysis plan, which was published online on 13 October 2021.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) in CKD — benefits, harms, and monitoring: In randomized trials, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have consistently shown renal and cardiovascular benefits in proteinuric kidney disease, and they remain nephroprotective in those with GFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m². Adverse effects include acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, peripheral edema, hypotension, angioedema, cough, headache, and nausea, and they are associated with teratogenicity. KDIGO guidelines recommend that the initial dose should be lower for individuals with GFR < 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, with GFR and potassium measured within 1 week of starting, or after any dose escalation, and regularly thereafter. ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be temporarily discontinued during intercurrent illness, planned intravenous radiocontrast administration, bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy, or before major surgery, and contraindications include a history of allergy or angioedema and bilateral renal artery stenosis.

### Perioperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers for preventing mortality and morbidity in adults [^111p3oTu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative hypertension requires careful management. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown efficacy in treating hypertension associated with surgery. However, there is lack of consensus about whether they can prevent mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To systematically assess the benefits and harms of administration of ACEIs or ARBs perioperatively for the prevention of mortality and morbidity in adults (aged 18 years and above) undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia.

Search Methods

We searched the current issue of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to 8 December 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 8 December 2014), and references of the retrieved randomized trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perioperative administration of ACEIs or ARBs with placebo in adults (aged 18 years and above) undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which participants underwent procedures that required local anaesthesia only, or participants who had already been on ACEIs or ARBs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 571 participants in the review. Two of the seven trials involved 36 participants undergoing non-cardiac vascular surgery (infrarenal aortic surgery), and five involved 535 participants undergoing cardiac surgery, including valvular surgery, coronary artery bypass surgery, and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The intervention was started from 11 days to 25 minutes before surgery in six trials and during surgery in one trial. We considered all seven RCTs to carry a high risk of bias. The effects of ACEIs or ARBs on perioperative mortality and acute myocardial infarction were uncertain because the quality of the evidence was very low. The risk of death was 2.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 1.6% in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 5.85). The risk of acute myocardial infarction was 1.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 3.0% in the placebo group (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26). ACEIs or ARBs may improve congestive heart failure (cardiac index) perioperatively (mean difference (MD) -0.60; 95% CI -0.70 to -0.50, very low-quality evidence). In terms of rate of complications, there was no difference in perioperative cerebrovascular complications (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.28, very low-quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 4.41, very low-quality evidence). Cardiac surgery-related renal failure was not reported. ACEIs or ARBs were associated with shortened length of hospital stay (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.16, P value = 0.005, very low-quality evidence). These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to likely confounding by the clinical backgrounds of the participants. ACEIs or ARBs may shorten the length of hospital stay, (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.16, very low-quality evidence) Two studies reported adverse events, and there was no evidence of a difference between the ACEIs or ARBs and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, this review did not find evidence to support that perioperative ACEIs or ARBs can prevent mortality, morbidity, and complications (hypotension, perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and cardiac surgery-related renal failure). We found no evidence showing that the use of these drugs may reduce the rate of acute myocardial infarction. However, ACEIs or ARBs may increase cardiac output perioperatively. Due to the low and very low methodology quality, high risk of bias, and lack of power of the included studies, the true effect may be substantially different from the observed estimates. Perioperative (mainly elective cardiac surgery, according to included studies) initiation of ACEIs or ARBs therapy should be individualized.

### Preoperative activation of the renin-angiotensin system and myocardial injury in noncardiac surgery: exploratory mechanistic analysis of the SPACE randomised controlled trial [^112gxAh6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- Surgical patients most are commonly prescribed renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) for cardiometabolic disease and hypertension, but treatment is often suboptimal.
- In this prespecified mechanistic exploratory study of the SPACE trial, the authors hypothesised that endotypes of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activation predispose patients to postoperative myocardial injury independent of RASi cessation or continuation.
- Effective preoperative RAAS inhibition was associated with lower risk of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery independent of stopping or continuing RAAS inhibitors before surgery.
- Further work to explore whether continuation or preoperative intensification of RASi therapy might help reduce perioperative myocardial injury is warranted.

Despite advances in perioperative care, postoperative complications still lead to delayed recovery and accelerated mortality even after discharge from hospital. The complexity of perioperative pathophysiology necessitates, in part, a patient-specific approach to understand perioperative pathophysiology in more depth, thereby identifying opportunities to reduce the burden of postoperative complications.

Surgical patients most at risk of sustaining myocardial injury and subsequent complicationsafter noncardiac surgery, are commonly prescribed renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) for cardiometabolic disease and hypertension. Hypertension therapy in older adults is often suboptimal, which can impact on cardiac complications after noncardiac surgery by failing to reduce activation of the renin–angiotensin system and inflammation. The noncanonical axis of the renin–angiotensin system counteracts the deleterious effects of angiotensin II (ANG-II), largely through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). As a homologue of ACE, ACE2 converts ANG-II into the organ-protective mediator ang1–7. Dipeptidyl peptidase-3 (DPP-3) also positively regulates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway by degrading circulating ANG-II. Accordingly, inadequate treatment with RASi can predispose noncardiac surgical patients to organ injury by failing to reduce aldosterone through the negative feedback effect of ANG-II on renin release or maintaining cellular protection via the counter-regulatory RAAS.

In this prespecified, mechanistic exploratory study of the SPACE multicentre, randomised trial of stopping or continuing RASis according to their individual pharmacokinetic profile before noncardiac surgery, we hypothesised that endotypes of RAAS activation predispose patients to myocardial injury within 48 h of surgery independently of RASi cessation or continuation.

### Preoperative cardiovascular risk and postoperative outcomes by renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112Gr71L]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The STOP-or-NOT randomized clinical trial compared the outcomes of continuing vs discontinuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) prior to major noncardiac surgery and found no difference in the postoperative risk of death or major complications, but it remains unclear whether preoperative cardiovascular risk stratification influences the response to this intervention. This post hoc analysis explores whether preoperative cardiovascular risk stratification affects the outcomes in patients who continue vs discontinue RASi use before major surgery.

Objective

To evaluate whether preoperative cardiovascular risk stratification affects the strategy of RASi management before major noncardiac surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a post hoc analysis of the multicenter STOP-or-NOT randomized clinical trial, conducted across 40 hospitals in France between January 2018 and April 2023, with follow-up for 28 days postoperatively. Data analysis was performed from September 2024 to January 2025. The participants were patients who had been treated with RASi for at least 3 months and were scheduled for major noncardiac surgery.

Intervention

Patients were randomized to either continue RASi until the day of surgery or to discontinue RASi 48 hours prior to surgery.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and major postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events and acute kidney injury. Cardiovascular risk stratification was assessed with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), American University of Beirut (AUB)-HAS2 Cardiovascular Risk Index, and systolic blood pressure prior to randomization.

Results

Among the 2222 patients (median [IQR] age, 68 [61–73] years; 771 [35%] female), 1107 were randomized to RASi continuation and 1115 were randomized to RASi discontinuation. Using the RCRI, 592 patients were categorized as low risk (0 points), 1095 as intermediate-low risk (1 point), 418 as intermediate-high risk (2 points), and 117 as high risk (≥ 3 points). Using the AUB-HAS2 Cardiac Risk Index, 1049 patients were categorized as low risk (0 points), 727 as intermediate-low risk (1 point), 333 as intermediate-high risk (2 points), and 113 as high risk (≥ 3 points). A total of 2132 patients were split into 4 quartiles of preoperative systolic blood pressure. The risk of postoperative complications and major adverse cardiovascular events varied with RCRI score. However, a strategy of RASi continuation vs discontinuation was not associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications.

Conclusions

This study found that preoperative cardiovascular risk did not affect patient outcomes with respect to the strategy of continuing vs discontinuing RASi before major noncardiac surgery, suggesting that the decision to continue or discontinue RASi should not be influenced by a patient's preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Patients scheduled for surgical procedures — perioperative antihypertensive management and surgical timing: In patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on BBs chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the perioperative period to assist with BP control (1, B-NR). In patients with hypertension scheduled for elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the perioperative period (2a, C-EO). In patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery, discontinuation of ACEI or ARB preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery (2b, B-R). In patients scheduled for elective major surgery with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications (2b, C-LD). In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful (3: Harm, B-NR). For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality (3: Harm, B-R).

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^112r9iCd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Vasoplegic shock, which manifests as a low systemic vascular resistance, is common in the postoperative cardiac surgical population. 17 The association between preoperative ACEI or ARB use and postoperative vasoplegia, mediated in part through reduced vasopressor responsiveness, has been consistently described in observational studies, but prospective controlled trials are lacking. 5, 17, 18, 35 In this study, we observed a 30% overall incidence of vasoplegic shock, with no differences between the continuation and discontinuation arms. The incidence in this study is higher than that in previous reports, and we hypothesize that result this may be related to differences in study populations and hemodynamic definitions. Currently, there is no consensus definition of vasoplegic shock; previous observational studies have varying definitions that include vasopressor doses, mean arterial pressure, calculated hemodynamics, time, and/or cardiac filling pressures. 5, 17, 18, 20, 36 In this registry trial, we used a pragmatic vasoplegic shock definition based on duration of vasopressor requirements in a patient population at low risk of low cardiac output syndrome and in which the routine use invasive hemodynamic monitoring could not be clinically justified. Our study suggests that in patients predominantly undergoing isolated CABG surgery, the preoperative continuation of an ACEI or ARB is not associated with vasoplegic shock. Future controlled studies could potentially build on this study by incorporating routine hemodynamic monitoring in a patient population at potentially higher risk for vasoplegic shock such as valve, combined valve/CABG, mechanical circulatory support, and transplant surgeries.

### Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibition is safe in the preoperative period surrounding carotid endarterectomy [^1159zpt5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) medications before surgery has been suggested because of the potentially deleterious effects of hypotension. We investigated the effect of preoperative ACEI and/or ARB use on early outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

Methods

We examined 3752 consecutive CEA patients within the Vascular Study Group of New England from September 2012 to September 2014 and compared outcomes for patients treated (n = 1772) or not treated (n = 1980) with ACEI and/or ARB preoperatively. Outcomes included perioperative need for intravenous vasoactive medication (IVBPmed) for hypotension or hypertension (HTN), major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), and the combined outcome of stroke or death. Adjusted analysis was performed using multivariable logistic regression of the crude cohort and by constructing a propensity score matched cohort (n = 1441).

Results

ACEI and/or ARB users were more likely to be male (64% vs 59%; p = 0.001), with a higher prevalence of diabetes (41% vs 28%; P < .0001), HTN (97% vs 82%; P < .0001), coronary artery disease (31% vs 25%; p = 0.0001), congestive heart failure (10% vs 8%; p = 0.02), and asymptomatic carotid disease (59% vs 54%; p = 0.004). Patients who received ACEI and/or ARB preoperatively were more likely to be treated with aspirin (92% vs 88%; p = 0.0002) and statins (89% vs 85%; p = 0.001) preoperatively. In the unadjusted analysis, no significant differences were identified in hypotension that required IVBPmed (12% vs 11%; odds ratio [OR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–1.4; p = 0.22), MACE (3% vs 2%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8–1.9; p = 0.32), or stroke or death (3% vs 3%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7–1.6; p = 0.89) for preoperative ACEI and/or ARB treated and nontreated patients, respectively. Preoperative ACEI and/or ARB usage was, however, associated with HTN that required IVBPmed (13% vs 10%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.6; p = 0.01). Analysis of the propensity score matched cohort revealed no significant differences in hypotension that required IVBPmed (12% vs 12%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8–1.3; p = 0.86), MACE (3% vs 2%; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7–1.8; p = 0.62;), or stroke or death (3% vs 3%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7–1.6; p = 0.91) for patients treated or not treated with preoperative ACEI and/or ARB, respectively. ACEI and/or ARB remained associated with HTN that required IVBPmed (13% vs 10%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7; p = 0.02). Results were similar after adjustment using logistic regression. The incidence of hospital length of stay > 1 day was similar between ACEI and/or ARB treated and not treated patients (29% vs 32%; OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8–1.1; p = 0.21).

Conclusions

Preoperative ACEI and/or ARB use was associated with marginally increased use of IVBPmed for HTN but not for hypotension and was not associated with increased MACE, stroke, or death. On the basis of these metrics, the use of preoperative ACEI and/or ARB appears safe before CEA.

### Continuation versus discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors before noncardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113k77o8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The optimal management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) before noncardiac surgery remains unclear. Continuing RASIs may increase intraoperative hypotension, while discontinuation risks postoperative hypertension and heart failure. Current guidelines suggest withholding RASI 24 hours prior to surgery, but evidence is limited. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to clarify the risks and benefits of continuing versus withholding RASIs in this setting.

Design

A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analysis.

Setting

A comprehensive electronic search conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane from inception to August 2024.

Participants

Nine clinical trials that collectively enrolled 8,906 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

Interventions

A comparison of continuation versus discontinuation of RASIs preoperatively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcomes were intraoperative hypotension, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury (AKI) and postoperative hypertension. Patients who discontinued RASIs had a significantly lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.84) compared to those who continued treatment. No significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.40–1.85), MACE (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.87–1.17), AKI (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.22), and postoperative hypertension (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.92–2.68).

Conclusions

Continuation of RASIs significantly increased the risk of intraoperative hypotension compared to discontinuation of treatment. Overall, no significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality, MACE, AKI, or postoperative hypertension between patients who continued or discontinued RASIs preoperatively.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111fToTF]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Perioperative management of hypertension — surgical timing, BP targets, and medication handling are specified: Postponing necessary surgery is usually not warranted in grade 1 or 2 hypertension, whereas in those with an SBP > 180 mmHg and/or DBP > 110 mmHg, deferring the intervention until BP is reduced or controlled is advisable, except for emergency situations; it is important to avoid large preoperative BP fluctuations, with cohort data showing that maintaining a stable BP with a 70 mmHg threshold for SBP and pre‑induction BP values within 10% difference from the preoperative office SBP reduced postoperative organ dysfunction; there is no clear evidence in favour of against one or another antihypertensive treatment mode in non‑cardiac surgery, so general drug treatment algorithms apply; continuation of beta‑blockers is nevertheless recommended in hypertensive patients on chronic beta‑blocker treatment because abrupt discontinuation may lead to BP or heart rate rebounds, which may also occur with central agents such as clonidine; while the question has been raised whether RAS blockers should be discontinued before surgery, a large international cohort reported that withholding ACE inhibitors or ARBs 24 h before non‑cardiac surgery was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality 30 days after the intervention.

Abstract

Background and Aims

Haemodynamic instability is associated with peri-operative myocardial injury, particularly in patients receiving renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers). Whether stopping RAS inhibitors to minimise hypotension, or continuing RAS inhibitors to avoid hypertension, reduces peri-operative myocardial injury remains unclear.

Methods

From 31 July 2017 to 1 October 2021, patients aged ≥ 60 years undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to either discontinue or continue RAS inhibitors prescribed for existing medical conditions in six UK centres. Renin–angiotensin system inhibitors were withheld for different durations (2–3 days) before surgery, according to their pharmacokinetic profile. The primary outcome, masked to investigators, clinicians, and patients, was myocardial injury [plasma high-sensitivity troponin-T (hs-TnT) ≥ 15 ng/L within 48 h after surgery, or ≥ 5 ng/L increase when pre-operative hs-TnT ≥ 15 ng/L]. Pre-specified adverse haemodynamic events occurring within 48 h of surgery included acute hypertension (> 180 mmHg) and hypotension requiring vasoactive therapy.

Results

Two hundred and sixty-two participants were randomized to continue (n = 132) or stop (n = 130) RAS inhibitors. Myocardial injury occurred in 58 (48.3%) patients randomized to discontinue, compared with 50 (41.3%) patients who continued, RAS inhibitors [odds ratio (for continuing): 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45–1.31]. Hypertensive adverse events were more frequent when RAS inhibitors were stopped [16 (12.4%)], compared with 7 (5.3%) who continued RAS inhibitors [odds ratio (for continuing): 0.4; 95% CI 0.16–1.00]. Hypotension rates were similar when RAS inhibitors were stopped [12 (9.3%)] or continued [11 (8.4%)].

Conclusions

Discontinuing RAS inhibitors before non-cardiac surgery did not reduce myocardial injury, and could increase the risk of clinically significant acute hypertension. These findings require confirmation in future studies.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite overwhelming evidence that ACEi/ARB treatment reduces morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular patients, these recent concerns about a potential increase in the susceptibility for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with potentially deleterious outcome have already encouraged physicians to withhold ACEi/ARB treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease, despite a complete lack of evidence.

The present study adds novel data about the impact of ACEi/ARB treatment on cardiac and white blood cellular ACE2 mRNA expression in high‐risk patients undergoing heart surgery.

### Intraoperative cardiac arrest: was it the ACE inhibitor? [^111qynNa]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Continuing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonist therapy on the day of surgery is controversial, and appears to contribute to intraoperative hypotension. A patient presenting for cerebral aneurysm clipping continued her angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on the morning of surgery, and subsequently experienced significant postinduction hypotension that culminated in cardiac arrest. Following successful resuscitation, she returned 6 weeks later to have her aneurysm clipped using identical anesthetic management; her blood pressure medications were held on the day of surgery.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: the SPACE trial [^117WzcbJ]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

For most ACE-I alone, at least 24 h cessation is required. For example, the duration of action for lisinopril and ramipril, the commonest ACE-I used by patients recruited into SPACE, is 24 h, with half-life elimination times of 12–17 h, respectively. The lack of consistency in when RAS inhibitors have been stopped before — and restarted after — non-cardiac surgery explains, in part, the considerable variability in international recommendations for the management of RAS inhibitors in surgical patients. The current evidence base relies mostly on retrospective studies with a strong risk of bias and small, single-centre randomized trials that had non-blinded primary outcomes. A similar sized trial to ours examined haemodynamic changes after 275 patients were randomized to either continuing ACE-I or omitting a single ACE-I dose. Intra-operative hypotension occurred less frequently after ACE-I omission, accompanied by lower vasopressor use. Similar to our study, post-operative hypertension was more frequent when ACE-I were omitted, although fluid requirements did not differ between groups. In the absence of markers for organ injury, the relevance of these haemodynamic alterations remained unclear. Moreover, recent randomized controlled trial data do not support universally targeting higher intra-operative blood pressures to reduce post-operative complications.

In our study, we specifically focussed on older patients aged > 60 years, who are at most risk of myocardial injury, rather than younger patients (age ≥ 18 years) with markedly less risk of morbidity. Three ongoing, pragmatic multi-centre trials are also examining the management of RAS inhibitors in patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery. In contrast to our study, discontinuation of RAS inhibitors has not been designed in these studies according to individual pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs. Moreover, these trials do not protocolise when RAS inhibitor treatment should be resumed. Two large database studies in non-cardiacand cardiac surgeryhave identified that failure to restart RAS inhibitor treatment is strongly associated with excess morbidity and mortality, suggesting that protocolization of resuming therapy is likely to be an important confounder in interpreting unblinded outcomes beyond the early post-operative stage. Indeed, our data suggest that clinically significant acute hypertension is a notable feature of stopping RAS inhibitors peri-operatively. However, caution is warranted in interpreting these results, given the event rates. Furthermore, our post hoc analyses show that blood pressure lability is more common after discontinuation of RAS inhibitors, as evidenced by the combination of acute hypertension and intra-operative hypotension.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: the SPACE trial [^115qsK53]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Before randomization, systolic and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) readings in the pre-assessment clinic were similar between patients randomly allocated to either continue (systolic: 138 ± 20 mmHg; MAP: 95 ± 11 mmHg) or stop (systolic: 140 ± 21 mmHg; MAP: 97 ± 12 mmHg) their RAS inhibitor. On the day of surgery, the first arterial blood pressure reading did not change from pre-assessment clinic readings in patients allocated to continue RAS inhibitors (+3 mmHg, 95% CI −3 to 8 mmHg). Both systolic and MAP readings were higher in patients who had been randomized to stop RAS inhibitors, compared to their pre-operative readings. Systolic blood pressure increased by 16 mmHg, 95% CI 10–22 mmHg; MAP increased by 10 mmHg, 95% CI 6–13 mmHg. The clinical management was similar between patients randomized to either stop or continue their RAS inhibitor (Table 3).

Table 3
Peri-operative management

Primary outcome

From the 241/260 patients who had blood samples collected (Table 4), myocardial injury occurred in 50 (41%) patients who continued RAS inhibitor therapy, compared to 58 (48%) patients who discontinued RAS inhibitors (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.45–1.31; p = 0.33) by 48 h after surgery. Sixty-two patients had hs-TnT > 15 ng/L before surgery (31 in each group); for patients without a pre-operative troponin elevation, myocardial injury was sustained by 19/90 (21%) patients who continued RAS inhibitor therapy, compared to 27/89 (30%) patients who discontinued RAS inhibitors. The results from the sensitivity analysis indicate that the analysis of the primary outcome is robust to departures from the missing-at-random assumption, as detailed in the Supplementary data online. When we excluded patients who had regional anaesthesia with sedation, the primary outcome was observed in 46/111 (41.4%) patients who continued their RAS inhibitor, compared with 55/108 (50.9%) patients allocated to stop (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.40–1.16).

### Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI) international consensus statement on perioperative arterial pressure management [^112Qf2zU]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypotension is common in postoperative patients because of antihypertensive medications, inadequate intravenous fluid administration, adverse effects of some anaesthetic drugs, intraoperative and ongoing blood loss, the inflammatory response to surgery, arrhythmias, and impaired myocardial function. Most hospitals therefore establish guidance on when to alert medical staff, for example, when systolic arterial pressure is < 90 mm Hg. Postoperative hypotension often goes undetected, and lasts longer than intraoperative hypotension.

Large observational studies have identified associations between postoperative hypotension and organ injury, especially acute kidney injury, cardiovascular events, readmission, and mortality. Harm thresholds appear to be an absolute systolic arterial pressure of 90–100 mm Hg or a mean arterial pressure of 60–75 mm Hg. Longer cumulative duration of postoperative hypotension is associated with higher risk.

A challenge is that it has proven difficult to modify postoperative arterial pressures. For example, a delayed restart of chronic antihypertensive medications has no appreciable effect on ward arterial pressures. Trials show that avoiding beta blockersand clonidinereduces the risk of hypotension. Observational analyses suggest that avoiding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers also reduces hypotension. However, in the SPACE trial, a six-centre trial of 262 patients aged ≥ 60 yr who had elective noncardiac surgery, discontinuing vs continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers did not reduce myocardial injury or hypotension within 48 h of surgery. Beta blockers reduce the risk of myocardial injury but cause hypotension (and strokes). Avoiding clonidine does not reduce organ injury despite less severe hypotension. The effects of avoiding perioperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers need to be evaluated in further trials. It thus remains unclear whether postoperative hypotension is causally related to organ injury.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^112p5iEc]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

CPB-induced inflammatory mediators stimulate iNOS and cause increased release of NO, leading to profound vasodilation. This inflammatory response is similar to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that occurs most notably in sepsis and is further compounded by the innate inflammatory response to surgical trauma, yielding increased inflammation and subsequent loss of vascular tone. As CPB continues, a secondary immune response occurs as a result of the reinfusion of blood from the thoracic cavity through the CPB circuit. A combination of hemolyzed red blood cells, platelets, and recirculated denatured proteins stimulates a secondary immune response. When non-pulsatile CPB is discontinued and pulsatile tissue reperfusion re-occurs, a microvascular ischemia-reperfusion injury leads to further NO production and vasodilation.

In severe cases of vasoplegia, norepinephrine responsiveness may be blunted by a number of mechanisms. Adrenergic receptors become phosphorylated inhibiting binding of catecholamines, and increased production of NO interferes with adrenergic receptor activation. These factors in combination with AVP deficiency, acidosis, and cell membrane hyperpolarization secondary to K ATP channel stimulation all contribute to the vasoplegic state.

Patient- and treatment-specific factors also contribute to the development of vasoplegia following CPB. Argenziano et al. examined 145 patients undergoing CPB and found that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35% was independently associated with the development of post-CPB vasodilatory shock. This correlation may be due in part to a sustained inflammatory state caused by chronic tissue hypoperfusion and ischemia that is common in patients with heart failure with reduced LVEF. The authors also found the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prior to CPB to be an independent predictor of post-CPB vasodilatory shock. ACE inhibitors are commonly used medications in this patient population, and other common medications include beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, which may also be associated with increased risk of vasoplegia. The use of vasodilatory inotropes such as dobutamine or milrinone, common both before and after cardiac surgery, may contribute to vasoplegic shock. In addition, patients receiving vasopressors prior to cardiac surgery are also at increased risk.

### Should renin-angiotensin system inhibitors be held prior to major surgery? [^111yVFSq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Many patients undergoing surgical procedures have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or a combination. Often, these conditions involve the chronic use of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Observational studies have suggested that continuing ACEIs/ARBs before major noncardiac surgery can increase the risk of intraoperative hypotension, which might drive postoperative complications such as acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, or stroke. Strong recommendations on how to manage ACEIs/ARBs before surgery are, however, lacking owing to insufficient evidence, mostly limited to data from observational studies. Recently, the SPACE trial investigated the impact of preoperative management of ACEIs/ARBs on postoperative myocardial injury. Myocardial injury occurred in 48.3% patients randomised to discontinue and 41.3% patients randomised to continue ACEI/ARB (odds ratio for continuing: 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.45–1.31). Patients randomised to the 'Stop' group experienced more postoperative hypertension. In a post hoc analysis, patients randomised to the 'Continue' group with low preoperative NT-proBNP concentrations (< 100 pg mL ⁻¹) experienced less myocardial injury after surgery than the 'Stop' group, whereas no significant difference was observed in patients with elevated preoperative NT-proBNP concentrations. The SPACE trial provides important and new reassuring data on the safety of continuing ACEIs/ARBs before major surgery, challenging previous beliefs.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1157D8CQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension — blood pressure (BP) targets and surgical timing: Expert opinion states BP control to levels recommended by this guideline (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) before major elective procedures is reasonable, and if oral agents cannot be used, intravenous medications are reasonable to control BP. Caution is advised when continuing therapy in patients with low perioperative BPs, older adults (age ≥ 65 years), and those at high risk for perioperative hypotension. Evidence is conflicting for delaying surgery when diastolic BP (DBP) is > 110 mm Hg; preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications, and increased cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal failure has been reported with DBP > 110 mm Hg, whereas DBP < 110 mm Hg does not appear to confer significantly increased risk. During anesthesia induction, a sympathetic reaction can produce a 20 to 30 mm Hg BP rise in patients with normal BP. An elevated day-of-surgery BP may reflect white-coat hypertension; referring to baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide management. Without evidence of increased perioperative risk when preoperative SBP/DBP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery, and BP can be managed postoperatively or after discharge.

### Management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors prior to major surgery: insights from the STOP-or-NOT trial [^116TPXAU]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Strong recommendations on how to manage renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, before surgery are lacking because of a lack of evidence, which is mostly limited to data from observational studies. The STOP-or-NOT trial was a large multicentre randomised trial designed to determine whether chronic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors should be continued or discontinued before major noncardiac surgery. As principal investigators of the STOP-or-NOT trial, we discuss the trial's results and how they contribute to the existing literature on management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors before surgery.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128abZj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

An increasing number of patients who have hypertension and chronic heart diseases continue to be scheduled for elective surgery. However, for those patients who use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), the question of whether these medications should be continued or discontinued on the day of surgery remains under discussion. ACEIs/ARBs are not only widely used as antihypertensive medications, but also for treating chronic heart diseases or other diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, the use of ACEIs/ARBs has shown various beneficial effects.

However, patients using ACEIs/ARBs have been reported to be prone to side effects like hypotension and even refractory hypotension during the administration of anesthesia. Therefore, some anesthetists have suggested the possibility of discontinuing these drugs in order to maintain the patient's hemodynamic stability during surgery. However, other research has shown that the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs preoperatively did not decrease the incidence of hypotension, and that the recommendation of discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs should be taken with reservations. One study indicated that patients who discontinued these drugs on the day of surgery required more vasodilators to control hypertension after surgery. Regardless of the predominant opinion, it is clear that the present concerns regarding continuing or discontinuing these drugs before surgery need to be explored. Besides being first-line antihypertensive drugs, these drugs also decrease morbidity and mortality, and prevent secondary strokes in patients with chronic heart diseases.

In order to clarify the consequences of continuing patients on ACEIs/ARBs on the day of their scheduled surgery, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.

### Continuation vs discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors before major noncardiac surgery: the stop-or-not randomized clinical trial [^117FZxqQ]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Before surgery, the best strategy for managing patients who are taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) is unknown. The lack of evidence leads to conflicting guidelines.

Objective

To evaluate whether a continuation strategy vs a discontinuation strategy of RASIs before major noncardiac surgery results in decreased complications at 28 days after surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial that included patients who were being treated with a RASI for at least 3 months and were scheduled to undergo a major noncardiac surgery between January 2018 and April 2023 at 40 hospitals in France.

Intervention

Patients were randomized to continue use of RASIs (n = 1107) until the day of surgery or to discontinue use of RASIs 48 hours prior to surgery (ie, they would take the last dose 3 days before surgery) (n = 1115).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and major postoperative complications within 28 days after surgery. The key secondary outcomes were episodes of hypotension during surgery, acute kidney injury, postoperative organ failure, and length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit during the 28 days after surgery.

Results

Of the 2222 patients (mean age, 67 years [SD, 10 years]; 65% were male), 46% were being treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at baseline and 54% were being treated with angiotensin receptor blockers. The rate of all-cause mortality and major postoperative complications was 22% (245 of 1115 patients) in the RASI discontinuation group and 22% (247 of 1107 patients) in the RASI continuation group (risk ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.87–1.19]; p = 0.85). Episodes of hypotension during surgery occurred in 41% of the patients in the RASI discontinuation group and in 54% of the patients in the RASI continuation group (risk ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.19–1.44]). There were no other differences in the trial outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients who underwent major noncardiac surgery, a continuation strategy of RASIs before surgery was not associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications than a discontinuation strategy.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: the SPACE trial [^1152NzZx]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this trial was that the incidence of myocardial injury was similar between patients who stopped and continued RAS inhibitors during the peri-operative period. However, patients who stopped RAS inhibitors did experience more hypertensive events. By contrast, there was no difference between groups in the need for vasoactive therapy to treat hypotension within 48 h of surgery (Structured Graphical Abstract). We also noted that the relative risk of myocardial injury between groups, if replicated in a larger clinical effectiveness trial, may indicate significant benefits to continuing RAS inhibitors during the peri-operative period. It is also important to emphasise that we used a drug-specific protocol for stopping different RAS inhibitors before surgery, to ensure the duration reflected the pharmacokinetic profile of each drug.

Peri-operative trials examining whether RAS inhibitors are organ protective or detrimental have been inconsistent. A major factor in the interpretation of preceding studies is when RAS inhibitors were stopped and when they were restarted. Until SPACE, no preceding trials have adopted a pharmacokinetically based rationale for stopping RAS inhibitors. In contrast to the recently published pragmatic hypotension-avoidance trial embedded in POISE-3, our trial specifically targeted RAS inhibitors. Moreover, we stopped ACE-I/ARB in an individualized manner, based on their distinct pharmacokinetic properties. Given that this class of drugs was stopped < 24 h before surgery in POISE-3, it seems very unlikely that their withdrawal would meaningfully impact on blood pressure on the day of surgery. Indeed, our individualized protocol resulted in substantially higher pre-operative arterial blood pressure when RAS inhibitors were stopped. The pre-operative omission of other cardiovascular drugs in POISE-3, as well as their reintroduction after surgery, was a highly complex intervention with lower compliance than we achieved with SPACE (e.g. 57%–68% on the day of surgery).

### Impact of renin-angiotensin system blockers on mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery [^116MU2JC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Continuation of preoperative RASBs and initiation of RASBs before discharge is associated with decreased 30‐day and 1‐year mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery. Given the findings of our study and prior investigators, continuation of preoperative RASBs or initiation in the early postoperative period should be considered in most patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^112n3VUv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery improves long‐term survival in patients with diabetes mellitus or complex multivessel disease. 1, 2, 3 Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce mortality and subsequent cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing CABG when initiated at least 4 weeks preoperatively. 4

High‐quality studies from which to guide practice regarding perioperative ACEI or ARB management strategies in patients undergoing CABG are lacking. Observational studies, without standardized perioperative medication management, have reported that preoperative ACEI or ARB use is associated with an increased risk of postoperative vasoplegic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), and mortality; however, other studies have reported that preoperative ACEIs or ARBs are associated with a reduced risk of perioperative myocardial infarction with no increased risk of AKI or death. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The only randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date enrolled 40 patients undergoing CABG and randomized participants to preoperative ACEI continuation or discontinuation the day before surgery. It has been reported that ACEI‐withdrawal patients required fewer vasopressors during cardiopulmonary bypass but more intravenous vasodilators to control postoperative hypertension. 16 High‐quality studies examining the postoperative clinical and hemodynamic outcomes associated with preoperative ACEI or ARB management strategies are currently lacking.

Evaluating the best perioperative ACEI and ARB management practices for postoperative outcomes has important implications for clinical care and resource utilization. Vasoplegic shock and AKI, which have been associated with preoperative ACEI or ARB continuation, are potential risk factors for prolonged cardiac surgical intensive care unit (CSICU) length of stay (LOS) and mortality. 17, 18, 19, 20 Conversely, withdrawal is a known precipitant of acute heart failure and increases the risk of postoperative hypertension. 16, 21 The conflicting available low‐quality data reflect equipoise in contemporary clinical practice reported in a survey of practicing cardiovascular surgeons. 22 Accordingly, in a pragmatic registry‐based pilot RCT, we evaluated feasibility, hemodynamic, clinical, and health resource utilization end points in patients undergoing on‐pump cardiac surgery randomized to preoperative continuation or discontinuation of an ACEI or ARB.

### Angiotensin receptor blockade improves cardiac surgical outcomes in patients with metabolic syndrome [^1178kNUZ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) in patients undergoing cardiac operations remains controversial. The current practice of discontinuing renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors preoperatively may negate their beneficial effects in vulnerable populations, including patients with metabolic syndrome, who exhibit elevated renin-angiotensin system activity. We hypothesized that preoperative ARB use is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative complications, compared with ACEi or no drug, in patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

Methods

We used propensity matching to derive a cohort of 1,351 patients from 2,998 who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting based on preoperative use of ARBs, ACEis, or no renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors. Our primary end point was a composite of adverse events occurring within 30 days after the operation: new-onset atrial fibrillation/flutter, arrhythmia requiring cardioversion, perioperative myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, need for dialysis, cerebrovascular accidents, acute respiratory failure, or perioperative death.

Results

At least one adverse event occurred in 524 (38.8%) of matched cohort patients (1,184 [39.6% of all patients]). Adjusting for European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation and metabolic syndrome in the matched cohort, preoperative use of ARBs was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events in patients with metabolic syndrome compared with preoperative use of no renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.99) or ACEis (odds ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.88).

Conclusions

Preoperative use of ARBs, but not ACEis, confers a benefit within 30 days after cardiac operations in patients with metabolic syndrome, suggesting potential efficacy differences of these drug classes in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and death in ambulatory vs surgical patients.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: the SPACE trial [^117D3Tig]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Haemodynamic instability is associated with peri-operative myocardial injury, particularly in patients receiving renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers). Whether stopping RAS inhibitors to minimise hypotension, or continuing RAS inhibitors to avoid hypertension, reduces peri-operative myocardial injury remains unclear.

Methods

From 31 July 2017 to 1 October 2021, patients aged ≥ 60 years undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to either discontinue or continue RAS inhibitors prescribed for existing medical conditions in six UK centres. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors were withheld for different durations (2–3 days) before surgery, according to their pharmacokinetic profile. The primary outcome, masked to investigators, clinicians, and patients, was myocardial injury [plasma high-sensitivity troponin-T (hs-TnT) ≥ 15ng/L within 48h after surgery, or ≥ 5ng/L increase when pre-operative hs-TnT ≥ 15ng/L]. Pre-specified adverse haemodynamic events occurring within 48h of surgery included acute hypertension (> 180mmHg) and hypotension requiring vasoactive therapy.

Results

Two hundred and sixty-two participants were randomized to continue (n = 132) or stop (n = 130) RAS inhibitors. Myocardial injury occurred in 58 (48.3%) patients randomized to discontinue, compared with 50 (41.3%) patients who continued, RAS inhibitors [odds ratio (for continuing): 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45–1.31]. Hypertensive adverse events were more frequent when RAS inhibitors were stopped [16 (12.4%)], compared with 7 (5.3%) who continued RAS inhibitors [odds ratio (for continuing): 0.4; 95% CI 0.16–1.00]. Hypotension rates were similar when RAS inhibitors were stopped [12 (9.3%)] or continued [11 (8.4%)].

Conclusions

Discontinuing RAS inhibitors before non-cardiac surgery did not reduce myocardial injury, and could increase the risk of clinically significant acute hypertension. These findings require confirmation in future studies.

### Patterns of use of perioperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass: effects on in-hospital morbidity and mortality [^112AguYi]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite proven benefit in ambulatory patients with ischemic heart disease, the pattern of use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in coronary artery bypass graft surgery has been erratic and controversial.

Methods and Results

This is a prospective observational study of 4224 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cohort included 1838 patients receiving ACEI therapy before surgery and 2386 (56.5%) without ACEI exposure. Postoperatively, the pattern of ACEI use yielded 4 groups: continuation, 915 (21.7%); withdrawal, 923 (21.8%); addition, 343 (8.1%); and no ACEI, 2043 (48.4%). Continuous treatment with ACEI versus no ACEI was associated with substantive reductions of risk of nonfatal events (adjusted odds ratio for the composite outcome, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.91; P = 0.009) and a cardiovascular event (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.88; P = 0.006). Addition of ACEI de novo postoperatively compared with no ACEI therapy was also associated with a significant reduction of risk of composite outcome (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.84; P = 0.004) and a cardiovascular event (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–0.97; P = 0.04). On the other hand, continuous treatment of ACEI versus withdrawal of ACEI was associated with decreased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.66; P < 0.001), as well as a decrease in cardiac and renal events (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). No differences in in-hospital mortality and cerebral events were noted.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that withdrawal of ACEI treatment after coronary artery bypass graft surgery is associated with nonfatal in-hospital ischemic events. Furthermore, continuation of ACEI or de novo ACEI therapy early after cardiac surgery is associated with improved in-hospital outcomes.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WMEuP]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the data available at the time this study was conducted did not provide sufficient evidence to support that continuing ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery in patients who chronically received these drugs is associated with obvious disadvantages. No significant incidences of severe or refractory hypotension or postoperative ischemia-related complications were observed between those patients continuing ACEIs/ARBs and those who either discontinued these drugs or continued using other antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, evidence supporting the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery is lacking. However, anesthetists should be cautious about the possibility of hypotension in patients chronically receiving ACEIs/ARBs, and should know how to treat it effectively. To explore the long-term effects of continuing or discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs in patients, RCTs involving a large number of patients are required.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) — antihypertensive medications should be managed proactively; the need for antihypertensive medications should be evaluated repeatedly and frequently during the active phase of weight loss, as RYGB has been associated with hypertension resolution in a significant proportion of patients with preexisting hypertension and may occur as early as 1 week postoperatively. Frequent monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications to prevent sequelae of hypotension is recommended. Selective guidance specifies that diuretics should be restarted with caution, especially in the early postoperative period; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should be continued or restarted early after RYGB, because the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs has been found to be independently associated with an increased risk for acute kidney injury; and beta-blockers may be restarted after RYGB, with limited studies showing no difference in the bioavailability of immediate and controlled-release metoprolol after RYGB.

Finally, while our study and the weight of evidence from prior research clearly demonstrate the long‐term benefits of RASBs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the appropriate timing and protocol for initiation or resumption of these medications remains unclear given the concerns for short‐term adverse events (intraoperative and early postoperative). While some experts have reported the safety 47 of clear institutional protocols, which can help avoid many of these short‐term adverse events, yet providing the long‐term cardiovascular benefits, these are not widely tested. This lacuna in evidence is clearly a reason for the variable practice patterns. 43 While a few studies have clearly demonstrated that a strategy of continuation of preoperative RASB is safe compared with routine discontinuation, 48 such evidence is lacking regarding the postoperative approaches with no validated protocols that have been tested in a prospective well‐designed study. Factors such as intraoperative events, postoperative hemodynamics, and patient risk and comorbidities should all be considerations that dictate the timing and dose of the RASB initiation or resumption. Therefore, a protocolized approach that can be individualized is necessary for minimizing short‐term adverse effects and maximizing long‐term benefits of RASBs in these patients. Given the retrospective nature of our study, these various factors could not be assessed, and future research is necessary.

### A systematic review of outcomes associated with withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers before noncardiac surgery [^115bVAQT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The global rate of major noncardiac surgical procedures is increasing annually, and of those patients presenting for surgery, increasing numbers are taking either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The current recommendations of whether to continue or withhold ACE-I and ARB in the perioperative period are conflicting. Previous meta-analyses have linked preoperative ACE-I/ARB therapy to the increased incidence of postinduction hypotension; however, they have failed to correlate this with adverse patient outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether continuation or withholding ACE-I or ARB therapy in the perioperative period is associated with mortality and major morbidity.

Methods

This meta-analysis was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017055291). A comprehensive search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (EBSCO host), ProQuest, Cochrane database, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted on December 6, 2016. We included adult patients > 18 years of age on chronic ACE-I or ARB therapy who underwent noncardiac surgery in which ACE-I or ARB was either withheld or continued on the morning of surgery. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and major cardiac events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included the risk of congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, stroke, intraoperative/postoperative hypotension, and the length of hospital stay.

Results

After abstract review, the full text of 25 studies was retrieved, of which 9 fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 5 were randomized control trials, and 4 were cohort studies. These studies included a total of 6022 patients on chronic ACE-I/ARB therapy before noncardiac surgery. A total of 1816 patients withheld treatment the morning of surgery and 4206 continued their ACE-I/ARB. Preoperative demographics were similar between the 2 groups. Withholding ACE-I/ARB therapy was not associated with a difference in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–1.52; I = 0%) or MACE (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.82–1.52; I = 0%). However, withholding therapy was associated with significantly less intraoperative hypotension (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.85; I = 71%). No effect estimate could be pooled concerning length of hospital stay and congestive heart failure.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis did not demonstrate an association between perioperative administration of ACE-I/ARB and mortality or MACE. It did, however, confirm the current observation that perioperative continuation of ACE-I/ARBs is associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative hypotension. A large randomized control trial is necessary to determine the appropriate perioperative management of ACE-I and ARBs.

Best practice: the treatment of hypertension

This section summarises the recommendations for primary care following the diagnosis of hypertension. There is good evidence (GRADE 1A) for the treatment of hypertension with one or more of the following: diuretics (thiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide); beta‐blockers; calcium channel‐blockers (CCB); angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or an angiotensin‐2 receptor blocker (ARB) 1. In the future, the threshold for treating high blood pressure might change to cardiovascular risk (see below, the treatment of cardiovascular risk, not hypertension).

Step 1 treatment

Patients aged less than 55 years should be offered an ACE inhibitor, or a low‐cost ARB. If an ACE inhibitor is prescribed but is not tolerated (for example, because of cough), offer a low‐cost ARB. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. An ACE inhibitor should not be combined with an ARB.

Patients aged over 55 years and Black patients of African or Caribbean family origin of any age should be offered a CCB. If a CCB is not suitable, for example because of oedema or intolerance, or if there is evidence of heart failure or a high risk of heart failure, a thiazide‐like diuretic should be offered.

If diuretic treatment is to be initiated or changed, offer a thiazide‐like diuretic, such as chlorthalidone (12.5–25.0 mg once daily), or indapamide (1.5 mg modified‐release once daily or 2.5 mg once daily), in preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide.

For patients who are already having treatment with bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide and whose blood pressure is stable and well controlled, treatment with the bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide should be continued.

Beta‐blockers are not a preferred initial therapy for hypertension. However, beta‐blockers may be considered in younger patients, particularly those with an intolerance or contraindication to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, or women of childbearing potential or patients with evidence of increased sympathetic drive. If beta‐blockers are started and a second drug is required, add a CCB rather than a thiazide‐like diuretic to reduce the person's risk of developing diabetes.

### Clinical consequences of withholding versus administering renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period [^116gDgtj]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalists involved in perioperative care either stop or continue until the day of surgery renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists (either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI] or angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 antagonists [ARA]) in patients who use these agents chronically. This practice variation reflects uncertainty regarding the risks and benefits of either approach.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical consequences of preoperatively continuing versus withholding ACEI/ARAs in patients treated chronically with these agents.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We comprehensively searched 7 major electronic databases, considered references from selected reviews, hand-searched journals, and communicated with experts. We included randomized trials and observational studies.

Data Extraction

We evaluated the relative risk (RR) of hypotension requiring vasopressors and of myocardial infarction in patients who did or did not receive an immediate preoperative dose of ACEI or ARA.

Data Synthesis

Random-effects meta-analysis from 5 studies totaling 434 patients suggested that patients receiving an immediate preoperative ACEI/ARA dose were more likely (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15–1.96) to develop hypotension requiring vasopressors at or shortly after induction of anesthesia. Sufficient data were not available to assess other outcomes.

Conclusion

Preoperative administration of ACEI/ARAs increases intraoperative hypotension. The long-term clinical consequences of continuing versus withholding preoperative ACEI/ARAs are unknown. This uncertainty stems in part from the absence to date of randomized trials designed specifically to examine patient-important consequences of this decision.

Methods

Trial design and oversight

Before the trial started, SPACE was registered as a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product with Eudract on 2016–004141–90. The trial was also registered before the first patient was recruited with the International Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Registry on 29 May 2017 as ISRCTN17251494 (doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN17251494).

Patients underwent screening at six centres in the UK. The trial protocol (Supplementary data online) was approved by the London (City and East) Research Ethics Committee (16/LO/1495), the Health Research Authority (UK), and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK). The trial was funded by the British Oxygen Company research chair grant from the Royal College of Anaesthetists, administered by the National Institute for Academic Anaesthesia and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); no industry support was provided. An independent steering committee whose members were unaware of trial-group assignments oversaw the conduct of the trial (Supplementary data online). A data and safety monitoring committee monitored patient safety in an unblinded manner (Supplementary data online).

Patients

Adults prescribed RAS inhibitors aged ≥ 60 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status grade 3 or above undergoing elective major surgery requiring general anaesthesia lasting longer than 120 min were eligible. Exclusion criteria included current participation in any other interventional clinical trials and myocardial infarction within the 3 months preceding surgery. We did not exclude patients taking ACE-I/ARB for left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 50%). All patients provided written informed consent.

Randomization

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to discontinue or to continue RAS inhibitors. Randomization was performed by a centralized internet-based system. Minimization was used to ensure balance between the two groups for the following variables: centre, planned surgical procedure category, and ACE-I/ARB (ACE-I, ARB, or both). Each participant was allocated with 80% probability to the treatment group that minimizes between group differences in these factors among all participants recruited to the trial to date, and to the alternative group with 20% probability.

5.1 Peri-Procedural Complications

Hemorrhage, hepatocellular injury, and thromboembolic events have been observed when HEPZATO has been administered via hepatic intra-arterial administration. Administration of HEPZATO requires general anesthesia and extracorporeal bypass of circulation which may cause life threatening or fatal adverse effects. Ensure the patient is euvolemic but do not overhydrate the patient. Monitor for these peri-procedural complications during the procedure and for at least 72 hours following the procedure.

To mitigate the risk of thromboembolic events, administer anticoagulation as described in the IFU during the procedure.

Due to the risk of bleeding, do not use in patients with uncorrectable coagulopathies and delay treatment with the HEPZATO KIT for at least 4 weeks after surgery or other medical procedure involving the liver. Platelets and clotting factors may be removed during the HEPZATO KIT procedure. Monitor platelets and coagulation parameters as described in the IFU. If life-threatening bleeding occurs during the procedure, reverse anticoagulation as described in the IFU and correct coagulopathy as appropriate. Discontinue anticoagulation with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants prior to the procedure; resume when hemostasis has been restored after the procedure, provided no bleeding complications have been observed. Refer to the Prescribing Information of the anticoagulant agent for bridging recommendations for anti-coagulation prior to surgical procedures. Discontinue drugs affecting platelet function such as aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other anti-platelet drugs one week before the procedure.

Patients with abnormal hepatic vascular (especially arterial supply) or biliary (especially re-implantation of bile duct) anatomy or gastric acid hypersecretion syndromes may be at increased risk of peri-procedural complications or other severe adverse reactions. Screen patients for a history of prior surgeries involving the bile duct to assess whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for HEPZATO KIT and monitor patients for adverse reactions following HEPZATO KIT administration.

Procedure-related reductions in blood pressure including severe hypotension can occur during the HEPZATO KIT procedure. Closely monitor blood pressure during the procedure. Patients may require fluid support and vasopressors. To reduce the risk of severe hypotension, assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, and temporarily discontinue ACE-inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, or alpha-1-adrenergic blockers for at least 5 half-lives prior to treatment with the HEPZATO-KIT. If necessary, use other short-acting antihypertensive drugs to manage blood pressure during the peri-procedure period.

### Association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use prior to major elective surgery and the risk of acute dialysis [^116DS8Wc]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Study strengths and limitations

Our study has several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to describe the association between preoperative ACEi/ARB use and AKI-D (over 230,000 patients from 118 hospitals). We included both cardiac and non-cardiac major surgeries. Unlike other studies, the large number of events of AKI-D (810 events) reduced concerns about statistical overfitting. Given there is < 1% yearly emigration from Ontario, the loss to follow up was minimal. Finally, the information available within the large Ontario health care databases reflects routine clinical practice and may be less prone to participation biases that can arise in other types of studies.

There are several limitations to our study. Due to possible difference in underlying mechanism for the risk of postoperative acute dialysis in emergent surgeries compared to elective surgeries, we excluded emergent surgeries from our analyses. In an emergency situation it is also difficult to manipulate pre-operative medication use. However, exclusion of emergency surgeries may have reduced the generalizability of the study results. We could not determine medication compliance from evidence of a dispensed prescription for ACEi, ARB, or other medications in our data sources. Our study was limited by the absence of key information on perioperative ACEi/ARB use particularly whether it was held prior to surgery and if so when it was held, and when it was restarted after surgery. Important information such as preoperative and intraoperative blood pressure was also not available. These are key elements to guide the optimal and safe use of ACEi/ARB use in the perioperative period, including regimens to be tested in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We were also not able to adjust for variables unavailable in our data sources such as body mass index, preoperative proteinuria, non-prescription medication use and in hospital medication use. Another limitation with our data sources is the accuracy of codes for patient related health information. In attempt to limit these concerns, we did use database codes supported by validation studies whenever possible.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors slow recovery from anemia following cardiac surgery [^111cbNPK]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are frequently administered in patients with heart disease, have a known inhibitory effect on erythropoiesis. The aim of this study was to detect whether early ACE inhibitor administration slows recovery from anemia following recent cardiac surgery.

Methods and Results

Forty male patients with anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL) an average of 9 days after cardiac surgery were randomized to receive enalapril (ACE inhibitor group) or not. All of the patients received ferrous sulfate, 525 mg, in addition to standard therapy. Patients with anemia due to other causes were excluded. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, and after 8 days, 16 days, and 60 days. A 6-min walking test and echocardioscan were performed at baseline, and after 16 days and 60 days of treatment, and a chest radiograph was obtained at baseline and after 60 days. The ACE inhibitor group showed a statistically significant lower increase in hemoglobin and RBC values. The peak between-group differences of 1 g/dL of hemoglobin (p = 0.012) and 444 RBCs per milliliter (p = 0.017) were observed on day 16.

Conclusions

Early enalapril maleate administration in anemic patients after heart surgery significantly inhibits erythropoiesis. This unfavorable effect on anemia should be considered when prescribing ACE inhibitors for such patients.

### ACE inhibitors in cardiac surgery: current studies and controversies [^1134MCje]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Major complications associated with cardiac surgery are still common and carry great prognostic significance. Current medical interventions to prevent these cardiovascular complications include antiplatelet therapy, statins, β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Both experimental studies and clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibitors hold promise as cardiovascular protective agents for cardiac surgery patients. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, long-term use of ACE inhibitors has been well established to provide cardiovascular protection and reduce ischemic events and complications, independent of their effect on heart function and blood pressure. Second, early ACE inhibitor therapy has been demonstrated to produce remarkable survival and heart function benefits in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Third, ACE blockage can prevent or delay the development or progression of renal disease at all stages, from subclinical microalbuminuria to end-stage renal disease. Nevertheless, perioperative studies of the effects of ACE inhibitors remain few and inconclusive. Results from recent clinical trials and observational studies are conflicting and raise more questions than answers. Further studies, both retrospective and larger-scale prospective studies, are critically needed to examine whether ACE inhibitors reduce mortality and major complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^113xffz4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A pragmatic randomized clinical study of preoperative ACEI or ARB continuation or discontinuation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery was feasible, and no differences were observed in the incidence of vasoplegic shock, postoperative intravenous vasopressors or vasodilators requirements, AKI, duration of mechanical ventilation, or CSICU LOS between study arms. These findings suggest that preoperative ACEI/ARB management is not associated with postcardiac surgery hemodynamic outcomes. These findings may serve to inform the design and event rates of a larger future randomized trial.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management in noncardiac surgery — continuation of chronic therapy and target blood pressure: If well tolerated, beta blockers (BBs) should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, and clinical judgment is useful in titrating BB during the perioperative period with a focus on continuation throughout the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. In the absence of conclusive randomized controlled trials (RCTs), control of blood pressure (BP) to levels recommended by this guideline (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) or other target levels specified for a particular individual is reasonable before undertaking major elective procedures in either the inpatient or outpatient setting, and if the patient is unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications as necessary to control BP. Caution is advised when continuing antihypertensive therapy in patients with low perioperative diastolic BP (DBP), older adults (age ≥ 65 years), and patients in whom the risk for perioperative hypotension is high. Regarding renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), evidence from a large cohort study demonstrates that patients who stopped their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome and intraoperative hypotension than those continuing these medications until surgery, whereas POISE-3 randomized 7490 patients with at least 1 high-risk factor and did not find a significant difference between perioperative discontinuation versus maintenance of ACEi/ARB therapy during the operative and immediate perioperative periods; omitted RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas RCTs have failed to prove their continuation or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

Neurohormonal blockade and hypertension management post–mechanical circulatory support (LVAD) implant should be started following vasopressor wean during the postoperative period, with blood pressure management to maintain a mean arterial pressure 75 to 90 mm Hg for patients on continuous flow LVAD support; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are recommended in LVAD patients, with observational data supporting a role in reducing gastrointestinal bleeding and one study showing marked reductions when started within the first 30 postoperative days; if ACE inhibitor/ARB use is limited or contraindicated, hydralazine and nitrates can be introduced, but nitrates should not be given with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor; angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors lack large LVAD-specific studies but may be considered in carefully selected patients, and side-effects should be monitored; beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be started during the postoperative period, with beta-blockers initiated once patients are stable off inotropes, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists started once renal function has stabilized postoperatively, while use in advanced CKD and/or hyperkalemia is not recommended.

### The association of withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers on acute kidney injury after non-cardiac surgery [^116gwfGh]. Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers peri-operatively in non-cardiac surgery remains controversial as they may result in intra-operative hypotension and postoperative organ damage.

Methods

We included patients prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers who underwent surgical procedures > 1h duration under general or spinal anaesthesia from January 2012 to June 2022 in a single centre. We categorised patients by whether these drugs were withheld for 24h before surgery. We evaluated the association of withholding these drugs before non-cardiac surgery with creatinine concentrations that increased ≥ 26.4μmol.l⁻¹ in the first 48 postoperative hours (acute kidney injury). We also analysed changes in creatinine concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rates.

Results

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers were withheld in 24,285 of 32,933 (74%) patients and continued in 8648 (26%) patients. We used propensity scores for drug discontinuation to match 8631 patient pairs who did or did not continue these drugs: acute kidney injury was recorded for 1791 (21%) patients who continued these drugs vs. 1587 (18%) who did not (OR (95%CI) 1.16 (1.08–1.25), p < 0.001). Intra-operative hypotension was recorded for 3892 (45%) patients who continued drugs vs. 3373 (39%) patients who did not (OR (95%CI) 1.28 (1.21–1.36), p < 0.001). Continuing drugs was independently associated with a mean increase in creatinine of 2.2μmol.l -1 (p < 0.001) and a mean decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 1.4ml.min.1.73m ⁻² (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers 24h before non-cardiac surgery was associated with intra-operative hypotension and postoperative acute kidney injury.

### Pretreatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury [^113TdQnD]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial demonstrated that ischemic events are decreased in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This study sought to determine whether pretreatment with ACE inhibitors would attentuate ischemic injury during surgical revascularization of ischemic myocardium.

Methods

In a porcine model, the second and third diagonal vessels were occluded for 90 minutes, followed by 45 minutes of cardioplegic arrest, and 180 minutes of reperfusion. Ten pigs received quinapril (20 mg p.o. q.d.) for 7 days prior to surgery; 10 others received no-ACE inhibitors.

Results

Quinapril-treated animals required less cardioversions for ventricular arrhythmias (1.58 ± 0.40 vs 2.77 ± 0.22; p < 0.05), had higher wall motion scores assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography (4 = normal to -1 = dyskinesia; 2.11 ± 0.10 vs 1.50 ± 0.07; p < 0.05), more complete coronary artery endothelial relaxation to bradykinin (45% ± 3% vs 7% ± 4%; p < 0.005), and lower infarct size (24.0% ± 3.0% vs 40.0% ± 1.7%; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

ACE inhibition prior to coronary revascularization enhances myocardial protection by decreasing ventricular irritability, improving regional wall motion, lowering infarct size, and preserving endothelial function.

5.4 Hypotension

PRESTALIA can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting.

In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, start PRESTALIA therapy under close medical supervision. Follow patients closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of PRESTALIA is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased.

If excessive hypotension occurs, immediately place patient in a supine position and, if necessary, treat patient with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. PRESTALIA treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure.

Patients with severe aortic stenosis may be more likely to experience symptomatic hypotension. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, PRESTALIA may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

5.5 Hyperkalemia

Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including PRESTALIA. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving PRESTALIA.

5.6 Cough

Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.

5.7 Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving PRESTALIA. Drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system can cause reductions in renal function, including acute renal failure. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system — (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or who are on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) or angiotensin receptor blockers — may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on PRESTALIA. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on PRESTALIA.

RESEARCH QUESTION

Does a strategy of discontinuing ACEi, ARBs or their combination in patients with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive CKD lead to stabilization or improvement in renal function over a 3-year follow-up period, provided that good BP control is maintained with other agents, compared with a strategy of continuing ACEi and/or ARB?

### Continuation versus discontinuation of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors before non-cardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116anx2J]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A large number of patients undergoing noncardiac surgeries are on long-term use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The current guidelines regarding the continuation or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS) inhibitors before noncardiac surgery are conflicting. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether continuing or withholding RAAS inhibitors before noncardiac surgery influences perioperative mortality and complications.

Methods

A thorough literature search was performed across PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception up to August 30, 2024 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using a random-effects model to pool odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

The analysis included 16 studies with a total of 59,105 patients on RAAS inhibitors before noncardiac surgery. Withholding RAAS inhibitors was associated with a significantly lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.83) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.82 to 0.95) than continuing the therapy. However, there was no statistically significant difference in reducing mortality (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.40), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (OR = 1.27; 95% CI = 0.75 to 2.16), myocardial infarction (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.27 to 2.59) or stroke events (OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.36 to 1.36) between the two groups.

Conclusion

Withholding RAAS inhibitors before noncardiac surgery reduces intraoperative hypotension and AKI with nonsignificant effects on mortality and MACE.

Nephrotoxic Insults

Management of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been hypothesized to increase the risk for AKI through a variety of mechanisms, including systemic hypotension, renal artery constriction, and interstitial nephritis. Recommendations and practice for the management of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in the perioperative period are conflicting. The American College of Cardiology (Bethesda, Maryland) and American Heart Association (Dallas, Texas) recommending continuing during noncardiac surgery, while anesthesia groups routinely hold on the day of surgery due to concerns of intraoperative hypotension. Subanalysis of the Vascular events In noncardiac Surgery patIents cOhort evaluatioN (VISION) cohort found that withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers before major noncardiac surgery was associated with a lower risk of death and postoperative vascular events, although this study was not designed to assess renal outcomes. This contrasts with an earlier meta-analysis that did not demonstrate a difference in mortality, morbidity, and complications between patients who continued or held their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in the perioperative period. In the largest prospective study to date in major elective noncardiac surgery, conducted by the Student Audit and Research in Surgery (STARSurg) Collaborative, withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers did not protect against the development of postoperative AKI. The POQI-3 consensus statement recommends restarting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy within the first 48 h postoperatively in patients, as long as the patient is hemodynamically stable and not exhibiting signs of postoperative AKI.

Secondary outcomes

Peak troponin-T levels were similar between groups (mean difference, −0.16 ng/L; 95% CI −3.13–2.82). To account for the skewed distribution, a post hoc analysis of peak troponin using the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test also found no difference in peak troponin levels between stop and continue groups (z = 0.117, P = 0.91). Post-operative infections occurred in 26 (21.0%) in the stop group, compared to 24 (19.5%) patients who continued RAS inhibitors (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.50–1.76; p = 0.83). Clinically diagnosed myocardial infarction, stroke, and death were recorded in fewer than 10 participants.

### Association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use prior to major elective surgery and the risk of acute dialysis [^116yz7pf]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Study population

We included patients aged 66 years or older admitted to a hospital for elective surgery between January 1, 1995 and November 30, 2010. We excluded patients in their first year of universal drug coverage (patients aged 65 years) to avoid incomplete historical medication data. We included five surgical categories: cardiac, vascular, thoracic, abdominal, and retro-peritoneal, which all carry an appreciable risk for AKI-D (sample database codes in Additional file 1). To avoid selecting emergent or urgent surgery, we excluded all surgeries done during the course of a non-surgical hospital admission. We also excluded hospital admissions associated with missing or invalid identification, or demographic information. To ensure all patients had a recent access to health-care services, we limited our analyses to patients with at least one dispensed outpatient medication prescription in the 120 days prior to surgery.

We excluded patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) prior to their surgery (i.e. any evidence of dialysis or kidney transplantation) as the assessment of AKI-D is different and may no longer be relevant. To avoid the need to account for less frequently prescribed anti-hypertensive medications in the analyses, we only considered patients with either no evidence of anti-hypertensive medication use, or evidence of a prescription for the following frequently prescribed anti-hypertensive medications in the 120 days prior to surgery: ACEi, ARB, β-blocker, calcium channel blocker, non-potassium sparing diuretic (loop diuretic or thiazide diuretic). For patients with multiple eligible surgeries during the study period, we randomly selected one surgical procedure to avoid within patient clustering in the analyses.

Preoperative ACEi/ARB use

We grouped selected surgical cohort into ACEi/ARB users and non-users according to whether the patient filled at least one prescription for an ACEi or ARB (or not) in the 120 days prior to surgery. We selected a time frame of 120 days because the provincial drug plan requires each prescription to be renewed at least once every 100 days and 20 extra days were considered to accommodate any missed doses resulting in a longer period between renewal.

Baseline characteristics

We assessed demographic characteristics and comorbidities using validated database codes whenever possible (detailed in Additional file 1). We also determined concomitant medication use in the 120 days prior to surgery.

### Introducing an AKI predictive tool for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery [^116mc2kn]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Consideration was also given as to whether patients at high risk should be catheterised routinely. Due to the risk of catheter-related infection, we did not include routine catheterisation of high-risk patients.

Our second intervention related to withholding certain medications around the time of surgery. The perioperative drug management guideline in place prior to this project stipulated patients on ACE inhibitors or ARBs should have these medications withheld on the day of surgery and that patients on NSAIDs should stop these 3 days before surgery. It also stated that aldosterone antagonists should be withheld on the day of surgery but not did comment on loop or thiazide diuretics.

In the baseline audit, six patients were on an ACE inhibitor or ARB. All six patients had these medications withheld on the day of surgery though it was restarted on day 1 postoperatively in four patients. Of note, four of the patients who had their ACE inhibitors or ARBs restarted postoperatively required further doses to be withheld during their admission due to low BP, which suggested that restarting these medications routinely on day 1 postoperatively was premature. We recommended that patients at high risk of AKI withhold these medicines on the day of surgery and day 1 and day 2 postoperatively.

With regards to NSAIDs, 4/37 patients were on regular NSAIDs preoperatively. Only one of these patients did not have their NSAIDs withheld preoperatively. This was a patient undergoing palliation for metastatic cancer. NSAIDs were started for postoperative pain in three patients (all low risk). Our intervention bundle did not alter the advice to withhold the NSAIDs from 3 days preoperatively but added that they should be used with caution postoperatively for those at high risk of AKI.

No patients in the baseline audit were on loop or thiazide diuretics; one patient was on spironolactone and this was withheld on the day of surgery. Our intervention bundle advised that all diuretics should be withheld routinely on the day of surgery and that fluid balance should be monitored closely when restarting these medications postoperatively. It was agreed that the anaesthetist would make this decision based on the individual patient.

### Association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use prior to major elective surgery and the risk of acute dialysis [^115Pew9D]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication of major surgery and severe AKI requires treatment with acute dialysis. Annually 230 million patients undergo major surgery worldwide and around one million major surgeries are complicated by AKI treated with dialysis (AKI-D). The development of AKI is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. A patient's risk for developing postoperative AKI is influenced by a variety of clinical factors including pre-existing comorbidities (e.g. chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension), clinical factors around the time of surgery (e.g. volume depletion, blood loss, hypotension, administration of vasoconstrictors), type of surgery (e.g. cardiac, vascular), and certain medications used in the perioperative period (e.g. antihypertensive medications). Medication use prior to surgery is of particular interest given the possibility of modification prior to planned elective surgeries.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are frequently prescribed medications. Despite their demonstrated benefits in outpatient settings, their continued use in the perioperative period remains controversial as preoperative ACEi/ARB use may lead to the development of perioperative hypotension and subsequent AKI. However, previous observational studies on the association between preoperative ACEi/ARB use and AKI have had conflicting results, and have focused on milder forms of AKI rather than the most serious renal outcome of AKI-D. We conducted this large retrospective cohort study to test the hypothesis that preoperative ACEi/ARB use compared to non-use associates with a different risk of AKI-D following major elective surgery.

### Thirty-day mortality risk associated with the postoperative nonresumption of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: a retrospective study of the veterans affairs healthcare system [^115wQ2gt]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are a widely used class of cardiovascular medication. However, limited data exist on the risks of postoperative nonresumption of an ACE-I.

Objective

To evaluate the factors and 30-day mortality risks associated with the postoperative nonresumption of an ACE-I.

Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System.

Patients

A total of 294,505 admissions in 240,978 patients with multiple preoperative prescription refills (> 3) for an ACE-I who underwent inpatient surgery from calendar years 1999 to 2012.

Intervention

None.

Measurements

We classified surgical admissions based upon the timing of postoperative resumption of an ACE-I prescription from the day of surgery through postoperative days 0 to 14 and 15 to 30, and collected 30-day mortality data. We evaluated the relationship between 30-day mortality and the nonresumption of an ACE-I from postoperative day 0 to 14 using proportional hazard regression models, adjusting for patient- and hospital-level risk factors. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using more homogeneous subpopulations and propensity score models.

Results

Twenty-five percent of our cohort did not resume an ACE-I during the 14 days following surgery. Nonresumption of an ACE-I within postoperative day 0 to 14 was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality (hazard ratio: 3.44; 95% confidence interval: 3.30–3.60; P < 0.001) compared to the restart group. Sensitivity analyses maintained this relationship.

Conclusions

Nonresumption of an ACE-I is common after major inpatient surgery in the large VA Health Care System. Restarting of an ACE-I within postoperative day 0 to 14 is, however, associated with decreased 30-day mortality. Careful attention to the issue of timely reinstitution of chronic medications such as an ACE-I is indicated.

### Prospective randomized evaluation of preoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (PREOP-ACEI) [^113v9NrZ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative hypotension is associated with an increased risk of end organ damage and death. The transient preoperative interruption of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy prior to cardiac and vascular surgeries decreases the occurrence of intraoperative hypotension.

Objective

We sought to compare the effect of two protocols for preoperative ACEI management on the risk of intraoperative hypotension among patients undergoing noncardiac, nonvascular surgeries.

Design

Prospective, randomized study.

Setting

Midwestern urban 489-bed academic medical center.

Patients

Patients taking an ACEI for at least six weeks preoperatively were considered for inclusion.

Interventions

Randomization of the final preoperative ACEI dose to omission (n = 137) or continuation (n = 138).

Measurements

The primary outcome was intraoperative hypotension, which was defined as any systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 80 mm Hg. Postoperative hypotensive (SBP < 90 mm Hg) and hypertensive (SBP > > 180 mm Hg) episodes were also recorded. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test.

Results

Intraoperative hypotension occurred less frequently in the omission group (76 of 137 [55%]) than in the continuation group (95 of 138 [69%]) (RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.97, P = 0.03, NNH 7.5). Postoperative hypotensive events were also less frequent in the ACEI omission group (RR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.86, P = 0.02) than in the continuation group. However, postoperative hypertensive events were more frequent in the omission group than in the continuation group (RR: 1.95, 95%: CI: 1.14 to 3.34, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

The transient preoperative interruption of ACEI therapy is associated with a decreased risk of intraoperative hypotension.

If the patient has had any driveline or pump infection antibiotics should be considered according to the patient's existing sensitivities to cover the explant surgery and continued for approximately a week and often 10 to 14 days afterward, and if there is no known infection 48 hours of broad spectrum coverage should still be given.

### Withholding versus continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers before noncardiac surgery: an analysis of the vascular events in noncardiac surgery patIents cOhort evaluatioN prospective cohort [^111PCAd1]. Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The effect on cardiovascular outcomes of withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in chronic users before noncardiac surgery is unknown.

Methods

In this international prospective cohort study, the authors analyzed data from 14,687 patients (including 4,802 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker users) at least 45 yr old who had in-patient noncardiac surgery from 2007 to 2011. Using multivariable regression models, the authors studied the relationship between withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and a primary composite outcome of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery at 30 days, with intraoperative and postoperative clinically important hypotension as secondary outcomes.

Results

Compared to patients who continued their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, the 1,245 (26%) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker users who withheld their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the 24h before surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury (150/1,245 [12.0%] vs. 459/3,557 [12.9%]; adjusted relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96; P = 0.01) and intraoperative hypotension (adjusted relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.93; P < 0.001). The risk of postoperative hypotension was similar between the two groups (adjusted relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.10; P = 0.36). Results were consistent across the range of preoperative blood pressures. The practice of withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers was only modestly correlated with patient characteristics and the type and timing of surgery.

Conclusions

Withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers before major noncardiac surgery was associated with a lower risk of death and postoperative vascular events. A large randomized trial is needed to confirm this finding. In the interim, clinicians should consider recommending that patients withhold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers 24h before surgery.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^114mcuLd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative clinical outcomes associated with the preoperative continuation or discontinuation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers before cardiac surgery remain unclear.

Methods and Results

In a single‐center, open‐label, randomized, registry‐based clinical trial, patients undergoing nonemergent cardiac surgery were assigned to/continuation or discontinuation 2 days before surgery. Among the 584 patients screened, 261 met study criteria and 126 (48.3%) patients were enrolled. In total,121 patients (96% adherence; 60 to continuation and 61 to/discontinuation) underwent surgery and completed the study protocol, and follow‐up was 100% complete. Postoperative intravenous vasopressor use (78.3% versus 75.4%, P = 0.703), vasodilator use (71.7% versus 80.3%, P = 0.265), vasoplegic shock (31.7% versus 27.9%, P = 0.648), median duration of vasopressor (10 versus 5 hours, P = 0.494), and vasodilator requirements (10 versus 9 hours, P = 0.469) were not significantly different between the continuation and discontinuation arms. No differences were observed in the incidence of acute kidney injury (1.7% versus 1.6%, P = 0.991), stroke (no events, mortality (1.7% versus 1.6%, P = 0.991), median duration of mechanical ventilation (6 versus 6 hours, P = 0.680), and median intensive care unit length of stay (43 versus 27 hours, P = 0.420) between the treatment arms.

Conclusions

A randomized study evaluating the routine continuation or discontinuation ofors before cardiac surgery was feasible, and treatment assignment was not associated with differences in postoperative physiological or clinical outcomes. These preliminary findings suggest that preoperative/management strategies did not affect the postoperative course of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113uKmyZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Library, PubMed, the Web of Knowledge, and Elsevier (ScienceDirect OnLine, SDOL) to retrieve studies investigating the incidence of hypotension in those patients continuously receiving ACEIs/ARBs, especially in patients continuing their use of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of their surgery.

Text headings and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms for the search included "angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ACEIs", "angiotensin II receptor blockers/ARBs", "angiotensin receptor antagonist", "renin-angiotensin system (RAS)/RAS inhibitor", "renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)/RAAS inhibitor", "hypotension", and "low blood pressure".

The search strategy included considering any terms pertinent to renin-angiotensin system/RAS inhibitors and any terms related to hypotension. Eligible trials were identified via electronic searches from 1981, when captopril, the first ACEI, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, up to July 1, 2017. A hand-search method was used to examine the reference lists of some of the identified trials. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to guide the meta-analysis.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Case-control studies, cohort studies, and/or randomized controlled trials were considered for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (i) written in the English language; (ii) enrolled adults scheduled for elective or emergency surgery who were chronically using ACEIs/ARBs; and (iii) compared the incidence of hypotension during anesthesia in patients continuing to receive ACEIs/ARBs with those who did not receive these drugs on the day of surgery. The exclusion criteria were: (i) formatted as a letter, review or meeting abstract; (ii) containing a lack of hypotension data as incidences or numbers; and (iii) containing no delineation between patients continuing to receive ACEIs/ARBs and those who were not, or those who were using other drugs or who had never used antihypertensive drugs. Only published data were included in the present study.

Data extraction

The data were extracted independently by three reviewers (Qiong Ling, Yu Gu and Jiaxin Chen) and validated by a fourth one (Qianqian Zhu). The following information was extracted from each included study: the name of the primary author, year of publication, geographical location, number of participants, type of surgery, and anesthesia.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^116S4NFp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Patient Population

This prospective, open‐label, registry‐based RCT was conducted at a single tertiary academic center in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada between May 2014 and June 2017 (NCT02096406). The study was approved by the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board (Pro00042749).

Participants were eligible for randomization if they were aged ≥ 18 years and scheduled for elective or urgent CABG (within 14 days of referral) and/or valve surgery and had been treated with an ACEI or ARB for a minimum of 7 days. Exclusion criteria were as follows: emergency surgery, preoperative shock (defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, the need for any vasopressor or inotropic support, or a mechanical cardiac support device), severe uncontrolled preoperative hypertension (defined as blood pressure ≥ 200 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 120 mm Hg diastolic or the preoperative need for intravenous antihypertensive agents), or any mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy.

Study Protocol and Randomization

Eligible patients who provided informed consent were randomized 1:1 using a web‐based randomization sequence, without stratification or blocking, to presurgical preoperative continuation or discontinuation of their ACEI or ARB. Patients randomized to the continuation arm continued their ACEI or ARB up to and including the morning of surgery, with a sip of water. Patients in the discontinuation arm discontinued the medication 2 days before their scheduled surgery; in the event of any surgical postponement, patients were instructed to continue to hold the ACEI or ARB until the time of surgery. In the immediate postoperative period, local CSICU practice sets systolic blood pressure targets of 90 to 110 mm Hg for the first 4 hours and then 90 to 140 mm Hg thereafter. Patients arrive in the CSICU from the operating room sedated with propofol, and sedation is typically discontinued within 2 to 3 hours in stable patients. The CSICU is a closed unit staffed by in‐house board‐certified intensivists who admit and direct the postoperative care of all admitted patients in collaboration with the surgical team. The preoperative management of all other medications and the postoperative reintroduction of an ACEI or ARB were at the discretion of the most responsible physician. During the study period, the hospital performed an average of 1490 open heart surgeries including an average of 533 nonemergent CABGs.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: the SPACE trial [^115Yv7Sf]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgical procedures, occurs frequently in patients with pre-existing cardio-metabolic pathology. Myocardial injury, independent of symptoms or ECG changes, increases the risk of death and further cardiovascular complications — even after discharge from hospital. Surgical patients at most risk of post-operative complications, are commonly prescribed renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors [angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)] to treat hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and cardiac failure, which reduce organ injury, in part, by reducing systemic inflammation.

The 2022 ESC guidelines reflect clinical uncertainty regarding RAS inhibitors during surgery. The dominance of observational studies, rather than randomized controlled trials with outcomes masked to investigators, have informed these divergent recommendations.RAS inhibitors are frequently stopped before surgery in the widely held belief that this prevents intra-operative hypotension, which may increase the risk of myocardial injury and death in older patients. Moreover, hypotension in combination with acute hypertension increases the risk even further of myocardial injury during the peri-operative period in non-cardiac surgery. The failure to restart RAS inhibitors after surgery, and hence likely increase the risk of poorly controlled blood pressure, is also associated with increased mortality. The markedly variable pharmacokinetic profiles of RAS inhibitors may also account for inconsistent study findings, since these reports assume that the drugs (particularly ARB) are no longer active during the early peri-operative period. Many clinicians simply stop ACE-I the day before surgery, but pharmacokinetic studies show that stopping these drugs for < 24 h does not alter their biological activity.

Accordingly, we conducted a multi-centre, randomized, open-label trial to assess whether the discontinuation of RAS inhibitors would reduce myocardial injury and post-operative complications, whilst assessing whether avoidance of haemodynamic instability would reduce post-operative morbidity.

### Predictors of hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication: a retrospective observational study [^112pjjDC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypotension often occurs during anesthesia induction in all adult patients, with an incidence of approximately 20%. It is reported that a substantial fraction of intraoperative hypotension in noncardiac surgery occurs before the start of surgery. Intraoperative hypotension in noncardiac surgery has been reported to be associated with various postoperative complications such as mortality, myocardial damage, and acute kidney injury. Recently, there have been an increasing number of studies on predictors of hypotension during anesthesia induction.

Hypotension during anesthesia induction has been reported to occur frequently in patients with hypertension. Intraoperative hypotension has been known to increase the risk of organ damage in patients with hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are often used to treat hypertension. The risk of intraoperative hypotension associated with the preoperative continuation of these drugs is still under investigation. We previously reported a case wherein the regular use of ARBs with a long half-life might have caused refractory hypotension during anesthesia induction, even when ARBs had been withdrawn 24 h prior to general anesthesia induction. However, a multivariable analysis of predictors of hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication has not yet been conducted.

We hypothesized that there are unknown predictors of hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication. We aimed to determine the predictors of hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication such as ARBs and ACE-Is, focusing on the half-life of the medication used.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^115NMEks]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Postoperative clinical outcomes associated with the preoperative continuation or discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) before cardiac surgery remain unclear. Methods and Results In a single-center, open-label, randomized, registry-based clinical trial, patients undergoing nonemergent cardiac surgery were assigned to ACEI / ARB continuation or discontinuation 2 days before surgery. Among the 584 patients screened, 261 met study criteria and 126 (48.3%) patients were enrolled. In total,121 patients (96% adherence; 60 to continuation and 61 to ACEI / ARB discontinuation) underwent surgery and completed the study protocol, and follow-up was 100% complete. Postoperative intravenous vasopressor use (78.3% versus 75.4%, P = 0.703), vasodilator use (71.7% versus 80.3%, P = 0.265), vasoplegic shock (31.7% versus 27.9%, P = 0.648), median duration of vasopressor (10 versus 5 hours, P = 0.494), and vasodilator requirements (10 versus 9 hours, P = 0.469) were not significantly different between the continuation and discontinuation arms. No differences were observed in the incidence of acute kidney injury (1.7% versus 1.6%, P = 0.991), stroke (no events, mortality (1.7% versus 1.6%, P = 0.991), median duration of mechanical ventilation (6 versus 6 hours, P = 0.680), and median intensive care unit length of stay (43 versus 27 hours, P = 0.420) between the treatment arms. Conclusions A randomized study evaluating the routine continuation or discontinuation of ACEIs or ARB s before cardiac surgery was feasible, and treatment assignment was not associated with differences in postoperative physiological or clinical outcomes. These preliminary findings suggest that preoperative ACEI / ARB management strategies did not affect the postoperative course of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: the SPACE trial [^1142ZU9K]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment

For patients randomized to discontinue RAS inhibitors, the duration of cessation before surgery was defined by the pharmacokinetics of each drug (see Supplementary data online, Appendix for full protocol). For RAS inhibitors with a duration of action ≥ 24 h, the drug was discontinued 48 h prior to surgery. All other ACE-I and/or ARB were stopped on the morning of the day (i.e. 24–32 h) before surgery.

After randomization, participants received confirmation of which treatment group they have been allocated to and reminded of their randomized allocation by daily telephone call and/or text message, or in person if they were in hospital. Renin–angiotensin system inhibitors were restarted after surgery on the morning of post-operative day 2, in accord with recommendations by the ESC guidelines. Resumption or continuation of ACE-I and/or ARB did not involve dose modifications. Recommencing RAS inhibitors was delayed on post-operative day 2 if systolic blood pressure was < 90 mmHg in the preceding 12 h, vasoactive therapy was required to maintain blood pressure and/or if acute kidney injury [as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria] had been sustained. The decision to restart ACE-I and/or ARB was confirmed by the principal investigator at each site. All other treatments (concomitant care) were administered according to usual peri-operative practice and were not influenced by trial-group allocation, in accord with recent ESC peri-operative guidelines.

Follow-up

Blood samples were collected before induction of anaesthesia and on the morning 24 and 48 h after surgery. Investigators reviewed the medical record of participants (paper or electronic) at 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery. To minimise bias, follow-up data were collected by a study team member who was masked to the treatment group allocation. The schedule of assessments is detailed in the protocol.

### Perioperative use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^114o46qX]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

In the early 2000s, two large-randomized clinical trials, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trialand the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease, showed that in patients with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but without heart failure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) resulted in a relative risk (RR) reduction of about 20% in mortality, MI, and stroke in 4–5 years follow-up. The effects were independent of age, gender, concomitant diseases, or therapy. Thus far, multiple clinical trials and cohort studies have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors are beneficial to patients with hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, heart dysfunction, also to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and valve diseases –.

Meanwhile, despite accumulating evidence that ACE inhibitors are effective drugs in a broad range of patients with risk of CVD and increasing numbers of patients are treated with ACE inhibitors prior to cardiac surgery, whether or not ACE inhibitors should be continued or given perioperatively remains controversial. Results from previous clinical studies are conflicting and raise more questions than answers –. The Guidelines (2011) for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology stated that it is uncertain about the safety of the preoperative administration of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients on chronic therapy and the safety of initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs before hospital discharge. In the updated 2014 ESC/EACTS Guidelines, they state that ACE inhibitors might be stopped 1–2 days before CABG to avoid the potential deleterious consequences of perioperative hypotension. Thus, there is a need to investigate the safety and effectiveness of preoperative and postoperative RASi therapy in large cardiovascular cohorts.

In this study, we examined both preoperative and postoperative (or perioperative) use of RASi, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors, on outcomes of patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery. The results show that perioperative use of RASi has a significant benefit for the postoperative and long-term survival among patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery.

We planned to analyse the primary outcome using a mixed effects logistic regression model with patients clustered by centre. However, owing to a near-zero intra-cluster correlation, the model did not converge, so instead we fitted a single-level model ignoring clustering. The model was adjusted for minimization variables [planned surgical procedure category and ACE-I/ARB (ACE-I, ARB, or both)] and the following pre-specified baseline covariates: age, sex. All covariates were entered into the model as fixed factors, with age being included as a continuous variable, assuming a linear association with the primary outcome. The analysis of the primary outcome was conducted using a logistic regression model which gives an estimated adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI.

The continuously distributed secondary outcomes (absolute peak troponin levels) were analysed using a mixed effects linear regression model adjusted for the same covariates as the primary analysis and taking into account clustering by centre. Secondary outcome for infection within 30 days of surgery was analysed with the use of a logistic regression model adjusted for minimization variables [planned surgical procedure category and ACE-I/ARB (ACE-I, ARB, or both)]. For all other secondary outcomes, no statistical analysis was performed (pre-peer review) due to low event rates. Categorical safety outcome measures were summarized as the percentage of patients with these events. Pre-specified sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome were conducted under the missing not at random assumption over a range of plausible scenarios to assess how robust the results were to departures from missing at random on the treatment estimates.

Time to event analyses: AKI-D and all-cause mortality

Similar to the primary analyses, preoperative ACEi/ARB use was associated with a lower risk of AKI-D (adjusted HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.97) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.95).
