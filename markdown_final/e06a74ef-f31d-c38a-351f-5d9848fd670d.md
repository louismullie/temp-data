## Question

First line therapy antibiotics for boils?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line therapy for boils, specifically whether antibiotics are indicated and, if so, which agents to choose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and its usual pathogens. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about the primary treatment. Next, I will examine when antibiotics are actually indicated and which agents are reasonable empiric choices. After that, I need to check the strength of evidence for antibiotics in uncomplicated boils. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note special scenarios like MRSA risk, immunocompromise, and recurrence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and typical pathogens. Boils, or furuncles, are deep infections of the hair follicle extending into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including community-associated MRSA in many regions, with streptococci less frequent contributors, so I need to keep CA-MRSA in mind when antibiotics are warranted [^dbdf1c2e] [^eb7b7421].

> Wait, let me verify the primary therapy before discussing antibiotics. Multiple contemporary guidelines converge on the same point: incision and drainage is the cornerstone and first-line treatment for simple abscesses or boils; antibiotics are not routinely indicated for uncomplicated cases, and this is a strong recommendation with low-quality evidence but broad consensus across WSES/SIS-E and WSES/GAIS/WSIS pathways [^d6a675bb] [^1ffe6bfd] [^dbdf1c2e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should confirm the indications where antibiotics are appropriate. Antibiotics are recommended when there is significant surrounding cellulitis, systemic features such as fever or malaise, immunocompromise, extremes of age, location in difficult-to-drain areas like the face, hand, or perineum, multiple lesions, or failure to improve after adequate drainage; in these scenarios, empiric therapy should cover S. aureus, with MRSA coverage considered based on risk factors and local epidemiology [^dbdf1c2e] [^4ea7e4b4] [^1ffe6bfd].

> I need to check the strength of evidence for routine antibiotics in uncomplicated boils. The Cochrane review of interventions for bacterial folliculitis and boils found no meaningful differences in clinical cure between various oral antibiotics and concluded that comparative trials have not identified important efficacy advantages, reinforcing that routine antibiotics after adequate drainage are not beneficial in uncomplicated cases [^d42be534].

> Let me consider empiric antibiotic choices when they are indicated. Reasonable first-line oral options with activity against MSSA include cephalexin or dicloxacillin; if MRSA risk is present or there is no response to a beta-lactam, options include doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin, with local resistance patterns guiding selection; duration is typically 5–10 days, individualized to clinical response, and cultures should be obtained in recurrent, severe, or nonresponding cases to refine therapy [^4ea7e4b4] [^1ffe6bfd] [^dbdf1c2e].

> But wait, what if the patient has frequent recurrences. I should double-check decolonization strategies. For recurrent furunculosis, consider nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine body washes, and in some protocols, household contacts may also be addressed; this is particularly relevant when colonization with S. aureus is likely and can reduce recurrence risk when combined with optimized drainage and hygiene measures [^eb7b7421] [^6ff16d46].

> I will now examine special populations briefly. In children, the same principles apply: incision and drainage is primary, with antibiotics reserved for systemic illness, immunocompromise, or failure of drainage; in pregnancy, avoid tetracyclines and TMP-SMX near term, favoring beta-lactams if antibiotics are truly indicated; in penicillin allergy, non–beta-lactam options like doxycycline or clindamycin can be used based on local resistance and severity [^dbdf1c2e] [^4ea7e4b4].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. For uncomplicated boils, first-line therapy is incision and drainage alone; antibiotics are not indicated. For complicated cases meeting the criteria above, use an oral antibiotic active against S. aureus, adding MRSA coverage when risk factors or clinical failure suggest it, and tailor based on culture results if available; this approach balances efficacy, safety, and antimicrobial stewardship [^d6a675bb] [^dbdf1c2e] [^d42be534].

---

For uncomplicated boils (furuncles), **incision and drainage is the first-line therapy** [^d6a675bb]; antibiotics are not routinely indicated [^1ffe6bfd]. Reserve antibiotics for patients with **systemic symptoms**, **immunocompromise**, **rapid progression**, **failure of drainage alone**, or **MRSA risk** [^4ea7e4b4]. When antibiotics are needed, use **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**, **clindamycin**, or **doxycycline** to cover MRSA [^4ea7e4b4]; for MSSA, use cephalexin or dicloxacillin. Treat for 5–10 days, guided by clinical response [^4ea7e4b4].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated boils [^d6a675bb]. They are reserved for specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, or malaise [^1ffe6bfd].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: HIV, diabetes, or immunosuppressive therapy [^1ffe6bfd].
- **Rapid progression**: Rapidly spreading infection or cellulitis [^4ea7e4b4].
- **Failure of incision and drainage**: Lack of improvement after adequate drainage [^1ffe6bfd].
- **MRSA risk**: History of MRSA colonization or infection, or high local prevalence [^4ea7e4b4].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

When antibiotics are indicated, **empiric therapy should cover MRSA** given its prevalence in community settings [^4ea7e4b4]. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Coverage** |
|-|-|-|
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily | MRSA |
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg orally four times daily | MRSA, MSSA |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily | MRSA, MSSA |
| Cephalexin | 500 mg orally four times daily | MSSA |
| Dicloxacillin | 500 mg orally four times daily | MSSA |

---

Duration of therapy is typically **5–10 days**, individualized to clinical response [^4ea7e4b4].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting antibiotic use

Evidence supporting routine antibiotic use in uncomplicated boils is **limited** [^d42be534]. A Cochrane review found no significant difference in clinical cure rates between different oral antibiotics, suggesting that antibiotics do not substantially improve outcomes in uncomplicated cases [^d42be534]. However, in complicated cases — particularly with MRSA — antibiotics are beneficial [^4ea7e4b4].

---

## Role of incision and drainage

Incision and drainage (I&D) is the **cornerstone of boil management** [^d6a675bb]. It provides immediate relief, accelerates healing, and reduces recurrence. Adequate drainage often obviates the need for antibiotics, except in the scenarios outlined above [^1ffe6bfd].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy carries potential risks and side effects, including:

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated colitis [^f7f6a5e8].
- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, and anaphylaxis [^5f8aa2d7].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Development of resistant organisms, particularly MRSA [^6a7bb38a].
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Particularly with clindamycin and fluoroquinolones [^fdf5548a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **incision and drainage as the primary therapy** for uncomplicated boils [^d6a675bb]. Antibiotics are reserved for specific indications, as outlined above [^4ea7e4b4]. This approach aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles, minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use and resistance development [^16541ab4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Incision and drainage for uncomplicated boils [^d6a675bb].
- **Antibiotics**: Reserved for systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, rapid progression, failure of drainage, or MRSA risk [^4ea7e4b4].
- **Empiric coverage**: MRSA coverage recommended when indicated [^4ea7e4b4].
- **Duration**: 5–10 days, individualized to clinical response [^4ea7e4b4].

---

Incision and drainage is the **first-line therapy** for boils; antibiotics are reserved for specific indications. When antibiotics are needed, use agents active against MRSA, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, or doxycycline, and tailor therapy to clinical response and culture results.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^d6a675bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1ffe6bfd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Interventions for bacterial folliculitis and boils (furuncles and carbuncles) [^d42be534]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial folliculitis and boils are globally prevalent bacterial infections involving inflammation of the hair follicle and the perifollicular tissue. Some folliculitis may resolve spontaneously, but others may progress to boils without treatment. Boils, also known as furuncles, involve adjacent tissue and may progress to cellulitis or lymphadenitis. A systematic review of the best evidence on the available treatments was needed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (such as topical antibiotics, topical antiseptic agents, systemic antibiotics, phototherapy, and incision and drainage) for people with bacterial folliculitis and boils.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2020: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched five trials registers up to June 2020. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic antibiotics; topical antibiotics; topical antiseptics, such as topical benzoyl peroxide; phototherapy; and surgical interventions in participants with bacterial folliculitis or boils. Eligible comparators were active intervention, placebo, or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'clinical cure' and 'severe adverse events leading to withdrawal of treatment'; secondary outcomes were 'quality of life', 'recurrence of folliculitis or boil following completion of treatment', and 'minor adverse events not leading to withdrawal of treatment'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs (1300 participants). The studies included more males (332) than females (221), although not all studies reported these data. Seventeen trials were conducted in hospitals, and one was conducted in clinics. The participants included both children and adults (0 to 99 years). The studies did not describe severity in detail; of the 232 participants with folliculitis, 36% were chronic. At least 61% of participants had furuncles or boils, of which at least 47% were incised. Duration of oral and topical treatments ranged from 3 days to 6 weeks, with duration of follow-up ranging from 3 days to 6 months. The study sites included Asia, Europe, and America. Only three trials reported funding, with two funded by industry. Ten studies were at high risk of 'performance bias', five at high risk of 'reporting bias', and three at high risk of 'detection bias'. We did not identify any RCTs comparing topical antibiotics against topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics against systemic antibiotics, or phototherapy against sham light. Eleven trials compared different oral antibiotics. We are uncertain as to whether cefadroxil compared to flucloxacillin (17/21 versus 18/20, risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.16; 41 participants; 1 study; 10 days of treatment) or azithromycin compared to cefaclor (8/15 versus 10/16, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; 31 participants; 2 studies; 7 days of treatment) differed in clinical cure (both very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in clinical cure rate between cefdinir and cefalexin after 17 to 24 days (25/32 versus 32/42, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.38; 74 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), and there probably is little to no difference in clinical cure rate between cefditoren pivoxil and cefaclor after 7 days (24/46 versus 21/47, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.78; 93 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). For risk of severe adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal, there may be little to no difference between cefdinir versus cefalexin after 17 to 24 days (1/191 versus 1/200, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.62; 391 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). There may be an increased risk with cefadroxil compared with flucloxacillin after 10 days (6/327 versus 2/324, RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.60 to 14.62; 651 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) and cefditoren pivoxil compared with cefaclor after 7 days (2/77 versus 0/73, RR 4.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 97.17; 150 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). However, for these three comparisons the 95% CI is very wide and includes the possibility of both increased and reduced risk of events. We are uncertain whether azithromycin affects the risk of severe adverse events leading to withdrawal of treatment compared to cefaclor (274 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence) as no events occurred in either group after seven days. For risk of minor adverse events, there is probably little to no difference between the following comparisons: cefadroxil versus flucloxacillin after 10 days (91/327 versus 116/324, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98; 651 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) or cefditoren pivoxil versus cefaclor after 7 days (8/77 versus 5/73, RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.52 to 4.42; 150 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of azithromycin versus cefaclor after seven days due to very low-certainty evidence (7/148 versus 4/126, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.17; 274 participants; 2 studies). The study comparing cefdinir versus cefalexin did not report data for total minor adverse events, but both groups experienced diarrhoea, nausea, and vaginal mycosis during 17 to 24 days of treatment. Additional adverse events reported in the other included studies were vomiting, rashes, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as stomach ache, with some events leading to study withdrawal. Three included studies assessed recurrence following completion of treatment, none of which evaluated our key comparisons, and no studies assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCTs regarding the efficacy and safety of topical antibiotics versus antiseptics, topical versus systemic antibiotics, or phototherapy versus sham light for treating bacterial folliculitis or boils. Comparative trials have not identified important differences in efficacy or safety outcomes between different oral antibiotics for treating bacterial folliculitis or boils. Most of the included studies assessed participants with skin and soft tissue infection which included many disease types, whilst others focused specifically on folliculitis or boils. Antibiotic sensitivity data for causative organisms were often not reported. Future trials should incorporate culture and sensitivity information and consider comparing topical antibiotic with antiseptic, and topical versus systemic antibiotics or phototherapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e674ee33]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^d02f2be5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment remains a challenge for the clinician, as no available therapy is able to cure the infection in all treated patients. In the last two decades, several antibiotic combinations have been proposed, including triple therapies, bismuth-free therapies (sequential, concomitant, hybrid regimens), and bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Some national and international guidelines on H. pylori management have recently been updated, recommending or discouraging the use of each of these therapeutic approaches, based mainly on the presumed pattern of primary antibiotic resistance in different geographic areas. We examined the recommendations on first-line therapies in the most recently updated guidelines worldwide, taking into account other data affecting the efficacy of a therapy regimen beyond the primary resistance pattern. Although several guidelines highlighted that the results achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable, it emerged that some therapy regimens are recommended or discouraged with no mention of the vital need for national data.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^a9f44057]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of 'shorter is better', initially conceived one decade ago. However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy. Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia. Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^cd271194]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotic selection for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) indicates that if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. Recommendation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^c61db5e6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 6 — treatment failure for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis specifies that if the patient fails to improve or worsens despite being on an appropriate antibiotic for 3–5 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, and if ABRS is confirmed, the clinician should change the antibiotic; the recommendation is based on expert opinion and first principles for changing therapy with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with an action statement profile citing quality improvement opportunity, aggregate evidence quality Grade D with use of rescue antibiotic in RCTs, level of confidence in evidence moderate, benefits of preventing complications, detecting missed diagnosis, and instituting effective therapy, and risks or costs including delay in changing therapy if the patient fails to improve and medication costs.

The guideline is intended for use by healthcare providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The guideline updates the 2002 Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline and discusses diagnosis and management, and recommendations are provided regarding antibiotic choices and dosing. Penicillin or amoxicillin remain the treatments of choice, and recommendations are made for the penicillin-allergic patient, which now include clindamycin.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^0e5ca29a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — antibiotics versus watchful waiting: Although the literature suggests that antibiotics shorten the time to cure in ABRS, there is concern about the adverse effects of antibiotics, including resistance. A previous expert panel recommended a watchful waiting approach with antibiotics in nonsevere ABRS, and the panel recommended re-evaluation as necessary and antibiotics if there was worsening or no improvement with symptomatic therapy. A Cochrane database review assessed the effect of antibiotics in uncomplicated ABRS in a primary care setting and concluded that antibiotics are not recommended as first-line treatment in adults with clinically diagnosed ABRS, with their review of 10 trials finding that irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of patients were cured after 1 week and 71% after 2 weeks; this review did not make recommendations for pediatric patients, patients with suppressed immune system, and patients with severe disease.

### Antibiotics for treatment of sore throat in children and adults [^d230c660]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common reason for people to present for medical care and to be prescribed antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics in primary medicine is a concern, hence it is important to establish their efficacy in treating sore throat and preventing secondary complications. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotics for reducing symptoms of sore throat for child and adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2021, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2021), Embase (January 1990 to April 2021), and two trial registries (searched 6 April 2021).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antibiotics versus control assessing typical sore throat symptoms or complications amongst children and adults seeking medical care for sore throat symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data, resolving any differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted the trial authors from three studies for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the efficacy of antibiotics on our primary outcomes (sore throat at day three and one week) and secondary outcomes (fever and headache symptoms and incidence of acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and quinsy).

Main Results

We included 29 trials with 15,337 cases of sore throat. The majority of included studies were conducted in the 1950s, during which time the rates of serious complications (especially acute rheumatic fever) were much higher than today. Although clinical antibiotic trials for sore throat and respiratory symptoms are still being conducted, it is unusual for them to include placebo or 'no treatment' control arms, which is a requirement for inclusion in the review. The age of participants ranged from younger than one year to older than 50 years, but most participants across all studies were adults. Although all studies recruited patients presenting with symptoms of sore throat, few of them distinguished between bacterial and viral aetiology. Bias may have been introduced through non-clarity in treatment allocation procedures and lack of blinding in some studies. Harms from antibiotics were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were thus not quantified for this review. 1. Symptoms Throat soreness and headache at day three were reduced by using antibiotics, although 82% of participants in the placebo or no treatment group were symptom-free by one week. The reduction in sore throat symptoms at day three (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.80; 16 studies, 3730 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) was greater than at one week in absolute numbers (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.75; 14 studies, 3083 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) due to many cases in both treatment groups having resolved by this time. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 18. Compared with placebo or no treatment, antibiotics did not significantly reduce fever at day three (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.07; 8 studies, 1443 participants; high-certainty evidence), but did reduce headache at day three (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70; 4 studies, 1020 participants; high-certainty evidence). 2. Suppurative complications Whilst the prevalence of suppurative complications was low, antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40; 10 studies, 3646 participants; high-certainty evidence) and quinsy within two months (Peto OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.35; 8 studies, 2433 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to those receiving placebo or no treatment, but not acute sinusitis within 14 days (Peto OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.05; 8 studies, 2387 participants; high-certainty evidence). 3. Non-suppurative complications There were too few cases of acute glomerulonephritis to determine whether there was a protective effect of antibiotics compared with placebo against this complication (Peto OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 10 studies, 5147 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever within two months when compared to the control group (Peto OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50; 18 studies, 12,249 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It should be noted that the overall prevalence of acute rheumatic fever was very low, particularly in the later studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics probably reduce the number of people experiencing sore throat, and reduce the likelihood of headache, and some sore throat complications. As the effect on symptoms can be small, clinicians must judge on an individual basis whether it is clinically justifiable to use antibiotics to produce this effect, and whether the underlying cause of the sore throat is likely to be of bacterial origin. Furthermore, the balance between modest symptom reduction and the potential hazards of antimicrobial resistance must be recognised. Few trials have attempted to measure symptom severity. If antibiotics reduce the severity as well as the duration of symptoms, their benefit will have been underestimated in this meta-analysis. Additionally, more trials are needed in low-income countries, in socio-economically deprived sections of high-income countries, as well as in children.

### Azithromycin (Zithromax) [^6f4d06ac]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

INDIACTIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications [see Dosage and Administration (2)]

1.1 Adult Patients

Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy.

Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^ec3e6958]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Purpose of this section — if an antibiotic will be used for treatment of a child with AOM, the clinician must choose an antibiotic with a high likelihood of being effective against the most likely etiologic bacterial pathogens with considerations of cost, taste, convenience, and adverse effects, and this section proposes first- and second-line antibiotics that best meet these criteria while balancing potential benefits and harms.

### The status and progress of first-line treatment againstinfection: a review [^ba6ec464]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment guided by drug sensitivity

International guidelines recommend that the first treatment for HP infection should be successful. – Therefore, personalized treatment programs tailored to patients according to drug sensitivity tests are the preferred choice, which can not only provide a satisfactory eradication rate but also prevent the misuse of antibiotics to avoid further increases in global antibiotic resistance. In a prospective study in Korea, the agar-dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration to select the treatment regimen. The study showed that a reliable and excellent eradication rate [intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 93.1%; per-protocol (PP) analysis, 100%] could be achieved even in areas with high drug resistance. An open controlled trial, also from Korea, compared the safety and efficacy of customized (TR) eradication strategies based on 23s ribosomal RNA point mutations with empirical bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BCQT), and concluded that TR strategies had fewer related complications (12.0% versus 43.0%; p < 0.001).

However, considering the cost, difficulty, and availability of drug sensitivity tests, personalized treatment is difficult to implement, so in practice, first-line treatment is often dominated by empirical treatment. In first-line empirical therapy, the guidelines unanimously recommend the use of BCQT, while concomitant therapy (CT) can also be used in areas where bismuth is not available or where clarithromycin is resistant. The use of PPI-based triple therapy is strictly restricted and can only be used in areas with low drug resistance, so that it cannot be used in most areas. There is no consensus on the use of other first-line treatments, such as sequential therapy (ST) and hybrid therapy (HT), in the guidelines developed by expert groups in Europe, Canada, and the USA for the treatment of HP infection. Clinicians should consider not only the history of drug contact and the prevalence of local drug resistance but also the history of allergy, compliance, cost, availability, and adverse reactions. The effectiveness of the regimen is influenced by all the above factors. Therefore, the best regimen for first-line empirical therapy has not been determined.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^d4b06827]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The pattern of primary bacterial resistance towards different antibiotics may be a cause for concern. Indeed, different guidelines suggest choosing the first-line therapy according to regional or national prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in H. pylori isolates. Specifically, a prevalence rate > 15% for combined resistance towards clarithromycin and metronidazole is recognized as the major factor impairing efficacy of all bismuth-free therapies, whilst an isolate resistance rate > 20% to clarithromycin undermines the efficacy of triple and sequential therapies, but not the concomitant regimen. Nevertheless, at least three meta-analyses, including data from studies performed in areas with different prevalences of antibiotic resistance, have shown a similar efficacy between sequential and concomitant therapies. Therefore, a priori discrimination with respect to a particular therapy based only on the presumed prevalence of bacterial resistance in a geographic area seems to be at least questionable, and local validation of each therapy regimen would be desirable. Indeed, factors beyond the antibiotic resistance pattern could play a role, causing different results in diverse geographic areas. For instance, primary resistance towards either clarithromycin or metronidazole in H. pylori isolates is as high as 30% in Italy, so that the sequential therapy should not be used according to the European guidelines. However, in the last decade, an eradication rate of > 90% has repeatedly been found in all multicenter Italian trials involving thousands of patients, apart from one study published in 2010 where the infection was cured in 83% of 122 patients. When considering only data from studies published in the last 5 years, the cure rate following sequential therapy was still 90–92.6% in 5 Italian studies with more than 1000 patients, and 73% in another study with 100 cases. A similarly high success rate of sequential therapy has been observed in studies recently performed in Slovenia (94.2%), Portugal (90%), Belgium (90%), Israel (95.9%), Thailand (94%), Taiwan (91.9%), Singapore (90.3%), and the United Arab Emirates (88.6%), suggesting that this therapy is still effective in several countries. Based on these findings, Italian, Slovenian, or Portuguese physicians could inopportunely deprive their patients a priori of a still effective therapy by following the European guidelines. In contrast, unsatisfactory cure rates were observed in Greece, Spain, Ireland, Turkey, Iran, Korea, China, and Puerto Rico. Notably, the difference among results achieved by sequential therapy in different geographic areas could be due, at least in part, to the type of nitroimidazole used. In several studies, metronidazole 400 mg b.i.d. has been administered instead of tinidazole 500 mg b.i.d. and it has been found that the tinidazole-based regimen achieved significantly higher cure rates than metronidazole-based sequential therapy. Indeed, apart from the higher dose, tinidazole possesses a markedly higher half-life compared to metronidazole.

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^2d0778f3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)) 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22)), (NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 51, I(2) statistic 0%, three trials). However, 27% of the participants who received antibiotics and 15% of those who received placebo experienced adverse events (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.77) (number needed to treat to harm (NNTH)) 8 (95% CI 6 to 13, I(2) statistic 13%, seven trials). More participants in the placebo group needed to start antibiotic therapy because of an abnormal course of rhinosinusitis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66), NNTH 20 (95% CI 14 to 35, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Only one disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in a patient treated with antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. Taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^9d499ca6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori antibiotic susceptibility testing — first-line and salvage therapy evidence and expert guidance are as follows: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials for first-line therapy showed a small advantage for tailored therapy (risk ratio 1.15; 95% CI 1.11–1.20 and 1.14; 95% CI 1.08–1.21). When empiric therapy was BQT or nonbismuth quadruple, no advantage was seen; accordingly, when BQT is chosen and local eradication rate is ≥ 85%, there is no need for susceptibility testing before first-line treatment, and providers are encouraged to monitor success rates and consider using antibiotic susceptibility testing if eradication rates with their preferred first-line therapies are less than 85%. In treatment-experienced patients, meta-analyses concluded testing before second- or third-line therapy did not improve eradication outcomes; the evidence base was limited (for second-line therapy, only 5 relevant studies with approximately 200 patients in each arm; for third-line therapy, only 3 studies, and in the only large RCT with approximately 200 patients per arm, tailored therapy had a 6% advantage that was not statistically significant). In a third-line comparison of molecular vs culture-based testing, tailored regimens were similar and both were superior to historic empiric controls (88% vs 78%). Based on expert consensus language, "we advise using antibiotic susceptibility testing when the choice of therapy remains unclear after taking into consideration previous treatments for H. pylori infection, past antibiotic exposure more generally (particularly use of macrolides and quinolones), and any documented history of penicillin allergy", and "we recommend antibiotic susceptibility testing before the use of regimens containing clarithromycin or levofloxacin".

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment forinfection? A comprehensive review [^a1acb099]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although susceptibility-guided therapy is frequently recommended for Helicobacter pylori infection, the evidence available to date supporting this strategy is limited. The aim of the present article is to review the advantages and limitations of the susceptibility-guided and the empirical strategies to treat this infection. We performed a bibliographic search to identify studies investigating H. pylori susceptibility-guided therapy. Culture is not the only way to assess antibiotic resistance, as different polymerase chain reaction-based approaches have been developed as alternative methods. For detecting H. pylori antimicrobial resistance, a molecular approach based on a stool sample might enable more convenient, time-saving methods. Unfortunately, the antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be obtained in all cases. Furthermore, antibiotic susceptibility testing in clinical practice yields useful information only for a few antibiotics: clarithromycin, metronidazole, and quinolones. In addition, susceptibility towards clarithromycin and metronidazole in vitro does not necessarily lead to eradication in vivo. In the case of H. pylori therapy failure, we should not re-administer any of the antibiotics against which H. pylori has probably become resistant. Our updated meta-analysis showed that susceptibility-guided treatment is not better than empirical treatment of H. pylori infection in first-line therapy if the most updated quadruple regimens are empirically prescribed, and similar efficacy results were also demonstrated with the two strategies for second-line therapy. Cumulative H. pylori eradication rate with several successive rescue therapies empirically prescribed reaches almost 100%. Finally, the studies that have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the susceptibility-guided treatment have achieved contradictory results. In summary, we can conclude that the evidence is too limited to support the generalized use of susceptibility-guided therapy for H. pylori treatment in routine clinical practice, either as first-line or as rescue treatment. Nevertheless, it would be recommended that susceptibility tests are performed routinely, even before prescribing first-line treatment, in specialized centers with an interest in H. pylori management.

### Antibiotics for sore throat [^9c1d9664]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a very common reason for people to seek medical care. It is a disease that remits spontaneously, that is, 'cure' is not dependent on treatment. Nonetheless primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for sore throat and other upper respiratory tract infections.

Objectives

To assess the benefits of antibiotics in the management of sore throat.

Search Strategy

Systematic search of the literature from 1945 to 2003, using electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 2, 2003); MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2003); EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2003), and the reference sections of the articles identified. We applied no language restrictions. We used abstracts of identified articles to identify trials.

Selection Criteria

Trials of antibiotic against control with either measures of the typical symptoms (throat soreness, headache or fever), or suppurative complications (meaning: forming pus) and non-suppurative complications of sore throat.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently screened potential studies for inclusion and resolved differences in opinion by discussion. The reviewers then independently extracted the data from the selected studies. We contacted the authors of three studies to acquire additional information not available in published articles. Potential studies were screened independently by two reviewers for inclusion, with differences in opinion resolved by discussion. Data was then independently extracted from studies selected by inclusion by two reviewers. Authors of three studies were contacted to acquire additional information not available in published articles.

Main Results

We included twenty-six studies, covering 12,669 cases of sore throat in the review.1. Non-suppurative complications There was a trend for protection against acute glomerulonephritis by antibiotics, but insufficient cases were recorded to be sure of this effect. Several studies found that antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever, to less than one third (odds ratio (OR) = 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.20 to 0.45). 2. Suppurative complications Antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media to about one quarter of that in the placebo group (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43) and reduced the incidence of acute sinusitis to about one half of that in the placebo group (OR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.10 to 2.05). The incidence of quinsy was also reduced in relation to placebo group (OR = 0.16; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.35). 3. Symptoms Symptoms of headache, throat soreness and fever were reduced by antibiotics to about one half. The greatest time for this to be evident was at about three and a half days (when the symptoms of about 50% of untreated patients had settled). About 90% of treated and untreated patients were free of symptoms by one week. The overall number needed to treat to prevent one sore throat at day three was about 5.0 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8); and at one week was 14.2 (95% CI 11.5 to 20.6). 4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction Subgroup analysis by age; blind versus unblinded; or use of antipyretics yielded no significant differences. The results of swabs of the throat for Streptococcus influenced the effect of antibiotics. If the swab was positive, antibiotics were more effective (the OR reduced to 0.16, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26) than if it was negative (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in modern Western society can be achieved only by treating with antibiotics many who will derive no benefit. In emerging economies where rates of for example acute rheumatic fever are high, the number needed to treat may be much lower. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by a mean of one day about half way through the illness (the time of maximal effect), and by about sixteen hours overall.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^361eed2e]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media — first-line antibiotic therapy and dosing: High-dose amoxicillin is recommended as the first-line treatment in most patients, with amoxicillin 80–90 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses as the recommended first-line regimen. In children who have taken amoxicillin in the previous 30 days, those with concurrent conjunctivitis, or those for whom coverage for β-lactamase–positive Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is desired, therapy should be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate, specified as 90 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate (amoxicillin to clavulanate ratio 14:1) given in 2 divided doses.

Regarding medical management for chronic bacterial prostatitis, more specifically with respect to general principles, PERG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider adding the following to first-line antibiotic therapy, depending on the symptoms at presentation:

- α-blockers and/or NSAIDs

- agents targeting neuropathic pain, such as pregabalin

- 5-ARIs, predominantly in patients with coexisting LUTS with BPH.

### First-and second-lineeradication with modified sequential therapy and modified levofloxacin-amoxicillin-based triple therapy [^af8ac8b9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

For patients who did not cure the infection after initial treatment, a 10-day triple therapy with PPI twice daily, levofloxacin (500 mg daily) and amoxicillin (2 g daily) is advised as the standard second-line treatment in both Italian and European guidelines. Indeed, such a therapy was proven to be more effective than quadruple therapy, and its efficacy was documented also following standard sequential therapy failure. Unfortunately, the cure rate following this therapy seems to be decreasing.

Based on these considerations, we designed a pilot study to evaluate two endpoints. The first was to assess the efficacy as first-line therapy of a modified 10-day sequential therapy characterized by an increased dose and schedule of PPI and antibiotic as well as by a reduction of the dual therapy from 5 to 3 days and subsequently prolongation of the following triple therapy from 5 to 7 days. The second was to appraise the effectiveness as second-line treatment of a modified 10-day levofloxacin-based triple therapy by increasing both the PPI dose and antibiotic frequency, aiming to improve its efficacy.

### Culture-based antibiotic susceptibility testing forinfection: a systematic review [^a444cb7b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

By considering data from more than 4500 patients, we compared the cure rates achieved by therapies tailored on antibiotic susceptibility and those empirically administered. As expected, the culture-tailored therapies were more successful overall than empiric regimens. Moreover, another advantage of the tailored strategy is to achieve bacterial eradication, in keeping with the rules of antibiotic stewardship, whilst empiric therapies inevitably lead to the misuse of antibiotics. Nevertheless, optimal (> 90%) eradication rates were achieved only when the tailored strategy was adopted before first- and second-line regimens, whilst suboptimal (< 80%) cure rates were observed following 2 or more therapy failures, namely when current European guidelines suggest that culture-tailored therapies should be administered. In addition, the therapeutic advantage of culture-tailored first-line therapy was mainly due to the low efficacy of the empiric therapies used as comparator in the studies we evaluated. Indeed, despite the use of first-line regimens including only those antibiotics with a proven susceptibility at culture, the eradication rate was not distinctly higher than 90%. This success rate would appear to be no different to that achieved by the more effective therapies currently available, such as sequential, concomitant and quadruple first-line regimens administered empirically. In addition, the lack of any therapeutic advantage of culture-based therapies clearly emerged in more recent studies, and in Western populations. Some host factors, especially those affecting the proton pump inhibitor metabolism (e.g. CYP 2C19 polymorphisms, etc.) may be involved in the difference between Asian and Caucasian studies.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^f7f6a5e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e72adfb2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — definition and timing of antibiotic treatment failure are specified as follows: For patients who have started on antibiotic therapy, treatment failure is defined as worsening of symptoms or failure to improve after 3 to 5 days, with worsening defined as the progression of presenting signs or symptoms of ABRS or the onset of new signs or symptoms, and failure to improve defined as a lack of reduction in presenting signs or symptoms of ABRS that would not apply if symptoms are persistent yet gradually improving. The statement lists "Policy level: Option". Fluctuations in signs and symptoms within the first 48 to 72 hours of initial therapy were not uncommon and not necessarily indicative of failure. Prior guidelines noted an "acceptable percentage of poor outcomes" when failure was defined at 7 days, but subsequent studies demonstrate an early response to effective antibiotic therapy, usually within 3 days, and the GUG felt that keeping a 7‑day cut‑point before changing antibiotics would result in more than an "acceptable percentage of poor outcomes".

Triple therapy: PPI + 2 antibiotics

The combination of two antibiotics and a PPI has been the recommended first-line therapy since the first published pediatric guidelines. In 2000, Oderda et al performed a systematic review of the published eradication treatment studies in children. Due to the marked heterogeneity and the limited number of well-designed studies it was difficult to make definitive recommendations. In 2001, the first randomized double blind trial comparing dual therapy of amoxicillin and clarithromycin with triple therapy including omeprazole in children confirmed that, in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, triple therapy was far superior to dual therapy with eradication rates of 74.2% versus 9.4%. A meta-analysis of eradication treatment efficacy in children concluded that, in general, the methodological quality of the studies was poor and that additional well-designed randomized trials are needed.

Simple abscess

Cutaneous abscesses are collections of pus within the dermis and deeper tissues.

To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its the borders of the abscess. Additionally, simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Epidermoid cysts, often named "sebaceous cysts", are usually due to infection of pilosebaceous gland and are present anywhere in the body lined by squamous epithelium.

Furuncles also named "boils" are superficial infections with suppuration of the hair follicle, usually caused by S. aureus. They extend through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, where form a small abscess. Furuncles can occur anywhere on hairy skin. A group of infected hair follicles with pus is named carbuncle. Carbuncles are larger and deeper than furuncles. Furuncles often rupture and drain spontaneously or following treatment with moist heat. Most large furuncles and all carbuncles should be treated with incision and drainage. Excision of carbuncle with primary split-thickness skin grafting is an alternative treatment modality.

A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection may be caused by local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material. Therefore, it always requires research of a local cause.

Treatment
Incision and drainage
Antibiotic therapy only in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days

Incision, evacuation of pus and debris, and probing of the cavity to break up loculations provide effective treatment of cutaneous abscesses. The resultant wound should be left open and lightly packed with roll gage soaked with antiseptic solution.

Antibiotic therapy should be prescribed for abscesses greater than 5 cm, in an area difficult to drain (e.g. face, hand, and genitalia), if there is lack of response to incision and drainage alone, if there are multiple localizations and in patients with immunosuppression.

### Culture: from bench to bedside [^343f7007]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

How do results of antibiotic susceptibility testing impact on therapy success?

A recent systematic review of comparative studies showed that H. pylori infection was cured in 89.9% of 2052 patients treated with antibiotic tailored therapies and in 77.6% of 2516 patients receiving empiric therapy (P < 0.001). However, in the sub-analysis, acceptably high eradication rates with tailored therapies were achieved only when the approach was applied before either first- (91.6% vs. 78.2%) or second-line (91.2% vs. 79%) therapies, but not before third-line treatment (79% vs. 70%), that is for the step suggested in all current guidelines. Beyond this observation, it is clinically relevant to note that the therapeutic advantage is mainly due to the low efficacy of empiric therapies used as a comparator, rather than a notably high success rate of antibiotic-tailored therapies, which is above 90%. The evidence that a similar cure rate may be achieved with current quadruple regimens, empirically administered as first-line therapies, further weakens the real advantage of culture in clinical practice. Indeed, for other infectious diseases, the use of an antibiotic therapy tailored to bacterial susceptibility testing is expected to achieve bacterial eradication in virtually all patients, but this seems not to be the case for H. pylori infection. The same phenomenon is expected when antibiotic susceptibility is genetically assessed using a culture-free, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tool, that overcomes the culture limitation of difficult bacterial growth. On the other hand, a recent randomized controlled trial found that, as second- or third-line treatment, therapy guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing was not significantly superior to the costless therapy guided by personal medication history, according to the intention to treat analysis (78.1% vs. 74.3%).

In summary: (a) the use of culture-based therapies following 2 failures, as suggested in current guidelines, allows us to achieve an eradication rate < 80%; and (b) even using therapies tailored to antibiotic susceptibility as first- or second-line treatments, the cure rate remains about 90%, similar to that of current empirically used quadruple regimens.

### Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: minimizing bacterial resistance [^4305796e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance in respiratory pathogens has become a common clinical problem that has serious public health implications. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for the treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) has contributed to the development of resistant microorganisms. Health care providers can help control the spread of resistance by limiting the use of antimicrobial agents to infections that meet clinical guidelines for a bacterial cause.

Objective

This article examines the means of accurately diagnosing and appropriately treating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in an effort to control increasing levels of resistance.

Methods

This article discusses current treatment guidelines that provide the evidenced-based rationale for choosing the most appropriate antimicrobial agents for suspected ABRS in adults and children. An evidence-based approach can help minimize the public health threat posed by the continuing increase in microbial resistance.

Results

Although definitive clinical criteria that differentiate between ABRS and viral URTI are lacking, careful evaluation of the duration and severity of symptoms provides a rational basis for diagnosing ABRS in primary care settings.

Conclusions

Once a diagnosis of ABRS has been made, empiric antibiotic therapy may be justified. When it is, the first-line agent should be the narrowest spectrum antibiotic that would be expected to eradicate the most common causative organisms. The antibiotic selection process should take into account prevailing patterns of resistance and the presence of risk factors for infection with resistant pathogens, as well as published evidence-based guidelines.

 Azithromycin tablets, are a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

1.1 Adult Patients

Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy.

1.2 Pediatric Patients

[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]

1.3 Limitations of Use

Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following:­

1.4 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Folliculitis and furunculosis — risk factors, persistence, decolonization, and misattribution — note that people whose skin or nasal mucosa is colonized with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) are at risk for recurrent folliculitis or furunculosis; folliculitis occurs only on hair-bearing surfaces and autoinoculation can occur during shaving; furuncles may continue occurring weeks or months after a traveler's return; if staphylococcal boils recur frequently, treatment may require a decolonization regimen with nasal mupirocin and a skin wash with an antimicrobial skin cleanser, and some protocols advise similar treatment for household members and close contacts; many travelers attribute boils to spider bites, but outside a few endemic areas (mainly the south-central US) necrotizing spider bites are extremely rare, and lesions are far more likely to be abscesses caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus and should be treated accordingly.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^fe5b6f95]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Comparison of sequential therapy and amoxicillin / tetracycline containing bismuth quadruple therapy for the first-line eradication of Helicobacter pylori: a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial [^819ebfd2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of gastric diseases such as chronic gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer, and it is well known that the eradication of H. pylori is important in preventing and treating these gastric diseases. Recently, the Kyoto Global Consensus Meeting, held in Japan in early February of 2014, presented radical changes in the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection, such as recommending eradication treatment for patients with dyspepsia. In addition, eradication therapy was recommended for all H. pylori -positive individuals for the purpose of preventing H. pylori- related diseases. However, the eradication rates of first-line triple therapy, which consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin), have been continuously decreasing. Only ~18% of previous studies have reported exceeding 85% eradication on an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, with ~60% falling short of 80%. The reason for the decrease in the efficacy of PPI-based triple therapy is mainly due to the increase in H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin. As such, in Western countries, standard triple therapy is currently considered a "legacy therapy". In fact, recent European guidelines recommended triple therapy as the first-line treatment only when the prevalence of clarithromycin resistance is under 20%.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^20ff43c0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic efficacy rationale and trial interpretation in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS): The purpose is to promote prescribing of antibiotics with known efficacy and safety for ABRS and to reduce prescribing of antibiotics with potentially inferior efficacy because of a limited antimicrobial spectrum against usual pathogens that cause ABRS in adults. Dozens of RCTs have assessed the comparative clinical efficacy of antibiotics for ABRS in adults, but most participants were not microbiologically confirmed and likely included uncomplicated viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) expected to recover spontaneously; this is supported by the finding that only ~50% clinically diagnosed ABRS had positive bacterial cultures by antral or middle meatal cultures.

### Helicobacter pylori: diagnosis and treatment [^0b09faf6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multiple diagnostic methods and treatment strategies have been developed to detect and treat the Helicobacter pylori infection. Many of them have stood the test of time; others lost their value with the introduction of new test and treatment modalities. This review focuses on the current diagnostic methods and their clinical implications, as well as on established and novel treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

The increasing antimicrobial resistance has resulted in a decline of the success rate of recommended eradication regimens. The current guidelines recommend as first-line treatment clarithromycin, amoxicillin or metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor twice daily, but recent studies have demonstrated an increasing eradication failure with these regimens. Several treatment modifications have been adopted regarding duration and combination of substances.

Summary

The currently recommended first-line treatments are effective and well tolerated. In areas with high antimicrobial resistance rates, new antibiotic combinations and modifications in the sequence of drug administration are proposed as alternative treatment options to standard triple therapy. Future treatment strategies have to focus on regional antimicrobial resistance adopted treatment selection and the development of new antibiotics.

### Treatment of impetigo… [^d6d89f99]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What are the best treatments for impetigo. Evidence-Based Answer Topical mupirocin and fusidic acid are more effective than placebo and at least as effective as oral antibiotics for the treatment of limited impetigo, and are better tolerated. Based on the available evidence on effectiveness, no clear preference can be given for any one oral antibiotic over another. Limited evidence does not support the use of topical antiseptics in the treatment of impetigo. There is insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of topical versus oral antibiotics in widespread impetigo. Two recent systematic reviews have cast doubt on the traditional role of oral antibiotics as first-line therapy for impetigo. The first, a meta-analysis of 57 trials including 3, 533 patients, studied varying comparisons of 20 oral and 18 topical treatments for impetigo.
4.

Oral antibiotic therapy caused more side effects than topical therapy. Topical antiseptic agents, which have traditionally been used either alone or in conjunction with other therapies, have not been adequately studied or have not been compared with placebo treatment. Two older studies were found comparing topical antibiotics with antiseptic treatment; pooled data favored topical antibiotic therapy. 4 Another meta-analysis of 16 trials indicated that topical antibiotics are more effective than placebo. 5 There was no significant difference found between the two topical antibiotics, mupirocin and fusidic acid. The review included three trials comparing oral erythromycin with these topical antibiotics and found weak evidence favoring topical therapy.

From the limited high-quality evidence available, the authors recommended a seven-day course of topical therapy for healthy patients with limited disease. Recommendations from Others The American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics have accepted the IDSA guidelines 6 but made no unique recommendations themselves. All three recommend topical treatment for limited infection and consideration of systemic penicillinase-resistant antibiotics in more widespread disease. 6.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^6589bf93]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria, and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotics is to use rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomised individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomised.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures; number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; number of participants in need of hospital admission by the end of follow-up; number of satisfied participants; number of participants with an adverse event attributed to the rapid test). We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses when feasible.

Main Results

We included five trials (2891 children and adult participants in total; 2545 participants after adjusting for clustering). Management in the intervention group was as follows: in three trials rapid tests were used in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, some physicians were asked to use rapid tests alone, while others were asked to use rapid tests in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, rapid tests were used alone. Based on data from five trials (2545 participants), a large reduction in prescribed antibiotics was found in the rapid test group (481/1197) versus management based on clinical grounds (865/1348), for a summary risk difference (RD) of -25%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -31% to -18%; I² = 62%; moderate-certainty evidence. Estimates of effect on antibiotic prescription rates were stable in various sensitivity analyses. Based on data from two trials (900 people) originating from the same overarching study, the evidence suggests that rapid tests may not reduce dispensed antibiotic treatments: rapid test group (156/445) versus management based on clinical grounds (197/455); summary RD -7%, 95% CI -17% to 2%; I² = 53%; low-certainty evidence. Four trials (2075 participants) reported data on the number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; the summary odds ratio (OR) was 0.85, 95% CI 0.03 to 26.65; P = 0.93; I² = 62%; very low-certainty evidence, which means that people in the rapid testing group were less likely to develop complications of the index infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. Two trials (1161 participants) reported on the number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; the summary OR was 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; P = 0.74; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence, which means that participants in the rapid testing group were more likely to be in need of re-consultation by the end of the study follow-up, but the evidence is uncertain. Lack of data impeded assessment of other secondary outcomes (including safety outcomes) and of sources of heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rapid testing to guide antibiotic treatment for sore throat in primary care probably reduces antibiotic prescription rates by 25% (absolute risk difference), but may have little or no impact on antibiotic dispensing. More studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of rapid test-guided antibiotic prescribing, notably to evaluate patient-centred outcomes and variability across subgroups (e.g. adults versus children).

### Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children [^5292687d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat'.
Main Results

We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin). We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^04bf5d49]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — Antibiotic selection and dosing in children: When considering antibiotic choices, uncomplicated ABRS in a child who has not received multiple previous courses of antibiotics can still be treated with amoxicillin (45 or 80 mg/kg/day). Another reasonable and safe choice is amoxicillin — clavulanate, and as the likelihood that the prevalence of H influenzae has increased in children with ABRS, amoxicillin clavulanate is the preferred treatment. If hypersensitivity to these antimicrobials is suspected, alternative choices include quinolones or clindamycin or linezolid with a second or third generation cephalosporins; penicillin skin testing may be considered in patients with β-lactam allergy if β-lactams are the most appropriate antibiotic. Clindamycin is useful if anaerobic organisms are suspected but provides no coverage against gram-negative organisms.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^099f05fb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated participants were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values.

Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: a 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [^fa22c577]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, first-line therapy, ESCMID/IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to initiate any of the following regimens as first-line therapy in female patients with uncomplicated cystitis:

- nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID for 5 days, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage and efficacy compared to 3 days of TMP/SMX

- TMP/SMX 160/800 mg BID for 3 days, if local resistance rates of uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis are < 20% or if the infecting strain is known to be susceptible

- fosfomycin trometamol 3 g in a single dose, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, recognizing that it appears to have inferior efficacy compared with standard short-course regimens

- pivmecillinam (in regions where it is available) 400 mg BID for 3–7 days, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, recognizing that it may have inferior efficacy compared with other available therapies.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^2e9eaee5]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥ 38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main outcome measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n = 433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n = 215) or 10 day (n = 218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n = 181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n = 182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval −9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n = 156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n = 165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### Improving antimicrobial prescribing practice for sore throat symptoms in a general practice setting [^ecdae469]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to health both at population and individual patient levels. A key driver of increasing resistance to antibiotics is their overuse worldwide.

The highest rates of antibiotic prescription in the UK takes place in general practice and most are for common respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as sore throat. General practice is also where most antibiotic treatment failures for RTIs, due to resistance and adverse side effects, increasingly occur.

Sore throat symptoms is one of the most common presentations in general practice worldwide, ranging from 2–4 percent. Most are due to viral infections and 90% resolve in 7 days without antibiotics. Antibiotic use has modest benefit in shortening the duration of illness with pain only reduced by 16 hours. Although antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of very rare complications of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis such as rheumatic fever, otitis media, acute sinusitis and quinsythe number needed to treat to prevent these complications is very high. Furthermore, in clinical practice it is difficult to determine the bacterial aetiology of sore throat symptoms. Therefore, the current guidelines from NICE and PHE in the UK recommend antibiotic use should be avoided for sore throat symptoms. The guidelines further recommend that clinical assessment based on the four Centor criteria (Lymphadenopathy; No Cough; Fever; Tonsillar Exudate)should be used to decide antibiotic prescription. For Centor score three or four, 2 or 3-day delayed or immediate antibiotic prescription could be considered. Guidelines also state the parameters of antibiotic prescribing: antibiotic choice, dose, frequency and duration. The recommendation of the duration of antibiotic use is based on Randomised Control Trial (RCT) in < 18 year olds, that shows 10 days phenoxymethylpenicillin course had lower relapse rates. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance is more likely if patients received longer duration, incomplete courses and broad spectrum antibiotics such as clarithromycin. Therefore, the guidelines recommend that phenoxymethypenicillin should be used as treatment of choice and a short course of clarithromycin must be reserved for those with true penicillin allergy.

Antibiotic guidelines have introduced evidence-based recommendations to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial prescription in general practice. Thus, improving compliance with national policies will reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs, it will also contribute to better patient care by reducing antibiotic-associated adverse side effects.

### Innovative management of recurrent furunculosis [^6ff16d46]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

One of the most common bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissue is furunculosis (boil), an inflammatory nodule that involves the hair follicle, with small abscess formation extending through the dermis into the subcutaneous layers. Treatment of recurrent furunculosis is a difficult and challenging process. The mainstay of therapy is incision and drainage of a furuncle coupled with bacterial culture. Affected patients and their family members must practice good hygiene, predicated with regular hand washing, fomite cleaning, and avoiding contact with contaminated skin.

### Efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy as the first-line regimen for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^ef049f45]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In an era of antibiotic resistance, modified dual therapy has been paid much attention because of simple drug composition and low resistance of amoxicillin. However, its eradication rate as a first-line regimen remains controversial. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy for the initial treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection compared with mainstream first-line therapies.

Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy as the initial treatment for H. pylori eradication compared with guideline-recommended first-line therapies. A meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 and dichotomous data were estimated by the risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI). We also performed subgroup analysis according to control groups and studies with antibiotic susceptibility tests.

Results

Eight studies including 1672 patients with H. pylori infection met the selection criteria and were assessed. The meta-analysis demonstrated that modified dual therapy achieved similar efficacy [85.83% vs. 86.77%, RR 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95–1.03), intention-to-treat analysis; 89.53% vs. 90.45%, RR 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96–1.02), per-protocol analysis] and compliance [95.77% vs. 95.56%, RR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98–1.02)] compared with recommended first-line regimens. In addition, there were no significant differences in comparing the eradication rate of modified dual therapy with clarithromycin triple therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy, and concomitant therapy, respectively. Subgroup analysis based on the studies with antibiotic susceptibility tests also confirmed a similar efficacy. However, modified dual therapy showed fewer adverse effects [8.70% vs. 22.38%, RR 0.39 (95% CI, 0.28–0.54)], with a significant difference (P < 0.00001).

Conclusion

Modified dual therapy achieved equal efficacy and compliance compared with recommended first-line regimens for H. pylori infection, and generally modified dual therapy showed fewer side effects.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^b11c1296]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common worldwide infection that is an important cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. H. pylori may also have a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin or starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, patients should be asked about previous antibiotic exposure and this information should be incorporated into the decision-making process. For first-line treatment, clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pylori isolates is known to be low. Most patients will be better served by first-line treatment with bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. When first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were previously used. If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. If a patient received first-line bismuth quadruple therapy, clarithromycin or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. Details regarding the drugs, doses and durations of the recommended and suggested first-line and salvage regimens can be found in the guideline.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^9e23adf2]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients without a penicillin allergy who do not respond to first-line therapy: Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients without a penicillin allergy fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral amoxicillin or oral penicillin V potassium, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^9ff8dfe9]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^16541ab4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

'Complete the antibiotic course', a dogma to be debunked

In medical schools we have been taught to advise our patients to always complete an antibiotic course once initiated. This was deemed suitable to minimise the development of AMR. However, this often-heard statement that to prevent AMR it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course, even after the resolution of symptoms, by eradicating every bacterium that could result in a future relapse, remains unproved. To the contrary, the longer patients and the environment are exposed to antibiotics, the greater the selective pressure driving AMR.

Even short courses of antibiotics can have long-term effects causing persistence of resistant organisms lasting years and altering the normal gut microbiome and might be detrimental. By shortening antibiotic duration, overall antibiotic exposure is lessened, reducing the selection pressure for multidrug-resistant organisms. This is particularly evident in patients with pneumonia as some randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that shorter treatments yield similar clinical outcomes to longer courses but are associated with lower rates of infection recurrence and AMR. This observation is consistent with what we know about natural selection. AMR emerges at the site of infection in only a few types of infections; moreover, resistance typically emerges off target, among colonising flora away from the site of infection. A recent study showed that for eight of nine potential pathogens of interest, over 80% of their exposures to commonly used antibiotic classes in the outpatient setting occur when the organisms are asymptomatically colonising the microbiome, not causing disease.

Over the last years there has been an increasing number of independent bodies, scientific academies and institutions abandoning this principle on completing antibiotic courses. In addition, in 2017, the World Health Organization abandoned this dogma. The best way to contravene this historical belief is by providing new evidence from randomised clinical trials setting a revised standard for antimicrobial therapy durations. Conventional stewardship strategies aimed at patients not requiring antibiotics do not help those who truly need them but receive excessively long treatment. However, encouraging a minimum duration of therapy might be more attainable than completely refraining from antibiotic therapy, as shown in qualitative studies. In such instances, the potential harm posed by unnecessary therapy to patients without bacterial infections is considerably lower compared to adhering to standard durations, and it can prove beneficial to those with genuine bacterial infections.

### Immediate versus delayed versus no antibiotics for respiratory infections [^019bb21f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. One proposed strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions, but to advise delay in antibiotic use with the expectation that symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007, and updated in 2010, 2013 and 2017.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects on duration and/or severity of clinical outcomes (pain, malaise, fever, cough and rhinorrhoea), antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance and patient satisfaction of advising a delayed prescription of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections.

Search Methods

From May 2017 until 20 August 2022, this was a living systematic review with monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 20 August 2022. Due to the abundance of evidence supporting the review's key findings, it ceased being a living systematic review on 21 August 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving participants of all ages with an RTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to immediate or no antibiotics. We defined a delayed antibiotic as advice to delay the filling of an antibiotic prescription by at least 48 hours. We considered all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were recommended or not.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

For this 2022 update, we added one new trial enrolling 448 children (436 analysed) with uncomplicated acute RTIs. Overall, this review includes 12 studies with a total of 3968 participants, of which data from 3750 are available for analysis. These 12 studies involved acute RTIs including acute otitis media (three studies), streptococcal pharyngitis (three studies), cough (two studies), sore throat (one study), common cold (one study) and a variety of RTIs (two studies). Six studies involved only children, two only adults and four included both adults and children. Six studies were conducted in primary care, four in paediatric clinics and two in emergency departments. Studies were well reported and appeared to provide moderate-certainty evidence. Randomisation was not adequately described in two trials. Four trials blinded the outcome assessor, and three included blinding of participants and doctors. We conducted meta-analyses for pain, malaise, fever, adverse effects, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction. Cough (four studies): we found no differences amongst delayed, immediate and no prescribed antibiotics for clinical outcomes in any of the four studies. Sore throat (six studies): for the outcome of fever with sore throat, four of the six studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and two found no difference. For the outcome of pain related to sore throat, two studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and four found no difference. Two studies compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotic for sore throat, and found no difference in clinical outcomes. Acute otitis media (four studies): two studies compared immediate with delayed antibiotics - one found no difference for fever, and the other favoured immediate antibiotics for pain and malaise severity on Day 3. Two studies compared delayed with no antibiotics: one found no difference for pain and fever severity on Day 3, and the other found no difference for the number of children with fever on Day 3. Common cold (two studies): neither study found differences for clinical outcomes between delayed and immediate antibiotic groups. One study found delayed antibiotics were probably favoured over no antibiotics for pain, fever and cough duration (moderate-certainty evidence).

Adverse Effects

there were either no differences for adverse effects or results may have favoured delayed over immediate antibiotics with no significant differences in complication rates (low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic use: delayed antibiotics probably resulted in a reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.07; 8 studies, 2257 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, a delayed antibiotic was probably more likely to result in reported antibiotic use than no antibiotics (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.75; 5 studies, 1529 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Patient satisfaction: patient satisfaction probably favoured delayed over no antibiotics (OR 1.45, 1.08 to 1.96; 5 studies, 1523 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably no difference in patient satisfaction between delayed and immediate antibiotics (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.29; 7 studies, 1927 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. Reconsultation rates and use of alternative medicines were similar for delayed, immediate and no antibiotic strategies. In one of the four studies reporting use of alternative medicines, less paracetamol was used in the immediate group compared to the delayed group.

Authors' Conclusions

For many clinical outcomes, there were no differences between prescribing strategies. Symptoms for acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved by immediate antibiotics compared with delayed antibiotics. There were no differences in complication rates. Delaying prescribing did not result in significantly different levels of patient satisfaction compared with immediate provision of antibiotics (86% versus 91%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, delay was favoured over no antibiotics (87% versus 82%). Delayed antibiotics achieved lower rates of antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (30% versus 93%). The strategy of no antibiotics further reduced antibiotic use compared to delaying prescription for antibiotics (13% versus 27%). Delayed antibiotics for people with acute respiratory infection reduced antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics, but was not shown to be different to no antibiotics in terms of symptom control and disease complications. Where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately for people with RTIs, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delayed antibiotics. Where clinicians are not confident in not prescribing antibiotics, delayed antibiotics may be an acceptable compromise in place of immediate prescribing to significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for RTIs, while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction levels. Further research into antibiotic prescribing strategies for RTIs may best be focused on identifying patient groups at high risk of disease complications, enhancing doctors' communication with patients to maintain satisfaction, ways of increasing doctors' confidence to not prescribe antibiotics for RTIs, and policy measures to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for RTIs.

### Efficacy of second-line regimens foreradication treatment: a systemic review and network meta-analysis [^7b7b9162]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BQT) and quinolone-containing therapy after failure of first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. However, the optimum regimen of second-line eradication therapy remains elusive. We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the relative efficacy of 16 second-line H. pylori eradication regimens.

Methods

Three major bibliographic databases were reviewed to enrol relevant randomised controlled trials between January 2000 and September 2018. Network meta-analysis was conducted by STATA software and we performed subgroup analysis in countries with high clarithromycin resistance and high levofloxacin resistance, and in patients with documented failure of first-line triple therapy.

Results

Fifty-four studies totalling 8752 participants who received 16 regimens were eligible for analysis. Compared with a 7-day BQT, use of probiotic add-on therapy during, before, and after second-line antibiotic regimens, quinolone-based sequential therapy for 10–14 days, quinolone-based bismuth quadruple therapy for 10–14 days, bismuth quadruple therapy for 10–14 days, and quinolone-based triple therapy for 10–14 days were significantly superior to the other regimens. Subgroup analysis of countries with high clarithromycin resistance and high levofloxacin resistance revealed that the ranking of second-line eradication regimens was distributed similarly in each group, as well as in patients with failure of first-line triple therapy.

Conclusion

We conducted a detailed comparison of second-line H. pylori regimens according to different antibiotic resistance rates and the results suggest alternative treatment choices with potential benefits beyond those that could be achieved using salvage therapies recommended by guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^862326b1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — assessment before prescribing antibacterial therapy: The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with CRS if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination. Evidence strength is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are limited in number but demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm when limiting the indiscriminate use of antibiotics for CRS treatment. Benefits include avoiding therapy designed to address an infectious condition when no infection exists; prevent harm and adverse effects from therapy that is not beneficial; limit induced bacterial resistance; reduce cost, while risks include possibly missing or delaying therapy for a bacterial infection that does not have obvious discolored or purulent nasal discharge. The word "significant" is used to allow for clinician judgment regarding the severity of the purulence and the impact on the patient; the word "persistent" is used to limit making a judgment on a single observation. Exceptions note that macrolide antibiotics may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties that may provide therapeutic benefits for select CRS patients, although the data for macrolide antibiotics in CRS treatment are mixed. Supporting context clarifies that antibiotic therapy has had a role in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, which is characterized by purulent nasal drainage that persists for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms or worsens within 10 days after an initial improvement.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^5f8aa2d7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) patient information — symptom course, watchful waiting, and antibiotics: Most patients with ABRS feel better within 7 days and by 15 days about 90% are cured or improved. Watchful waiting means delaying antibiotic treatment of ABRS for up to 5 days after diagnosis, with a prescription to be filled only if not better after 5 days or if worse at any time. Both watchful waiting and antibiotic therapy are proven ways to treat ABRS, and antibiotics only slightly increase symptom relief with about 10–15 people must use antibiotics to get 1 more person better after 7–15 days; antibiotics have side effects including rash, upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, and causing resistant germs. If antibiotics are used, they are usually given for 10 days; ask your doctor about a 5–7 day course of antibiotics since side effects are less common. For symptomatic relief, nasal steroid sprays can reduce symptoms after 15 days of use but the benefit is small (about 14 people must use them to get 1 person better), decongestant nasal sprays should be used for no more than 3 days in a row, and antihistamines and oral steroid medicines should not be used routinely.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^429f7af7]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years — initial management and antibiotics: The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for children with severe onset or worsening course, and should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the first-line treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is caregiver report of worsening or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management, and if the diagnosis is confirmed with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

### Delayed antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory infections [^7aa1b31a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost, and antibacterial resistance. One proposed strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions, but to advise delay in antibiotic use with the expectation that symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007, and updated in 2010 and 2013.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects on clinical outcomes, antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance, and patient satisfaction of advising a delayed prescription of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections.

Search Methods

For this 2017 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2017), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register; Ovid MEDLINE (2013 to 25 May 2017); Ovid Embase (2013 to 2017 Week 21); EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1984 to 25 May 2017); Web of Science (2013 to 25 May 2017); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (1 September 2017); and ClinicalTrials.gov (1 September 2017).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving participants of all ages defined as having an RTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to immediate antibiotics or no antibiotics. We defined a delayed antibiotic as advice to delay the filling of an antibiotic prescription by at least 48 hours. We considered all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were recommended or not.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Three review authors independently extracted and collated data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

For this 2017 update we added one new trial involving 405 participants with uncomplicated acute respiratory infection. Overall, this review included 11 studies with a total of 3555 participants. These 11 studies involved acute respiratory infections including acute otitis media (three studies), streptococcal pharyngitis (three studies), cough (two studies), sore throat (one study), common cold (one study), and a variety of RTIs (one study). Five studies involved only children, two only adults, and four included both adults and children. Six studies were conducted in a primary care setting, three in paediatric clinics, and two in emergency departments. Studies were well reported, and appeared to be of moderate quality. Randomisation was not adequately described in two trials. Four trials blinded the outcomes assessor, and three included blinding of participants and doctors. We conducted meta-analysis for antibiotic use and patient satisfaction. We found no differences among delayed, immediate, and no prescribed antibiotics for clinical outcomes in the three studies that recruited participants with cough. For the outcome of fever with sore throat, three of the five studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and two found no difference. For the outcome of pain related to sore throat, two studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and three found no difference. One study compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotic for sore throat, and found no difference in clinical outcomes. Three studies included participants with acute otitis media. Of the two studies with an immediate antibiotic arm, one study found no difference for fever, and the other study favoured immediate antibiotics for pain and malaise severity on Day 3. One study including participants with acute otitis media compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotics and found no difference for pain and fever on Day 3. Two studies recruited participants with common cold. Neither study found differences for clinical outcomes between delayed and immediate antibiotic groups. One study favoured delayed antibiotics over no antibiotics for pain, fever, and cough duration (moderate quality evidence for all clinical outcomes - GRADE assessment). There were either no differences for adverse effects or results favoured delayed antibiotics over immediate antibiotics (low quality evidence - to GRADE assessment) with no significant differences in complication rates. Delayed antibiotics resulted in a significant reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics prescription (odds ratio (OR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.05). However, a delayed antibiotic was more likely to result in reported antibiotic use than no antibiotics (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.08) (moderate quality evidence - GRADE assessment). Patient satisfaction favoured delayed over no antibiotics (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.06). There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between delayed antibiotics and immediate antibiotics (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10) (moderate quality evidence - GRADE assessment). None of the included studies evaluated antibiotic resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

For many clinical outcomes, there were no differences between prescribing strategies. Symptoms for acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved by immediate antibiotics compared with delayed antibiotics. There were no differences in complication rates. Delaying prescribing did not result in significantly different levels of patient satisfaction compared with immediate provision of antibiotics (86% versus 91%) (moderate quality evidence). However, delay was favoured over no antibiotics (87% versus 82%). Delayed antibiotics achieved lower rates of antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (31% versus 93%) (moderate quality evidence). The strategy of no antibiotics further reduced antibiotic use compared to delaying prescription for antibiotics (14% versus 28%). Delayed antibiotics for people with acute respiratory infection reduced antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics, but was not shown to be different to no antibiotics in terms of symptom control and disease complications. Where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately for people with respiratory infections, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delaying prescription of antibiotics. Where clinicians are not confident in using a no antibiotic strategy, a delayed antibiotics strategy may be an acceptable compromise in place of immediate prescribing to significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for RTIs, and thereby reduce antibiotic resistance, while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction levels. Editorial note: As a living systematic review, this review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

### Ten-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy vs standard 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy for first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^ad38ec33]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Helicobacter pylori is a widespread bacterium that typically infects the human gastric mucosa. H. pylori infection is universally acknowledged as a main risk factor of numerous gastrointestinal diseases, including gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma. Affecting approximately 50% of the global population, H. pylori infection has been a worldwide threat to human health.

Strategy of H. pylori screening and eradication in asymptomatic individuals is a cost-effective way to prevent gastric cancer. And nowadays, H. pylori eradication therapies are facing challenges with decreasing eradication rates, which mainly attribute to antimicrobial resistance such as clarithromycin, and are partially influenced by the efficacy of acid-suppressive drugs. Till now, international guidelines and consensus conferences still recommend bismuth-based quadruple (B-quadruple) therapies as first-line therapy for H. pylori infection in high clarithromycin resistance (resistance rate > 15%) areas. First-line B-quadruple therapies contain 2 types of antibiotics, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and bismuth, to overcome antimicrobial resistance and have reached an eradication rate approximately 90%. Despite improvement in the eradication rate, long-lasting B-quadruple regimens are restricted in clinical generalization owing to availability of conventional antibiotics (such as tetracycline and furazolidone) and bismuth and increasing side effects, poor compliance, and heavy cost. In addition, multiple antibiotics application could induce perturbation of fecal microbiota diversity and increase secondary antibiotic resistance (for instance, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole), which would limit the choice of rescue regimen in patients with a failure of first-line eradication. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel regimens applying minimal antibiotics with shorter treatment duration while achieving satisfied H. pylori eradication rates.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN Recommendation 14 — first-line therapy for pediatric Helicobacter pylori should be susceptibility-guided: We recommend the following as first-line therapy for H pylori infection as outlined in Table 2 (GRADE: Strong; Agreement: 100%). If the strain is susceptible to clarithromycin (CLA) and to metronidazole (MET), triple therapy (proton pump inhibitor [PPI], amoxicillin [AMO], CLA) for 14 days is the preferred choice; in case of treatment failure with PPI, AMO, and CLA a switch to PPI, AMO, and MET can be made without further susceptibility testing. Sequential therapy for 10 days (PPI with AMO for 5 days followed by PPI with CLA and MET for 5 days) is equally effective in fully susceptible strains but should not be given if the strain is resistant to MET or CLA, or if susceptibility testing is not available. Recommended therapies should be based on knowledge of antibiotic susceptibility testing.

Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role.

### Joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori in children and adolescents (update 2016) [^932cbab6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 16 — rescue therapy after treatment failure in children: We recommend that when H pylori treatment fails, rescue therapy should be individualized considering antibiotic susceptibility, the age of the child, and available antimicrobial options (GRADE: Strong recommendation; Quality of evidence: low; Agreement: 93%). In patients who have previously failed eradication therapy, the choice of rescue therapy should consider initial antibiotic susceptibility status and the first-line regimens employed; where possible, rescue therapy should be based on antibiotic resistance profiles, and antibiotics with a high likelihood of the infecting strain to develop secondary resistance (eg, clarithromycin, metronidazole) should be avoided if they were employed in the initial regimen.

### Practical treatment of Helicobacter pylori: a balanced view in changing times [^00d5f932]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Eradication rates of first-line triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection have fallen in the recent years. The main reasons for treatment failure are poor compliance due to complicated treatment regimens and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of H. pylori. Treatment failure is a cause for concern with regard to the complications of H. pylori infection, which include gastric and peptic ulcers, gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. This review describes considerations for optimizing standard first-line triple therapy, as well as alternatives to the standard first-line treatment, such as bismuth quadruple therapy, sequential therapy, concomitant therapy and hybrid therapy. Studies using levofloxacin-based and rifabutin-based regimens for the treatment of multiresistant infections have also been reviewed. The current most up-to-date systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing the efficacy of these treatments have been discussed, in light of the recent antimicrobial susceptibility testing data, regional antibiotic resistance rates and the Maastricht IV guidelines on the management of H. pylori infection.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for acute otitis media for children 2 Years and older [^2aa33d46]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the frequency that non-first-line antibiotics, safety-net antibiotic prescriptions (SNAPS), and longer than recommended durations of antibiotics were prescribed for children ≥ 2 years of age with acute otitis media and examine patient and system level factors that contributed to these outcomes.

Study Design

Children age ≥ 2 years with acute otitis media seen at Denver Health Medical Center outpatient locations from January to December 2018 were included. The percentages of patients who received first-line antibiotics, SNAPs, and recommended durations of antibiotics were determined. Factors associated with non-first-line and longer than recommended antibiotic durations were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression modeling.

Results

Of the 1025 visits evaluated, 98.0% were prescribed an antibiotic; only 4.5% of antibiotics were SNAPs. Non-first-line antibiotics were prescribed to 18.8% of patients. Most antibiotic durations (94.1%) were longer than the institution recommended 5 days and 54.3% were ≥ 10 days. Private insurance was associated with non-first-line antibiotics (aOR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1; 14–3.14, P = 0.01). Patients who were younger (2–5 years; aOR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.32–3.05; P < .001) or seen in emergency/urgent care sites (aOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.26–2.38; P < .001) were more likely to receive ≥ 10 days of antibiotic compared with those in pediatric clinics.

Conclusions

Antibiotic stewardship interventions that emphasize the duration of antibiotic therapy as well as the use of SNAPs or observation may be higher yield than those focusing on first-line therapy alone. Numerous system and patient level factors are associated with off-guideline prescribing.

### Infection in children [^5bc47f58]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Treatment regimens for ﬁrst-line therapy should provide a cure rate of at least 90%. Excessive indication of antibiotics or ineffective treatment regimens for H. pylori infection has led to an increase in the resistance of key antibiotics for treatment.

Adapting the first line of treatment according to susceptibility would be ideal (table 3), but we know that in practice it is difficult so therefore in many regions treatment is indicated empirically. Clarithromycin (CLA) is the choice of treatment in patients with susceptible strains. If the resistance rate exceeds 15%–20% in that region, it should not be used unless sensitivity to this antibiotic is known in the patient; therefore, in patients with known sensitivity to CLA and metronidazole (MET), the first recommended option is PPI-AMO-CLA. They can use sequential therapy as alternative treatment. In those with known resistance to CLA, triple therapy with PPI-AMO-MET is indicated, and PPI-AMO-CLA for those with resistance to MET. In both cases, bismuth therapy can be used as an alternative treatment. Patients with unknown susceptibility or double resistance are not recommended to treat with PPI-AMO-CLA. Triple therapy with high doses of AMO can be considered as the first line of treatment, as well as bismuth-based and concomitant therapy as treatment alternatives. Treatment regimens and doses are based on European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^fdf5548a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are listed by the Centres for Disease Control and prevention as one of the top 5 urgent threats in the USA. CDI occurs from gut microbiome dysbiosis, typically through antibiotic-mediated disruption; however, antibiotics are the treatment of choice, which can result in recurrent infections. Here, we highlight new treatments available and provide a perspective on different classes of future treatments.

Recent Findings

Due to the reduced risk of disease recurrence, the microbiome-sparing antibiotic Fidaxomicin has been recommended as the first-line treatment for C. difficile infection. Based on the success of faecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) in treating CDI recurrence, defined microbiome biotherapeutics offer a safer and more tightly controlled alterative as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Given the association between antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the recurrence of CDI, future prospective therapies aim to reduce the dependence on antibiotics for the treatment of CDI.

Summary

With current first-in-line antibiotic therapy options associated with high levels of recurrent CDI, the availability of new generation targeted therapeutics can really impact treatment success. There are still unknowns about the long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics, but efforts to expand the CDI treatment toolbox can offer multiple solutions for clinicians to treat this multifaceted infectious disease to reduce patient suffering.

### Pragmatic randomised trial assessing the impact of peer comparison and therapeutic recommendations, including repetition, on antibiotic prescribing patterns of family physicians across British Columbia for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections [^e3a44ad6]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Interventions

AF: The first page of the confidential personalised prescribing tool shows 2019–2020 first-line prescribing patterns for oral antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated lower UTI and the current recommendations for BC. The primary recommendation is to choose nitrofurantoin for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI. A second message recommends choosing fosfomycin as first-line therapy for patients who cannot tolerate nitrofurantoin due to allergy or have impaired renal function. A final recommendation advises against prescribing ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and other antibiotics as first-line empiric therapy due to bacterial resistance rates in BC and adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones. Each message is accompanied by a bar chart depicting the physicians' individual prescribing compared with the average BC FP. The second page of the AF provides supporting evidence for why nitrofurantoin is recommended for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI including a graph of 10-year history of E. coli isolates resistance rates by an antibiotic agent from the BC Centre for Disease Control Antimicrobial Resistance Dashboard. It shows escalating resistance to cephalexin over 50%, relative stability of∼40% resistance to amoxicillin, ∼20% resistance to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX and low or declining < 10% resistance to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. This makes it visually obvious which antibiotic is least likely to be resisted.

The evidence summary describes antimicrobial best practices for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated lower UTI in BC. It recommends diagnosing uncomplicated UTI based on patient symptoms and against routine use of a urine dipstick/urinalysis or urine culture for diagnosing as testing abnormalities increase with age. Empiric treatment with nitrofurantoin (Macrobid 100 mg two times a day or Macrodantin 50 mg four times a day) for 5–7 days is recommended with fosfomycin recommended as an alternative when there is an allergy or intolerance to nitrofurantoin. TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams are unsuitable for empiric therapy (unguided by susceptibility profile) in BC due to bacterial resistance. See onlinesupplemental files 1 2 for the sample AF and ES.

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment of MRSA infections in… [^4ea7e4b4]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Skin and Soft-Tissue Infections in Community-Associated MRSA Simple abscesses or boils may be managed with incision and drainage alone; more data are needed on the use of antibiotics in this setting. Antibiotics are recommended for patients who have abscesses associated with severe or extensive disease or rapid progression in the presence of associated cellulitis; signs and symptoms of systemic illness; associated comorbidities or immunosuppression; very young or very old age; abscesses in areas difficult to drain; associated septic phlebitis; or lack of response to incision and drainage alone. Empiric therapy for five to 10 days is recommended pending culture results for outpatients with purulent cellulitis. Infection from β-hemolytic streptococci does not usually require empiric therapy.

For those with nonpurulent cellulitis, five to 10 days of empiric therapy for β-hemolytic streptococcal infection is recommended, based on the patient's clinical response. Empiric coverage for community-associated MRSA is recommended in patients who do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics, and also may be considered in those with systemic toxicity. A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response. Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak.

Dilute bleach baths can be made with 1 teaspoon of bleach per 1 gallon of water and are given for 15 minutes twice per week for three months. Oral antimicrobial therapy is recommended only for treating active infection and is not routinely recommended for decolonization. An oral agent in combination with rifampin, if the strain is susceptible, may be considered if infections recur despite these measures. In patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be used with drainage procedures.

### Dual antibiotics for bronchiectasis [^24a2a597]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the smaller airways and associated with a mortality rate greater than twice that of the general population. Antibiotics serve as front-line therapy for managing bacterial load, but their use is weighed against the development of antibiotic resistance. Dual antibiotic therapy has the potential to suppress infection from multiple strains of bacteria, leading to more successful treatment of exacerbations, reduced symptoms, and improved quality of life. Further evidence is required on the efficacy of dual antibiotics in terms of management of exacerbations and extent of antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of dual antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), which includes the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), and PsycINFO, as well as studies obtained by handsearching of journals/abstracts. We also searched the following trial registries: US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We imposed no restriction on language of publication. We conducted our search in October 2017.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing dual antibiotics versus a single antibiotic for short-term (< 4 weeks) or long-term management of bronchiectasis diagnosed in adults and/or children by bronchography, plain film chest radiography, or high-resolution computed tomography. Primary outcomes included exacerbations, length of hospitalisation, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were response rates, emergence of resistance to antibiotics, systemic markers of infection, sputum volume and purulence, measures of lung function, adverse events/effects, deaths, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life. We did not apply outcome measures as selection criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of 287 records, along with the full text of seven reports. Two studies met review inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias. We extracted data from only one study and conducted GRADE assessments for the following outcomes: successful treatment of exacerbation; response rates; and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Two randomised trials assessed the effectiveness of oral plus inhaled dual therapy versus oral monotherapy in a total of 118 adults with a mean age of 62.8 years. One multi-centre trial compared inhaled tobramycin plus oral ciprofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin alone, and one single-centre trial compared nebulised gentamicin plus systemic antibiotics versus a systemic antibiotic alone. Published papers did not report study funding sources. Effect estimates from one small study with 53 adults showed no evidence of treatment benefit with oral plus inhaled dual therapy for the following primary outcomes at the end of the study: successful management of exacerbation - cure at day 42 (odds ratio (OR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 2.01; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence); number of participants with Pseudomonas aeruginosa eradication at day 21 (OR 2.33, 95% CI 0.66 to 8.24; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence); and serious adverse events (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.87; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence). Similarly, researchers provided no evidence of treatment benefit for the following secondary outcomes: clinical response rates - relapse at day 42 (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.69; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence); microbiological response rate at day 21 - eradicated (OR 2.40, 95% CI 0.67 to 8.65; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence); and adverse events - incidence of wheeze (OR 5.75, 95% CI 1.55 to 21.33). Data show no evidence of benefit in terms of sputum volume, lung function, or antibiotic resistance. Outcomes from a second small study with 65 adults, available only as an abstract, were not included in the quantitative data synthesis. The included studies did not report our other primary outcomes: duration; frequency; and time to next exacerbation; nor our secondary outcomes: systemic markers of infection; exercise capacity; and quality of life. We did not identify any trials that included children.

Authors' Conclusions

A small number of studies in adults have generated high-quality evidence that is insufficient to inform robust conclusions, and studies in children have provided no evidence. We identified only one dual-therapy combination of oral and inhaled antibiotics. Results from this single trial of 53 adults that we were able to include in the quantitative synthesis showed no evidence of treatment benefit with oral plus inhaled dual therapy in terms of successful treatment of exacerbations, serious adverse events, sputum volume, lung function, and antibiotic resistance. Further high-quality research is required to determine the efficacy and safety of other combinations of dual antibiotics for both adults and children with bronchiectasis, particularly in terms of antibiotic resistance.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^6a7bb38a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 20% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clindamycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, glycopeptides (teicoplanin, vancomycin), linezolid, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin, rifampicin, tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline), tigecycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).

### Systemic and topical antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^ab3ebe00]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used with the aim of eliminating infection in the short term (and some to reduce inflammation in the long term), in order to normalise nasal mucus and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo or (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) and anaphylaxis or other very serious reactions.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (293 participants), all of which compared systemic antibiotics with placebo or another pharmacological intervention. The varying study characteristics made comparison difficult. Four studies recruited only adults and one only children. Three used macrolide, one tetracycline and one a cephalosporin-type antibiotic. Three recruited only patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, one recruited patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and one had a mixed population. Three followed up patients for 10 to 12 weeks after treatment had finished. Systemic antibiotics versus placebo Three studies compared antibiotics with placebo (176 participants). One study (64 participants, without polyps) reported disease-specific HRQL using the SNOT-20 (0 to 5, 0 = best quality of life). At the end of treatment (three months) the SNOT-20 score was lower in the group receiving macrolide antibiotics than the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -0.54 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.10), corresponding to a moderate effect size favouring antibiotics (moderate quality evidence). Three months after treatment, it is uncertain if there was a difference between groups. One study (33 participants, with polyps) provided information on gastrointestinal disturbances and suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) after a short course of tetracycline antibiotic compared with placebo. We are very uncertain if antibiotics were associated with an increase in gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.50) or skin irritation (RR 6.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 128.86) (very low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids One study (60 participants, some with and some without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with placebo; all participants also used saline irrigation and 70% used intranasal corticosteroids. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using SNOT-22 (0 to 110, 0 = best quality of life). Data were difficult to interpret (highly skewed and baseline imbalances) and it is unclear if there was an important difference at any time point (low quality evidence). To assess patient-reported disease severity participants rated the effect of treatment on a five-point scale (-2 for "desperately worse" to 2 for "cured") at the end of treatment (three months). For improvement in symptoms there was no difference between the antibiotics and placebo groups; the RR was 1.50 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.79; very low quality evidence), although there were also slightly more people who felt worse after treatment in the antibiotics group. There was no demonstrable difference in the rate of gastrointestinal disturbances between the groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10). General HRQL was measured using the SF-36. The authors stated that there was no difference between groups at the end of treatment (12 weeks) or two weeks later. Systemic antibiotics versus intranasal corticosteroids One study (43 participants, without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with intranasal corticosteroids. Patient-reported disease severity was assessed using a composite symptom score (0 to 40; 0 = no symptoms). It is very uncertain if there was a difference as patient-reported disease severity was similar between groups (MD -0.32, 95% CI -2.11 to 1.47; low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics versus oral corticosteroids One study (28 participants, with polyps) compared a short course of tetracycline antibiotic (unclear duration, ˜20 days) with a 20-day course of oral corticosteroids. We were unable to extract data on any of the primary efficacy outcomes. It is uncertain if there was a difference ingastrointestinal disturbances (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.14) or skin irritation (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 19.62) as the results for these outcomes were similar between groups (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found very little evidence that systemic antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. We did find moderate quality evidence of a modest improvement in disease-specific quality of life in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps receiving three months of a macrolide antibiotic. The size of improvement was moderate (0.5 points on a five-point scale) and only seen at the end of the three-month treatment; by three months later no difference was found. Despite a general understanding that antibiotics can be associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, the results in this review were very uncertain because the studies were small and few events were reported. No RCTs of topical antibiotics met the inclusion criteria. More research in this area, particularly evaluating longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^d54c794a]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients with a history of a penicillin allergy (with or without anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives): Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients with a history of a penicillin allergy and with or without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).
