## Question

What is the safety profile of Carbamazil as outlined in the TRIDENT study?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the safety profile of "Carbamazil" as outlined in the TRIDENT study. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "Carbamazil" is a typographical error for carbamazepine. Then, I should verify whether a study named "TRIDENT" exists in the provided references and, if not, what the closest high-quality carbamazepine safety data are. Next, I will extract and synthesize the core safety signals from the best available sources, including serious dermatologic reactions, hematologic and hepatic toxicity, hyponatremia, CNS effects, drug–drug interactions, and suicidality. Finally, I will contextualize risk by formulation, population, and monitoring recommendations, and I will flag any pharmacogenomic guidance that meaningfully modifies risk.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity. "Carbamazil" does not appear in the provided references, and the most plausible interpretation is that this refers to carbamazepine, which is repeatedly discussed across FDA labeling, randomized trials, and guidelines; I should proceed using carbamazepine as the target and explicitly note this assumption while I verify whether any similarly named study exists in the corpus.

> Wait, let me verify the existence of a "TRIDENT" study. I do not find a study by that name in the supplied references; the closest high-quality head-to-head safety data come from randomized trials comparing carbamazepine with lacosamide, zonisamide, and levetiracetam, and from authoritative reviews and FDA labeling, so I will anchor the safety profile to those sources and clearly state that I am substituting the best-available evidence for a study that cannot be located here.

> I will now examine serious dermatologic reactions, because these are the most consequential safety signal. Carbamazepine carries a boxed warning for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis; risk is about 1–6 per 10,000 new users in predominantly Caucasian populations and roughly 10-fold higher in some Asian countries, with strong associations to HLA-B✱1502 and additional risk from HLA-A✱31:01; guidelines recommend avoiding carbamazepine in HLA-B✱1502–positive individuals and exercising caution or enhanced monitoring if HLA-A✱31:01 is present, with immediate discontinuation at the first sign of rash [^116DUS36] [^113HN4jm] [^115S8ksL].

> Next, I should review hematologic toxicity. Carbamazepine is associated with rare but serious events including agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia; these are reflected in FDA labeling and warrant baseline and periodic complete blood count monitoring, particularly early in therapy or with dose changes, even though routine monitoring is not universally mandated in all settings [^112soX29] [^115VnyCK].

> Hold on, I should verify hepatic safety. Carbamazepine can cause acute liver failure and cholestatic injury; baseline and periodic liver function tests are prudent, with heightened vigilance in patients with liver disease or concomitant hepatotoxic drugs, and any significant transaminase elevation should prompt reassessment of therapy [^115VnyCK] [^11699bQe].

> I need to check hyponatremia risk, which is clinically important. Carbamazepine is linked to dose-related hyponatremia, more pronounced in older adults; guidelines recommend periodic sodium monitoring, especially in the elderly or when symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, or seizures occur, and dose adjustment or alternative therapy if significant hyponatremia develops [^116UKuch] [^11699bQe].

> Let me consider CNS and neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Common dose-related effects include dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, somnolence, and cognitive slowing; these often track with peak plasma concentrations, which is why controlled-release formulations are sometimes used to mitigate peaks and improve tolerability, though evidence is mixed and formulation-specific differences should be interpreted cautiously [^117HhdTc] [^113Dy3AZ].

> I should confirm suicidality risk. Pooled analyses of antiepileptic drugs show an approximately twofold increase in suicidal ideation or behavior with AEDs, including carbamazepine; clinicians should monitor mood and suicidality, especially early in treatment or after dose changes, and balance this against the risks of untreated epilepsy or bipolar disorder [^113TZum2] [^113sJutd].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions, which materially affect safety in polypharmacy. Carbamazepine is a potent CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inducer, reducing levels of many co-medications including direct oral anticoagulants, certain antiretrovirals, and other antiseizure drugs; conversely, enzyme inhibitors can raise carbamazepine levels and toxicity, so medication reconciliation and level monitoring are essential when adding or removing interacting agents [^111WkHQo] [^115Xb9sU] [^115CTx4c] [^1178sVc1].

> But wait, what about formulation-specific safety nuances. Controlled-release carbamazepine may reduce peak-related adverse effects and improve adherence for some patients, yet randomized data have not consistently demonstrated superiority over immediate-release for seizure control or global tolerability; nonetheless, switching to CR can be reasonable in patients with peak-related side effects on IR when seizure control is acceptable [^117HhdTc] [^113Dy3AZ].

> I should double-check special populations and pharmacogenomics. Elderly patients are more susceptible to hyponatremia, ataxia, and cognitive effects, and women of childbearing potential require counseling on teratogenic risk and contraceptive interactions; pre-treatment HLA-B✱1502 testing is recommended in patients of Asian ancestry to mitigate SJS/TEN risk, and HLA-A✱31:01 testing is increasingly considered in diverse populations to reduce hypersensitivity risk [^116UKuch] [^113HN4jm] [^115S8ksL].

> Let me synthesize a practical safety monitoring approach. Baseline assessment should include CBC, liver function, and sodium, with periodic reassessment based on clinical context and dose changes; patients should be educated to report rashes, mucosal lesions, fever, bruising, jaundice, or mood changes promptly; clinicians should anticipate and manage interactions, and consider alternative antiseizure medications when risk–benefit is unfavorable, particularly in patients with high-risk HLA alleles or complex polypharmacy [^116UKuch] [^11699bQe].

> In summary, I should confirm that the key safety profile elements for carbamazepine include: serious cutaneous reactions with HLA-linked risk, hematologic toxicity, hepatic injury, hyponatremia, CNS and cognitive effects, suicidality, and extensive drug–drug interactions; these risks are dose related and modifiable by formulation choice, population-specific pharmacogenomic screening, and vigilant monitoring, which together inform individualized risk–benefit decisions when carbamazepine is used [^113HN4jm] [^117HhdTc] [^113TZum2] [^111WkHQo].

I can't find a study named "TRIDENT" in the provided materials. Could you **confirm the exact study name** or provide more details (e.g. author, journal, year, or a link)? If you meant a different carbamazepine safety study, I can summarize its safety profile from the references I have here.

### Ancestry-based pharmacogenomics, adverse reactions and carbamazepine: is the FDA warning correct? [^11194o8o]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In an effort to prevent potentially fatal adverse reactions to carbamazepine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert in 2007 containing pharmacogenomic information, which is still in effect today. The alert states that carbamazepine-induced skin reactions are significantly more common in patients with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B✱1502 allele and that these people are almost exclusively from 'broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians'. This study reviews the medical evidence relied upon by the FDA and finds that the alert does not accurately reflect the medical evidence relied upon in 2007 or evidence that has been generated over the last 5 years since the label was created. The FDA drug labeling should be modified to reflect current medical evidence.

### Shared genetic risk factors across carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions [^115TBH63]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Carbamazepine (CBZ) is associated with serious, and sometimes fatal, cutaneous and liver adverse reactions. Genomewide profiling has shown that these predisposing factors largely reside in the HLA region (HLA‐B✱15:02 and HLA‐A✱31:01) consistent with the immune pathogenesis.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ What are the genetic predisposing factors in Northern and Southern European populations for CBZ‐induced hypersensitivity reactions affecting both the skin and liver?

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Genetic profiling confirmed that HLA‐A✱31:01 predisposes to serious cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) in both Northern and Southern European populations. HLA‐A✱31:01 also seems to predispose to CBZ‐induced liver injury. In addition, an uncommon variant in the ALK gene was associated with an increased risk of CBZ‐SCAR.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Our study adds to the overwhelming evidence of the role of HLA‐A✱31:01 in predisposing to a variety of CBZ hypersensitivity phenotypes and highlights the need to implement its pre‐prescription and preemptive use in clinical settings.

### Association between use of pharmacokinetic-interacting drugs and effectiveness and safety of direct acting oral anticoagulants: nested case-control study [^116gdBeS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ There is inconsistency in clinical data regarding bleeding events in direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)‐patients treated concomitantly with P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors. In addition, there is paucity of clinical data assessing interactions between DOACs and P‐gp/CYP3A4 inducers.
WHAT QUESTIONS DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ Is risk for bleeding in DOAC‐treated patients associated with concomitant use of P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors? Is lower effectiveness of DOACs associated with concomitant use of P‐gp/CYP3A4 inducers?
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOW‐LEDGE?

☑ Concomitant prescription of the DOACs dabigatran and rivaroxaban with the P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors verapamil or amiodarone is associated with increased risk for serious bleeding. Higher risk for stroke or systemic embolism in DOAC‐treated patients is associated with concurrent prescriptions of phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, or levetiracetam.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE

☑ Our results should alert the clinical community to these interactions, as alternative drugs can be used in these scenarios. The results should also serve to guide specific clinical studies that will include pharmacokinetic analyses of DOAC plasma levels in patients treated with the interacting drugs.

### Oxcarbazepine (trileptal) in the treatment of bipolar disorders: a review of efficacy and tolerability [^114epKj1]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Oxcarbazepine, although structurally similar to carbamazepine, is metabolised very differently. As a consequence, oxcarbazepine's pharmacokinetic profile is comparatively less complex, and a more predictable, linear relationship between oxcarbazepine and blood levels is apparent. Furthermore, hepatic enzyme induction is considerably less with oxcarbazepine. Unlike carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine does not appear to induce its own metabolism, nor is it highly protein bound. These pharmacokinetic and metabolic characteristics raise the expectation that potential for drug interactions and side effects with oxycarbazepine will be less than that reported for carbamazepine. This review compares the pharmacokinetic and metabolic profiles of the two drugs and the available efficacy and safety data of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

### Protocol for a prospective observational study of adverse drug reactions of anti-epileptic drugs in children in the UK [^1176cknZ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Study design

Study configuration and population

This protocol is for the first multicentre prospective cohort study of the safety of AEDs in children in the UK. The aim is to prospectively study 3000 children with epilepsy for ADRs. We aim to enrol a minimum of 500 children receiving valproic acid, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and levetiracetam, respectively, so as to compare the adverse effect profile of these drugs effectively. It is expected that this sample size will allow one to compare toxicity between the most frequently used AEDs. There will be no other intervention other than that obtained in routine practice in the respective hospitals. Information on ADRs will be extracted and recorded onto a case record form.

Paediatric patients receiving AED treatment will be recruited from hospital outpatient clinics over a period of 12 months. Enrolment shall start as soon as the research ethics committee (REC) and research & development (R&D) approvals are obtained. The study will close at 24 months, after the last recruited patients have been followed up for the requisite minimum of 12 months.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lacosamide monotherapy versus controlled-release carbamazepine in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy: a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^112buU9z]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Further options for monotherapy are needed to treat newly diagnosed epilepsy in adults. We assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lacosamide as a first-line monotherapy option for these patients.

Methods

In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial, patients from 185 epilepsy or general neurology centres in Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific region, aged 16 years or older and with newly diagnosed epilepsy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, via a computer-generated code, to receive lacosamide monotherapy or controlled-release carbamazepine (carbamazepine-CR) twice daily. Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were masked to treatment allocation. From starting doses of 100 mg/day lacosamide or 200 mg/day carbamazepine-CR, uptitration to the first target level of 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, took place over 2 weeks. After a 1-week stabilisation period, patients entered a 6-month assessment period. If a seizure occurred, the dose was titrated to the next target level (400 or 600 mg/day for lacosamide and 800 or 1200 mg/day for carbamazepine-CR) over 2 weeks with a 1-week stabilisation period, and the 6-month assessment period began again. Patients who completed 6 months of treatment and remained seizure-free entered a 6-month maintenance period on the same dose. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients remaining free from seizures for 6 consecutive months after stabilisation at the last assessed dose. The predefined non-inferiority criteria were -12% absolute and -20% relative difference between treatment groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01243177.

Findings

The trial was done between April 27, 2011, and Aug 7, 2015. 888 patients were randomly assigned treatment. 444 patients taking lacosamide and 442 taking carbamazepine-CR were included in the full analysis set (took at least one dose of study treatment), and 408 and 397, respectively, were included in the per-protocol set. In the full analysis set, 327 (74%) patients in the lacosamide group and 308 (70%) in the carbamazepine-CR group completed 6 months of treatment without seizures. The proportion of patients in the full analysis set predicted by the Kaplan-Meier method to be seizure-free at 6 months was 90% taking lacosamide and 91% taking carbamazepine-CR (absolute treatment-difference: -1.3%, 95% CI -5.5 to 2.8 relative treatment difference: -6.0%). Kaplan-Meier estimates results were similar in the per-protocol set (92% and 93%; -1.3%, -5.3 to 2.7; -5.7%). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 328 (74%) patients receiving lacosamide and 332 (75%) receiving carbamazepine-CR. 32 (7%) patients taking lacosamide and 43 (10%) taking carbamazepine-CR had serious treatment-emergent adverse events, and 47 (11%) and 69 (16%), respectively, had treatment-emergent adverse events that led to withdrawal.

Interpretation

Treatment with lacosamide met the predefined non-inferiority criteria when compared with carbamazepine-CR. Therefore, it might be useful as first-line monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

### Running out of breath: the diminishing role of gabapentinoids in epilepsy [^117CT3FX]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

In epilepsy, gabapentin never fulfilled its promise. Over time, studies and clinical experience found it to be less efficacious for seizure control than older and newer competitors. This was emphatically demonstrated in the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD) study of newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Patients were randomized to one of 5 ASMs; gabapentin performed the worst, primarily because of poor efficacy. The authors concluded that "We see no reasons to prefer gabapentin to the standard drug carbamazepine, except where there might be individual mitigating factors".

With its dreams of dominance lost, gabapentin found a smaller role as a utility player, with its pharmacokinetic and safety profile allowing it to carve out a few niches in epilepsy. Most prominently, it was considered as an alternative for geriatric patients, who have a higher burden of comorbidities and medication interactions. An RCT comparing gabapentin, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine in new-onset epilepsy patients 65 years and older found it to be about as efficacious as lamotrigine in preventing seizures, and less frequently stopped than carbamazepine. This established gabapentin for a time as at least a reasonable alternative to lamotrigine in elderly patients, although clinical experience suggested that its side effect profile was less favorable. It has also maintained use as a (usually distant) alternative adjunctive therapy in pharmacoresistant therapy and as a choice for patients with epilepsy (or possible epilepsy) who also suffer from conditions such as tremor or neuropathic pain that might also respond to gabapentin.

Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Efavirenz and carbamazepine — bidirectional pharmacokinetic interaction: In a randomized, open-label, crossover study, 18 healthy subjects received efavirenz 600 mg/day on days 1–14 and then efavirenz 600 mg/day with carbamazepine titrated up to 400 mg/day on days 15–35; in the 14 evaluable subjects, carbamazepine reduced efavirenz AUC by 36% (90% CI 32% to 40%). In a complementary arm, 18 healthy subjects received carbamazepine titrated to 400 mg/day on days 1–21 and then carbamazepine 400 mg/day with efavirenz 600 mg/day on days 22–35; in the 14 evaluable subjects, efavirenz reduced carbamazepine AUC by 27% (90% CI 20% to 33%).

### Assessment of the CYP3A4 induction potential by carbamazepine: insights from two clinical DDI studies and PBPK modeling [^111WkHQo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

In the past, rifampicin was well-established as strong index CYP3A inducer in clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. However, due to identified potentially genotoxic nitrosamine impurities, it should not any longer be used in healthy volunteer studies. Available clinical data suggest carbamazepine as an alternative to rifampicin as strong index CYP3A4 inducer in clinical DDI studies. Further, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a tool with increasing importance to support the DDI risk assessment of drugs during drug development. CYP3A4 induction properties and the safety profile of carbamazepine were investigated in two open-label, fixed sequence, crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers using midazolam as a sensitive index CYP3A4 substrate. Carbamazepine was up-titrated from 100mg twice daily (b.i.d.) to 200mg b.i.d., and to a final dose of 300mg b.i.d. for 10 consecutive days. Mean area under plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) of midazolam consistently decreased by 71.8% (ratio: 0.282, 90% confidence interval (CI): 0.235–0.340) and 67.7% (ratio: 0.323, 90% CI: 0.256–0.407) in study 1 and study 2, respectively. The effect was adequately described by an internally developed PBPK model for carbamazepine which has been made freely available to the scientific community. Further, carbamazepine was safe and well-tolerated in the investigated dosing regimen in healthy participants. The results demonstrated that the presented design is appropriate for the use of carbamazepine as alternative inducer to rifampicin in DDI studies acknowledging its CYP3A4 inductive potency and safety profile.

Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

SANAD — Arm A (Class III randomized unblinded; children and adults, 89% focal) — primary outcomes were time to treatment failure and time to 12-month remission; lamotrigine outperformed carbamazepine, gabapentin, and topiramate for treatment failure and had a nonsignificant advantage over oxcarbazepine, whereas carbamazepine outperformed gabapentin for 12-month remission and had a nonsignificant advantage over lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate; lamotrigine was inferior to carbamazepine for 12-month remission at 2 and 4 years, and adverse-event intolerability leading to discontinuation was less frequent with gabapentin and lamotrigine than with oxcarbazepine and topiramate, with rash more frequent with carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, weight gain/dizziness/ataxia more with gabapentin, and psychiatric symptoms/weight loss/paresthesia more with topiramate.

### Immediate-release versus controlled-release carbamazepine in the treatment of epilepsy [^117HhdTc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a commonly used drug for epilepsy that is associated with troublesome adverse events including dizziness, double vision, drowsiness, poor co-ordination and unsteadiness. These adverse events often occur during peaks in drug plasma concentration. These adverse events may limit the daily dose of CBZ that can be tolerated and reduce the chances of seizure control in patients who require high doses. A controlled-release formulation of CBZ delivers the same dose over a longer period of time when compared to a standard immediate-release formulation, thereby reducing post-dose peaks in CBZ plasma concentration and potentially reducing adverse events. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 12, 2014.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of immediate-release CBZ (IR CBZ) versus controlled-release CBZ (CR CBZ) in patients diagnosed with epilepsy. The following review questions were investigated.(1) For newly diagnosed patients commencing CBZ, how do IR and CR formulations compare for efficacy and tolerability?(2) For patients on established treatment with IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events, what is the effect on seizure control and the tolerability of a switch to a CR formulation versus remaining on the IR formulation?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, and MEDLINE (Ovid) from inception to 30 August 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing IR CBZ to CR CBZ in patients commencing monotherapy and patients presently treated with IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. Primary outcome measures included measures of seizure frequency, incidence of adverse events, proportion of patients with treatment failure and quality of life measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted the data and recorded relevant information on a standardised data extraction form. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The heterogeneity of the included trials with respect to the reporting of outcomes resulted in only a narrative, descriptive analysis being possible for both the categorical and time-to-event data.

Main Results

Ten trials (296 participants) fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this review. Only one study had a low risk of bias. Two studies had a high risk of bias and the rest of the studies were rated as unclear risk of bias. One trial included patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy and nine included patients on treatment with IR CBZ. Eight trials reported heterogeneous measures of seizure frequency with conflicting results. A statistically significant difference was observed in only one trial, with patients prescribed CR CBZ experiencing fewer seizures than patients prescribed IR CBZ. Nine trials reported measures of adverse events. There was a trend in favour of CR CBZ with four trials reporting a statistically significant reduction in adverse events compared to IR CBZ. A further two trials reported fewer adverse events with CR CBZ but the reduction was not statistically significant. One trial found no difference in adverse events, and another trial reported more adverse events in the CR CBZ group than the IR CBZ group, although the increase was not statistically significant.

Authors' Conclusions

For this update no new eligible studies were identified and the conclusions drawn from the initial review remain unchanged. At present, data from trials do not confirm or refute an advantage for CR CBZ over IR CBZ for seizure frequency or adverse events in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. For trials involving epilepsy patients already prescribed IR CBZ, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the superiority of CR CBZ with respect to seizure frequency. There is a trend for CR CBZ to be associated with fewer adverse events when compared to IR CBZ. A change to CR CBZ may therefore be a worthwhile strategy in patients with acceptable seizure control on IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. The included trials were of small size and of poor methodological quality limiting the validity of this conclusion. Randomised controlled trials comparing CR CBZ to IR CBZ and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of CBZ preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

### Efficacy and tolerability of zonisamide versus controlled-release carbamazepine for newly diagnosed partial epilepsy: a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^1129e3kC]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Additional options are needed for monotherapy treatment of adults newly diagnosed with partial epilepsy. This trial compares the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily zonisamide with twice-daily controlled-release carbamazepine monotherapy for such patients.

Methods

In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial, adults from 120 centres in Asia, Australia, and Europe, aged 18–75 years and newly diagnosed with partial epilepsy, were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio, done with a computer-generated pseudorandom code) to receive zonisamide or carbamazepine. Patients, investigators, and sponsor personnel giving drugs, analysing outcomes, and interpreting data were masked to treatment allocation. After treatment initiation (zonisamide 100 mg/day vs carbamazepine 200 mg/day [given in two doses]) and up-titration (to 300 mg/day vs 600 mg/day), patients entered a 26–78 weeks flexible-dosing period (200–500 mg/day vs 400–1200 mg/day, according to response and tolerance). Once patients were seizure-free for 26 weeks they entered a 26-week maintenance phase. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved seizure freedom for 26 weeks or more in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00477295.

Findings

583 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (282 zonisamide, 301 carbamazepine), of whom 456 were analysed for the primary endpoint (per-protocol population: 223 zonisamide, 233 carbamazepine). 177 of 223 (79.4%) patients in the zonisamide group and 195 of 233 (83.7%) patients in the carbamazepine group were seizure-free for 26 weeks or more (adjusted absolute treatment difference -4.5%, 95% CI -12.2 to 3.1). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 170 (60%) in the zonisamide group versus 185 (62%) in the carbamazepine group, of which 15 (5%) versus 17 (6%) were serious and 31 (11%) versus 35 (12%) led to withdrawal.

Interpretation

Zonisamide was non-inferior to controlled-release carbamazepine — according to International League Against Epilepsy guidelines — and could be useful as an initial monotherapy for patients newly diagnosed with partial epilepsy.

### Acute antimanic efficacy and safety of oxcarbazepine in an open trial with an on-off-on design [^111ErDPK]. Bipolar Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Carbamazepine has shown reasonable antimanic properties, but its use has been limited because of enzyme-inducing effects. The keto-derivative oxcarbazepine (OXC) is very similar to carbamazepine, however, the metabolic pathway is different. OXC is not metabolized to the 10, 11-epoxide, which seems to be responsible for several undesirable side-effects of carbamazepine and furthermore OXC has less enzyme-inducing properties.

Methods

In this non-random open label study, patients were treated with OXC for 14 days, crossed over to no OXC for 7 days, and then crossed back over to OXC for the remaining 14 days. OXC was titrated to a final dose in a range of 900–2100 mg due to individual response. Treatment success was defined as a reduction of the original Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of more than 50% at the end of study period.

Results

Four of the 12 included patients (33%) met defined response criteria at the end of study period. Fifty percentage of the patients had to be prematurely excluded from the trial. The mean YMRS scores of the on-periods were obviously different from the off-period. Forty-two percentage of the patients experienced side-effects leading to premature discontinuation in two of 12 patients.

Conclusion

Antimanic activity of OXC was demonstrated in this pilot study only for patients with mild or moderate manic symptoms. Further studies are encouraged to clarify OXC's role as mood-stabilizer and assess whether it has a profile similar to that of carbamazepine.

### Immediate-release versus controlled-release carbamazepine in the treatment of epilepsy [^113Dy3AZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is defined as the tendency to spontaneous, excessive neuronal discharge manifesting as seizures. It is a common disorder with an incidence of 50 per 100,000 per year and a prevalence of 0.5% to 1% (Hauser 1993) in the developed world. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a widely used antiepileptic drug that is associated with a number of troublesome adverse events including dizziness, double vision and unsteadiness. These often occur during peaks in plasma concentration. The occurrence of such adverse events may limit the daily dose that can be tolerated and reduce the chances of seizure control for patients requiring higher doses (Vojvodic 2002). A controlled-release formulation of carbamazepine delivers the same dose over a longer period of time when compared to a standard formulation, thereby reducing post-dose peaks and potentially reducing adverse events associated with peak plasma levels.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of immediate-release CBZ (IR CBZ) versus controlled-release CBZ (CR CBZ) in patients diagnosed with epilepsy. The following hypotheses were tested.(1) For newly diagnosed patients commencing CBZ, how do immediate-release and controlled-release formulations compare for efficacy and tolerability?(2) For patients on established treatment with immediate-release CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events, what is the effect on seizure control and tolerability of a switch to a controlled-release formulation versus remaining on the immediate-release formulation?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (5 September 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2013) in The Cochrane Library and MEDLINE (1946 to 5 September 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing IR CBZ to CR CBZ in patients commencing monotherapy and patients presently treated with IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. Primary outcome measures include seizure frequency, incidence of adverse events, proportion with treatment failure and quality of life measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

The methodological quality of each study was assessed with respect to study design, type of control, method and the concealment of allocation, blinding and completeness of follow up, and the presence of blinding for assessment of non-fatal outcomes. We did not make use of an overall quality score. Two review authors (GP, MS) independently extracted the data and recorded relevant information on a standardised data extraction form. Results were assessed for inclusion. The heterogeneity of the included trials resulted in only a narrative, descriptive analysis being possible for both the categorical and time-to-event data.

Main Results

Ten trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this review. One trial included patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy and nine included patients on treatment with IR CBZ. Eight trials reported heterogeneous measures of seizure frequency with conflicting results. A statistically significant difference was observed in only one trial, with patients prescribed CR CBZ experiencing fewer seizures than patients prescribed IR CBZ. Nine trials reported measures of adverse events. There was a trend in favour of CR CBZ with four trials reporting a statistically significant reduction in adverse events compared to IR CBZ. A further two trials reported fewer adverse events with CR CBZ but the reduction was not statistically significant. One trial found no difference, with a further trial reporting increased adverse events in the CR CBZ group although not statistically significant.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, data from trials do not confirm or refute an advantage for CR CBZ over IR CBZ for seizure frequency or adverse events in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. For trials involving epilepsy patients already prescribed IR CBZ, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the superiority of CR CBZ with respect to seizure frequency. There is a trend for CR CBZ to be associated with fewer adverse events when compared to IR CBZ. A change to CR CBZ may therefore be a worthwhile strategy in patients with acceptable seizure control on IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. The included trials were of small size, poor methodological quality and possessed a high risk of bias, limiting the validity of this conclusion. Randomised controlled trials comparing CR CBZ to IR CBZ and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of CBZ preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

8.1 Medical evaluation and laboratory investigations

A complete medical history including assessment of BMI and baseline laboratory investigations (Table 23) should be performed prior to initiating pharmacological treatment for BD or, in the case of an acute clinical situation, as soon as the patient is cooperative. For more detail, readers are referred to comprehensive guidelines for safety monitoring in BD. 652 In women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be ruled out, and they should be counselled about the possibility of lamotrigine and carbamazepine affecting the efficacy of oral contraceptives before initiating pharmacotherapy.

Table 23
Baseline laboratory investigations in patients with bipolar disorder

For those on maintenance therapy with lithium, thyroid and renal function as well as plasma calcium 799 should be assessed at 6 months and at least annually thereafter or as clinically indicated. Menstrual history (to assess for polycystic ovary syndrome), haematology profile, and liver function tests should be obtained at 3‐6 month intervals during the first year, and yearly thereafter and as clinically indicated, in patients on maintenance treatment with divalproex. Patients initiated on lamotrigine or carbamazepine should be routinely educated about the risks of skin rashes and the potential for Stevens‐Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). They should be advised to contact the treating physician if they observe any type of skin rashes or mucosal ulcers as they require urgent medical evaluation to determine the nature of rashes/ulcers and implementation of most appropriate treatment options which might include discontinuation of these medications and instituting other therapeutic strategies to treat serious rashes and prevent destabilization of BD. Further, prior to commencing carbamazepine, patients with ancestry in genetically at‐risk populations such as Han Chinese and other Asian patients should have genotyping performed to ensure that they do not have the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)‐B✱1502 allele, which confers a high risk for SJS/TEN with carbamazepine. 800 In addition, those on carbamazepine therapy should have serum sodium levels measured at least annually and as clinically indicated given the risk of hyponatraemia with this compound. Patients on atypical antipsychotics should have their weight monitored monthly in the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipid profile should be assessed at 3 and 6 months, and yearly thereafter. Children under 10 years of age, seniors, medically ill patients, and patients on combination treatments should receive more frequent monitoring. Re‐emergence of clinical symptoms, as well as signs of haematological, hepatic, cardiovascular, and neurological dysfunction, should also signal the need for additional investigations.

Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Monotherapy in adults with new-onset focal epilepsy or unclassified tonic-clonic seizures — since the 2004 publications, 2 Class I, 5 Class II, and 2 Class III studies have been published. In a Class II double-blind randomized study in patients aged ≥ 60 years, gabapentin (GBP) (≤ 1,500 mg/d), lamotrigine (LTG) (≤ 150 mg/d), and immediate-release carbamazepine (CBZ-IR) (≤ 600 mg/d) were compared with the primary outcome of retention in the trial for 12 months; drug discontinuation was less frequent with LTG than with GBP or CBZ-IR because of better LTG tolerability, with higher weight gain and water retention with GBP than with LTG or CBZ, more rash with CBZ than with LTG, and more hyponatremia with CBZ than with GBP, while the 3 AEDs did not differ with respect to neurologic adverse events. The differences between LTG and CBZ-IR were not reproduced in a Class I study comparing LTG (100–500 mg/d) with controlled-release carbamazepine (CBZ-CR) (400–2,000 mg/d).

### Carbamazepine er [^115sxZfA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

Substantial evidence of carbamazepine's effectiveness for use in the management of children with epilepsy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE for specific seizure types) is derived from clinical investigations performed in adults and from studies in several in vitro systems which support the conclusion that (1) the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation are essentially identical in adults and children, and (2) the mechanism of action of carbamazepine in treating seizures is essentially identical in adults and children.

Taken as a whole, this information supports a conclusion that the generally accepted therapeutic range of total carbamazepine in plasma (i.e., 4 to 12 mcg/mL) is the same in children and adults.

The evidence assembled was primarily obtained from short-term use of carbamazepine. The safety of carbamazepine in children has been systematically studied up to 6 months. No longer-term data from clinical trials is available.

### Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) [^116sGL5J]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3

	Cross Hypersensitivity Reaction to Carbamazepine

Approximately 25% to 30% of patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine will experience hypersensitivity reactions with TRILEPTAL. For this reason, patients should be specifically questioned about any prior experience with carbamazepine, and patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine should ordinarily be treated with TRILEPTAL only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, TRILEPTAL should be discontinued immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.8)].

5.4

	Serious Dermatological Reactions

Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in both children and adults in association with TRILEPTAL use. Such serious skin reactions may be life threatening, and some patients have required hospitalization with very rare reports of fatal outcome. The median time of onset for reported cases was 19 days after treatment initiation. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with TRILEPTAL has also been reported.

The reporting rate of TEN and SJS associated with TRILEPTAL use, which is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting, exceeds the background incidence rate estimates by a factor of 3- to 10-fold. Estimates of the background incidence rate for these serious skin reactions in the general population range between 0.5 to 6 cases per million-person years. Therefore, if a patient develops a skin reaction while taking TRILEPTAL, consideration should be given to discontinuing TRILEPTAL use and prescribing another antiepileptic medication.

Association With HLA-B✱1502

Patients carrying the HLA-B✱1502 allele may be at increased risk for SJS/TEN with TRILEPTAL treatment. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele B✱1502 increases the risk for developing SJS/TEN in patients treated with
	carbamazepine. The chemical structure of TRILEPTAL is similar to that of carbamazepine. Available clinical evidence, and data from nonclinical studies showing a direct interaction between TRILEPTAL and HLA-B✱1502 protein, suggest that the HLA-B✱1502 allele may also increase the risk for SJS/TEN with TRILEPTAL.

### Intravenous carbamazepine for adults with seizures [^112zTAF9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, dosage and administration, potential drug-drug interactions, and place in therapy of the intravenous (IV) formulation of carbamazepine (Carnexiv) for the treatment of seizures in adult patients.

Data Sources

A comprehensive PubMed and EBSCOhost search (1945 to August 2017) was performed utilizing the keywords carbamazepine, Carnexiv, carbamazepine intravenous, IV carbamazepine, seizures, epilepsy, and seizure disorder. Additional data were obtained from literature review citations, manufacturer's product labeling, and Lundbeck website as well as Clinicaltrials.gov and governmental sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language trials evaluating IV carbamazepine were analyzed for this review.

Data Synthesis

IV carbamazepine is FDA approved as temporary replacement therapy for treatment of adult seizures. Based on a phase I trial and pooled data from 2 open-label bioavailability studies comparing oral with IV dosing, there was no noted indication of loss of seizure control in patients switched to short-term replacement antiepileptic drug therapy with IV carbamazepine. The recommended dose of IV carbamazepine is 70% of the patient's oral dose, given every 6 hours via 30-minute infusions. The adverse effect profile of IV carbamazepine is similar to that of the oral formulation, with the exception of added infusion-site reactions.

Conclusion

IV carbamazepine is a reasonable option for adults with generalized tonic-clonic or focal seizures, previously stabilized on oral carbamazepine, who are unable to tolerate oral medications for up to 7 days. Unknown acquisition cost and lack of availability in the United States limit its use currently.

Vigabatrin (VGB) vs immediate-release carbamazepine (CBZ-IR) — one Class I and one Class III study — Class I primary outcome was time to withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or AEs; secondary outcomes included time to 6-month seizure remission, time to first seizure after reaching the initial target dose (≤ 600 mg/d of CBZ-IR and ≤ 2 g/d of VGB), and AE development. In Class I, time to 6-month remission was significantly shorter and time to first seizure significantly longer for CBZ-IR than for VGB; VGB was more frequently associated with psychiatric symptoms and weight gain, whereas rash occurred more frequently with CBZ-IR. In Class III, significantly more patients were seizure free on CBZ-IR, serious rash occurred with CBZ-IR, and VGB was associated with significantly higher frequencies of scintillating visual disturbances and myoclonus.

### AEDs and cognition: one small fish in a very large pond? [^113nj19N]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

There exist over 30 years of clinical and controlled trial studies focused at sorting out AED efficacies and adverse effects. These trials have contributed to changes in "real world" practice by encouraging slower titration schedules, avoidance of potential iatrogenic drug interactions, favoring new line over old line medications when possible, and by monitoring AED adverse event profiles which in turn positively impacts patient quality of life. With these standards of carein mind, it may be that patients such as those admitted to an EMU setting had reduced AED burden that could affect cognitive function. For example, it was noteworthy that from the 273 instances of AED medications (ie, 25% monotherapy, 45% polytherapy, 30% no AED) in the study, 75% were taking "clean" medications. Thus, positively highlighting that treating physicians sending their patients to the EMU were attending to key treatment goals of maximizing AED efficacy and minimizing adverse event potential.

The authors listed carbamazepine in their "clean" medication group but had phenytoin and valproate in the "dirty" group. However, prior controlled studies have found similar cognitive profiles between these medications. That review study also highlighted that carbamazepine had a poorer cognitive profile compared to levetiracetam in 2 controlled studies. This is relevant since the present study listed levetiracetam as the most commonly administered AED followed by valproate and carbamazepine. Operto et alrecently described cognitive effects (ie, changes in executive function) of various AED treatments in new-onset/drug naive pediatric epilepsy patients over a 9-month period. Results found the only AED examined with positive cognitive impact was levetiracetam, while carbamazepine as the only AED showing negative test performance.

Gabapentin (GBP), lamotrigine (LTG), and immediate-release carbamazepine (CBZ-IR) — Class II double-blind randomized trial in adults aged ≥ 60 years — were compared for efficacy and tolerability with GBP ≤ 1,500 mg/d, LTG ≤ 150 mg/d, and CBZ-IR ≤ 600 mg/d; the primary outcome was 12-month retention based on seizure recurrence or adverse events (AEs). Drug discontinuation was less frequent with LTG than with GBP or CBZ-IR due to better tolerability. AEs differed by drug: weight gain and water retention were higher with GBP than with LTG or CBZ, rash and hyponatremia were more frequent with CBZ (vs LTG and vs GBP, respectively), and neurologic AEs did not differ among the 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

### Antiseizure medications consumption in 73 countries and regions from 2012 to 2022: a longitudinal trend study [^112QDFgz]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the overall rise in ASM consumption, we observed a decline in phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, which may be attributable to their less favourable safety profiles, with various drug-specific concerns. The receding of these older agents may benefit the rise of newer agents such as levetiracetam and lamotrigine, which have demonstrated a safer profile and are easier to use in comparison. A marked increase of levetiracetam consumption in upper-middle and lower-middle countries suggests broadening access to first-line newer therapies outside of high-income countries. The expiry of its patent shortly before the start of the study period also catalysed the entry of low-cost generics, further accelerating use. With the inclusion of lamotrigine and levetiracetam into the WHO List of Essential Medicines in 2017 and 2023 respectively, their increasing consumption trend may persist. Encouragingly, a growing number of countries are now incorporating these comparatively safer ASMs into their own national essential medicines lists. Nevertheless, sustained progress will depend on complementary measures, including timely revision of national standard treatment guidelines and essential medicines lists, to ensure that national policies consistently align with the latest evidence and guidance around essential antiseizure medicines. Meanwhile, newly marketed third generation medications such as lacosamide, perampanel, or brivaracetam are posting very large relative increases, although their absolute consumption rates remain modest, and this growth is concentrated in high-income countries that can more readily afford costlier innovations. Given their recent introduction, future studies evaluating their effectiveness and safety in real-world clinical practice are needed.

### Comparison of levetiracetam and controlled-release carbamazepine in newly diagnosed epilepsy [^116TfySA]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We report the results of a prospective study of the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam, a new antiepileptic drug with a unique mechanism of action, in comparison with controlled-release carbamazepine as first treatment in newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Methods

Adults with ≥ 2 partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the previous year were randomly assigned to levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily, n = 288) or controlled-release carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily, n = 291) in a multicenter, double-blind, noninferiority, parallel-group trial. If a seizure occurred within 26 weeks of stabilization, dosage was increased incrementally to a maximum of levetiracetam 1,500 mg twice daily or carbamazepine 600 mg twice daily. Patients achieving the primary endpoint (6-month seizure freedom) continued on treatment for a further 6-month maintenance period.

Results

At per-protocol analysis, 73.0% (56.6%) of patients randomized to levetiracetam and 72.8% (58.5%) receiving controlled-release carbamazepine were seizure free at the last evaluated dose (adjusted absolute difference 0.2%, 95% CI -7.8% to 8.2%) for ≥ 6 months (1 year). Of all patients achieving 6-month (1-year) remission, 80.1% (86.0%) in the levetiracetam group and 85.4% (89.3%) in the carbamazepine group did so at the lowest dose level. Withdrawal rates for adverse events were 14.4% with levetiracetam and 19.2% with carbamazepine.

Conclusions

Levetiracetam and controlled-release carbamazepine produced equivalent seizure freedom rates in newly diagnosed epilepsy at optimal dosing in a setting mimicking clinical practice. This trial has confirmed in a randomized, double-blind setting previously uncontrolled observations that most people with epilepsy will respond to their first-ever antiepileptic drug at low dosage.

Isoniazid (INH) interaction profile: INH is a relatively potent inhibitor of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes and increases concentrations of some drugs to the point of toxicity, including the anticonvulsants phenytoin and carbamazepine. INH also increases concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by oxidation (such as diazepam and triazolam) but not those metabolized by conjugation (such as oxazepam). When combined with RIF, the inductive effect of RIF outweighs the inhibitory effect of INH so that the overall effect is a decrease in the concentrations of drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine.

Carbamazepine (HLA-B, HLA-A) — genotype-based safety and use guidance: US Food and Drug Administration approved labeling recommends to avoid using carbamazepine on the basis of the HLA-B✱15:02 and HLA-A✱31:01 genotypes, where data support or indicate a potential effect on drug safety. HLA-B✱15:02 genotype increases risk for Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and the HLA-A✱31:01 genotype increases risk for SJS, TEN, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and maculopapular exanthema. Recommendations based on the 2017 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline state that if HLA-B✱15:02 and/or HLA-A✱31:01 genotypes are present, do not use carbamazepine for naive patients or cautiously consider using it if previously used consistently for > 3 months, and if alternative agents are not available and the patient is positive for HLA-A✱31:01, consider using carbamazepine with increased clinical monitoring.

### Conversion to eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy: a pooled analysis of 2 phase III studies [^1128Woga]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The appropriate use of a historical control comparator is based on the concept that there are no substantive differences in population characteristics between the current studies and the historical control, or that any population differences do not affect exit rates. It is of note that the CIs for the ESL 1,200 mg exit rate did not overlap between studies 045 and 046, suggesting that the study population influenced exit rates in these trials. However, exit rates for both dose groups in these studies were lower than the rate for the historical control.

Patients were diagnosed using the 1981 version of the International League Against Epilepsy classification. Although more recent versions exist, the 1981 classification was used to ensure consistency with other AED trials. As the 1981 guidelines are still used frequently in clinical practice, we are confident that the population remains relevant to today's patients.

The safety profiles of ESL 1,600 mg and 1,200 mg were similar and there were no incidences of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy during ESL therapy. No new safety findings of concern were identified in this pooled analysis.

Exit rates for patients taking ESL (1,600 mg and 1,200 mg once daily) monotherapy were lower than the historical control threshold, irrespective of baseline AED use and region, and ESL was well tolerated. The potential effects of clinical and demographic factors on patient outcomes should be taken into consideration when designing future monotherapy studies. Further evaluation of the effect of baseline AED use on treatment response is also needed, given the difference in outcomes between patients who were taking baseline phenytoin and carbamazepine in this analysis.

### Adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs [^116iGJy7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

More than 150 years after bromide was introduced as the first antiepileptic drug, adverse effects remain a leading cause of treatment failure and a major determinant of impaired health-related quality of life in people with epilepsy. Adverse effects can develop acutely or many years after starting treatment and can affect any organ or structure. In the past two decades, many efforts have been made to reduce the burden of antiepileptic drug toxicity. Several methods to screen and quantify adverse effects have been developed. Patient profiles associated with increased risk of specific adverse effects have been uncovered through advances in the areas of epidemiology and pharmacogenomics. Several new-generation antiepileptic drugs with improved tolerability profiles and reduced potential for drug interaction have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium. Overall, these advances have expanded the opportunities to tailor treatment with antiepileptic drugs, to enhance effectiveness and minimise the risk of toxic effects.

### Neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal exposure to psychotropic medications [^116u3bpt]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Until now, studies on the reproductive safety of psychotropics have typically assessed the risk of congenital malformations and perinatal complications associated with in utero exposure to such medications. However, little is known of their inherent potential neurobehavioral teratogenicity. The objective is to analyze available data from studies investigating developmental outcome of children exposed prenatally to psychotropics. A computerized Medline/PubMed/TOXNET/ENBASE search (1960–2010) was conducted using the following keywords: pregnancy, child/infant development/neurodevelopment, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics. A separate search was also run to complete the safety profile of single specific medications. Resultant articles were cross-referenced for other relevant articles not identified in the initial search. A noncomputerized review of pertinent journals and textbooks was also performed. All studies published in English and reporting primary data on the developmental outcome of infants exposed in utero to psychotropics and born without malformations were collected. As regards antiepileptic drugs, only studies that provided data on specific medications approved for psychiatric practice use (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproate) were considered. Data were extracted from 41 articles (38 identified electronically and 3 nonelectronically), which met the inclusion criteria. Despite reviewed studies showing relevant methodological limitations, concordant, albeit preliminary, information seems to exclude that prenatal exposure to both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants may interfere with the infants' psychological and cognitive development. Conversely, information on valproate strongly discourages its use in pregnant women. Moreover, although data on carbamazepine remain controversial, information on whole classes of drugs and single medications is either absent (second-generation antipsychotics) or too limited (first-generation antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, lithium, and lamotrigine) to inform the decision-making process. For all classes of psychotropics, new and/or further studies are warranted to answer definitively the urgent question about the impact of prenatal exposure to such medications on infant development.

### Carbamazepine versus phenytoin monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^1148b7eA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 2, 2002 and its subsequent updates in 2010 and 2015. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which recurrent, unprovoked seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenytoin are commonly-used broad spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first-line treatment for partial onset seizures in the USA and Europe. Phenytoin is no longer considered a first-line treatment due to concerns over adverse events associated with its use, but the drug is still commonly used in low- to middle-income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenytoin in individual trials, although the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide. Differences in efficacy may therefore be shown by synthesising the data of the individual trials.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, six- and 12-month remission, and first seizure with carbamazepine compared to phenytoin, used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures), or generalised tonic-clonic seizures, with or without other generalised seizure types.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (1st November 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 1st November 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 1 November 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (1 November 2016), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 1st November 2016). Previously we also searched SCOPUS (1823 to 16th September 2014) as an alternative to Embase, but this is no longer necessary, because randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in Embase are now included in CENTRAL. We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures, comparing carbamazepine monotherapy versus phenytoin monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This is an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, and our secondary outcomes were time to six-month remission, time to 12-month remission, and time to first seizure post-randomisation. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 595 participants out of 1192 eligible individuals, from four out of 12 trials (i.e. 50% of the potential data). For remission outcomes, HR greater than 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR greater than 1 indicates an advantage for carbamazepine. The methodological quality of the four studies providing IPD was generally good and we rated it at low risk of bias overall in the analyses. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were time to withdrawal of allocated treatment: 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.39; three trials, 546 participants); time to 12-month remission: 1.01 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; three trials, 551 participants); time to six-month remission: 1.11 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.37; three trials, 551 participants); and time to first seizure: 0.85 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; four trials, 582 participants). The results suggest no overall statistically significant difference between the drugs for these outcomes. There is some evidence of an advantage for phenytoin for individuals with generalised onset seizures for our primary outcome (time to withdrawal of allocated treatment): pooled HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.96; two trials, 118 participants); and a statistical interaction between treatment effect and epilepsy type (partial versus generalised) for this outcome (P = 0.02). However, misclassification of seizure type for up to 48 individuals (32% of those with generalised epilepsy) may have confounded the results of this review. Despite concerns over side effects leading to the withdrawal of phenytoin as a first-line treatment in the USA and Europe, we found no evidence that phenytoin is more likely to be associated with serious side effects than carbamazepine; 26 individuals withdrew from 290 randomised (9%) to carbamazepine due to adverse effects, compared to 12 out of 299 (4%) randomised to phenytoin from four studies conducted in the USA and Europe (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.80, P = 0.014). We rated the quality of the evidence as low to moderate according to GRADE criteria, due to imprecision and potential misclassification of seizure type.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not found evidence for a statistically significant difference between carbamazepine and phenytoin for the efficacy outcomes examined in this review, but CIs are wide and we cannot exclude the possibility of important differences. There is no evidence in this review that phenytoin is more strongly associated with serious adverse events than carbamazepine. There is some evidence that people with generalised seizures may be less likely to withdraw early from phenytoin than from carbamazepine, but misclassification of seizure type may have impacted upon our results. We recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review, and do not recommend that our results alone should be used in choosing between carbamazepine and phenytoin. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible, with considerations of allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

Aromatic amine anticonvulsant hypersensitivity — pharmacogenetic associations and screening are highlighted as follows. The strongest associations involve HLA serotype B75 alleles (notably HLA-B✱15:02) and carbamazepine SJS/TEN in Southeast Asian populations. Since 2007, the FDA has recommended HLA-B✱15:02 screening for patients of known or suspected Southeast Asian ancestry before initiating carbamazepine. Evidence is mixed regarding impact: a Taiwan 1-arm study supported reduced carbamazepine SJS/TEN with HLA-B✱15:02 screening, whereas a Hong Kong program did not reduce overall SJS/TEN and was associated with displacement to phenytoin and increased phenytoin SJS/TEN. HLA risk alleles have had a low (< 5%) positive predictive value for IM-ADRs with antiepileptic drugs.

### Topiramate versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^112hx32G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy, the majority of which may be able to achieve remission with a single antiepileptic drug (AED). The correct choice of first-line antiepileptic therapy for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AED for an individual is based on the highest-quality evidence available regarding the potential benefits and harms of various treatments. It is also important to compare the efficacy and tolerability of AEDs appropriate to given seizure types. Topiramate and carbamazepine are commonly used AEDs. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of results of outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability, and may help inform a choice between the two drugs.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topiramate monotherapy versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy in people with partial-onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (14 April 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (14 April 2016) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 14 April 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in children or adults with partial-onset seizures or generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types with a comparison of monotherapy with either topiramate or carbamazepine.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to first seizure post randomisation', 'time to 6-month remission, 'time to 12-month remission' and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and used the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HRs and 95% CIs.

Main Results

IPD were available for 1151 of 1239 eligible individuals from two of three eligible studies (93% of the potential data). A small proportion of individuals recruited into these trials had 'unclassified seizures;' for analysis purposes, these individuals are grouped with those with generalised onset seizures. For remission outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine, and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for topiramate. The main overall results, given as pooled HR adjusted for seizure type (95% CI) were: for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment 1.16 (0.98 to 1.38); time to first seizure 1.11 (0.96 to 1.29); and time to 6-month remission 0.88 (0.76 to 1.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the drugs. A statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine was shown for time to 12-month remission: 0.84 (0.71 to 1.00). The results of this review are applicable mainly to individuals with partial-onset seizures; 85% of included individuals experienced seizures of this type at baseline. For individuals with partial-onset seizures, a statistically significant advantage for carbamazepine was shown for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.45) and time to 12-month remission (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00). No statistically significant differences were apparent between the drugs for other outcomes and for the limited number of individuals with generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types or unclassified seizures. The most commonly reported adverse events with both drugs were drowsiness or fatigue, 'pins and needles' (tingling sensation), headache, gastrointestinal disturbance and anxiety or depression The rate of adverse events was similar across the two drugs. We judged the methodological quality of the included trials generally to be good; however, there was some evidence that the open-label design of the larger of the two trials may have influenced the withdrawal rate from the trial. Hence, we judged the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment withdrawal to be moderate for individuals with partial-onset seizures and low for individuals with generalised-onset seizures. For efficacy outcomes (first seizure, remission), we judged the evidence from this review to be high for individuals with partial-onset seizures and moderate for individuals with generalised-onset or unclassified seizures.

Authors' Conclusions

For individuals with partial-onset seizures, there is evidence that carbamazepine is less likely to be withdrawn and that 12-month remission will be achieved earlier than with topiramate. No differences were found between the drugs in terms of the outcomes measured in the review for individuals with generalised tonic-clonic seizures with or without other seizure types or unclassified epilepsy; however, we encourage caution in the interpretation of these results due to the small numbers of participants with these seizure types. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible and take into consideration masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Should you run a dedicated TQT study? Sponsor and regulatory considerations on substitution pathways to assess QT liability [^11279fzc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac safety regulatory guidance for drug development has undergone several monumental shifts over the past decade as technological advancements, analysis models and study best practices have transformed this landscape. Once, clinical proarrhythmic risk assessment of a new chemical entity (NCE) was nearly exclusively evaluated in a dedicated thorough QT (TQT) study. However, since the introduction of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E14/S7B Q&A 5.1 and 6.1 TQT substitutions, drug developers are offered an alternative pathway to evaluate proarrhythmic risk during an ascending dose study in healthy volunteers or during a powered patient study, respectively. In addition, the findings as well as the manner in which nonclinical studies are conducted (i.e., utilizing best practices) can dictate the need for a positive control in the clinical study and/or affect the labeling outcome. Drug sponsors are now faced with the option of pursuing a dedicated TQT study or requesting a TQT substitution. Potential factors influencing the choice of pathway include the NCE mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic properties, and safety profile, as well as business considerations. This tutorial will highlight the regulatory framework for integrated arrhythmia risk prediction models to outline drug safety, delineate potential reasons why a TQT substitution request may be rejected and discuss when a standalone TQT is recommended.

### Carbamazepine (Carbamazepine er) [^112eKNBM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Serious Dermatologic Reactions

Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.

Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drug–antiretroviral interactions — clinical risks — Potential interactions between antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are complex and extensive, with greatest concern for P450 system enzyme induction by older-generation AEDs (phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) which might be expected to lower the effective dose of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs). AED–ARV interactions that raise drug levels may increase toxicity risk, ARVs that reduce AED levels could lead to loss of therapeutic AED effects including seizure control, and AEDs that decrease ARV levels may result in virologic failure with immunologic decline, clinical disease progression, and development of ARV resistance. In low- and middle-income countries where first-line AED availability is limited to phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phenytoin and ARV options may also be limited, there is substantial risk for clinically important drug interactions.

### Design of phase 3 studies evaluating vixotrigine for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia [^1124xHUH]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Two double-blind randomized withdrawal studies are planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vixotrigine compared with placebo in participants with TN (NCT03070132, Study 1, and NCT03637387, Study 2). The 2 studies will include a screening period, 7-day run-in period, 4- or 6-week single-dose-blind dose-optimization period (Study 1) or 4-week open-label period (Study 2), and 14-week double-blind period (Figure 1). Participants will be given an electronic diary to record daily and weekly efficacy assessments and will receive training on its use during the screening period.

Figure 1
Study design for (A) Study 1 and (B) Study 2.

Notes: Responders are defined as participants with ≥ 30% reduction in mean pain score from run-in period baseline to the last week of the dose-optimization/open-label period. a Participants must meet all eligibility criteria on Day 1 to enter the dose-optimization period and all randomization criteria at Week 4 (Day 29) or Week 6 (Day 43) to be randomized to DB treatment. b For efficacy endpoints based on daily participant diary (pain score, worst pain score, and number of paroxysms), baseline will be defined as the means of the diary data recorded over the 7 days preceding the first dose of study treatment in the dose-optimization period. For other efficacy endpoints, baseline will be the last measurement before the first dose of study treatment. c Participants taking > 1 TN medication at study entry will be required to gradually titrate down and discontinue their medications so that they are receiving no more than 1 TN medication at the start of the dose-optimization period. The remaining TN medication should be at a low enough dose at the start of the dose-optimization period so that it can be safely stopped by the end of Week 1. Participants taking carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine will be required to reduce their dose by the start of the dose-optimization period and will take their last dose by Day 7, prior to the start of Week 2 of the dose-optimization period. d The increase in dose at the end of Week 4 for nonresponders will occur only if participants have recorded their pain score in the electronic diary on ≥ 5 of the last 7 days of the dose-optimization period; participants who are noncompliant with the electronic diary will be withdrawn from the study. e Includes participants who discontinue DB study treatment for reasons other than adverse events but remain in the study and complete the DB period through Week 14. Participants who discontinue DB study treatment and withdraw from the study and participants who exceed dosing limits for acetaminophen/paracetamol, pregabalin, or immediate-release oxycodone during the DB period will not be eligible for the long-term extension. f Participants must meet all eligibility criteria on Day 1 to enter the open-label period and all randomization criteria at Week 4 (Day 29) to be randomized to DB treatment. g For efficacy endpoints based on daily participant diary (pain score, worst pain score, and number of paroxysms), baseline will be defined as the means of the diary data recorded over the 7 days preceding the first dose of study treatment in the open-label period. For other efficacy endpoints, baseline will be the last measurement before the first dose of study treatment. h Participants taking > 1 TN medication at study entry will be required to gradually titrate down and discontinue their medications so that they are receiving no more than 1 TN medication at the start of the open-label period. The remaining TN medication should be at a low enough dose at the start of the open-label period so that it can be safely stopped by the end of Week 1. Participants taking carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine will be required to reduce their dose by the start of the open-label period and will take their last dose by Day 7, prior to the start of Week 2 of the open-label period.

Results

Patient disposition and baseline demographics

A total of 34 patients were randomized: 30 patients at 8 sites in the United States and 4 patients at 3 sites in the United Kingdom; 32 patients (94%) completed the treatment period, and of these, 24 (75%) entered an open-label extension trial (figure 1). Two patients on CBD were withdrawn during the treatment period. All 34 randomized patients were included in the safety analysis set: 10, 8, and 9 patients in the 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/d CBD groups, respectively, and 7 patients in the placebo group. All PK analyses were conducted using the safety analysis set.

Figure 1
Disposition of patients

There was a delay of ≥ 23 weeks between treatment completion and when the open-label extension trial was available for enrollment. All pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted using the safety analysis set. CBD = cannabidiol.

Demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (table 1). Seventy-one percent of patients were white and the mean age was 7.6 years (range 4.0–10.9 years). The most common concomitant AEDs were clobazam (68%) and valproate (all forms; 65%).

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^112soX29]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Medical Management

Historical Therapies

Eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries saw the use of various compounds like quinine, mercury, opium, arsenic, and powder of gelsenium as treatments for TN. The use of phenytoin as the first antiepileptic medication used for TN was described by Bergouignan in 1942 and ushered in the modern TN treatment era.

First-Line Treatments

Carbamazepine is the first-line drug of choice, with oxcarbazepine also utilized given its relatively more favorable side effect profile. It is important to keep in mind that both carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine typically do not work immediately.

Carbamazepine

Carbamazepine was initially shown to be effective for treating TN in a randomized placebo-controlled trial published in 1966. In the trial, doses from 100 mg three times per day to 200 mg four times per day were used. Patients using carbamazepine for 2 weeks had a 58% improvement in pain when compared to a 26% improvement in the placebo group, p < 0.01. However, carbamazepine has a serious side effect profile, including hyponatremia, aplastic anemia, and liver failure. Current recommendations are to monitor sodium, complete blood count (CBC), and liver function tests (LFTs) at baseline, and periodically afterwards. Carbamazepine has also been associated with hormonal alterations, including lower thyroxine levels, elevated levels of sex hormone–binding globulin, and lower free testosterone levels in men. Other side-effect symptoms of the medication include drowsiness, ataxia, and nausea. In an analysis of four placebo-controlled trials of carbamazepine performed in the late 1960s, the number needed to treat was 1.7–1.8; however, this study also found the number needed to harm of 3 for adverse events and 24 for serious events.

### Initial treatment of epilepsy: special issues in treating the elderly [^114meVPM]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The incidence of new-onset epilepsy is higher among the elderly, the most rapidly growing segment of the population, than in any other age group. New-onset seizures in elderly patients are typically cryptogenic or symptomatic partial seizures that require long-term treatment. Because seizures in the elderly are often readily controlled, considerations of tolerability and safety, including pharmacokinetics and the potential for drug interactions, may be as important as efficacy in the selection of an antiepileptic drug (AED). The newer AEDs introduced during the past decade offer advantages in this respect over older agents. Phenytoin is the most widely used AED in the United States, but its hepatic metabolism and associated enzyme induction, as well as its nonlinear pharmacokinetics, are particular disadvantages for elderly patients. Because of their potential effects on cognitive function, sedating AEDs such as phenobarbital and primidone have little place in the treatment of new-onset seizures in elderly patients. Carbamazepine also is an enzyme-inducing agent with significant potential for drug interactions. Among the newer AEDs, gabapentin and levetiracetam have good safety and cognitive effect profiles and do not interact with other drugs, and lamotrigine offers many of the same benefits. Oxcarbazepine has better tolerability than carbamazepine, and topiramate and zonisamide, although they have more cognitive side effects than the other new AEDs, can be considered for some elderly patients. Forthcoming data from the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Trial 428, as well as recent guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society, are likely to provide support for the use of selected second-generation AEDs as first-line agents for the treatment of epilepsy in elderly patients.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability profile of treatment with a combination of CDX-1127 and nivolumab in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell NHL. II. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1
- Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks
- White blood cell ≥ 2000/mm³
- Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm³.
- Aspartate transaminase = <
2. 5 x ULN
- Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min.
- History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to CDX-1127 and/or nivolumab
- History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody
- Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
- Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CDX-1127 and nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CDX-1127 or nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CDX-1127 or nivolumab.

Likely to have near normal lifespan if not for the presence of relapsed/refractory lymphoma
- Patients with evidence of hepatitis B virus are eligible provided there is minimal hepatic injury and the patient has undetectable HBV on suppressive HBV therapy; patient must be willing to maintain adherence to HBV therapy

### Fear of the dark: concomitant use of direct oral anticoagulants and antiseizure medications [^116VsfJR]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Since most PWE require antiseizure medications (ASMs), could DOACs be safely co-administered? The same question is posed for a host of patients without epilepsy, who are nevertheless prescribed ASMs for other indications (eg, migraines, mood stabilization, peripheral neuropathy, etc). All DOACs are substrates of P-glycoprotein; an efflux pump that, when inhibited, would increase absorption, bioavailability, and the risk of bleeding. Additionally, the FXa inhibitors (aside for Betrixaban that undergoes hydrolysis) are metabolized through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway, mostly via CYP3A4; when this pathway is induced, the clotting risk increases. Several ASMs (eg, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine) potently induce both P-glycoprotein and CYP, while some (eg, oxcarbazepine, escirbazepine, topiramate) exert minor induction in the CYP pathway only. The data on other ASMs (eg, valproic acid and levetiracetam) are more controversial, and for the remainder of ASMs, they are not well established. Several studies have reported a reduction in the PCs of DOACs from enzyme-inducing ASMs (EI-ASMs). The clinical repercussions of recurrent thromboembolism or heightened bleeding risk from these drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between DOACs and ASMs are not conclusively delineated. - In this nebulous milieu, the European Heart Rhythm Association recommended against concurrent use of EI-ASMs (in addition to valproic acid and levetiracetam) with DOACs.

The current studyattempts to elucidate this issue. By using a US population-based, healthcare database of adult PWE on ASMs and AF on co-dispensed DOACs, the authors evaluated whether the frequency of thromboembolic and major bleeding events differed between patients on EI-ASMs versus non EI-ASMs. With > 14 000 exposure episodes within 11 years, the estimated incidence for thromboembolic events was 88.5 per 1000-person years and the estimated incidence for major bleeding events was 68.3 per 1000-person years. While there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients on EI-ASMs versus non EI-ASMs, the authors identified a reduced risk of bleeding events in patients on EI-ASMs (AHR 0.63; 95% CI 0.44–0.89).

### Once-daily maraviroc versus tenofovir / emtricitabine each combined with darunavir / ritonavir for initial HIV-1 treatment [^116rtq1W]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Safety

Maraviroc along with DRV/r was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to that of TDF/FTC and DRV/r. Over 48 weeks, rates of SAEs and nonserious adverse events; discontinuations due to adverse events; and rates of DAIDS Grade 3 or 4 AEs and laboratory abnormalities were similar between the groups (Table 2). There were no deaths and no new safety findings.

Forty-one (10.4%) and 40 (10.0%) participants in the MVC and TDF/FTC groups, respectively, experienced at least one treatment-emergent SAE up to 30 days after last dose of study drug. Five SAEs were considered to be related to study drugs. Four occurred in the MVC group and two were considered possibly related to MVC by the investigator: one of abnormal weight loss and one of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other two treatment-related SAEs in the MVC group were rash considered to be related to DRV/r and concomitant treatment with ritonavir and carbamazepine that led to drug toxicity. The event in the TDF/FTC group was abnormal weight loss, considered to be related to TDF/FTC by the investigator.

### Carbamazepine er [^113sJutd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

Table 1 Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing carbamazepine or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

### The new antiepileptic drugs: clinical applications [^117N5eAi]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

In the past decade, 8 new antiepileptic drugs have been approved for use in the United States, offering many new treatment options to patients with epilepsy. With expanding use of these newer agents, primary care clinicians are challenged with understanding the roles that each new agent plays in the treatment of patients with epilepsy as well as possible interactions with other pharmacological therapies. Each new medication provides a unique profile of pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and mechanisms of action, making an appreciation of how these agents are best utilized even more difficult. Despite well-performed trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of specific antiepileptic drugs, the lack of head-to-head comparisons among them makes it difficult to endorse a single therapeutic regimen. Limited studies have compared the new antiepileptic drugs with more traditional medications and found similar efficacy but improved tolerability of the newer agents. There remains no well-established guidelines for choosing a particular antiepileptic drug or for choosing a newer agent over a traditional one. However, careful consideration of seizure type, patient comorbidities, and specific medication toxicities aids in prescribing the most appropriate medication. This article aims to familiarize the general practitioner with the appropriate roles and effective uses of the new antiepileptic drugs in specific clinical scenarios.

### The initial experience of eslicarbazepine in children at three Canadian tertiary pediatric care centers [^115bhBFX]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Epilepsy is common in childhood, with focal seizures being the most common seizure type. Epilepsy is associated with worse quality of lifeand increased morbidity and mortality than the general population, including the risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. These issues, among others, have led to the continued development of antiseizure medications. The number of available antiseizure medications, with novel mechanisms of action, has progressively increased over the past decades. Most of them are characterized by more favorable pharmacokinetics and drug interaction profiles than first-generation antiseizure medications, but efficacy profiles do not seem to be improved, with little change in the incidence of drug-resistant epilepsy.

Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) is a once-daily, third-generation antiseizure medication for focal onset seizures. It is a member of the dibenzazepine family of antiseizure medications, which also includes carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. The primary mechanism of action is enhancing the slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, – which may dampen neuronal excitability. Eslicarbazepine differs from carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, which act primarily on fast channel inactivation. The differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and metabolism, may have an impact on the effectiveness and tolerability of these antiseizure medications.

Five phase III clinical trials found that eslicarbazepine was effective and well tolerated in adults (18 years) with focal seizures and supported the approval of eslicarbazepine in the United States. A subset of data pooled from 2 European double-blind clinical trials (with open-label extensions) of adjunctive eslicarbazepine in children aged 2–18 years with focal seizures were used to support the FDA approval of eslicarbazepine for the treatment of focal seizures in children. A post hoc analysis of the pooled data from patients aged 4–17 years in study 208 (NCT01527513) and study 305 (NCT00988156) were analyzed. Both were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of eslicarbazepine as adjunctive treatment in pediatric patients with refractory focal seizures receiving 1 or 2 antiseizure medications. Adjunctive eslicarbazepine was generally well tolerated in children aged 4–17 years, with good safety profile.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^111hPCP7]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder — maintenance and acute mania pharmacotherapy considerations emphasize that "Priority should be given to treatments effective for maintenance treatment to prevent the return of mood episodes; maintenance treatment is the cornerstone of treatment for BD". Evidence suggests that aripiprazole has potentially less efficacy compared with other agents. Valproate shows a small effect size (0.26) with liver toxicity and coagulopathy risks, its use "should be considered carefully", and "Valproate should be prescribed only as a last resort to individuals of childbearing potential" due to teratogenic and developmental harms. Carbamazepine poses severe risks to women of childbearing potential, has a Black Box warning recommending genomic testing (for HLA-B✱1502) in certain populations — specifically for those of Chinese descent — because of risk of a deadly rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [SJS/TEN]) and also has many drug–drug interactions. Patient preferences vary given side effect profiles: haloperidol has a higher risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects, and cariprazine had a 29% incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and a 21% incidence of akathisia in trials in BD. Asenapine requires sublingual administration for several minutes (twice daily) with unclear feasibility in more severely ill manic patients, and there is a lack of evidence for effectiveness of the asenapine transdermal patch. Ziprasidone must be taken twice daily with 500 kilocalories of food for proper absorption, and the intramuscular formulation takes increased time to administer secondary to preparation. The Work Group categorized the evidence as Reviewed, New-added with low confidence and noted limitations; benefits of these drugs in acute mania slightly outweighed harms, and because these treatments have no evidence preventing recurrence of mania or depression, "these drugs are not recommended as preferred treatments for acute mania".

### Carbamazepine (Carbamazepine er) [^113TZum2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including carbamazepine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

### Immediate-release versus controlled-release carbamazepine in the treatment of epilepsy [^1127vov1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is defined as the tendency to spontaneous, excessive neuronal discharge, manifesting as seizures. It is a common disorder with an incidence of 50 per 100,000 per year and a prevalence of 0.5% to 1% (Hauser 1993) in the developed world. Carbamazepine is a commonly used antiepileptic drug that is associated with a number of troublesome adverse events including dizziness, double vision and unsteadiness. These often occur during peaks in plasma concentration. The occurrence of such adverse events may limit the daily dose that can be tolerated and reduce the chances of seizure control for patients requiring higher doses (Vojvodic 2002). A controlled-release formulation of carbamazepine delivers the same dose over a longer period of time when compared to a standard formulation, thereby reducing post-dose peaks and potentially reducing adverse events associated with peak plasma levels.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of immediate-release carbamazepine (IR CBZ) versus controlled-release carbamazepine (CR CBZ) in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. To determine the efficacy of switching to CR CBZ in patients treated with IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (25 September 2009), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), and MEDLINE (1950 to September week 3, 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing IR CBZ to CR CBZ in patients commencing monotherapy and patients presently treated with IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. Primary outcome measures include seizure frequency, incidence of adverse events, proportions with treatment failure and quality of life measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

The methodological quality of each study was assessed with respect to study design, type of control, method and concealment of allocation, blinding and completeness of follow up, and the presence of blinding for assessment of non-fatal outcomes. We did not make use of an overall quality score. Two review authors (GP, MS) independently extracted the data and recorded relevant information on a standardised data extraction form. Results were assessed for inclusion. The heterogeneity of the included trials resulted in only a narrative, descriptive analysis being possible for both categorical and time-to-event data.

Main Results

Ten trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this review. One trial included patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy and nine included patients on treatment with IR CBZ. Eight trials reported heterogeneous measures of seizure frequency with conflicting results. A statistically significant difference was observed in only one trial, with patients prescribed CR CBZ experiencing fewer seizures than patients prescribed IR CBZ. Nine trials reported measures of adverse events. There was a trend in favour of CR CBZ with four trials reporting a statistically significant reduction in adverse events compared to IR CBZ. A further two trials reported fewer adverse events with CR CBZ, not statistically significant. One trial found no difference, with a further trial reporting increased adverse events in the CR CBZ although not statistically significant.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, data from trials do not confirm or refute an advantage for CR CBZ over IR CBZ for seizure frequency or adverse events in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. For trials involving epilepsy patients already prescribed IR CBZ, no conclusions can be drawn concerning superiority of CR CBZ with respect to seizure frequency. There is a trend for CR CBZ to be associated with fewer adverse events when compared to IR CBZ. A change to CR CBZ may therefore be a worthwhile strategy in patients with acceptable seizure control on IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. The included trials were of small size, poor methodological quality and possessed a high risk of bias, limiting the validity of this conclusion. Randomised controlled trials comparing CR CBZ to IR CBZ and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of CBZ preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^11699bQe]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine

Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the first-line treatment options for TN and offer meaningful initial pain control in almost 90% of patients, although this may not be sustained in the long term. The benefit of these drugs is offset by adverse effects, which lead to withdrawal in up to 40% of patients. Carbamazepine is known for its metabolic interaction with other medications, which can be problematic in elderly people with comorbidities. Oxcarbazepine causes fewer side effects and has lower potential for drug interactions than carbamazepine, though it is more likely to cause excessive central nervous system depression or dose-related hyponatraemia. The tolerability of both these drugs is gender related; women are significantly less tolerant.

The individual response to both drugs varies considerably, hence if one is not effective, then the other one can be tried. If changing over from carbamazepine to oxcarbazepine, then 200 mg of carbamazepine is equipotent to 300 mg of oxcarbazepine. It is important to be aware that the modified-release (retard) version of carbamazepine available is best used when patients have stabilised. Liquid versions of both drugs are useful when patients find it hard to swallow due to pain severity. While these drugs are effective for control of the paroxysmal pain, their effect on the concomitant continuous pain is usually limited.

Contraindications to using these agents include cardiac conduction problems and allergic reactions. There is a high degree of cross-reactivity between the aromatic antiseizure medications (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital).

Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine do not generally require regular monitoring of serum drug concentrations; in most patients, the drug doses can be titrated or tapered by clinically considering the balance between the efficacy and adverse effects. However, we advocate regular monitoring of renal, calcium and liver function tests. Patients may develop hyponatraemia and a cholestatic picture on liver function testing which, while not usually of clinical concern, need careful monitoring to ensure that they do not progressively worsen. Older women are already at increased risk of osteoporosis and this needs to be monitored in long-term use. The HLA-B✱1502 allele is highly associated with the outcome of carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. This association has been found mostly in the Han Chinese, but not in Caucasian patients. Hence, all Han Chinese patients should be tested for this allele before starting carbamazepine.

### Carbamazepine versus phenobarbitone monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^115P4Pdn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review, first published in Issue 1, 2003 and updated in 2015. This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone are commonly used broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first-line treatment for partial onset seizures, and is used in the USA and Europe. Phenobarbitone is no longer considered a first-line treatment because of concerns over associated adverse events, particularly documented behavioural adverse events in children treated with the drug. However, phenobarbitone is still commonly used in low- and middle-income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone in individual trials; however, the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide, and therefore, synthesising the data of the individual trials may show differences in efficacy.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, remission, and first seizure of carbamazepine compared with phenobarbitone when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 18 August 2016: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946), the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Previously we also searched SCOPUS (from 1823) as an alternative to Embase, but this is no longer necessary, because randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in Embase are now included in CENTRAL. We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

RCTs in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with a comparison of carbamazepine monotherapy versus phenobarbitone monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'time to achieve 12-month remission', 'time to achieve six-month remission', 'time to first seizure post-randomisation', and 'adverse events'. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with the generic inverse variance method used to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 836 participants out of 1455 eligible individuals from six out of 13 trials; 57% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, HR > 1 indicated an advantage for phenobarbitone, and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR > 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type, 95% CI) were HR 1.50 for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (95% CI 1.15 to 1.95; P = 0.003); HR 0.93 for time to achieve 12-month remission (95% CI 0.72 to 1.20; P = 0.57); HR 0.99 for time to achieve six-month remission (95% CI 0.80 to 1.23; P = 0.95); and HR 0.87 for time to first seizure (95% CI 0.72 to 1.06; P = 0.18). Results suggest an advantage for carbamazepine over phenobarbitone in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and no statistically significant evidence between the drugs for the other outcomes. We found evidence of a statistically significant interaction between treatment effect and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence (Chi² test for subgroup differences P = 0.03), where phenobarbitone was favoured for partial onset seizures (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.96; P = 0.02) and carbamazepine was favoured for generalised onset seizures (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.77; P = 0.27). We found no evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and seizure type for the other outcomes. However, methodological quality of the included studies was variable, with 10 out of the 13 included studies (4 out of 6 studies contributing IPD) judged at high risk of bias for at least one methodological aspect, leading to variable individual study results, and therefore, heterogeneity in the analyses of this review. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of poor methodological aspects, where possible.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, we found evidence suggestive of an advantage for carbamazepine in terms of drug effectiveness compared with phenobarbitone (retention of the drug in terms of seizure control and adverse events) and evidence suggestive of an association between treatment effect and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence (phenobarbitone favoured for partial seizures and carbamazepine favoured for generalised seizures). However, this evidence was judged to be of low quality due to poor methodological quality and the potential impact on individual study results (and therefore variability (heterogeneity) present in the analysis within this review), we encourage caution when interpreting the results of this review and do not advocate that the results of this review alone should be used in choosing between carbamazepine and phenobarbitone. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with considerations for allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenetic-guided treatment: are we there yet? [^111io9yT]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pharmacogenetics (PGx) studies the relationship between genetic variation and inter-individual variability in drug response in terms of efficacy and safety. Hence, PGx knowledge can be used to tailor pharmaceutical treatment to the genetic make-up of the patient. Several robust, well-replicated PGx associations exist, for example, the association of HLA-B✱5701 with abacavir hypersensitivity, HLA-B✱1502 with carbamazepine-induced Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and VKORC1 and CYP2C9 with warfarin dosing. Accordingly, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) includes information about PGx associations in many drug labels in a wide range of therapeutic areas. These PGx drug labels cover tests that are commonly used, but also include weaker genetic associations that are reported without requiring adjustments to pharmaceutical treatment. Most drugs with mandatory genetic testing are used in oncology, but PGx tests in other therapeutic areas are already being offered by laboratories and some have become part of standard clinical practice.

Personalizing drug treatments through PGx testing could improve their efficacy and safety, as well as reduce costs. However, as health-care resources are finite, it is important that the cost-effectiveness of novel PGx-guided treatment strategies is assessed in addition to their clinical utility before they are widely applied. Economic evaluations, which compare costs and outcomes of at least two competing interventions, are a useful tool to inform decision making and prioritize health-care spending. In the context of PGx testing, a pharmaco-economic study might contrast PGx-guided treatment with standard treatment (ST) with the same drug, or with an alternative drug that does not require genetic testing, or with both alternatives. When the PGx strategy is found to be more effective at an acceptable additional cost (cost-effective) or more effective at a lower cost (cost-saving or dominant), this provides a strong argument for the implementation of PGx testing.

### Antiepileptic drugs: the old and the new [^113Tymey]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

During the past decade several new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have become available, including new formulations of some of the older medications. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of the new AEDs is important because they are primarily used for adjunctive therapy and interactions with other medications can result in significant toxicities. The new-generation AEDs do not cause serious morbidity in overdose, and treatment is primarily supportive. Specific medications should be chosen based on the patient's history and presentation.

Carbamazepine is a current first line treatment for partial onset seizures in the USA and Europe. Phenytoin is no longer considered a first line treatment due to concerns over adverse events associated with its use, however the drug is still commonly used in low- to middle-income countries due to it's low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenytoin in individual trials, however the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide. Therefore, differences in efficacy may be shown by synthesising the data of the individual trials.

To review the time to withdrawal, six- and 12-month remission, and first seizure of carbamazepine compared to phenytoin when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures) or generalised tonic-clonic seizures, with or without other generalised seizure types.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (16 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to 16 September 2014), SCOPUS (1823 to 16 September 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (16 September 2014), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (18 September 2014). We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with a comparison of carbamazepine monotherapy versus phenytoin monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, and our secondary outcomes were time to 12-month remission, time to six-month remission and time to first seizure post-randomisation. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 595 participants out of 1192 eligible individuals, from four out of 12 trials (i.e. 50% of the potential data). For remission outcomes, HR > 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR > 1 indicates an advantage for carbamazepine. Methodological quality of the four studies providing IPD was generally good and we rated it at low risk of bias overall in the analyses. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were time to withdrawal of allocated treatment: 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.39); time to 12-month remission: 1.01 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.31); time to six-month remission: 1.11 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.37); and time to first seizure: 0.85 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.04). The results suggest no overall statistically significant difference between the drugs for these outcomes. There is some evidence of an advantage for phenytoin for individuals with generalised onset seizures for our primary outcome (time to withdrawal of allocated treatment): pooled HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.96); and a statistical interaction between treatment effect and epilepsy type (partial versus generalised) for this outcome (P = 0.02), however misclassification of seizure type for up to 48 individuals (32% of those with generalised epilepsy) may have confounded the results of this review. Despite concerns over side effects leading to the withdrawal of phenytoin as first line treatment in the USA and Europe, we found no evidence that phenytoin is more likely to be associated with serious side effects than carbamazepine; 26 individuals withdrew from 290 randomised (9%) to carbamazepine due to adverse effects compared to 12 out of 299 (4%) randomised to phenytoin from four studies conducted in the USA and Europe (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.80, P = 0.014). We rated the quality of the evidence as low - moderate according to GRADE criteria, due to imprecision and potential misclassification of seizure type.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not found evidence that a statistically significant difference exists between carbamazepine and phenytoin for the efficacy outcomes examined in this review, however, CIs are wide and the possibility of important differences existing has not been excluded. There is no evidence in this review that phenytoin is more strongly associated with serious adverse events than carbamazepine. There is some evidence that participants with generalised seizures may be less likely to withdraw early from phenytoin than carbamazepine, but misclassification of seizure type may have impacted upon the results of this review. We recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review, and do not recommend that the results of this review alone should be used in choosing between carbamazepine and phenytoin. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with considerations on allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Safety and tolerability of adjunctive eslicarbazepine acetate in pediatric patients (aged 4–17 years) with focal seizures [^113bANw9]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

The pooled safety population comprised 362 patients (placebo, n = 160; ESL, n = 202), 123 from study 208 (placebo, n = 40; ESL, n = 83) and 239 from study 305 (placebo, n = 120; ESL, n = 119). A total of 24 patients were excluded from the analyses as they were aged < 4 years (placebo, n = 9; ESL, n = 15); no patient in study 208 or 305 was aged > 17 years. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were generally comparable between the placebo and ESL groups (Table 1). The majority of patients taking ESL were white (97%), enrolled at sites in Europe (98%), aged ≥ 7 years (89%), > 38 kg in weight (55%), and taking 2 or more AEDs at baseline (70%). The most commonly used concomitant AEDs were valproic acid, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, and levetiracetam.

Table 1.
Patient Baseline Demographics and Clinical Characteristics.

Patients in the ESL group of study 305 were taking more baseline AEDs (study 305: 1 baseline AED 15.1%, 2 baseline AEDs 74.8%; study 208: 51.8% and 47.0%, respectively) and had a higher baseline monthly seizure frequency (study 305: mean [standard deviation (SD)], 54.4 [133.7]; study 208: 13.9 [24.1]) than those taking ESL in study 208. The mean (SD) daily dose of ESL was higher in study 208 (820.1 [246.0] mg/d) than study 305 (714.2 [264.1] mg/d), whereas median exposure to double-blind treatment with ESL was higher in study 305 (147 days [21 weeks]) than study 208 (112 days [16 weeks]).

### Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for HLA genotype and use of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine: 2017 update [^115S8ksL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

The variant allele HLA-B✱15:02 is strongly associated with greater risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in patients treated with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. The variant allele HLA-A✱31:01 is associated with greater risk of maculopapular exanthema, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and SJS/TEN in patients treated with carbamazepine. We summarize evidence from the published literature supporting these associations and provide recommendations for carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine use based on HLA genotypes.

Broadly European CBZ‐DILI GWAS

As part of the phase II study, we also collected 12 patients of European descent with CBZ‐DILI, in which the liver was involved by itself. The cases were recruited from two large international DILI consortia: iDILIC and DILIN, 33 whereas two other cases were as described previously. 10 The iDILIC cases were evaluated by application of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) scale, also called the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM), and by expert review by a panel of three hepatologists. Only cases having at least possible causality (score ≥ 3) were included in the study. 33 DILIN causality assessment is determined by a panel of three hepatologists who independently assign a causality score ranging from 1 (definite) to 5 (unlikely) as well as a severity score ranging from 1 (mild) to 5 (fatal), as previously described. 33 Besides the DILI phenotype, DILIN and iDILIC also collected additional clinical information, including the occurrence of eosinophilia and cutaneous involvement. The cases were compared with the 8,438 phase II population controls of European descent.

### Carbamazepine versus phenobarbitone monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^116WeS5h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2003, of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug (AED) in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenobarbitone (PB) are commonly used broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first-line treatment for partial onset seizures in the USA and Europe. Phenobarbitone is no longer considered a first-line treatment because of concerns over associated adverse events, particularly documented behavioural adverse events in children treated with the drug. However, PB is still commonly used in low- and middle-income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between CBZ and PB in individual trials; however, the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide, and therefore, synthesising the data of the individual trials may show differences in efficacy.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, remission, and first seizure of CBZ compared with PB when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2014: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (from 1946), Scopus (from 1823), the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry platform (WHO ICTRP). We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with a comparison of CBZ monotherapy versus PB monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', and our secondary outcomes were 'Time to 12-month remission', 'Time to 6-month remission', and 'Time to first seizure postrandomisation'. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with the generic inverse variance method used to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

Individual participant data were available for 836 participants out of 1455 eligible individuals from 6 out of 13 trials, 57% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, HR > 1 indicated an advantage for PB, and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR > 1 indicated an advantage for CBZ. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type, 95% CI) were HR 1.50 for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (95% CI 1.15 to 1.95, P = 0.003); HR 0.93 for time to 12-month remission (95% CI 0.72 to 1.20, P = 0.57); HR 0.99 for time to 6-month remission (95% CI 0.80 to 1.23, P = 0.95); and HR 0.87 for time to first seizure (95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, P = 0.18). Results suggest an advantage for CBZ over PB in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and no statistically significant evidence between the drugs for the other outcomes. We found evidence of a statistically significant interaction between treatment effect and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence (Chi² test for subgroup differences P = 0.03), where PB was favoured for partial onset seizures (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.96, P = 0.02) and CBZ was favoured for generalised onset seizures (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.77, P = 0.27). However, methodological quality of the included studies was variable, with 10 out of the 13 included studies (4 out of 6 studies contributing IPD) judged as high risk of bias for at least 1 methodological aspect, leading to variable individual study results and therefore heterogeneity in the analyses of this review. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of poor methodological aspects where possible.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, we found evidence suggestive of an advantage for CBZ in terms of drug effectiveness compared with PB (retention of the drug in terms of seizure control and adverse events) and evidence of an association between treatment effect and seizure type for time to first seizure recurrence (PB favoured for partial seizures and CBZ favoured for generalised seizures). Given the varying quality of studies included in this review and the impact of poor methodological quality on individual study results (and therefore variability (heterogeneity) present in the analysis within this review), we recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review and do not recommend that the results of this review alone should be used in choosing between CBZ and PB. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with considerations for allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

Felbamate in partial-onset seizures — adjunctive therapy randomized trials show that there were two randomized controlled trials of felbamate as adjunctive therapy for intractable partial-onset seizures; in a crossover study adding felbamate to carbamazepine there was no statistically significant difference between placebo and felbamate periods and this was attributed to carbamazepine levels being lowered by felbamate, while in a three-armed double-blind trial with carbamazepine and phenytoin background antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) a mean dose of 2300 mg/day achieved a modest but statistically significant seizure reduction though lowered carbamazepine and phenytoin levels were again noted.

Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with Tegretol treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Tegretol should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed, and alternative therapy should be considered.

### Oxcarbazepine, an antiepileptic agent [^114KLoov]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurologic condition. Many of the currently approved pharmacologic agents for its treatment are associated with numerous adverse drug reactions and drug interactions.

Objective

This review describes the pharmacology and therapeutic use of oxcarbazepine, an analogue of the well-known antiepileptic agent carbamazepine.

Methods

Articles for review were identified through a search of MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and EMBASE for the years 1980 through 2000. The terms used individually and in combination were oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, epilepsy, and seizures.

Results

Oxcarbazepine and its primary metabolite have been effective in animal models of epilepsy that generally predict efficacy in generalized tonic-clonic seizures and partial seizures in humans. The exact mechanism of action of oxcarbazepine is unknown, although as with carbamazepine, it is believed to involve blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. The pharmacokinetic profile of oxcarbazepine is less complicated than that of carbamazepine, with less metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system, no production of an epoxide metabolite, and lower plasma protein binding. The clinical efficacy and tolerability of oxcarbazepine have been demonstrated in trials in adults, children, and the elderly. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial in adults, oxcarbazepine 300 mg was associated with a decrease in the mean frequency of tonic seizures (21.4 vs 30.5 seizures during steady-state periods) and tonic-clonic seizures (8.2 vs 10.4) compared with carbamazepine 200 mg (P = 0.05). A multinational, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 28-week trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of oxcarbazepine at doses of 600, 1200, and 2400 mg as adjunctive therapy in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures. All 3 oxcarbazepine groups demonstrated a reduction in seizure frequency per 28-day period compared with placebo (600 mg, 26% reduction; 1200 mg, 40% reduction; 2400 mg, 50% reduction; placebo, 7.6% reduction; all, P < 0.001). A trial in children assessed the efficacy and toxicity of oxcarbazepine (median dose, 31.4 mg/kg/d) as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures. Patients receiving oxcarbazepine experienced a 35% reduction in seizure frequency, compared with a 9% reduction in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The most common adverse effects associated with oxcarbazepine are related to the central nervous system (eg, dizziness, headache, diplopia, and ataxia) and the gastrointestinal system (eg, nausea and vomiting). Compared with carbamazepine, there is an increased risk of hyponatremia with oxcarbazepine. The frequency and severity of drug interactions are less with oxcarbazepine than with carbamazepine or other antiepileptic agents.

Conclusions

Oxcarbazepine may be considered an appropriate alternative to carbamazepine for the treatment of partial seizures in patients who are unable to tolerate carbamazepine. Its use in nonseizure disorders remains to be examined in large-scale clinical trials, and pharmacoeconomic comparisons of oxcarbazepine with other antiepileptic agents, particularly carbamazepine, are needed.

### The initial experience of eslicarbazepine in children at three Canadian tertiary pediatric care centers [^116Ad2MS]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Retention

In the present study, the retention rate for eslicarbazepine was 70% over at least 3 years. In the majority of patients, eslicarbazepine was initiated because of lack of effectiveness of previous antiseizure medications, or poor tolerance to previous treatment. These patients predominantly had drug-resistant epilepsy and had tried a mean of 5 antiseizure medications, and 90% of them had previously tried carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. Despite these characteristics of the cohort, the retention rate is similar to those previously reported with eslicarbazepine in adults and children. Our results are also similar to those of studies specifically in children. The study reviewing the long-term therapeutic effect of eslicarbazepine in children in an open-label extension of a cognition study in children aged 6–16 years found that the majority of patients remained on eslicarbazepine during the 2-year open label extension and treatment efficacy was maintained. Adverse effects were consistent with the known safety profile of eslicarbazepine. This high retention rate confirms the tolerability and safety profile that we observed. A potential advantage of eslicarbazepine in the pediatric setting is that it is administered once daily, reducing medication burden and increasing likelihood of treatment adherence, in comparison with agents requiring multiple dosing per day. Fifteen of the study patients underwent resective epilepsy surgery, of which 6 had Engle 1 outcome. Eslicarbazepine was maintained for ongoing seizure protection, as it can be a gradual process to wean multiple antiseizure medications after surgery. Also, some patients continued to have FA seizures (auras), requiring antiseizure medication. Once-daily dosing likely may have increased compliance in these patients.

### Risk of ischemic cerebrovascular and coronary events in adult users of anticonvulsant medications in routine care settings [^113MPeMa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anticonvulsant medications represent first‐line therapy for patients with epilepsy or convulsions, but their use is not limited to the control of seizures. Labeled indications include bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain, and migraine prophylaxis, and considerable off‐label use has been reported. – Given the heterogeneous prescribing patterns and varied benefits of anticonvulsant drugs, a clarification of their safety profile merits attention.

Several investigations have highlighted possible interactions between anticonvulsant drugs and the cardiovascular system. Some of the older anticonvulsants (ie, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) have been associated with metabolic changes that may contribute to cardiovascular risk. The mechanism underlying this association might reside in the interaction between these medications and cytochrome P450 system activity. Previous investigations have shown that patients treated with anticonvulsants that highly induce cytochrome P450 enzyme system activity, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital, experienced elevated levels of total cholesterol and most of the various lipid fractions, including low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and serum triglycerides, – as well as increases in serum lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) and serum homocysteine. – Meaningful increases in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and Lp(a) have been observed after 2 to 3 months of therapy with carbamazepine, and a recent study found that switching from carbamazepine and phenytoin to anticonvulsants not inducing cytochrome P450 enzyme system activity, such as lamotrigine and levetiracetam, decreased levels of serum cholesterol and C‐reactive protein after 6 weeks. Studies have directly quantified atherosclerotic changes associated with long‐term therapy with anticonvulsantsand have shown that carotid artery intima‐media thickness, a strong predictor for future vascular events, appears to be positively correlated with the duration of conventional anticonvulsant therapy.

In the current study we sought to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with anticonvulsants that highly induce cytochrome P450 activity compared with other anticonvulsant agents as observed in routine care settings among adult anticonvulsant new users. We also investigated the risk of cardiovascular events associated with individual anticonvulsant medications compared with a referent agent.

Anticonvulsant use in dementia — laboratory monitoring and heightened vulnerability — Many clinicians monitor the CBC and electrolyte levels in patients taking carbamazepine and monitor the CBC and liver function values in patients taking valproate, owing to the possibility of bone marrow suppression, hyponatremia, and liver toxicity. A particularly cautious approach is warranted when treating elderly patients and those with dementia, who may be more vulnerable to adverse effects, particularly central nervous system effects, and yet less likely to be able to report warning symptoms.

### Birth defects after prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs [^113Fh6ZT]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Background

Exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of major congenital anomalies (MCAs) in offspring. Most of the studies, however, have been fraught with methodological shortcomings, and differences in ascertainment methods and classifications prevent meaningful data pooling. Individual studies lacked the statistical power to assess comparative risks associated with specific AEDs.

Recent Developments

Several larger-scale studies, including collaborative multinational registries, have been set up to compare MCA risks associated with different treatments, including newer generation AEDs. Results have largely been consistent with the notion that monotherapy with the most commonly used AEDs is associated with an increase in risk of MCAs by two to three times, and that the magnitude of risk increases in offspring exposed to polytherapy. Available evidence does not suggest that epilepsy per se is associated with a major increase in the risk of MCAs. Almost all studies have suggested that exposure to valproic acid is associated with a greater incidence of MCAs than other AEDs. Valproic acid is also the only AED for which a dose-dependency has been confirmed in several studies: the increase in risk of MCAs, compared with other AEDs, is especially evident at doses above 800–1000 mg/day. Data from the North American registry have suggested that phenobarbital may also have a higher teratogenic risk compared with AEDs other than valproic acid, but evidence remains inconclusive. Information about effects on fetuses of newer generation AEDs other than lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine is scant. Although teratogenic effects of lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine have not been established with certainty, none of the investigations to date identified any statistically significant difference in rates of MCAs between infants exposed to lamotrigine or oxcarbazepine and infants exposed to carbamazepine. In the case of lamotrigine, moreover, a positive correlation between maternal dose and rates of MCAs has been identified. WHERE NEXT? Collaborative pregnancy registries worldwide are at work to fill remaining gaps in knowledge. Issues to be addressed include the comparative risks associated with phenobarbital, with low-dose valproic acid, with newer generation AEDs, and with specific AED combinations; the influence of potential confounders; and the interaction of AED-associated risks with other risk factors, such as genetic profiles. Large scale studies may also clarify whether individual AEDs differ in their ability to cause specific anomalies. Finally, studies are urgently needed to investigate other potential adverse effects of AED exposure, with special reference to effects on postnatal intellectual development.

### Diagnosis and treatment of neurocysticercosis: 2017 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) [^117KRsrP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence for the superiority of a particular AED. We suggest that the choice of antiepileptic drugs be guided by local availability, cost, drug interactions, and side effects. Monotherapy with phenytoin or carbamazepine-controlled seizures in 86.5% of patients in one study involving 185 patients with SEL, A single, open-labeled comparative trial of clobazam versus phenytoin in patients with SEL suggested that the former might be more effective. However, clobazam has not been widely used. In contrast, carbamazepine and phenytoin appear to be used most often, largely because of availability and cost considerations in T. solium –endemic regions. Both are potent hepatic P 450 enzyme inducers, and the antihelmithic drugs praziquantel and albendazole are metabolized by the hepatic P 450 enzyme system. In pharmacokinetic studies, phenytoin and carbamazepine decrease the area under curves of praziquantel and to a lesser extent, albendazole. The clinical significance of the pharmacokinetic interaction in context of a solitary cysticercus granuloma is unknown. One potential way of circumventing this interaction is to administer a nonenzyme-inducing AED (e.g. levetriacetam) at least for the period of time for which antihelminthic treatment is being administered. This treatment strategy, however, has not been tested in any controlled trial.

An important management issue resolves around the duration for which AED treatment is given. At least three trials compared short-term (6 months) with slightly longer term (12–24 months) AED treatment. – The trials found no benefit in seizure control with longer duration AEDs in those people in whom the solitary cysticercus granuloma had completely resolved. The studies also revealed that the risk of recurrent seizures remained high in people in whom the lesion resolved but resulted in a calcific residue visible on CT scan. The increased risk of seizures in those who developed calcification appeared to be offset by using a longer duration of AED treatment (12–24 months). Hence, people with solitary cysticercus granuloma, in which the granuloma leaves behind a calcific residue, should receive a longer duration AED. How long should AEDs be advocated in these circumstances and when AEDs can be safely discontinued remains unsettled, and AEDs should probably be managed according to the guidelines for chronic epilepsy.

### Association between use of pharmacokinetic-interacting drugs and effectiveness and safety of direct acting oral anticoagulants: nested case-control study [^1178sVc1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Concomitant use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and medications with inhibition/induction effect on P‐gp/CYP3A might increase risk of bleeding/treatment failure, respectively. We designed a nested case‐control study within a Clalit cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a cohort of patients with venous thromboembolism, new users of a DOAC (January 1, 2010 to August 24, 2020). Propensity scores were constructed from demographic/clinical characteristics, and medications at cohort entry. Each case of: (i) serious bleeding event; (ii) stroke/systemic emboli (SE) in patients with AF; (iii) recurrent thromboembolism in patients with thromboembolism, was matched by age, sex, length of follow‐up, year of cohort entry, DOAC type, and DOAC indication, to up to 20 controls. Within 89,284 patients with AF and venous thromboembolism and 126,302 patient‐years of follow‐up, there were 1,587 serious bleeding events. Risk of serious bleeding increased in association with concurrent prescription of P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors. Specifically, higher bleeding risk was associated with dabigatran‐verapamil, rivaroxaban‐verapamil, and rivaroxaban‐amiodarone concurrent prescriptions: adjusted odds ratios (ORs) 2.29 (1.13–4.60), 2.18 (1.07–4.40), and 1.68 (1.14–2.49), respectively. There were 1,116 events of stroke/SE, in 79,302 DOAC‐treated patients with AF and 118,124 patient‐years of follow‐up. Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, or levetiracetam was associated with risk for stroke/SE: adjusted OR 2.18 (1.55–3.10). Risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism could not be assessed due to the low number of cases. Concurrent prescriptions of dabigatran or rivaroxaban with verapamil, and of rivaroxaban with amiodarone, are associated with increased risk for serious bleeding. Higher risk for stroke/SE in patients with AF is associated with concurrent prescriptions of DOACs with phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, or levetiracetam.

### Carbamazepine versus phenytoin monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^111VS7dU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2017. This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenytoin are commonly-used broad spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first-line treatment for focal onset seizures in the USA and Europe. Phenytoin is no longer considered a first-line treatment, due to concerns over adverse events associated with its use, but the drug is still commonly used in low- to middle-income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenytoin in individual trials; however, the confidence intervals generated by these trials are wide, and therefore, synthesising the data of the individual trials may show differences in efficacy.

Objectives

To review the time to treatment failure, remission and first seizure with carbamazepine compared with phenytoin when used as monotherapy in people with focal onset seizures (simple or complex focal and secondarily generalised), or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 13 August 2018: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy's Specialised Register and CENTRAL; MEDLINE; the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We handsearched relevant journals and contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators, and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing monotherapy with either carbamazepine or phenytoin in children or adults with focal onset seizures or generalised onset (tonic-clonic) seizures.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to treatment failure. Our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post-randomisation, time to six-month remission, time to 12-month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 595 participants out of 1102 eligible individuals, from four out of 11 trials (i.e. 54% of the potential data). For remission outcomes, a HR greater than 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, a HR greater than 1 indicates an advantage for carbamazepine. Most participants included in analysis (78%) were classified as experiencing focal onset seizures at baseline and only 22% were classified as experiencing generalised onset seizures; the results of this review are therefore mainly applicable to individuals with focal onset seizures. Results for the primary outcome of the review were: time to treatment failure for any reason related to treatment (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 546 participants: 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.26, moderate-certainty evidence); time to treatment failure due to lack of efficacy (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 546 participants: 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.41, moderate-certainty evidence); both showing no clear difference between the drugs and time to treatment failure due to adverse events (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type for 546 participants: 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.86, moderate-certainty evidence), showing that treatment failure due to adverse events may occur earlier on carbamazepine than phenytoin, but we cannot rule out a slight advantage to carbamazepine or no difference between the drugs. For our secondary outcomes (pooled HRs adjusted for seizure type), we did not find any clear differences between carbamazepine and phenytoin: time to first seizure post-randomisation (582 participants): 1.15, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.40, moderate-certainty evidence); time to 12-month remission (551 participants): 1.00, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.26, moderate-certainty evidence); and time to six-month remission (551 participants): 0.90, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12, moderate-certainty evidence). For all outcomes, results for individuals with focal onset seizures were similar to overall results (moderate-certainty evidence), and results for the small subgroup of individuals with generalised onset seizures were imprecise, so we cannot rule out an advantage to either drug, or no difference between drugs (low-certainty evidence). There was also evidence that misclassification of seizure type may have confounded the results of this review, particularly for the outcome 'time to treatment failure'. Heterogeneity was present in analysis of 'time to first seizure' for individuals with generalised onset seizures, which could not be explained by subgroup analysis or sensitivity analyses. Limited information was available about adverse events in the trials and we could not compare the rates of adverse events between carbamazepine and phenytoin. Some adverse events reported on both drugs were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, drowsiness, motor and cognitive disturbances, dysmorphic side effects (such as rash).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence provided by this systematic review does not show any differences between carbamazepine and phenytoin in terms of effectiveness (retention) or efficacy (seizure recurrence and seizure remission) for individuals with focal onset or generalised onset seizures. However, some of the trials contributing to the analyses had methodological inadequacies and inconsistencies, which may have had an impact on the results of this review. We therefore do not suggest that results of this review alone should form the basis of a treatment choice for a person with newly-onset seizures. We did not find any evidence to support or refute current treatment policies. We implore that future trials be designed to the highest quality possible, with consideration of masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^113gWzYH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — anticonvulsants for agitation and behavioral symptoms: Carbamazepine is not recommended for the routine treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, and routine use of valproate to treat behavioral symptoms in dementia is not recommended based on the current evidence; most randomized placebo-controlled trials showed no benefit of valproate compared with placebo and a 2004 Cochrane review concluded that valproate formulations were no more effective than placebo and that side effects were more common. Nonetheless, a therapeutic trial of carbamazepine or valproate may be considered in individual cases, and given the potential toxicity of both agents it is important to identify and monitor target symptoms and to discontinue the medication if no improvement is observed. If used, carbamazepine may be given in two to four doses per day, started at a total dosage of 50–100 mg/day, and increased gradually as warranted by behavioral response and side effects or until blood levels reach 8–12 ng/ml; divalproex sodium may be given in two or three doses per day and should be started at 125–250 mg/day, with gradual increases based on behavioral response and side effects or until blood levels reach 50–60 ng/ml (or, in rare cases, 100 ng/ml). Principal adverse effects of carbamazepine include ataxia, falls, sedation, and confusion, with drug interactions through the cytochrome P450 system and rare bone marrow suppression or hyponatremia; valproate's principal side effects are sedation, gastrointestinal disturbances, and confusion.

### Antiepileptic drugs in critically ill patients [^114qJBtj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Selection of the most appropriate AED in the ICU setting can be challenging for a variety of reasons. Older AEDs such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and phenobarbital are often used by clinicians due to their familiarity with these agents, intravenous formulations, and availability of evidence in certain clinical scenarios. Despite this, adverse effects of these agents, drug-drug interactions, and the need for TDM may limit their use. Newer agents such as levetiracetam and lacosamide are gaining popularity due to their relatively safe AED profile, fewer drug-drug interactions, and lack of need for TDM. The efficacy of these agents for seizure prophylaxis and as second-line treatment for SE, however, should be further evaluated in large randomized clinical trials.

### Practice parameter: treatment of the child with a first unprovoked seizure: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice committee of the Child Neurology Society [^117AxpLe]. Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Systemic side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in children — trial and cohort data report event rates and discontinuations for carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), valproic acid (VPA), and phenobarbital (PB): In a randomized Class I study of 116 children, 24 had at least one side effect with counts including nausea and vomiting (9), ataxia (10), rash (5), gingival hyperplasia (3), and dizziness (3); another Class I series found 3 of 23 CBZ patients with headache, anorexia, nausea or abdominal pain, and increased irritability, while systemic side effects were not reported for 20 on PHT or 21 on VPA. In first-seizure cohorts, 2 of 14 on CBZ discontinued for rash and 2 of 14 for excessive somnolence; in newly diagnosed epilepsy, PB was dropped after 6 of 10 due to unacceptable side effects, with side effects at 9% for PHT, 4% for CBZ, and 6% for VPA. A randomized blinded study of 151 children found more than one side effect in 32% on PB, 19% on VPA, and 40% on PHT; among PHT recipients, 58% had gingival hyperplasia and 25% had dose-related ataxia or sedation, with 2-year follow-up. In another Class II trial assigning 130 to VPA and 130 to CBZ, by 1 year, 13% discontinued VPA and 7% discontinued CBZ because of adverse effects. A Class III first-seizure study reported an overall side-effect rate of 24%, and CBZ exacerbation of seizures has been reported in 11 of 129 new-onset epilepsy cases. Several newer AED carry warnings or precautions for Stevens–Johnson syndrome (lamotrigine, zonisamide, felbamate), hepatic toxicity (lamotrigine, felbamate), aplastic anemia (felbamate), and renal stones (topiramate, zonisamide).

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^112gecri]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lamotrigine

Lamotrigine has been reported to be helpful as an add-on therapy in a small randomised cross-over trial. Lamotrigine can be used in patients who cannot tolerate carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, or as add-on therapy to increase efficacy. It is generally associated with fewer side effects than carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. The dose of lamotrigine should be escalated slowly as the incidence of lamotrigine-induced rash is well recognised to be dose and titration dependent. About 10% of people taking lamotrigine develop benign adverse cutaneous reactions. However life-threatening conditions, like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, can rarely occur. Since the introduction of a slow-dose titration protocol, the rate of severe rashes has reduced to 0.1%–0.01%. In view of the need for this slow-dose titration, lamotrigine is not appropriate for managing severe TN exacerbation to those who need rapid pain control.

Gabapentin and pregabalin

There are 16 randomised controlled trials for gabapentin, all published in Chinese, comparing it with carbamazepine. However, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions as the inclusion criteria, endpoints and dosage are either not clarified or very varied. There are no such trials for pregabalin, but a long-term study suggests that it may be effective.

Clinical experience shows that gabapentin and pregabalin are less effective but have fewer side effects than carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. They can therefore be used in place of or in addition to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. However, there is a risk of dependency and they are controlled drugs in the UK.

Baclofen

Baclofen can help in TN especially in people with multiple sclerosis who may be using the drug for spasticity.

### Perampanel (Fycompa) [^112j1KRg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Each study evaluated placebo and multiple FYCOMPA dosages (see Figure 1). During the Titration period in all 3 trials, patients on FYCOMPA received an initial 2 mg once daily dose, which was subsequently increased in weekly increments of 2 mg per day to the final dose. Patients experiencing intolerable adverse reactions were permitted to have their dose reduced to the previously tolerated dose.

The primary endpoint in Studies 1, 2, and 3 was the percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days during the Treatment Period as compared to the Baseline Period. The criterion for statistical significance was p < 0.05. A statistically significant decrease in seizure rate was observed at doses of 4 to 12 mg per day. Dose response was apparent at 4 to 8 mg with little

additional reduction in frequency at 12 mg per day.

Figure 1. Median Percent Reduction in Seizure Frequency per 28 Days from Baseline to Treatment Period

Tables 4 and 5 present an analysis combining data from all 3 studies, grouping patients based upon whether or not concomitant enzyme-inducing AEDs (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or phenytoin) were used. The analysis revealed a substantially reduced effect in the presence of inducers.

Figure 2 shows the proportion of patients with different percent reductions during the maintenance phase over baseline across all three trials. Patients in whom the seizure frequency increased are shown at left as "worse". Patients in whom the seizure frequency decreased are shown in the remaining four categories.

Figure 2. Proportion of Patients Exhibiting Different Percent Reductions During the Maintenance Phase Over Baseline Across All Three Trials.

The percentages of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency were 19%, 29%, 35%, 35% for placebo, 4, 8, and 12 mg, respectively.

### Randomized, dose-ranging safety trial of cannabidiol in dravet syndrome [^1154ULyF]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Protocol amendment

The trial protocol was revised in November 2014 to include a review of the diagnosis and classification of seizure types in each patient by an independent panel, appointed by the Epilepsy Study Consortium, using a standard protocol to confirm the diagnosis of DS.

PK assessments

PK blood samples were taken predose, 2–3 hours postdose, and 4–6 hours postdose on the first day of dosing and again at the same time intervals after 3 weeks of treatment (day 22). The 3 time points (predose, 2.5 hours, and 5 hours) are the minimum required to generate an area under the curve (AUC). Only sparse data were used to derive exposure information; therefore, no other PK parameters were derived. Plasma concentrations (measured as total) were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry using a validated method for the following: CBD, 6-hydroxy-cannabidiol (6-OH-CBD), 7-carboxy-cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD), clobazam, N-CLB, valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, and stiripentol. The 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD) metabolite of CBD was also assessed, but due to analytical issues related to the reference material batch used, the data could only be considered qualitative and are not presented.

Safety assessments

Safety assessments included laboratory assessments (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs and ECGs, and assessments of AEs, seizure frequency, and suicidality (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, performed by a licensed assessor for the instrument and in children at least 6 years of age).

Data analyses

All PK and safety data were summarized using descriptive statistics; no formal statistical comparisons were planned or performed. PK exposures were expressed as AUC 0–t estimated using a linear trapezoidal linear interpolation method using WinNonlin v6.3. Dose proportionality was assessed by regression analysis.

### Lamotrigine versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^112L2WqW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2006 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug (AED) in monotherapy. The correct choice of first-line antiepileptic therapy for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AEDs for an individual is made using the highest quality evidence regarding the potential benefits and harms of the various treatments. It is also important that the effectiveness and tolerability of AEDs appropriate to given seizure types are compared to one another. Carbamazepine or lamotrigine are first-line recommended treatments for new onset partial seizures and as a first- or second-line treatment for generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of the results for outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability and may assist in informing a choice between the two drugs.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, remission and first seizure with lamotrigine compared to carbamazepine when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

The first searches for this review were run in 1997. For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (17 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 17 October 2016) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 17 October 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures comparing monotherapy with either carbamazepine or lamotrigine.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to withdrawal of allocated treatment and our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post-randomisation, time to six-month, 12-month and 24-month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

We included 13 studies in this review. Individual participant data were available for 2572 participants out of 3394 eligible individuals from nine out of 13 trials: 78% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes a HR < 1 indicated an advantage for lamotrigine. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were: time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), time to first seizure (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.37) and time to six-month remission (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94), showing a significant advantage for lamotrigine compared to carbamazepine for withdrawal but a significant advantage for carbamazepine compared to lamotrigine for first seizure and six-month remission. We found no difference between the drugs for time to 12-month remission (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07) or time to 24-month remission (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25), however only two trials followed up participants for more than one year so the evidence is limited. The results of this review are applicable mainly to individuals with partial onset seizures; 88% of included individuals experienced seizures of this type at baseline. Up to 50% of the limited number of individuals classified as experiencing generalised onset seizures at baseline may have had their seizure type misclassified, therefore we recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review for individuals with generalised onset seizures. The most commonly reported adverse events for both of the drugs across all of the included trials were dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and skin problems. The rate of adverse events was similar across the two drugs. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, however there is some evidence that the design choice of masked or open-label treatment may have influenced the withdrawal rates of the trials. Hence, we judged the quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment withdrawal to be moderate for individuals with partial onset seizures and low for individuals with generalised onset seizures. For efficacy outcomes (first seizure, remission), we judged the quality of evidence to be high for individuals with partial onset seizures and moderate for individuals with generalised onset seizures.

Authors' Conclusions

Lamotrigine was significantly less likely to be withdrawn than carbamazepine but the results for time to first seizure suggested that carbamazepine may be superior in terms of seizure control. A choice between these first-line treatments must be made with careful consideration. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with consideration of masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Association between use of pharmacokinetic-interacting drugs and effectiveness and safety of direct acting oral anticoagulants: nested case-control study [^1128JGzB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We demonstrate in this study higher risk of bleeding in DOAC‐treated patients, associated with concomitant use of verapamil or amiodarone. Risk was apparent specifically for dabigatran‐verapamil, dabigatran‐amiodarone, and rivaroxaban‐amiodarone combinations. A slightly increased risk was associated also with bisoprolol and a trend (which was not statistically significant) for an increased risk associated with clarithromycin. In addition, we have shown, for the first time in a population‐based study, significantly higher risk for CVA or systemic embolism in patients with AF, anticoagulated with DOACs that were concomitantly using phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, or levetiracetam.

The three DOACs differ in their elimination from the body. Clearance of dabigatran is only 20% by nonrenal pathways,(consisting of direct intestinal excretion and metabolism by CYP enzymes); nonrenal clearance of rivaroxaban is reported to be 65%; and apixaban nonrenal metabolism reports are between < 50%and 73%. In rivaroxaban and apixaban, CYP3A4 contributes 18% and 25% of the hepatic elimination, respectively. Dabigatran is not metabolized by CYP3A4. Efflux of all three DOACs was strongly inhibited in vitro in the presence of P‐gp inhibitors. Phase I studies reported pharmacokinetic drug‐drug interactions mediated by P‐gp alone for dabigatran; and interactions mediated by P‐gp with CYP3A4 enzymes for rivaroxaban and apixaban. Verapamil, and ketoconazole (P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors) increased dabigatran exposure by up to 2.5‐fold, and amiodarone (mainly P‐gp inhibitor) increased exposure of dabigatran 1.6‐fold; clarithromycin, ketoconazole (P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors), and ritonavir (which is mainly CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased exposure of rivaroxaban by 54%, 158%, and 153%, respectively. Apixaban exposure increased by 99% with co‐administration of ketoconazole, and by 40% with diltiazem (CYP3A4 inhibitor).

### Association between use of pharmacokinetic-interacting drugs and effectiveness and safety of direct acting oral anticoagulants: nested case-control study [^113AfNWf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

A notable strength of this study is the population‐based nature of the study with a relatively large number of DOAC users, from real‐world data, using a similar design to study the three DOACs. We had data on multiple covariates, and introduced them in the multivariable models. In addition, data on prescription fillings enabled us to censor patients if the prescription was not filled for more than 30 days.

In conclusion, we demonstrate in this nested case‐control study that concomitant prescription of DOACs with pharmacokinetic‐interacting drugs is associated with serious bleeding (verapamil and amiodarone) and with reduced effectiveness (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and levetiracetam). Future clinical studies with pharmacokinetic measurements should follow our results.
