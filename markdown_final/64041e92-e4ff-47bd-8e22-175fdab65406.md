## Question

write a plan for ureteroscopy of left UPJ stone include discussion of risk and expectation for ureteral stent

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a plan for ureteroscopy of a left UPJ stone with an explicit, stepwise discussion of the risks and expectations for a ureteral stent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about preoperative assessment and optimization. Then, I should delineate intraoperative approach and laser technique. Next, I will define stent omission versus placement criteria and reconcile them with guideline-based and observational data. After that, I should map postoperative pathways for both stented and unstented patients, including stent dwell time, removal strategy, symptom management, and complication avoidance. Finally, I will risk-stratify example scenarios, specify documentation and follow-up, and cross-check each step with guidelines and key studies to ensure internal consistency and accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the preoperative planning elements. For a suspected UPJ stone, non-contrast CT is appropriate to confirm size, exact location, and assess hydronephrosis; I should also consider whether there is concomitant fixed UPJ obstruction, in which case renography may be relevant pre- or post-definitive stone management, though for routine URS the CT suffices today. I need to check urine studies and labs: urinalysis, urine culture with treatment of any infection before surgery, CBC if clinically indicated, and serum creatinine to document baseline renal function. Regarding antithrombotics, I should verify whether they can be safely held; if not, flexible ureteroscopy remains preferred in high thrombotic risk scenarios per EAU guidance, with careful bleeding risk mitigation. General anesthesia is standard, though spinal can be acceptable in selected patients, but I should ensure airway and positioning considerations are addressed in advance [^114HuFnn].

> Next, I should review stone factors that influence stent decisions. Larger stone burden, proximal/UPJ location, and intraoperative impaction with edema tend to increase the probability of stent placement. Wait, let me verify whether UPJ location alone mandates a stent; it does not, but it increases the likelihood that stenting will be needed due to higher rates of edema, impaction, and instrument manipulation. Predictors from CROES and a statewide predictive model include impacted stones, longer operative time, larger stone size, solitary kidney, anticoagulant use, intraoperative complications, and UPJ location, all of which increase stent use across practices, though individual surgeon variation is substantial and materially affects stent rates [^114x7juE] [^1114m2D8].

> Hold on, before committing to URS, I should counsel about alternatives and expected outcomes. URS generally achieves higher single-procedure stone-free rates than SWL but carries higher overall complication rates; SWL is less invasive but often needs retreatment. Serious complications in pragmatic randomized comparisons are low and similar between pathways. When patients decline URS or when URS is less feasible, SWL remains an option, with a shared decision process that includes likelihood of retreatment and anesthesia considerations. This framework helps anchor informed consent while setting expectations for potential stent placement if URS is chosen for a proximal/UPJ stone [^117Lh2jo] [^114HASrJ] [^112EXPQ5].

> I will now examine the intraoperative plan. Flexible ureteroscopy is preferred for UPJ stones due to the need for deflection and proximal access; I should maintain low-pressure irrigation to reduce infectious risk and consider active fragment extraction only under direct endoscopic vision. Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy remains standard, with dusting versus basketing decided by stone size and composition; major laser-related complications are uncommon in contemporary series. If I anticipate numerous instrument passes or need for efficient repeated access, I may use a ureteral access sheath, but wait — a moment ago I almost stated that an access sheath "mandates" a stent; more precisely, sheath use and any ureteral dilation strongly favor stent placement given ureteral wall stretch/trauma and edema, rather than absolutely mandating it in every case, and I should document the rationale intraoperatively.

> Let me now define explicit stent omission criteria. The AUA/ES 2016 guideline supports considering stent omission after URS for ureteral stones when all of the following are met: no suspected ureteric injury, no stricture or anatomic impediment, a normal contralateral kidney, no renal functional impairment, and no planned second-look procedure. I should confirm one more nuance I initially left incomplete: normal renal function means a normal or stable creatinine for the patient, with unobstructed drainage at the end of the case — earlier I truncated that thought and need to correct it here. If any intraoperative ureteral injury occurs, stenting is recommended; in delayed-diagnosed incomplete ureteral injuries, the AUA Urotrauma guideline also advises attempting stenting. Beyond injury, factors that tip toward stenting include impacted stone with significant edema, larger stone burden with residual fragments, ureteral dilation or sheath use, prolonged operative time, solitary kidney or compromised renal function, and staged procedures; observational CROES data suggest fewer postoperative complications with stents in higher-risk settings, though this evidence is low quality and should be integrated with guideline principles and intraoperative judgment [^111Bjkv2] [^114x7juE].

> If I omit a stent, I need to ensure a structured postoperative plan. Patients should have clear return precautions for pain, fever, or urinary difficulty, and ideally a 24–48 hour check-in because the risk of unplanned visits is modestly higher without a stent based on meta-analytic data. I should double-check imaging strategy: routine early imaging after uncomplicated URS is not universally necessary and may be done selectively for symptoms or complicating factors; however, many contemporary practices still order imaging within 6 months, and a substantial fraction of those studies prompt management changes, especially when preoperative hydronephrosis was present. Thus, selective early imaging after stent omission is reasonable if there were risk factors like impaction, dilation, perforation, or persistent symptoms, while broader surveillance can be deferred to later intervals for uncomplicated cases [^115WvfNM] [^113E4gfA].

> If I place a stent, I should specify size, dwell time, and removal method explicitly. For most patients, a 6 Fr double-J stent balances patency with symptom burden, whereas 7 Fr may be preferred if edema or trauma was significant; length is tailored to patient height. I should confirm recommended duration: the AUA/ES framework supports shorter 3–7 day dwell times after uncomplicated cases, while the EAU often suggests 7–14 days for more complex scenarios; recent systematic data comparing different dwell times show no clear difference in aggregated postprocedure-related events overall, implying dwell time should be individualized to operative complexity and patient risk, with a bias toward shorter durations when safe. Removal can be via an extraction string for reliable patients or cystoscopic removal without a string; both approaches are acceptable and should be chosen based on adherence, comfort, and local workflow [^111PWunk] [^113pA2so].

> I should prepare patients for stent-related symptoms and offer proactive management. Common issues include flank pain, urgency, frequency, dysuria, and hematuria, usually peaking within the first week and improving thereafter; alpha blockers and antimuscarinics together reduce stent symptom burden better than either alone, and NSAIDs can reduce pain, including after stent removal. Daily symptom surveys in contemporary cohorts corroborate the transient but meaningful impact on quality of life, which I should acknowledge in counseling and work planning for the immediate postoperative days. Let me reconsider one point: while symptom prevalence estimates vary by series, the pattern of peak at days 2–5 and gradual improvement by a week is consistent and helps set realistic expectations [^114wob3M] [^113QYLBN].

> But wait, I need to ensure we minimize serious stent-related harms. Encrustation risks increase substantially beyond 2–4 weeks, so short dwell times and reliable removal systems are key. Forgotten stents can lead to severe encrustation, infection, and a need for multimodal endoscopic or percutaneous removal, often staged; creating a removal "safety net" with tracking, reminders, and documented plans reduces this risk. Migration, UTI, and obstruction can occur and warrant prompt evaluation; explicit return precautions for fever, escalating flank pain, or inability to void are essential parts of discharge education [^111VYmsi] [^1118PveB].

> Next, I should review imaging and follow-up after stent removal. Transient flank pain from ureteral spasm in the first 24–48 hours is common and typically self-limited. Imaging strategy should be risk-adapted: for uncomplicated URS with complete clearance, routine immediate imaging is not mandatory; for complicated cases — impacted stones, dilation, perforation, persistent symptoms — selective early imaging is prudent, and in many practices, post-URS imaging within 6 months leads to clinically meaningful management changes for a notable subset of patients. A 4–6 week non-contrast CT or ultrasound can be considered to confirm stone-free status when residual fragments were suspected or when symptoms persist, and stone analysis plus metabolic evaluation are appropriate for recurrent stone formers [^113E4gfA] [^117FKJ94].

> I will now risk-stratify example scenarios to make the stent decision concrete. In a high-risk case such as a 12 mm impacted left UPJ stone with 90-minute operative time and required dilation, stenting with a 6 Fr stent for roughly 5–10 days is appropriate given multiple risk factors for postoperative obstruction and ureteral edema; CROES predictors and the omission criteria both support stenting here. In a moderate-risk case like an 8 mm non-impacted UPJ stone with 45-minute time and no dilation, stenting is reasonable but omission could be considered if all AUA omission criteria are strictly met and the patient is reliable, with clear return precautions and selective early follow-up. In a low-risk case such as a 5 mm UPJ stone cleared in 30 minutes without dilation or injury and normal contralateral function, stent omission is reasonable per guideline criteria, with attention to symptom-triggered follow-up. I should double-check that UPJ location alone is not an absolute indication; correct, it is not, but it increases the probability of stent need in real-world practice and in prediction models [^114x7juE] [^1114m2D8].

> To synthesize evidence-based recommendations, I should emphasize selective stenting rather than routine placement after URS for ureteral stones. Benefits of stenting include reduced complications in higher-risk contexts and potentially fewer unplanned visits when omission criteria are not fully met; harms include meaningful symptom burden and the logistics of removal. Omission of stents reduces dysuria and operative time but modestly increases the risk of unplanned visits, reinforcing the need for careful selection and safety-net follow-up. For duration, shorter dwell times after uncomplicated URS are favored, individualizing longer durations to edema, injury, residual fragments, or planned staged procedures. This balanced approach aligns guideline statements with contemporary observational and meta-analytic data while leaving room for surgeon judgment and patient preference [^111Bjkv2] [^115WvfNM] [^111PWunk] [^117Lh2jo].

> I need to ensure meticulous documentation and precise patient instructions. The operative note should record stone clearance status, any ureteral injury grading or mucosal trauma, decision rationale for stent placement or omission, and stent details including size, length, and planned removal date; stating the omission criteria were met, when applicable, strengthens the record. Discharge instructions should specify activity as tolerated with brief lifting limits, hydration goals, scheduled medications including an alpha blocker, NSAID, and anticholinergic as needed, and explicit warning signs such as fever above 38.3°C, escalating flank pain, inability to void, or gross hematuria with clots triggering immediate contact or ED evaluation. A scheduled stent removal plan with reminders reduces the risk of a forgotten stent, and a 24–48 hour check-in supports early detection of problems whether a stent was placed or omitted [^111Bjkv2] [^111VYmsi].

> Finally, let me verify that the overall flow is internally consistent and guideline-concordant. Preoperative optimization, flexible URS with Ho:YAG lithotripsy, real-time decision-making on access sheath and dilation, and a selective stenting framework anchored to omission criteria and intraoperative findings all align with AUA/ES and EAU guidance. I corrected my earlier overstatement that access sheath use "mandates" a stent; instead, it strongly favors stenting due to anticipated edema, and I clarified the previously truncated statement on "normal renal function" by explicitly referencing creatinine stability and unobstructed drainage. The postoperative pathways, dwell time individualization, symptom management, complication prevention, and selective imaging strategy reflect current evidence and practice patterns, with transparent acknowledgment of where data are observational or low certainty [^111Bjkv2] [^114wob3M] [^112tt3gH] [^117FKJ94].

Ureteroscopy for a left UPJ stone is minimally invasive with **high stone-free rates** [^117Lh2jo] [^114HASrJ], but it carries risks of ureteral injury [^111kArWH], bleeding, infection, and a need for secondary procedures [^112tt3gH]. Ureteral stents are commonly placed postoperatively [^114x7juE] [^111Bjkv2] to prevent obstruction and facilitate healing, but they **can cause discomfort** and urinary symptoms, and they require removal [^113QYLBN]. Stent placement is indicated [^114x7juE] for ureteral injury, significant edema, a large stone burden, a solitary kidney, or renal insufficiency [^111VYmsi]; when placed, stents are typically left for 1–2 weeks. Patients should be counseled on stent-related symptoms [^113QYLBN] and the need for follow-up imaging to confirm stone clearance and ureteral patency [^117FKJ94].

---

## Preoperative evaluation and preparation

Preoperative assessment includes imaging with **non-contrast CT** to confirm stone size, location, and anatomy; diuretic renography is considered if UPJ obstruction is suspected [^114HVPuw]. Laboratory evaluation should include CBC, renal function, coagulation profile, and urine culture. Patients must be counseled on the procedure, risks, benefits, alternatives, and potential stent-related symptoms [^111Bjkv2]. General anesthesia is standard.

---

## Intraoperative technique

- **Patient positioning**: Lithotomy position [^115hAEzm].

- **Ureteral access**: Cystoscopic insertion of a guidewire into the renal pelvis.

- **Ureteroscopy**: Advance a flexible ureteroscope to the UPJ under direct visualization [^114exjbU].

- **Stone fragmentation**: Use holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy to fragment the stone [^112tt3gH].

- **Stone extraction**: Remove fragments with a basket or allow spontaneous passage [^114exjbU].

- **Ureteral stent placement**: Place a double-J stent if indicated (see below) [^111Bjkv2] [^114x7juE].

---

## Indications for ureteral stent placement

- **Ureteral injury**: Mucosal injury, perforation, or avulsion [^1169TVjd].

- **Significant edema**: Ureteral swelling causing obstruction [^111VYmsi].

- **Large stone burden**: Multiple or large fragments [^114x7juE].

- **Solitary kidney or renal insufficiency**: To ensure drainage [^111Bjkv2].

- **Prolonged operative time**: Increased risk of edema or injury [^114x7juE].

---

## Risks and complications of ureteroscopy

- **Ureteral injury**: Mucosal injury, perforation, or avulsion [^111kArWH] [^114HASrJ].

- **Bleeding**: Hematuria or rare significant bleeding [^114HASrJ].

- **Infection**: UTI or sepsis [^114HASrJ].

- **Residual fragments**: May require secondary procedures [^1122gTUv].

- **Anesthesia-related risks**: Standard surgical risks.

## Risks and complications of ureteral stent placement

Stent-related symptoms, such as pain, dysuria, frequency, urgency, and hematuria, are **common** [^113QYLBN] [^114wob3M]. Infectious complications include UTI or bacteriuria. Device-related issues, such as migration or encrustation, may necessitate additional procedures [^111VYmsi]. A forgotten stent can cause **significant morbidity** if not removed promptly [^1118PveB].

---

## Postoperative care and follow-up

Postoperative management includes pain control; NSAIDs and optional alpha-blockers can help with stent-related symptoms [^114wob3M]. Antibiotics are prescribed as a short course only when indicated. If a stent is placed, **removal typically occurs 1–2 weeks** postoperatively. Follow-up imaging [^117FKJ94] with ultrasound or CT is obtained to confirm stone clearance and ureteral patency [^113E4gfA].

---

## Patient expectations

Patients can expect high success, with **stone-free rates exceeding 90%** [^112tt3gH] [^117Lh2jo]. Stent-related urinary symptoms are common but temporary [^113QYLBN]. Secondary procedures may be needed if residual fragments remain [^114HASrJ]. Recovery is typically rapid, with **return to normal activities within a few days**.

---

Ureteroscopy for a left UPJ stone is **effective and safe** [^113cZtek] [^117Lh2jo]. Stents help prevent obstruction and aid healing [^114x7juE] [^111Bjkv2], and patients should be informed about stent symptoms and the need for follow-up [^117FKJ94] [^111VYmsi].

### Risks and benefits of postoperative double-J stent placement after ureteroscopy: Results from the Clinical Research Office of Endourological Society ureteroscopy global study [^114x7juE]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

This study investigates the common practice of double-J stent placement after stone removal by ureteroscopy (URS), which is recommended in many cases but debatable in others. The research examines the risks and benefits of postoperative double-J stent placement in URS stone treatment procedures.

The Clinical Research Office of Endourological Society (CROES) URS study is a prospective, observational, international multicenter study. It includes patients who are candidates for URS as a primary treatment or after failure of prior treatment for ureteral and renal stones. Baseline, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected. Predictors and outcomes of postoperative stent placement were analyzed using inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment of the relationship between a double-J stent placement and outcomes, such as complications, readmission (including retreatment), and length of hospital stay.

Significant predictors of postoperative double-J stent placement in URS treatment of ureteral stones included intraoperative complications, impacted stones, operation time, stone burden, age, the presence of a solitary kidney, and stone-free rate. In renal stone treatment, the predictors were identified as operation time, age, preoperative stent placement, anticoagulant use, the presence of a solitary kidney, and intraoperative complications. In both ureteral and renal stone treatment groups, postoperative placement of a double-J stent resulted in significantly fewer postoperative complications (p < 0.001) compared with patients who did not receive a stent.

### Efficacy and safety of ho:YAG laser lithotripsy for ureteroscopic removal of proximal and distal ureteral calculi [^112tt3gH]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The role of routine postoperative ureteral stenting after ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy remains a topic of debate. Stent-related morbidities, such as bladder irritation and mild back discomfort during urination, have been shown to affect postoperative quality of life. However, ureteral stenting is thought to prevent postoperative urinary sepsis by avoiding sudden ureteral obstruction caused by calculus fragments, blood clots, or ureteral mucosal edema. Clear indications for stenting include ureteral injury or stricture, solitary kidney, renal insufficiency, or a large residual stone burden. Several prospective randomized controlled trials comparing non-stented versus stented ureteroscopic lithotripsy reported similar results. At our institution, ureteral stenting following uncomplicated ureteric procedures is not routine. However, a transient ureteral stent is placed in all patients who undergo ureteral dilation through the insertion of an access sheath or present with large and/or impacted calculi, regardless of location. This accounts for the high postoperative stenting rates (87.7% vs. 83.8%, respectively).

Ureteroscopic (URS) and laser lithotripsy have proven safe even when extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is likely to fail or is contraindicated. Major complications during the procedure are uncommon. Minor intraoperative or postoperative complications range from 0 to 13% and primarily include pain or urinary tract infection. Ho:YAG laser-related complications are as low as 1%. No major complications were observed in the series examined.

### Quality of life impact and recovery after ureteroscopy and stent insertion: Insights from daily surveys in STENTS [^113QYLBN]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

All participants in the nested STENTS cohort were administered the following questionnaires that assessed pain, urinary symptoms, and the manner and degree to which these symptoms impact the patient's life (interference and bother):

1. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form, which has been used widely in pain studies, assessed pain intensity and pain interference.
2. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of pain intensity and pain interference allowed for comparing scores to population norms.
3. The Urinary Score of the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ), an instrument developed for SAS over a 1-month recall period, assessed urinary symptoms and bother.
4. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network Symptom Index (LURN SI-10) assessed urinary symptoms and bother.

We intentionally administered questionnaires that assessed the same construct in order to determine potential differences in the measured experience. We acknowledge that the USSQ covers other domains besides urinary symptoms, but given the importance of characterizing pain intensity and pain interference as accurately as possible, being able to compare to population norms, and our desire for a comprehensive body map that includes genitalia, it was decided to incorporate specific pain instruments used in the broader community of medicine. This decision followed several discussions with a multidisciplinary field, including experts within pain medicine, pain psychology, and psychometricians well-versed in the development of patient-reported outcomes.

### Optimal stenting duration following ureteroscopy and nephrolithotomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PWunk]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from its inception to October 2023 for trials that compared varying stenting durations in individuals who had undergone either ureteroscopy or nephrolithotomy procedures.

Our search strategy was: ("stent duration" OR "stenting duration" OR stenting OR "stent dwell time") AND (ureteroscop* OR "ureteroscopic surgery" OR nephrolithotomy OR "percutaneous nephrolithotomy" OR PNL OR PCNL OR nephrolithiasis OR lithotripsy) AND ("unplanned visit" OR ED OR "ED visit" OR "clinic visit" OR "emergency department visit" OR "post-procedure related events" OR PRE OR PREs). The references from all included studies and previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses were also searched manually for any additional studies. The prospective meta-analysis protocol was registered on PROSPERO under protocol CRD42023465684.

- **Eligibility criteria for study selection**: We included (1) randomized trials (RCTs) or non-randomized cohorts (non-RCTs); (2) comparing the duration for which the ureteral stent was retained in each patient following ureteroscopy or nephrolithotomy procedures; (3) in adult patients (≥ 18 years old). In addition, studies were included only if they reported any of the clinical outcomes of interest.

### Imaging after ureteroscopy: Practice patterns, patient adherence and impact on subsequent management in an urban academic hospital system [^117FKJ94]. Urology (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate practice patterns of post-ureteroscopy (URS) imaging, this study aimed to assess predictors of imaging order, type, and completion, as well as analyze the impact on patient management. A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent URS for nephrolithiasis at a single institution between May 2020 and May 2021. Patient demographics, clinical and operative characteristics, and surgeons' years in practice were reviewed. Post-URS imaging studies from less than 6 months post-operative were also examined. Changes in patient management were defined as additional imaging tests ordered or subsequent unplanned surgery. Patient, provider, and surgical variables were compared between those who had imaging ordered and those who did not.

A total of 289 patients underwent URS, with 234 (81.0%) having post-operative imaging ordered and 147 (62.8%) completing them. Baseline demographics, stone, and surgical variables were similar among those who did and did not have imaging ordered and among patients who completed imaging and those who did not. Pre-operative hydronephrosis was associated with the ordering of post-operative imaging (OR = 4.08, P = 0.01). Urologists in practice for less than 5 years were more likely to order post-operative imaging compared to those with more than 5 years in practice (< 5 years: 90.6%, 15+ years: 53.7%; P < .001). Management was changed for 52 out of 147 (35.4%) patients who completed imaging; additional imaging was ordered for 38 patients (25.9%), and a second, unplanned surgery was performed for 14 (9.5%).

The main predictive factor for ordering post-URS imaging was surgeons' practice experience.

### Iatrogenic upper urinary tract injuries during ureteroscopy for urolithiasis: A comprehensive review on incidence, mechanisms and preventative strategies [^111kArWH]. Nature Reviews Urology (2025). Low credibility.

The incidence of urolithiasis is increasing globally, with a prevalence of 13% in North America and 9% in Europe. Ureteroscopy is a minimally invasive approach for treating conditions affecting the upper urinary tract, including urolithiasis, for which its efficacy and safety is well recognized. There is a risk of complications associated with ureteroscopy, including iatrogenic mechanical ureteric injuries. These injuries are multifactorial in nature, with ureteroscopes and auxiliary endoscopic equipment having an important role, in addition to patient and stone factors. Excessive friction and insertion forces during ureteroscope and ureteric access sheath insertion, apparatus malfunction, or thermal injuries during laser lithotripsy might cause injury to the upper urinary tract.

Ureteric avulsion is a serious event, which necessitates further intervention such as ureteric reimplantation or nephrectomy. Ureteric mucosal injuries can be managed with a period of ureteric stenting, although stent-related symptoms can be challenging for patients. The ability of endoscopic equipment to injure the ureter is an area that requires further study to reduce incidence and minimize patient morbidity. In this article, we review the operative mechanisms that contribute to iatrogenic mechanical ureteric injuries and discuss preventative strategies.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, PART I [^111yjKAT]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline is intended to provide a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. The summary presented herein represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline. Please refer to Part II for an in-depth discussion of patients presenting with ureteral or renal stones.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review of the literature (search dates 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of strong, moderate, or conditional recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as clinical principles and expert opinions when insufficient evidence existed.

- **Results**: The panel identified 12 adult index patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional index patients were also created to describe pediatric and pregnant patients with such stones. With these patients in mind, guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in identifying optimal management.

Proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This guideline is intended for use in clinical settings.

### Impact of intraoperative digital stone measurement on surgeon decision making in ureteroscopy [^112b8Gdc]. Urology (2025). Low credibility.

To assess the clinical use of a novel software capable of accurately measuring stone fragments in real-time and its impact on intraoperative decision-making, adult patients undergoing flexible ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy for renal stones were prospectively enrolled. Intraoperative measurements of fragments were performed live and reported to surgeons upon request during surgery. After each case, surgeons were surveyed about the reasons for taking measurements and how the measurements impacted their intraoperative decisions.

Among 106 patients undergoing ureteroscopy, surgeons took an average of 2.4 intraoperative measurements per case. The software was deployed successfully in all cases.

- **Reasons for intraoperative measurements**: Surgeons' most frequent reason for taking intraoperative measurements was to determine whether post-lithotripsy fragments were extractable (52%). They also requested measurements to assess stone size (30%) and extractability (34%) before lithotripsy.

- **Impact on intraoperative plans**: Based on stone measurements, surgeons changed intraoperative plans in 28% of cases, opting instead to continue lithotripsy (11%), extract fragments (14%), or leave fragments behind for passage (3%).

- **Surgeon feedback**: Surgeons rated the ability to take intraoperative measurements as "very helpful" (61%) or "somewhat helpful" (38%). The time burden of taking measurements affected procedural efficiency in 3% of cases.

The ability to take stone measurements during flexible ureteroscopy changed surgeons' intraoperative stone management decisions in 28% of cases. Integrating digital measurement tools may improve surgical decision-making processes.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to technical considerations, the AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering omitting ureteral stenting following ureteroscopy in patients with ureteral stones meeting all of the following criteria:

- **No suspected ureteric injury**: During ureteroscopy, there should be no suspected ureteric injury.
- **No evidence of ureteral stricture**: There should be no evidence of ureteral stricture or other anatomical impediments to stone fragment clearance.
- **Normal contralateral kidney**: The contralateral kidney should be normal.
- **No renal functional impairment**: There should be no renal functional impairment.
- **Secondary ureteroscopy procedure is not planned**: A secondary ureteroscopy procedure should not be planned.

### Routine placement of ureteral stents is unnecessary after ureteroscopy for urinary calculi [^112PMSdB]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

To report a matched comparison of patients with and without stenting after ureteroscopy for calculi, including middle or proximal ureteral and renal calculi. The elimination of routine stenting after ureteroscopy would prevent stent pain, minimize the need for re-instrumentation, and reduce costs — provided that efficacy and safety are not diminished.

Of 318 patients who underwent ureteroscopy, 81 (25%) did not have a ureteral stent placed. Of those, 51 were suitable for analysis and included patients with distal ureteral (n = 22), middle or proximal ureteral (n = 11), and renal calculi (n = 18). This cohort was matched to a stented group by stone size and location.

The preoperative characteristics of the groups were similar. A stone-free rate of 86% and 94% was achieved in the stented and non-stented groups, respectively [P = 0.32]. Complications in the non-stented group were less frequent (flank pain in 3 and postoperative nausea in 1) than in the stented group (hospital visits for flank pain in 12, persistent nausea and vomiting in 1, sepsis in 1, perinephric hematoma in 1, and urinary retention in 1) [total of 4 versus 16, P = 0.025].

Ureteroscopy for distal ureteral stones without ureteral stent placement has been previously described. Our experience expands to include the elimination of stent placement after ureteroscopy for middle or proximal ureteral (22%) and renal (35%) calculi. Our data suggest that after ureteroscopies with short operative times and minimal ureteral trauma, ureteral stents may not be necessary, even if proximal.

### Emergency ureteroscopic removal of ureteral calculi after first colic attack: Is there any advantage [^111FSqVj]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To comparatively evaluate the efficacy of ureteroscopic stone treatment immediately after the first colic attack and in an electively planned manner, a study was conducted involving a total of 145 patients. These patients underwent semirigid ureteroscopic removal of obstructive ureteral calculi using two different approaches: Group 1 included 69 patients, and Group 2 included 76 patients.

- **Methods**:
	- The 69 patients in Group 1 were treated with appropriate medical therapy for a period of ≥ 7 days for colic pain and subsequently underwent either semirigid ureteroscopy or pneumatic lithotripsy in a planned manner.
	- The 76 patients in Group 2 underwent semirigid ureteroscopy immediately after the first colic attack.
	- The stone-free status, auxiliary procedures, and complications were evaluated between the groups using the Mann-Whitney U test, while Fisher's exact test was used for qualitative data.

- **Results**:
	- Of the 145 patients who underwent semirigid ureteroscopy, the mean stone size was 11.80 ± 3.95 mm in Group 1 and 8.32 ± 2.08 mm in Group 2.
	- No major complications were experienced during or after the procedure.
	- The stone-free rate was 87% in Group 1 and 90.7% in Group 2.
	- The mean readmission rate to the emergency department for the management of a colic attack was 3.03 ± 2.84 in Group 1; notably, no patients in Group 2 required readmission.

- **Conclusion**:
	- Ureteroscopic stone removal immediately after the first colic attack in cases of obstructive ureteral stones proved to be safe and effective. It offers the significant advantage of providing immediate stone fragmentation and alleviation of acute onset colic pain that causes extreme discomfort.

### Concomitant percutaneous nephrolithotomy and transperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction complicated by stones [^112kyTaT]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction and stones can coexist. Therapeutic controversy exists regarding their ideal management. We present our experience of combining percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) with laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) in patients with UPJ obstruction with multiple secondary stones in the same session or in a staged manner.

- **Patients and method**: From November 2006 to April 2008, ten patients underwent PNL with LP at our institution. Two of these patients had re-obstruction and stones after PNL and endopyelotomy. All patients had multiple calyceal and pelvic calculi (> 10), with sizes ranging from 3 to 24 mm. The mean age of patients was 33 years (17–55). PNL was performed in a standard manner and was followed by laparoscopic pyeloplasty.

- **Result**: Complete stone clearance was achieved in all cases by PNL. The procedure was staged in two patients due to the presence of infected hydronephrosis. Nine patients underwent dismembered pyeloplasty, and in one, Fengerplasty was done. Reduction of a baggy pelvis was required in three cases. Mean operative time was 3.9 hours (3–5 hours). Postoperatively, the nephrostomy was kept for an average of 2 days (1–3 days). The drain was removed after an average of 3.5 days (3–5 days). Mean hospital stay was 5.2 days (5–7 days). None of the patients required a blood transfusion. The stent was removed after 4 weeks. At 6 months, patients were stone-free on ultrasound and showed good drainage on renal scan. One year follow-up is available for five patients, which shows a stone-free status and good drainage across UPJ.

- **Conclusion**: Concomitant PNL and laparoscopic pyeloplasty are feasible.

### Outcomes of ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stent for pregnancy with urolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ctYSB]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Following the failure of initial conservative treatment, the insertion of a D-J stent might be a safe choice. Serial stenting for pregnancy with urolithiasis is commonly used in clinics, although there are not many relevant studies. After scanning articles over the past 30 years, only six related articles were included in this meta-analysis. Historically, serial stenting was considered the gold standard of surgical treatment for pregnancy with urolithiasis as it was less invasive and could be performed under local anesthesia. This amount of anesthetic and the reduced level of surgical trauma is considered to be safer for the fetus. Our meta-analysis also indicated that this treatment relieves obstruction and pain while maintaining the pregnancy.

However, there are still some negative opinions. On the one hand, serial stenting may be poorly tolerated by some pregnant women as it can cause pain and reduce the quality of life. On the other hand, the insertion of a D-J stent is a temporary measure; such stents require regular replacement. Furthermore, the increased concentration of calcium and urate in urine during pregnancy can lead to a tendency for encrustation; thus, these invasive operations need to be performed more frequently. An increased frequency of such invasive operations also leads to an increase in complications, including UTI and stent migration; there is also an increase in cost. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled ORs of complications after serial stenting was 45%. However, the pooled ORs for serious complications (Clavien-Dindo III-V) after s

### Stent encrustation or fragmentation? A case report of post stent removal encrustation in postpartum woman and literature review [^116UxHM5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

John S. Lam suggested stopping further procedures to avoid damaging the ureter if the patient complains of pain or the stent does not move easily. They considered that a slight coating was capable of locking the distal coils together to prevent uncoiling. Forced stent removal can result in ureteral injury or even ureteral avulsion. It is accepted that removing a severely encrusted ureteral stent is a difficult problem for most urologists. Although numerous articles showed tips and tricks for solving this problem, it needs to be addressed through multiple approaches, including ESWL, ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and open surgery. Any associated stone burden must be addressed during the operative session.

Due to various complications caused by long-term stent indwelling, surgical management with ureteroscopy is now an accepted, reasonable alternative for pregnant women. It is reported that ureteroscopy has been shown to be both feasible and safe during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, with similar stone-free rates to non-pregnant patients. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in the incidence of ureteric injury or UTI in pregnant patients compared to non-pregnant patients. Moreover, the post-procedural ureteral stent indwelling time is much shorter than delaying definitive stone management until after delivery. If there are any contraindications of ureteroscopy and long-term ureteral stent indwelling must be performed instead, a reasonable follow-up strategy should be developed.

### Management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in adults [^114HVPuw]. Nature Reviews Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is characterized by impaired flow of urine from the renal pelvis to the ureter. Untreated disease can result in renal impairment, making effective management crucial. A combination of CT imaging and diuretic renography is typically used for diagnosis.

- **Ct imaging**: It is the investigation of choice for obtaining anatomical information about UPJO and can help to identify potential causes.

- **Diuretic renography**: This is best for providing functional information about UPJO.

A variety of open and minimally invasive surgical techniques are available for the treatment of UPJO. Traditionally, open pyeloplasty has been the standard of care, but minimally invasive surgical techniques have become increasingly popular.

- **Endopyelotomy**: This has a lower success rate than other modalities (42–90% depending on the approach) but is associated with reduced pain and shorter convalescence.

- **Laparoscopic pyeloplasty and robot-assisted pyeloplasty**: These have similar success rates to open pyeloplasty (> 90%), with the additional advantages of significantly reduced morbidity and shorter convalescence. More long-term outcome data for minimally invasive surgical techniques are awaited.

### Outcomes of ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stent for pregnancy with urolithiasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114wtu6d]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

To investigate the outcomes of internal ureteral stents in comparison with ureteroscopy (URS) for pregnant women with urolithiasis, relevant studies published from January 1980 to June 2022 were identified through systematic literature searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library.

A total of 499 studies were initially identified. We included pregnant women in any stage of gestation who underwent double-J (D-J) stent insertion only or ureteroscopy for the treatment of urolithiasis. For a study to be included, the number of participants needed to exceed 10. This systematic review was registered on the PROSPERO website (Reference: CRD42020195607).

A total of 25 studies were identified, with 131 cases undergoing serial stenting and 789 cases undergoing URS. The pooled operative success rate was 97% for D-J stent insertion and 99% for URS. Only a few patients passed stones spontaneously after serial D-J stenting. The pooled stone-free rate (SFR) in URS operations was about 91%. For internal ureteral stent therapy, the rate of normal fertility outcomes was 99%, although the pooled incidence of complications was approximately 45%. For the group receiving URS treatment, the rate of normal fertility outcome was 99% and the pooled incidence of complications was approximately 1%. However, the pooled rate of premature birth and abortion was similar between the two groups (< 1%); the rate of serious complications was also similar between the two groups.

### Is stent placement necessary after uncomplicated ureteroscopy for removal of impacted ureteral stones [^111Ybpub]. Journal of Endourology (2010). Low credibility.

Ureteral stent placement after ureteroscopic lithotripsy has some advantages and disadvantages. In this randomized study, the necessity of ureteral stent placement after uncomplicated ureteroscopy for impacted ureteral stones was assessed.

- **Materials and methods**: Between 2005 and 2007, 60 evaluable patients were equally randomized to groups with and without stents. Patients underwent ureteroscopic pneumatic lithotripsy for ureteral stones. The operation was completed with or without stent placement according to the randomization order. Excretory urography was performed 3 months after the procedure. All stents were cystoscopically removed at the third postoperative week. Sociodemographic and clinical variables (age, sex, stone location, stone size, operative time, hospital stay, narcotic and non-narcotic analgesic use) and postoperative complications (fever, pain delaying discharge, emergency department visit, urinary retention, stent-related irritative symptoms) were evaluated.

- **Results**: Mean stone size was not significantly different in both groups. Mean operative time was significantly longer in the stent group: 30.5 ± 9.6 vs. 43.7 ± 11.6 minutes. On the operation day and until postoperative day (POD) 5, narcotic (P = 0.004) and non-narcotic analgesic (P = not significant) use was more frequent in the no-stent group. At POD 5 and later, although narcotic and non-narcotic analgesic use were frequently necessary in the stent group, both were almost unnecessary in the no-stent patients. Stent-related irritative symptoms were overwhelmingly higher.

### Optimal stenting duration following ureteroscopy and nephrolithotomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113p5MCN]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Upon evaluation of PREs, our meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant disparities in postoperative visitations among patients with varying durations of ureteral stenting. This finding suggests that the length of stent placement may not be a decisive factor in the overall incidence of post-procedural complications when assessing the PREs collectively. Contrarily, a stratified analysis of individual complications revealed distinct variations in specific postoperative complications, underscoring the complexity of stent duration's impact on postoperative morbidity.

The high heterogeneity observed in this primary outcome (I² = 98%) can be attributed to methodological differences among the included studies, such as variability in follow-up duration and differences in the studied populations. When we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding the study by Banerjee et al, heterogeneity decreased to 78%, suggesting that this study was one of the main contributors to the variability in results. This finding reinforces the need for future standardized RCTs to directly evaluate the optimal stent duration in different clinical scenarios.

Regarding the increase of flank pain and hematuria associated with shorter stent durations, it is posited that this could be attributed to the more immediate and recent placement of the ureteral stent within the ureteral lumen. The ureteral stent resides within the lumen of the ureter, in contact with its mucosal lining. According to a prospective randomized study, after ureteral intervention, the ureter is expected to reach its maximum dilation.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, and more specifically the choice of procedure for renal stones, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend offering flexible ureteroscopy (even for stones larger than 2 cm) or shockwave lithotripsy if percutaneous nephrolithotomy is not an option. These guidelines recognize that there is a higher risk of requiring a follow-up procedure and placement of a ureteral stent.

### Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) versus ureteroscopic management for ureteric calculi [^114HASrJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Ureteral stones frequently cause renal colic and, if left untreated, can lead to obstructive uropathy. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and ureteroscopy, with or without intracorporeal lithotripsy, are the most common interventions used to treat ureteral stones. ESWL treatment is less invasive than ureteroscopy but has some limitations, such as a high retreatment rate, and it is not available in all centers. Recent advances in ureteroscopy have increased success rates and reduced complication rates.

- **Objectives**: To examine evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the outcomes of ESWL or ureteroscopy in the treatment of ureteric calculi.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to March 2011), CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, reference lists of articles, and abstracts from conference proceedings, all without language restriction.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs that compared ESWL with ureteroscopic retrieval of ureteric stones were included in this review. Study participants were adults with ureteric stones requiring intervention. Published and unpublished sources were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently assessed study quality, risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals.

### Impact of ureteral stenting in ureteroscopy [^114wob3M]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

We review new therapies and biomaterials designed to reduce ureteral stent symptoms in patients undergoing ureteroscopy.

- **Recent findings**: Pharmacologically, alpha blockers and antimuscarinics have been shown to have a synergistic effect and be more effective than either medication alone in reducing stent-related symptoms. Prestenting patients prior to ureteroscopy has been shown to be beneficial for patients with renal stones, offering a better stone-free rate and reduced complications, but not for ureteral stones. Stenting after use of a ureteral access sheath reduced complications and unscheduled emergency visits. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories have been shown to prevent pain after stent removal. Surveys showed that patients preferred to remove their own stents via dangle strings at home or undergo cystoscopic removal in the operating room with some type of anesthesia. New materials such as gel-based or biodegradable ureteral stents are being developed to deal with stent-related pain, encrustation, and infection. Antirefluxing stents eliminate vesicoureteric reflux in patients during voiding and may reduce symptoms of back and flank pain. Ureteral stents are involved in many procedures in urology, particularly kidney stone treatments.

- **Summary**: Advances in materials and medications will help improve the patient experience for those who receive a ureteral stent.

### Ureteric stent versus percutaneous nephrostomy for acute ureteral obstruction - clinical outcome and quality of life: a bi-center prospective study [^116unY92]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Over a two-year period, 75 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency room of two hospitals with an obstructing ureteral stone necessitating drainage were asked to participate in this study by an on-call urologist involved in the study. The estimated recruitment rate was 42%. This study is an Institutional Review Board-approved, bi-center, prospective study comparing the impact on quality of life (QoL) of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) and retrograde ureteral catheterization.

Patients were offered renal drainage when definitive therapy was not immediately available, was contraindicated, or when a two-stage procedure was considered a safer approach. Entry criteria included an obstructing ureteral stone with either fever (> 38°C), acute renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 60 ml/min), or intractable pain. Diagnosis of the obstructing ureteral stone was made by either a non-contrast CT or a combination of renal ultrasound and abdominal X-ray. Exclusion criteria were patients under 18 years old, pregnant women, and those with contraindications to either form of drainage (e.g. uncorrected coagulopathy excluding percutaneous drainage, hemodynamic instability precluding anesthesia required for double-J stent [DJS] placement, or abnormalities of the urinary tract). Patients received either a DJS or a PCN according to the surgeon's preference. Practical issues such as the availability of an operating room or the interventional radiologist often dictated the choice of drainage, particularly in patients with fever, as it is our policy to minimize time to drainage in this high-risk group.

### Ultrasound guided ureteroscopy for the definitive management of ureteral stones: a randomized, controlled trial [^112f1Dpr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Ureteroscopy is central to the surgical management of ureteral stones. Fluoroscopy is conventionally used for intraoperative guidance, although there is a growing effort to decrease the exposure of patients and staff to ionizing radiation. We developed a radiation-free approach to ureteroscopy using ultrasound guidance to manage ureteral stones. To our knowledge, we present the first randomized trial to study its safety and efficacy.

This single-center, randomized clinical trial, conducted from 2011 to 2013, enlisted patients who presented with symptomatic ureteral stones 8 mm or less without a significant ipsilateral stone burden. Patients were randomly assigned to ultrasound or fluoroscopic guided ureteroscopy after temporizing ureteral stent placement. Intraoperative ultrasound guidance was performed using real-time imaging with the transducer placed at the patient's flank to visualize the collecting system of the ipsilateral kidney. We compared operative time, stone size, stone-free status, and complication rates between the two groups.

A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study, with 25 per arm. There was no difference in stone size (5.9 vs. 5.7 mm), patient age (56 vs. 52 years), or body mass index (31 vs. 30 kg/m²) in the test group compared to controls. The ultrasound guidance cohort showed no significant difference in the stone-free rate (86% vs. 86%) or the complication rate (8% vs. 16%) compared to controls. Operative time was no longer in the ultrasound guidance cohort.

In this feasibility study, we found that ureteral stones managed with ultrasound-guided ureteroscopy had comparable outcomes to those managed with fluoroscopic guidance, without an increase in operative time or complications.

### Flexible ureteroscopy for treatment of upper urinary tract calculus [^115hAEzm]. Journal of Endourology (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this article is to present a step-by-step guide to flexible ureteroscopy (URS) for the treatment of upper urinary tract calculus. A preoperative evaluation of the patient, with a focus on comorbidities, is crucial for determining the type of stone procedure to be performed. This article details the steps involved in the operating room setup, patient positioning, gaining access to the upper urinary tract, performing flexible URS, conducting laser lithotripsy, extracting stone fragments using a basket, and placing a ureteral stent. The importance of clearing the ureter before performing flexible URS in the presence of a pre-existing ureteral stone is also emphasized.

### New concepts in the treatment of ureteral calculi [^112niEtZ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The management of patients with ureteral stones remains under debate in several areas. The ability to predict spontaneous passage has improved but remains imprecise, while the range of therapeutic options continues to widen. Excellent results can be obtained by both shockwave lithotripsy and ureteroscopic methods, with relatively minimal complications. Routine ureteral stenting is not warranted, whichever treatment is chosen. In the future, directly comparative studies should be designed to incorporate quality-of-life parameters rather than just stone-free status to improve our understanding of the effect of treatment decisions on patients.

### Seamless post-operative removal of JJ stents in the paediatric population: Securing the JJ stent to the tip of the urethral balloon catheter avoids a further operation [^116KXitK]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Low credibility.

In children, removal of a post-procedural JJ stent typically requires an additional cystoscopy under general anesthesia. This study describes a novel technique of securing the distal end of the ureteric stent to the tip of a balloon catheter at the end of the primary procedure. Once post-operative edema has subsided, the stent can be seamlessly removed in tandem with the balloon catheter. Remarkably, this can be performed on the ward by nursing staff, eliminating the need for general anesthesia or sedation. Our experience with the first 10 successive patients, aged between 1.6 and 16.3 years, demonstrates that this technique is safe, easy to learn, and well tolerated.

### What are the benefits and harms of ureteroscopy compared with shock-wave lithotripsy in the treatment of upper ureteral stones? A systematic review [^1122gTUv]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) and ureteroscopy (URS), with or without intracorporeal lithotripsy, are the most common treatments for upper ureteric stones. With advances in technology, it is unclear which treatment is most effective and/or safest.

The objective of this study was to systematically review literature reporting the benefits and harms of SWL and URS in the management of upper ureteric stones.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Databases including Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2000 to November 2014. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized controlled trials, and nonrandomized studies comparing any subtype or variation of URS and SWL were included. The primary benefit outcome was stone-free rate (SFR). The primary harm outcome was complications. Secondary outcomes included retreatment rate, need for secondary, and/or adjunctive procedures. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess RCTs, and an extended version was used to assess nonrandomized studies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to assess the quality of evidence.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Five thousand three hundred and eighty abstracts and 387 full-text articles were screened. Forty-seven studies met inclusion criteria; 19 (39.6%) were RCTs. No studies on children met inclusion criteria. URS and SWL were compared in 22 studies (4 RCTs, 1 quasi-randomized controlled trial, and 17 nonrandomized studies). Meta-analyses were inappropriate due to heterogeneity at the time of writing. SFR favored URS in 9/22 studies. Retreatment rates were high.

### Minimally invasive treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction: Optimizing outcomes with concomitant cost reduction [^114jaKcq]. Journal of Endourology (2006). Low credibility.

With the seemingly exponential increase in the use of minimally invasive techniques in urology, cost-benefit comparisons will continue to play a major part in establishing services and improving those that already exist. The management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction is a focus of significant attention. An effective way of optimizing the economy of management is to understand the implications in terms of the success of each mode of treatment. Subsequently, costing models should be developed and applied in large-scale multicenter studies with the aid of health economists. The long-term benefits can then be assessed by also including patients' perceived quality of life.

Economic assessment will not be enough to promote cost-effective practices. The take-up of any techniques will always be influenced not only by patient preference and surgeon expertise but also, perhaps ironically, by the way hospitals and surgeons are remunerated. In addition, the impact of the time taken to train a surgeon to carry out laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty competently may play a significant role. Until these issues are resolved, definitive recommendations for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction will continue to be made on an individual basis.

### Does omission of ureteral stents increase risk of unplanned return visit? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WvfNM]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to address the controversy surrounding post-ureteroscopy ureteral stent omission. Although omitting stents is associated with reduced postoperative discomfort, there are concerns regarding early obstruction. A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials were conducted to compare the risk of unplanned visits with versus without a stent following ureteroscopy for nephrolithiasis.

- **Materials and methods**: Randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing post-ureteroscopic stent omission versus placement, and reporting unplanned visits within 30 days, were identified through a search of MEDLINE® (1946 to 2015), CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 1898 to 2015), Embase® (1947 to 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (1997 to 2015), American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting abstracts (2011 to 2015), and reference lists of included articles, with the last update in October 2015. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios (RRs), and weighted mean differences were calculated as appropriate for each outcome.

- **Results**: Out of the initial 1,992 studies, 17 studies comprising a total of 1,943 participants met the inclusion criteria. Unstented patients were significantly more likely to have an unplanned medical visit compared to those who received a post-ureteroscopy stent (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15–2.30). Unstented patients had a shorter operative time (weighted mean difference -3.19 minutes, 95% CI -5.64 to -0.74) and were less likely to experience dysuria (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25–0.62). They were also less likely to experience postoperative infection (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59–1.33) and pain.

The findings suggest that while the omission of ureteral stents can reduce operative time, dysuria, and postoperative infection, it increases the risk of unplanned medical visits.

### Routine ureteral stenting is not necessary after ureteroscopy and ureteropyeloscopy: A randomized trial [^1175ALAK]. Journal of Endourology (2002). Low credibility.

Retrospective studies have suggested that routine stenting can be avoided following ureteroscopy. We prospectively analyzed the need for routine ureteral stent placement in patients undergoing ureteroscopic procedures.

- **Patients and methods**: Fifty-five consecutive patients (60 renal units) were randomized into either a stent or a no-stent group following ureteroscopy with either a 7.5F semirigid or a 7.5F flexible ureteroscope for treatment of calculi (holmium laser or pneumatic lithotripsy) or transitional-cell carcinoma (holmium laser). Intraoperative variables assessed included total stone burden, the need for ureteral dilation, and overall operative times. All patients were evaluated by questionnaire on postoperative days 0, 1, and 6 with regard to pain, frequency, urgency, dysuria, and hematuria.

- **Results**: Of the 60 renal units treated, 38 received ureteral stents (mean 5.2 days), and 22 were treated without a stent. All 10 patients requiring ureteral balloon dilation had stents placed and were removed from the analysis. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to age, sex, or stone burden. Operative time was decreased in the no-stent group (43 minutes vs. 55 minutes; P = 0.013). Flank discomfort was significantly less common in the no-stent group on days 0, 1, and 6 (P = 0.004, P = 0.003, P < 0.001, respectively), as was the incidence of suprapubic pain on day 6 (P = 0.002). There was no difference in urinary frequency, urgency, or dysuria between the groups on postoperative day 1, but all these symptoms were significant.

### Selective postoperative imaging after ureteroscopy [^113E4gfA]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the need for routine follow-up imaging after ureteroscopy, we conducted a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing ureteroscopy for urolithiasis. Selective imaging was performed in the initial postoperative phase (1–3 weeks after removal of the ureteral stent) if the procedure was classified as complicated due to factors such as the presence of an impacted stone, the need for balloon dilation, intraoperative ureteral perforation, or postoperative pain after stent removal. Uncomplicated ureteroscopy cases were followed by repeat imaging if the patient developed renal colic or as a surveillance measure for new stone growth at 6–12 months of follow-up.

A total of 267 ureteroscopic procedures were performed on 253 patients. The data from 214 of these 253 patients (84.6%), who had undergone noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging one month or more after surgery, were analyzed. The mean follow-up period was 14.5 months (ranging from 1 to 66 months). The incidence of stricture was 1.4% (3/214). In the selective imaging (complicated ureteroscopy) group, the incidence was 5.3% (3/56), whereas in the uncomplicated ureteroscopy group, it was 0% (0/158). Ureteral stricture developed in 3 of 11 patients with stone impaction (27.2%, P = 0.002), 2 of 14 patients undergoing ureteral balloon dilation (10.4%, P = 0.0052), and in 1 of 6 patients with an intraoperative mucosal perforation (16.6%, P = 0.0326). Persistent postoperative pain after stent removal was not predictive of stricture formation (3.6%, P = 0.139).

The results of our study have shown that selective imaging, as determined by the presence of certain complicating factors during ureteroscopy, proves essential for effective postoperative management.

### Optimal stenting duration following ureteroscopy and nephrolithotomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ukc8r]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

The optimal duration for ureteral stent placement following ureteroscopy remains unclear, with no consensus on its impact on patient outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the ideal stent duration by comparing post-procedure-related events (PREs) and complications.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar identified studies comparing different durations of ureteral stenting after ureteroscopy. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PREs, while secondary outcomes focused on associated complications.

- **Results**: Four studies were included, encompassing 1762 patients with stents removed within ≤ 5 days and 2231 patients with stents removed in ≥ 6 days. The incidence of PREs did not significantly differ between the two groups (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.22–7.25; p = 0.79; I² = 98%). Patients with stent durations ≥ 6 days had higher rates of flank pain and hematuria, whereas fever and dysuria were more prevalent in patients with stents removed within 5 days.

- **Conclusion**: Although no significant difference was observed in overall PRE rates, the distinct patterns of complications based on stent duration highlight the complexity of determining optimal stent placement time in clinical practice.

### A prospective and randomized comparison of rigid ureteroscopic to flexible cystoscopic retrieval of ureteral stents [^111h64t1]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Ureteral stents are frequently used in minimally invasive procedures for upper urinary tract diseases. These stents alleviate temporary postoperative obstruction in the ureter resulting from trauma and swelling. They can also serve as a means of passive preoperative ureteral dilation. Traditionally, indwelling ureteral stents present for extended periods are retrieved using a rigid cystoscope and grasping forceps in adults under topical anesthesia as an outpatient procedure. This method can be painful and may cause urethral injury in men.

Recently, flexible cystoscopy has been accepted as an alternative for stent retrieval. However, the flexible cystoscope is associated with higher costs and may not be readily available in developing countries. Some reports have described experiences using a rigid ureteroscope to retrieve ureteral stents, particularly in situations involving migrated or retained stents. To date, no study has been published comparing outcomes between using a flexible cystoscope and a rigid ureteroscope for ureteral stent removal. In this prospective and randomized clinical trial, we aim to investigate this issue.

### Surgical approaches for treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction - a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113Mjuhs]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Several surgical techniques have been developed for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), each offering unique advantages and potential limitations. Although robotic pyeloplasty (RP) and laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) are allegedly superior, these claims are based on pairwise meta-analyses that failed to evaluate all available techniques at once. In contrast, our study provides a comprehensive overview of open pyeloplasty (OP), endoscopic pyeloplasty (EP), LP, and RP, comparing their performance with respect to crucial clinical outcomes.

Our results indicate that RP achieves the highest rates of operative success and the lowest overall complication rates, hospital stays, re-operation rates, and transfusion rates. Conversely, EP yields the lowest rates of urinary leakage and the shortest operating times. Robot-assisted surgery is known for its minimally invasive nature, which reduces postoperative pain and promotes earlier recovery, likely leading to shorter hospital stays. Additionally, robot-assisted surgery allows for high precision movements with articulated arms and provides magnified 3-D vision for the surgeon, which may explain the high operative success rates of RP.

The low transfusion rates associated with RP result from the minimally invasive nature of robotic surgery, which allows immediate and precise reactions to local bleeding. The short operating time in EP is likely because kidney access requires more time during abdominal surgery than this endoscopic procedure, which is less complex. Though the percutaneous approach involves a short flank incision and sewing techniques, both are of low complexity.

### Outcomes of ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stent for pregnancy with urolithiasis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Y5mQ5]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

From the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to investigate and compare the outcomes of ureteroscopy and serial D-J stenting therapy for pregnant females with urolithiasis. To determine the efficacy and safety of the two treatments, we analyzed the available information in as much detail as possible. This meta-analysis featured 25 studies with a total of 920 cases of urolithiasis during pregnancy. The studies were selected from several countries; as shown in Table 1, most studies originated from Asia (15 studies), followed by Africa (four studies), Europe (three studies), and America (including North and South America; three studies). Thus, this review represents a population of different ethnicities.

Our analysis showed that operative success rates were almost the same for internal ureteral stents and URS (97% vs. 99%, P = 0.280). Internal ureteral stents were associated with more complications than URS (45% vs. 1%, P < 0.001); however, most complications were minor or could be adequately managed. Serious complication rates were < 1% in both groups (P = 1.000) and there was no statistical difference in normal delivery rate between the two treatments (99% vs. 99%, P = 0.989). In summary, both ureteroscopy and internal ureteral stents are safe and effective for pregnancy with symptomatic urolithiasis.

### Optimal stenting duration following ureteroscopy and nephrolithotomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pA2so]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis, we focused on PREs rate and a spectrum of complications such as flank pain, hematuria, fever, LUTS, dysuria, and abdominal pain. It was noteworthy that the differences in PREs rate across varying stent durations were not statistically significant, as well as LUTS and abdominal pain. Conversely, shorter stent durations correlated with an elevated incidence of flank pain and more frequent hematuria. In contrast, patients with longer stent placements experienced higher rates of fever and dysuria.

The elucidation of this meta-analysis poses substantial clinical connotations, given the established protocols by esteemed entities like the International Alliance of Urolithiasis (IAU), the EAU, and the AUA. The discourse on the ideal stent duration post-ureteroscopy is multifaceted and contentious, primarily due to the variable recommendations posited by these authorities. The IAU has not yet provided definitive directives on stent duration, thus necessitating individualized patient assessment. The EAU, for instance, suggests stent durations around 7–14 days based on procedural complexity and postoperative complications. Nevertheless, AUA guidelines recommend considering factors such as stone burden and the presence of edema or injury during surgery, with a suggestion of shorter durations for stent placements, generally between 3 and 7 days, based on a balance of minimizing complications and ensuring healing. This variation underscores the imperative for an exhaustive, systematic evaluation to forge robust, evidence-backed guidelines.

### Forgotten ureteral stents: A systematic review of literature [^1118PveB]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Management**: There are currently no formal guidelines but several treatment algorithms in the management of forgotten ureteral stents (FUS). Single-session removal is often discouraged, and it is better to stage the procedures to avoid long intraoperative time and resultant complications. With improvements in surgical position and techniques, removing fractured or encrusted FUS in a single endourologic session could be achieved with reasonable operating time and acceptable morbidity. At an experienced center, combined endourological procedures can achieve safe and successful management even in the pediatric group.

- **Complex situations**: These often involve the kidney, ureter, and bladder, necessitating multimodal endoscopic procedures and even more invasive surgery that may be performed either simultaneously, sequentially, or separately. Each treatment modality has its advantages and disadvantages, and therefore a treatment strategy should be devised individually. The strategy is mainly based on the volume and site of encrustation, the direction of migration, the site of fracture, kidney function, and other urinary comorbidities. It is recommended to deal with the distal ends first in order to facilitate subsequent procedures such as ESWL and PCNL, and also facilitate placing a ureteral access catheter or a parallel stent.

- **Distal ends management**: SCSR or semi-rigid ureteroscopes alone could be performed for distal ends with minimal or no encrustation and simply downward-migrated FUS. Although severely or circular encrustation completely encasing the distal end could be managed by SCSR + EnCL, the semi-rigid ureteroscope combined… (text appears to be truncated here, and thus is left as is).

Patient counseling information should be provided to ensure safety and effectiveness of the treatment. Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling for detailed information.

- **Ureteric obstruction**: Inform patients that ureteric obstruction may occur. During treatment with Jelmyto, ureteral stents or alternative procedures might be necessary. Patients should contact their healthcare provider immediately if they experience signs or symptoms of ureteric obstruction, such as flank pain or fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Bone marrow suppression**: Inform patients that Jelmyto may decrease blood counts, including white blood cells and platelets. It is essential to periodically assess their blood counts to detect the development of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential about the potential risks to a fetus. They should inform their healthcare providers of any known or suspected pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Jelmyto and for 6 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Moreover, male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

- **Lactation**: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Jelmyto and for 1 week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

### Optimal stenting duration following ureteroscopy and nephrolithotomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128WMf4]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

After performing our screening, we retrieved 1854 articles. Following the deduplication and screening process, 4 articles were deemed relevant and included in our analysis (Fig. 1). For a comprehensive overview of the patient demographics across all included studies, please refer to Table 1. Regarding the design of the included studies, one of them was an RCT, while the remaining three were non-RCTs. Combining the data from these articles, we analyzed a total of 1762 patients whose stents were removed within ≤ 5 days and 2231 patients whose stents were removed after ≥ 6 days. The mean age of all patients was 51.3 years. Despite each trial opting for different group compositions regarding the length of stenting duration, we could group all of those into ≤ 5 and ≥ 6 days of stent duration.

While Paul et al. divided patients into 3- and 7-day groups, Banerjee et al. used 5- and 14-day groups, and Boyko et al. and Wenzler et al. categorized patients into three groups: 0–3 days, 4–6 days, and > 6 days. Notably, we excluded the intermediate group (4–6 days) from Boyko et al. and Wenzler et al. as it did not align with the groups we predefined.

### Shockwave lithotripsy versus ureteroscopic treatment as therapeutic interventions for stones of the ureter (TISU): A multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^112EXPQ5]. European Urology (2021). High credibility.

A key factor in decision-making between these treatment pathways for both patients and clinicians is complications. For the purposes of this study, we did not collect data on the expected low-grade complications of these treatments, which have been well-reported, but focused on serious complications. These were very similar for SWL (4%) and URS (3%) pathways.

We assessed quality of life using two generic quality of life measures (EQ-5D-3L and SF-12). With these measures, there was improvement from baseline for both the URS and the SWL arms, which was maintained for up to 6 months. We acknowledge potential limitations in this regard. Firstly, the response rate to questionnaires was low at both follow-up time points; although this is not uncommon for ureteric stones trials. Estimates on observed data favored URS, but these were attenuated when we accounted for missing data. However, confidence intervals around imputed estimates rule out any clinically meaningful differences in quality of life. Secondly, given that there is no condition-specific quality of life tool for ureteric stones, generic quality of life tools may be too blunt to pick up differences between care pathways at the earlier time point.

Blinding was not possible given the nature of the interventions in each care pathway. We do not consider this a weakness; rather, it reflects the pragmatic nature of our trial, embedded in urological practice across the UK. Our protocol allowed for "crossover" as both treatments are available and changes in the clinical condition of participants were accommodated.

### Defining the rate of negative ureteroscopy in the general population treated for upper tract urinary stone disease [^115gdpEP]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Ureteroscopy is increasingly used to treat upper tract urinary stone disease. A negative ureteroscopy is a ureteroscopy performed with the intent of removing a kidney or ureteral stone, but ultimately no stone is removed. Negative ureteroscopy may occur when the stone is found to have already passed or the presumed stone is found to be outside of the collecting system. We sought to determine the rate of negative ureteroscopy in a large population-based sample, as well as factors associated with its use.

- **Patients and methods**: We examined nonpublic data from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Database for all patients in California undergoing outpatient surgery from 2010 to 2012. We identified all patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code for upper tract urinary stone disease, who underwent a ureteroscopic procedure. After excluding patients undergoing second-look procedures or who had diagnosis codes for separate urologic pathology, the negative ureteroscopy rate was defined as the proportion of those ureteroscopy cases coded as a diagnostic ureteroscopy. We fit logistic regression models to evaluate patient factors associated with negative ureteroscopy.

- **Results**: During the years 2010 to 2012, 20,236 eligible patients underwent ureteroscopic procedures for upper tract stone disease. Of these, 1,287 patients underwent diagnostic ureteroscopy, and 19,039 underwent ureteroscopy with stone removal, accounting for a negative ureteroscopy rate of 6.3%. The odds of receipt of a

### Management of ureteric stones [^114AeEvY]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The contemporary management of ureteric stones is reviewed, and evidence-based recommendations about treatment are made. Stones measuring less than 4 mm in diameter have a high chance of spontaneous passage. The main debate for the optimum treatment of larger stones centers around the choice of shock wave lithotripsy or endoscopic management combined with laser fragmentation. Treatment recommendations should be based on patient preference, published evidence, local audit (such as surgeon expertise and availability of equipment), and cost.

Artificial neural networks could become a useful tool for predicting the treatment outcome for ureteric stones, and further research is needed to clarify this potential. ESWL is less effective than ureteroscopy, but it may prevent the need for more invasive treatment in a substantial proportion of patients. It should only be considered as initial treatment in patients with stones less than 10 mm in size. The routine use of stents should be avoided, as both fragmentation and stone-free rates are noticeably lower.

For larger stones, initial laser ureteroscopy is better for both proximal and distal calculi and is more cost-efficient. Provided that no contraindications for general anesthesia exist, laser ureterolithotripsy should be regarded as an excellent first-line treatment modality for ureteric stones, especially with a greater stone burden. In the best hands, the outcome for endoscopic management of ureteric stones in all sites is better than ESWL and is cheaper, although equipment, expertise, and experience are all required to achieve this superior outcome.

### Routine ureteral stenting after ureteroscopy for ureteral lithiasis: Is it really necessary [^116DmuXB]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of routine ureteral stenting following ureteroscopic stone removal.

- **Materials and methods**: Of 295 consecutive patients who underwent rigid ureteroscopic stone removal, 133 were in group 1 and 162 were in group 2. These patients were randomized to receive and not receive a stent, respectively, after the procedure. Operative time, stone size, stone location, success rate, postoperative pain, and complications were analyzed for each group.

- **Results**: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding stone size, stone location, success rate, postoperative pain, or complications. However, operative time in group 1 was significantly longer than in group 2 (chi-square test p = 0.019). The hospital charge per patient for placing and not placing a stent after ureteroscopy for stone removal was $9,900.95 and $3,661.78, respectively. Female patients with a stent without a suture required an extra charge for stent removal in the operating room, whereas no men had a stent with a suture.

- **Conclusions**: Routine catheter placement after ureteroscopic stone removal increased operative time and did not seem to improve patient outcomes. The cost was significantly higher than without a stent.

### Ureteric stent versus percutaneous nephrostomy for acute ureteral obstruction - clinical outcome and quality of life: a bi-center prospective study [^111DiCmU]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Demographic and preoperative data were obtained, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), baseline and post-drainage eGFR, urine culture, and stone parameters. Post-procedural pain was measured on the day of the procedure using a verbal visual analogue scale (VAS). Quality of life (QoL) was assessed twice: at post-operative day 1–2 ("time 0") and at the day of (prior to) definitive treatment ("time 1"). Patients were requested to fill out two dedicated questionnaires: EuroQol EQ-5D and a 'Tube symptoms' questionnaire. EuroQol EQ-5D is a validated tool for general health assessment, consisting of 5 QoL questions and a thermometer indicating general well-being. A higher questionnaire score is associated with lower QoL, while a higher thermometer score is associated with better QoL. The 'Tube symptoms' questionnaire was based on several questions from the "Intervention-specific" questionnaire described by Joshi, with some modifications to allow uniformity of the questions between the groups. For example, patients were not asked about 'urine incontinence' or 'Bag leak/slippage'; instead, they were asked about 'personal hygiene problems' due to the indwelling tube. The modified questionnaire includes six questions regarding pain, analgesic use, hematuria, urinary discomfort, discomfort associated with movement, and discomfort associated with personal hygiene. Answers to these questions were based on a four-point rating scale, with a higher score indicating worse symptoms.

- **Statistical analysis**: The association between different groups was assessed using statistical methods.

### Development and validation of a model to predict ureteral stent placement following ureteroscopy: Results from a statewide collaborative [^1114m2D8]. Urology (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a model to predict whether patients undergoing ureteroscopy (URS) will receive a stent. Using registry data obtained from the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative Reducing Operative Complications from Kidney Stones initiative, we identified patients undergoing URS from 2016 to 2020. We used patients' age, sex, body mass index, size and location of the largest stone, presence of a stent, history of any kidney stone procedure, procedure type, and acuity to fit a multivariable logistic regression model to a derivation cohort consisting of a random two-thirds of episodes. Model discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the validation cohort. A sensitivity analysis examined urologist variation using generalized mixed-effect models.

We identified 15,048 URS procedures, of which 11,471 (76%) had ureteral stents placed. Older age, male sex, larger stone size, the largest stone being in the ureteropelvic junction, no prior stone surgery, no stent in place, a planned procedure type of laser lithotripsy, and urgent procedure were associated with a higher risk of stent placement. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 (95% CI 0.67, 0.71). Incorporating urologist-level variation improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to 0.83 (95% CI 0.82, 0.84).

Using a large clinical registry, we developed a multivariable regression model to predict ureteral stent placement following URS. Though well-calibrated, the model had modest discrimination but consistently showed improved performance when accounting for urologist-level variation.

### Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) versus ureteroscopic management for ureteric calculi [^115ioCYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). High credibility.

Ureteral stones frequently cause renal colic, and if left untreated, can lead to obstructive uropathy. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and ureteroscopy, with or without intracorporeal lithotripsy, are the most common interventions used to treat ureteral stones. ESWL treatment is less invasive than ureteroscopy but has some limitations, such as a high retreatment rate and a lack of availability in all centers. Recent advances in ureteroscopy have increased success rates and reduced complication rates.

- **Objectives**: To examine evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the outcomes of ESWL or ureteroscopy in the treatment of ureteric calculi.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to March 2011), CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, reference lists of articles, and abstracts from conference proceedings, all without language restriction.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs that compared ESWL with ureteroscopic retrieval of ureteric stones were included in this review. Study participants were adults with ureteric stones requiring intervention. Published and unpublished sources were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently assessed study quality, risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence.

### Routine stenting after ureteroscopy for distal ureteral calculi is unnecessary: Results of a randomized controlled trial [^113Lf4jK]. Journal of Endourology (2003). High credibility.

Insertion of a ureteral stent is routinely done after ureteroscopy. Recently, several authors have questioned routine stenting after ureteroscopy for distal ureteral stones. We report our results of a randomized study comparing ureteroscopy with and without placement of stents for distal ureteral stones.

- **Patients and methods**: A total of 48 patients undergoing ureteroscopy for distal ureteral stones were randomized to a stented group (N = 26) or a non-stented group (N = 22). Ureteroscopy was carried out with a Wolf 8.5F semirigid endoscope, and the Swiss Lithoclast was used as the source of energy. Any stent was removed at 3 weeks. Patients were assessed for success, operative time, postoperative pain score, analgesic requirement, stent-related symptoms, and risk of ureteral stricture formation. Baseline variables were not significantly different in the two groups.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in the two treatment groups regarding the need for ureteral dilation, use of intracorporeal lithotripsy, or occurrence of intraoperative and postoperative complications. A successful outcome was achieved in 100% of both groups. The mean pain score on day 0 was 5.23 ± 0.95 out of 10 in the stented group and 4.82 ± 0.96 in the non-stented group; this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the analgesic requirement in the two treatment groups was not significantly different. However, patients with stents had significantly more pain, including flank pain with voiding (P = 0.01), urgency (P = 0.04), and dysuria (P < 0.01).

### Ureteral stenting and urinary stone management: A systematic review [^111VYmsi]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Ureteral stents are widely used in many urological procedures. This review evaluates recent literature, providing an update on materials, stent designs, indications for stent placement, and stent complications, including the management of such stent-related problems.

A thorough literature search on ureteral stents was conducted. Relevant new and updated articles published in English from 2000 to 2006 were systematically reviewed.

Following uncomplicated ureteroscopy or shock wave lithotripsy, routine stenting does not appear to affect the stone-free rate; however, stent-related morbidity is often observed. Patients at greatest risk for complications include those undergoing bilateral stentless ureteroscopy, those with recent or recurrent urinary tract infections, and pregnant patients. The placement of indwelling stents in these patients should be considered. The development of stent materials and designs aims to reduce stent-related morbidity such as pain, discomfort, bladder irritability, infection, and encrustation. Changes in stent design and materials show great promise. Initial evaluations suggest improvements in patient comfort as well as decreased encrustation. Forgotten stents can lead to significant morbidity due to severe encrustation. Most cases can be managed endoscopically, often requiring multiple procedures.

Stenting is not mandatory after uncomplicated simple ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy.
