## Question

Optimal fluid management in pediatric acute diarrhea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about optimal fluid management in pediatric acute diarrhea, preserving the thinking process and self-verification along the way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify dehydration severity and why that drives therapy. Then, I should verify the first-line role of reduced-osmolarity ORS and its dosing. Next, I will examine when to escalate to IV therapy and which isotonic solutions to choose. After that, I need to check special populations, especially severe acute malnutrition, and reconcile conflicting guidance. Finally, I will integrate nutrition, monitoring, and adjuncts like ondansetron and zinc, and close with a concise algorithm that aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical foundation: accurate assessment of dehydration severity is the pivot for all subsequent decisions, and I should double-check that the categories align with WHO/IDSA frameworks, namely none, mild/moderate, and severe, because treatment pathways diverge sharply at these thresholds [^117EFG91] [^1127sU6U].

> I will now examine the first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate dehydration, and I need to ensure I am precise: reduced-osmolarity ORS is recommended as first-line for infants and children with acute diarrhea and mild-to-moderate dehydration, and this is supported by IDSA and WHO-aligned guidance as well as meta-analyses showing fewer unscheduled IV infusions and less vomiting versus older WHO-ORS [^116t5QFh] [^111KxZ6T] [^115CWbr8].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing details so I don't overgeneralize: for infants and children, 50–100 mL/kg of ORS over 3–4 hours is standard, with ongoing stool/vomiting losses replaced at roughly 10 mL/kg for each diarrheal stool or emesis, and I should confirm that maintenance fluids resume once rehydration is complete, which IDSA explicitly supports [^115oX9BJ] [^1126Ddg7].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence base comparing ORS to IV therapy so I don't overstate IV benefits: randomized evidence shows no clinically important differences in failure rates, weight gain, or electrolyte disturbances between ORS and IV therapy, with a small absolute failure rate for ORS that leads to IV rescue, and ORS associated with shorter hospital stays and fewer IV complications, reinforcing ORS as default when feasible [^1147LQSh] [^112oe444].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to IV therapy, and I need to ensure I capture the red flags correctly: severe dehydration, shock, altered mental status, or failure of ORS/NG therapy are indications for isotonic IV fluids, with lactated Ringer's or normal saline both acceptable, and IV rehydration should continue until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize before transitioning back to ORS for remaining deficit [^116jwv3M] [^111yHMLk] [^116T8iZ1].

> Let me consider the choice of IV solution carefully, because I recall conflicting guidance: WHO historically favored Ringer's lactate, whereas some North American guidance leaned toward 0.9% saline; newer randomized and meta-analytic data suggest balanced crystalloids may modestly shorten hospital stay and reduce hypokalemia compared with saline, but mortality data are sparse and heterogeneous, so either isotonic option is reasonable, with balanced solutions a reasonable preference when available and safe to administer [^112w9meR] [^112ZPidS] [^1165bxRM].

> I should double-check the practical IV dosing schema so I don't misstate it: WHO Plan C uses 100 mL/kg total, typically 30 mL/kg rapidly followed by 70 mL/kg more slowly, with age-based adjustments for infants, and an RCT in East Africa comparing rapid Plan C to slower 8-hour rehydration found no difference in serious adverse events, suggesting slower strategies may be acceptable when closely monitored, though larger mortality-powered trials are needed [^113a8hNS] [^111GRniC].

> But wait, what if the child cannot tolerate oral intake yet is not in shock; I need to check the role of NG: nasogastric ORS is a reasonable bridge for moderate dehydration when oral intake is not feasible, and IDSA supports NG administration in children with normal mental status who are too weak or refuse to drink adequately, which can avert unnecessary IV lines [^1117Tzi7] [^111KxZ6T].

> Now, I will examine special populations, and I must be cautious here because guidance diverges: in severe acute malnutrition, traditional WHO teaching advises against IV rehydration and low-sodium ORS due to risk of sodium overload and cardiac compromise, favoring cautious oral/NG rehydration with ReSoMal and strict monitoring; however, emerging evidence and contemporary commentary question the evidentiary basis for these restrictions, noting high mortality and the feasibility of carefully titrated IV therapy in shock, so I should frame this as evolving and context-dependent rather than absolute [^117X4QVo] [^115oX9BJ].

> Let me reconsider the practical approach in SAM: if the child is in shock, small, frequent isotonic boluses with close hemodynamic and electrolyte monitoring may be lifesaving, whereas in non-shocked SAM, slow NG rehydration with ReSoMal and vigilant surveillance for refeeding syndrome and overhydration remains prudent until stronger evidence clarifies IV safety and dosing in this group [^115oX9BJ] [^117X4QVo].

> Next, I should review nutrition because I need to ensure I'm not perpetuating outdated fasting advice: breastfeeding should continue throughout the illness, and an age-appropriate diet should be resumed during or immediately after rehydration, as early refeeding is safe and may reduce duration of diarrhea; lactose-free options can be considered if persistent diarrhea suggests lactose intolerance, but routine dietary restriction is not recommended [^112a9xde] [^111Lqkk8] [^115BopXz].

> I will now examine adjunctive therapies, and I should confirm age-related nuances: ondansetron can facilitate ORS tolerance and reduce IV use in children with vomiting, with the clearest signal in older children, though some guidelines allow consideration in younger children while acknowledging limited evidence; antimotility agents like loperamide should be avoided in children, and zinc is recommended in children in low-resource settings to reduce duration and severity of diarrhea [^117S7csM] [^112acgxv] [^113DRoeK] [^1127sU6U].

> Hold on, I should verify the monitoring cadence so I don't under-specify follow-up: reassess hydration status and vitals frequently during rehydration, then every few hours once stable, and if symptoms persist beyond 10–14 days or the child deteriorates, re-evaluate fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and the need for further diagnostics or antimicrobial therapy, aligning with IDSA guidance on nonresponse [^113jzGzP] [^111pT2PA].

> Let me synthesize a concise, stepwise algorithm and double-check it aligns with the evidence: for no dehydration, ensure continued feeding and ad libitum fluids; for mild-to-moderate dehydration, give reduced-osmolarity ORS 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours with replacement of ongoing losses, using NG if oral not tolerated; for severe dehydration or ORS failure, initiate isotonic IV fluids with 20 mL/kg boluses until perfusion improves, then complete deficit replacement and transition to ORS; throughout, continue breastfeeding or age-appropriate diet and consider ondansetron to facilitate ORS in vomiting children, while avoiding routine antimotility agents and tailoring zinc use to setting [^115oX9BJ] [^116jwv3M] [^111Lqkk8] [^117S7csM] [^113DRoeK].

> Finally, I should confirm that my key takeaways reflect the strength of evidence: ORS remains the cornerstone for most children, IV therapy is essential for severe cases, balanced crystalloids are reasonable alternatives to saline with potential biochemical advantages but limited mortality data, NG is a valuable bridge, nutrition should not be withheld, and careful reassessment prevents both under- and over-treatment, which together operationalize best practice for pediatric acute diarrhea fluid management [^116t5QFh] [^112w9meR] [^1117Tzi7] [^111Lqkk8] [^113jzGzP].

The optimal fluid management for pediatric acute diarrhea is **reduced-osmolarity ORS as first-line therapy** [^116t5QFh] for mild-to-moderate dehydration, with **isotonic IV fluids for severe dehydration or ORS failure** [^111yHMLk]. ORS is given at 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours [^115oX9BJ], then maintenance at 60–120 mL per stool/vomit; IV therapy uses 20 mL/kg isotonic boluses (NS or LR) [^115oX9BJ] until perfusion improves, followed by 100 mL/kg over 2–4 hours. Continue breastfeeding or resume age-appropriate diet promptly [^114vDXPN]; avoid routine antibiotics [^111LYwyM] and antimotility agents [^113DRoeK]; consider ondansetron for persistent vomiting [^117S7csM] and zinc in low-resource settings [^1127sU6U]. Monitor for electrolyte disturbances and reassess if symptoms persist [^113jzGzP].

## Assessment of dehydration severity

Accurate assessment of dehydration severity is **essential for guiding fluid management** [^116Xbgc1]. The following clinical signs are commonly used:

| **Severity** | **Clinical signs** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Minimal or no dehydration <br/> - Normal vital signs <br/> - Slightly decreased urine output <br/> - Normal skin turgor |
| Moderate | - Tachycardia <br/> - Decreased skin turgor <br/> - Sunken eyes <br/> - Delayed capillary refill <br/> - Irritability <br/> - Decreased urine output |
| Severe | - Hypotension <br/> - Lethargy or altered mental status <br/> - Marked delayed capillary refill <br/> - Very sunken eyes <br/> - Minimal urine output |

---

## Fluid management based on dehydration severity

### Mild to moderate dehydration

- **First-line therapy**: Reduced-osmolarity ORS (75 mmol/L sodium, 75 mmol/L glucose, osmolarity 245 mOsm/L) [^116t5QFh] [^112X6f1f].

- **Administration**: 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours [^115oX9BJ], given in small, frequent sips or via syringe.

- **Maintenance fluids**: After rehydration, provide 60–120 mL ORS for each diarrheal stool or vomiting episode, up to 500 mL/day for children < 10 kg, and 120–240 mL for children > 10 kg, up to 1 L/day [^115oX9BJ].

- **Nasogastric administration**: Consider if oral intake is not tolerated or refused [^1117Tzi7] [^111KxZ6T].

---

### Severe dehydration

- **Intravenous fluids**: Isotonic crystalloids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) are indicated [^111yHMLk] [^116jwv3M].

- **Initial bolus**: 20 mL/kg administered rapidly (within 30–60 minutes) [^115oX9BJ], repeated as needed until perfusion and mental status normalize [^116T8iZ1].

- **Deficit replacement**: After stabilization, administer 100 mL/kg over 2–4 hours [^notfound].

- **Transition to ORS**: Once stabilized, transition to ORS to replace ongoing losses [^114NBuaN].

---

## Nutritional management

Nutritional management emphasizes **continued breastfeeding** throughout the illness [^112a9xde] [^114vDXPN]. Resume an age-appropriate diet within 4–6 hours after rehydration [^notfound]; avoid restrictive diets or fasting [^115BopXz].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Antiemetics**: Ondansetron may be considered in children with persistent vomiting to facilitate ORS tolerance [^117S7csM] [^114fuMUB].

- **Zinc supplementation**: Recommended in children in developing countries to reduce duration and severity of diarrhea [^111myody] [^11599D6X].

- **Antibiotics**: Not routinely recommended; indicated only in specific cases (e.g. dysentery, cholera) [^111LYwyM] [^117FUYGW].

- **Antimotility agents**: Contraindicated in children due to potential adverse effects [^113DRoeK].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **regular reassessment** of hydration status, vital signs, and urine output [^113jzGzP]. Electrolyte monitoring is essential in severe dehydration or persistent symptoms. If symptoms persist beyond 10–14 days, reassess fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and consider alternative diagnoses [^111pT2PA].

---

## Potential complications of improper fluid management

Improper fluid management can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Hyponatremia or hypernatremia**: Due to inappropriate fluid selection or electrolyte imbalance [^113dF6H3].

- **Fluid overload**: Particularly in children with cardiac or renal impairment.

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Such as hypokalemia or metabolic acidosis [^112w9meR].

- **Delayed recovery**: Due to inadequate rehydration or nutritional support [^115BopXz].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Dehydration severity** | **Recommended fluid management** | **Adjunctive therapies** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild to moderate | Reduced-osmolarity ORS (50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours) | - Ondansetron if vomiting persists <br/> - Zinc supplementation in developing countries | - Regular reassessment <br/> - Urine output monitoring |
| Severe | - Intravenous isotonic fluids (20 mL/kg boluses) <br/> - Transition to ORS after stabilization | - Antibiotics only if indicated <br/> - Zinc supplementation | - Frequent vital signs <br/> - Electrolyte monitoring <br/> - Strict intake/output |

---

The optimal fluid management for pediatric acute diarrhea involves **ORS for mild-to-moderate dehydration** [^116t5QFh] and **isotonic IV fluids for severe cases** [^111yHMLk], with prompt nutritional resumption and selective adjuncts; careful monitoring and adherence to guidelines minimize complications and speed recovery [^115bEPsb].

Fluid management in infectious diarrhea — Isotonic intravenous fluids such as lactated Ringer's and normal saline solution should be administered when there is severe dehydration, shock, or altered mental status and failure of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy (strong, high) or ileus (strong, moderate). In people with ketoemia, an initial course of intravenous hydration may be needed to enable tolerance of oral rehydration (weak, low). In severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus (strong, low), after which the remaining deficit can be replaced by using ORS (weak, low). Infants, children, and adults with mild to moderate dehydration should receive ORS until clinical dehydration is corrected (strong, low), and once rehydrated, maintenance fluids should be administered with replacement of ongoing stool losses with ORS until diarrhea and vomiting are resolved (strong, low).

### Acute diarrheal disease in children: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment [^112d1yoU]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The causes of acute diarrhea in children vary with the location, time of year, and population studied. There is increasing recognition of a widening array of enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal diseases. Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement and maintenance are key to managing diarrheal illnesses. Thorough clinical and epidemiologic evaluation is needed to define the severity and type of illness, exposures, and whether the patient in is immunocompromised to direct the performance of selective diagnosis cultures, toxin testing, parasite studies, and the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

### A comparison of the NIRUDAK models and WHO algorithm for dehydration assessment in older children and adults with acute diarrhoea: a prospective, observational study [^117EFG91]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoea is the eighth leading cause of death globally and the fifth leading cause of death in low-income countries. Despite considerable progress in reducing early childhood deaths over the past 50 years, diarrhoea morbidity and mortality remains high in older children and adults with 5.7 billion cases and 1.1 million deaths globally in 2019. In many countries, epidemics of diarrhoeal disease are becoming more frequent due to the effects of climate change, conflict, and mass displacement.WHO warned of an "unprecedented" surge in cholera outbreaks in 2022, with epidemics reported in 30 countries and an overall case fatality ratio of nearly 2% — twice the acceptable limit and the highest in a decade. Although diarrhoea incidence varies by age and region, most adults and older children will experience at least one episode of diarrhoea annually. The vast majority of these episodes will follow a relatively benign course; however, approximately 5% of episodes in older children and adults, or about 285 million cases each year, will lead to moderate or severe disease requiring medical management. Evidence suggests that older people can be especially susceptible to diarrhoea morbidity and mortality.

Although antibiotics can be useful in specific situations, appropriate rehydration remains the most important management strategy for acute diarrhoea in all populations. As the severity of dehydration from acute diarrhoea can vary widely, accurately assessing and managing dehydration remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. - Patients with severe dehydration require immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids in a hospital to prevent hypovolaemic shock, electrolyte derangements, and death; those with mild to moderate dehydration can be safely managed in an ambulatory setting with oral rehydration solution alone; and those with no dehydration require only guidance for continued oral intake and expectant management at home. Accurate assessment of dehydration status can thus improve the cost-effectiveness of diarrhoea management by reducing intravenous fluid and hospital bed usage while also reducing the morbidity and mortality that results from both overtreatment and undertreatment.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112r2PYE]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

For children with moderate to severe AGE, rehydration with oral or intravenous isotonic fluids to correct fluid and electrolyte deficits and on-going losses is the mainstay of treatment. Where oral rehydration is not feasible, rehydration by nasogastric tube is the preferred option and recommended before intravenous rehydration in some guidelines. However, some aspects of current management recommendations are controversial. First, the decision to treat with either oral or intravenous fluids is largely based upon an assessment of level of dehydration, which has been shown to be notoriously unreliable. Second, though the evidence supporting the recommendations are scanty, current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the treatment of severe dehydration ('Plan C') are based on rapid, intravenous administration of isotonic fluids. Plan C recommends a minimum of 100mls/kg, the equivalent volume replacement for losses in those with 10% dehydration. Plan C is given in two stages over 3–6 h, dependent on age. Recommending an initial 30 ml/kg to be administrated rapidly (30–60 min) and the remaining 70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 h respecitvely in infants aged under 12 months and older. For those with hypovolaemic shock initial management recommends fluid boluses (of up to 60 ml/kg) rehydration for children which is followed by step 2 of plan C (70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 h). Whilst the aggressive regime may be appropriate for cholera, the only infective cause of secretory-diarrhoea (leading to excess fluid and electrolyte loss), it may not be generalisable to non-cholera AGE, the dominant cause of AGE worldwide. Despite lack of formal testing, the WHO expert review group indicated this as a strong recommendation.

There are, however, increasing concerns over the safety of rapid intravenous correction of fluid deficits. The only controlled trial (FEAST) assessing fluid bolus therapy in children with presumed sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated a significantly higher mortality in those children receiving fluid-bolus therapy, including a large group with severe dehydration. Although the FEAST trial raises important questions about the safety of rapid intravenous fluid therapy in severe febrile illnesses, children with severe dehydration secondary to AGE were not included in the trial, therefore it is uncertain whether rapid fluid replacement to correct dehydration, the cornerstone of standard management in this condition, is safe. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the evidence underpinning current guidelines for intravenous rehydration.

Infectious diarrhea — reevaluation for nonresponse or persistent symptoms: A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions, particularly when symptoms last 14 or more days; reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms, and the usual duration of symptoms may be up to 10–14 days or longer.

### Infectious diarrhea in developed and developing countries [^116nboPy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea from gastrointestinal infection remains a common problem. In industrialized countries, management is aimed at reducing morbidity and defining groups that may benefit from further investigation. Most infectious diarrhea is self-limiting and only requires supportive management. Viral agents are increasingly recognized as causative agents of epidemic and sporadic diarrhea. In developing countries, diarrhea is a major cause of mortality in children. Oral rehydration therapy, guided by a clinical assessment of the degree of dehydration, is cheap, simple, and effective and remains the mainstay of management of infant diarrhea. Controversies focus on the optimal formulation of oral rehydration solution. A vaccine against rotavirus has the potential to save millions of lives worldwide.

### How to interpret symptoms, signs and investigations of dehydration in children with gastroenteritis [^116Xbgc1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

Dehydration is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Infants and young children are vulnerable to dehydration, and clinical assessment plays a pivotal role in their care. In addition, laboratory investigations can, in some children, be helpful when assessing the severity of dehydration and for guiding rehydration treatment. In this interpretation, we review the current literature and provide an evidence-based approach to recognising and managing dehydration in children.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

### An evidence and consensus based guideline for acute diarrhoea management [^116w2tod]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop an evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of the child who presents to hospital with diarrhoea (with or without vomiting), a common problem representing 16% of all paediatric medical attenders at an accident and emergency department. Clinical assessment, investigations (biochemistry and stool culture in particular), admission, and treatment are addressed. The guideline aims to aid junior doctors in recognising children who need admission for observation and treatment and those who may safely go home.

Evidence

A systematic review of the literature was performed. Selected articles were appraised, graded, and synthesised qualitatively. Statements on recommendation were generated.

Consensus

An anonymous, postal Delphi consensus process was used. A panel of 39 selected medical and nursing staff were asked to grade their agreement with the generated statements. They were sent the papers, appraisals, and literature review. On the second and third rounds they were asked to re-grade their agreement in the light of other panelists' responses. Consensus was predefined as 83% of panelists agreeing with the statement.

Recommendations

Clinical signs useful in assessment of level of dehydration were agreed. Admission to a paediatric facility is advised for children who show signs of dehydration. For those with mild to moderate dehydration, estimated deficit is replaced over four hours with oral rehydration solution (glucose based, 200–250 mOsm/l) given "little and often". A nasogastric tube should be used if fluid is refused and normal feeds started following rehydration. Children at high risk of dehydration should be observed to ensure at least maintenance fluid is tolerated. Management of more severe dehydration is detailed. Antidiarrhoeal medication is not indicated.

Validation

The guideline has been successfully implemented and evaluated in a paediatric accident and emergency department.

Acute infectious diarrhea is a major global health problem. Issues for the developed and developing regions of the world differ. Awareness of disease pathophysiology and epidemiology are essential, however, for clinical evaluation and management. The immense human and economic burden imposed by acute diarrhea illness can be addressed only by thoughtful strategies aimed at prevention as well as cost-efficient evaluation and treatment.

### Slow progress in diarrhea case management in low and middle income countries: evidence from cross-sectional national surveys, 1985–2012 [^116p6Xsz]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Globally, an estimated 5.8 million deaths in children less than 5 years old occurred in the world in 2015. The millennium development goal four (MDG-4) was not met in 28 countries, 11 of which had a under-5 mortality in excess of 100 per 1000 livebirths. Experts argue that that MDG-4 could not be accomplished since childhood diarrhea which accounts for about 10% of all under-5 child deaths was not effectively tackled owing to inadequate implementation of existing evidence-based interventions for diarrhea. Though a 60% reduction of child mortality rate from diarrhea has been achieved between 2000 and 2013, a further reduction targeted during the sustainable development goals (SDG) era requires a further improvement in coverage and quality of diarrhea case management.

In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) or Recommended Home Fluids (RHF) be used for all acute watery diarrheas among children to prevent deaths from diarrhea dehydration leading to the establishment of diarrheal diseases control programs with technical support from United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and WHO member states. Later, WHO-UNICEF joint strategy aimed to improve the proportion of children with diarrhea who receive ORS and increased fluids to 80% by 2000. Case management of diarrhea under Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy (IMCI) by training the healthcare providers (HCP) has been shown to improve their case management skills.

### Management of diarrhea in young children in sub-saharan Africa: adherence to World Health Organization recommendations during the global enteric multisite study (2007–2011) and the vaccine impact of diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study (2015–2018) [^1127sU6U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea remains a leading cause of mortality and illness among young children, with more than 500 000 deaths estimated to have occurred globally among children aged < 5 years in 2019. After a diarrheal episode, young children are at an increased risk of repeated episodes, malnutrition, and cognitive delays, which can have long-term consequences. In 2019, diarrhea accounted for more than 45 million disability-adjusted life-years lost in children aged < 5 years.

In the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce child morbidity and mortality and improve growth and development in children aged < 5 years. The focus of the guidelines for treating diarrheal disease has been the prevention and treatment of dehydration and promotion of optimal nutrition during a diarrheal episode. In the health center, children are categorized by clinical findings as having none, some, or severe dehydration, and treatment is framed accordingly. Children with some dehydration receive low osmolarity oral rehydration salts (ORS) in the health facility, while those who cannot tolerate oral fluids or have severe dehydration receive initial intravenous (IV) fluids. The home management guidlines for children who have diarrhea with no dehydration and those who have already been rehydrated at the health center recommend extra fluids (including increased breastfeeding) and ORS to prevent dehydration. All children with diarrhea should continue feeding and receive a prescription for zinc. As a component of the IMCI, the WHO Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 encourages countries to use community-based health workers to assess diarrheal disease severity using established criteria; for mildly ill children deemed appropriate for home care, their caretakers are educated on providing appropriate home care for diarrhea as described above. Public health messages in the media and routine health visits are other means for communicating this information to families.

### Universal recommendations for the management of acute diarrhea in nonmalnourished children [^112N7wAv]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite a substantial consistency in recommendations for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), a high variability in clinical practice and a high rate of inappropriate medical interventions persist in both developing and developed countries. The aim of this study was to develop a set of clinical recommendations for the management of nonseverely malnourished children with AGE to be applied worldwide.

Methods

The Federation of International Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (FISPGHAN) Working Group (WG) selected care protocols on the management of acute diarrhea in infants and children aged between 1 month and 18 years. The WG used a 3-step approach consisting of: systematic review and comparison of published guidelines, agreement on draft recommendations using Delphi methodology, and external peer-review and validation of recommendations.

Results

A core of recommendations including definition, diagnosis, nutritional management, and active treatment of AGE was developed with an overall agreement of 91% (range 80%-96%). A total of 28 world experts in pediatric gastroenterology and emergency medicine successively validated the set of 23 recommendations with an agreement of 87% (range 83%-95%). Recommendations on the use of antidiarrheal drugs and antiemetics received the lowest level of agreement and need to be tailored at local level. Oral rehydration and probiotics were the only treatments recommended.

Conclusions

Universal recommendations to assist health care practitioners in managing children with AGE may improve practitioners' compliance with guidelines, reduce inappropriate interventions, and significantly impact clinical outcome and health care-associated costs.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration — recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged < 6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children < 5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

### Understanding fluid administration approaches in children with co-morbidities and septic shock [^117X4QVo]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Fluid infusions are given to children to treat cardiovascular compromise from shock in locations across the globe, where resources vary widely. The most common cause of cardiovascular compromise is septic shock. In low and middle income countries severe malnutrition complicates sepsis largely from malaria, pneumonia, and diarrheal diseases, leading to interesting treatment conundrums. The high mortality rate of about 40% in children with severe malnutrition and shock from diarrheal diseases results from the confluence of clinical factors, inequity, socio-economic and cultural context resulting in late presentation, increased vulnerability, and sub-optimal care. Fluid resuscitation in this context is risky with little margin for error, where small deficits or excesses can lead to cardiovascular collapse or respiratory failure. Thus, the WHO recommends a cautious approach with frequent clinical monitoring. This recommendation is supported by weak evidence and accompanied by a suggestion that research is needed to determine optimal fluid management in children with severe malnutrition and shock.

In response to these uncertainties, Obonyo and colleagues investigated the cardiovascular response to two fluid infusion regimes (bolus and continuous infusion over 5 h) in severely malnourished children with hypovolemic shock due to diarrheal diseases with dehydration. The authors concluded that the concern of compromised cardiac function and vulnerability to fluid overload in children with severe malnutrition and diarrheal diseases with dehydration is not supported by their findings. However, there was a high mortality rate at 48 h (36–44%) and 28 days (56–82%). The rationale for this study is partly based on the FEAST trial in which bolus fluid in febrile children in Africa resulted in worse outcomes. However, the FEAST trial excluded children with dehydration from diarrheal diseases, few enrolled had septic shock, and almost 60% of the children suffered from malaria. The findings of the FEAST trial signals a cautious approach to fluid boluses in low resource settings, but the final chapter on fluid approaches in children with septic shock in any setting is not yet written.

### Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy [^117LJA7t]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis remains a common illness among infants and children throughout the world. Among children in the United States, acute diarrhea accounts for > 1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 300 deaths/year. In developing countries, diarrhea is a common cause of mortality among children aged < 5 years, with an estimated 2 million deaths annually. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) includes rehydration and maintenance fluids with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), combined with continued age-appropriate nutrition. Although ORT has been instrumental in improving health outcomes among children in developing countries, its use has lagged behind in the United States. This report provides a review of the historical background and physiologic basis for using ORT and provides recommendations for assessing and managing children with acute diarrhea, including those who have become dehydrated. Recent developments in the science of gastroenteritis management have substantially altered case management. Physicians now recognize that zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease, and an ORS of reduced osmolarity (i.e., proportionally reduced concentrations of sodium and glucose) has been developed for global use. The combination of oral rehydration and early nutritional support has proven effective throughout the world in treating acute diarrhea. In 1992, CDC prepared the first national guidelines for managing childhood diarrhea (CDC. The management of acute diarrhea in children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy. MMWR 1992;41[No. RR-16]), and this report updates those recommendations. This report reviews the historical background and scientific basis of ORT and provides a framework for assessing and treating infants and children who have acute diarrhea. The discussion focuses on common clinical scenarios and traditional practices, especially regarding continued feeding. Limitations of ORT, ongoing research in the areas of micronutrient supplements, and functional foods are reviewed as well. These updated recommendations were developed by specialists in managing gastroenteritis, in consultation with CDC and external consultants. Relevant literature was identified through an extensive MEDLINE search by using related terms. Articles were then reviewed for their relevance to pediatric practice, with emphasis on U.S. populations. Unpublished references were sought from the external consultants and other researchers. In the United States, adoption of these updated recommendations could substantially reduce medical costs and childhood hospitalizations and deaths caused by diarrhea.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^112w9meR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Although acute diarrhoea is a self‐limiting disease, dehydration may occur in some children. Dehydration is the consequence of an increased loss of water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate) in liquid stools. When these losses are high and not replaced adequately, severe dehydration appears. Severe dehydration is corrected with intravenous solutions. The most frequently used solution for this purpose is 0.9% saline. Balanced solutions (e.g. Ringer's lactate) are alternatives to 0.9% saline and have been associated with fewer days of hospitalization and better biochemical outcomes. Available guidelines provide conflicting recommendations. It is unclear whether 0.9% saline or balanced intravenous fluids are most effective for rehydrating children with severe dehydration due to diarrhoea.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of balanced solutions for the rapid rehydration of children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea, in terms of time in hospital and mortality compared to 0.9% saline.

Search methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 May 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea comparing balanced solutions, such as Ringer's lactate or Plasma‐Lyte with 0.9% saline solution, for rapid rehydration.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. time in hospital and 2. mortality. Our secondary outcomes were 3. need for additional fluids, 4. total amount of fluids received, 5. time to resolution of metabolic acidosis, 6. change in and the final values of biochemical measures (pH, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine), 7. incidence of acute kidney injury, and 8. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main results

Characteristics of the included studies

We included five studies with 465 children. Data for meta‐analysis were available from 441 children. Four studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries and one study in two high‐income countries. Four studies evaluated Ringer's lactate, and one study evaluated Plasma‐Lyte. Two studies reported the time in hospital, and only one study reported mortality as an outcome. Four studies reported final pH and five studies reported bicarbonate levels. Adverse events reported were hyponatremia and hypokalaemia in two studies each.

Risk of bias

All studies had at least one domain at high or unclear risk of bias. The risk of bias assessment informed the GRADE assessments.

Primary outcomes

Compared to 0.9% saline, the balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in hospital (mean difference (MD) −0.35 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.60 to −0.10; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of the balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.39; 1 study, 22 children; very low‐certainty evidence).

Secondary outcomes

Balanced solutions probably produce a higher increase in blood pH (MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.09; 4 studies, 366 children; low‐certainty evidence) and bicarbonate levels (MD 2.44 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.97; 443 children, four studies; low‐certainty evidence). Furthermore, balanced solutions likely reduces the risk of hypokalaemia after the intravenous correction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.96; 2 studies, 147 children; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions may result in no difference in the need for additional intravenous fluids after the initial correction; in the amount of fluids administered; or in the mean change of sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children. However, balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in the hospital compared to 0.9% saline. Also, balanced solutions likely reduce the risk of hypokalaemia after intravenous correction.

Furthermore, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions compared to 0.9% saline probably produce no changes in the need for additional intravenous fluids or in other biochemical measures such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Last, there may be no difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in the incidence of hyponatraemia.

### Environmental enteric dysfunction: a review of potential mechanisms, consequences and management strategies [^112iziFv]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to identifying effective interventions, considering the optimal delivery strategy for these interventions are also needed. Given the highly prevalent nature of EED in many settings, empiric treatment of entire populations through MDA may be a viable delivery mechanism. MDA is a highly equitable delivery platform, which may help to ensure that the highest risk children are effectively captured for intervention. However, MDA requires that interventions are inexpensive and safe, which limits its ability to support many of the therapeutics currently being evaluated. Screen-and-treat approaches are an alternative to MDA, but this approach would be complicated by the lack of a universally accepted case definition for EED, or an easily administered diagnostic. Screen-and-treat policies are also relatively more expensive. Interventions could also be administered to a targeted group of high-risk individuals, such as severely malnourished children or children presenting to medical facilities with an acute illness. Given that mortality is concentrated in these populations, this strategy may reach the greatest number of children with capacity to benefit, while limiting the cost and drug exposure of a less targeted approach. However, achieving high coverage in selected populations can be challenging. Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition programs are highly cost-effective, but only reach 17% of acutely malnourished children, and only 44% of children with diarrhea currently receive oral rehydration solution. These data suggest that the malnutrition management and medical care platforms in LMIC settings would also benefit from investment and scale-up if they are to be an effective EED treatment platform.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — features linked to complications or severe disease: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults (strong, high). When the clinical or epidemiologic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from other STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli) in stool (strong, moderate); if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used (weak, moderate), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler (strong, moderate). Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections (strong, moderate). Supporting risk data include that volume depletion is a frequently identified risk factor for diarrhea-related deaths; dehydration at admission among children with postdiarrheal HUS is associated with an increased need for dialysis; intravenous fluid during the diarrhea phase of STEC infections reduces the risk of oligoanuric renal failure; and although most patients with laboratory-confirmed STEC who develop HUS have bloody diarrhea, approximately 10% do not; factors independently associated with increased risk of STEC O157 include abdominal tenderness and absence of fever at first medical evaluation, and approximately 65% will have a peripheral white blood cell count > 10000 cells/μL.

### Reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution for treating dehydration caused by acute diarrhoea in children [^115CWbr8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Oral rehydration solution (ORS) has reduced childhood deaths from diarrhoea in many countries. Recent studies suggest that the currently recommended formulation of ORS recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) may not be optimal, and solutions that contain lower concentrations of sodium and glucose may be more effective.

Objectives

To compare reduced osmolarity ORS with WHO standard ORS in children with acute diarrhoea.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Collaboration Trials Register (on The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2001), EMBASE (1988 to May 2001), and Current Contents (June 2001) were searched. Additional trials were identified by hand searching. Content experts were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing reduced osmolarity ORS with the WHO standard ORS formulation. The primary outcome was unscheduled intravenous fluid infusion. Secondary outcomes were measures of clinical illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data. We tested for heterogeneity using the Chi-square statistic, conducted sensitivity analysis by allocation concealment, and the regression approach to assess funnel plot asymmetry from selective trial publication.

Main Results

The primary outcome, unscheduled intravenous fluid infusion, was reported in 11 trials. In a meta-analysis of 8 trials, reduced osmolarity ORS was associated with fewer unscheduled intravenous fluid infusions compared with WHO standard ORS (Mantel Haenzel odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.79) with no evidence for heterogeneity between trials. No unscheduled intravenous fluid infusion therapy was required in any participant in three trials. Eleven trials reported stool output, and data suggested less stool output in the reduced osmolarity ORS group. Vomiting was less frequent in the reduced osmolarity group in the six trials reporting this. Six trials sought hyponatraemia, with events in three studies, but no obvious difference between the two arms.

Reviewer's Conclusions

In children admitted to hospital with diarrhoea, reduced osmolarity ORS when compared to WHO standard ORS is associated with fewer unscheduled intravenous fluid infusions, lower stool volume post randomization, and less vomiting. No additional risk of developing hyponatraemia when compared with WHO standard ORS was detected.

### Comparison of recommendations in clinical practice guidelines for acute gastroenteritis in children [^11599D6X]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a major cause of child mortality and morbidity. This study aimed at systematically reviewing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on AGE to compare recommendations and provide the basis for developing single universal guidelines.

Methods

CPGs were identified by searching MEDLINE, Cochrane-Library, National Guideline Clearinghouse and Web sites of relevant societies/organizations producing and/or endorsing CPGs.

Results

The definition of AGE varies among the 15 CPGs identified. The parameters most frequently recommended to assess dehydration are skin turgor and sunken eyes (11/15, 73.3%), general appearance (11/15, 66.6%), capillary refill time, and mucous membranes appearance (9/15, 60%). Oral rehydration solution is universally recognized as first-line treatment. The majority of CPGs recommend hypo-osmolar (Na 45–60 mmol/L, 11/15, 66.6%) or low-osmolality (Na 75 mmol/L, 9/15, 60%) solutions. In children who fail oral rehydration, most CPGs suggest intravenous rehydration (66.6%). However, nasogastric tube insertion for fluid administration is preferred according by 5/15 CPGs (33.3%). Changes in diet and withdrawal of food are discouraged by all CPGs, and early refeeding is strongly recommended in 13 of 15 (86.7%). Zinc is recommended as an adjunct to ORS by 10 of 15 (66.6%) CPGs, most of them from low-income countries. Probiotics are considered by 9 of 15 (60%) CPGs, 5 from high-income countries. Antiemetics are not recommended in 9 of 15 (60%) CPGs. Routine use of antibiotics is discouraged.

Conclusions

Key recommendations for the management of AGE in children are similar in CPGs. Together with accurate review of evidence-base this may represent a starting point for developing universal recommendations for the management of children with AGE worldwide.

Background

Despite treatment recommendations from various organizations, oral rehydration therapy (ORT) continues to be underused, particularly by physicians in high-income countries. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare ORT and intravenous therapy (IVT) for the treatment of dehydration secondary to acute gastroenteritis in children.

Methods

RCTs were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, authors and references of included trials, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant organizations. Screening and inclusion were performed independently by two reviewers in order to identify randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ORT and IVT in children with acute diarrhea and dehydration. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The primary outcome measure was failure of rehydration. We analyzed data using standard meta-analytic techniques.

Results

The quality of the 14 included trials ranged from 0 to 3 (Jadad score); allocation concealment was unclear in all but one study. Using a random effects model, there was no significant difference in treatment failures (risk difference [RD] 3%; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0, 6). The Mantel-Haenzsel fixed effects model gave a significant difference between treatment groups (RD 4%; 95% CI: 2, 5) favoring IVT. Based on the four studies that reported deaths, there were six in the IVT groups and two in ORT. There were no significant differences in total fluid intake at six and 24 hours, weight gain, duration of diarrhea, or hypo/hypernatremia. Length of stay was significantly shorter for the ORT group (weighted mean difference [WMD] -1.2 days; 95% CI: -2.4,-0.02). Phlebitis occurred significantly more often with IVT (number needed to treat [NNT] 33; 95% CI: 25,100); paralytic ileus occurred more often with ORT (NNT 33; 95% CI: 20,100). These results may not be generalizable to children with persistent vomiting.

Conclusion

There were no clinically important differences between ORT and IVT in terms of efficacy and safety. For every 25 children (95% CI: 20, 50) treated with ORT, one would fail and require IVT. The results support existing practice guidelines recommending ORT as the first course of treatment in appropriate children with dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^114ScS3Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We presented the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach (Guyatt 2011a). Two review authors (IF and JS) independently assessed the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. The assessment was performed for each outcome and started by assigning an evidence level according to the designs of the included studies. Evidence from RCTs is considered to be of high certainty. The body of evidence summarized was assessed against five criteria: study limitations (risk of bias), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias (Guyatt 2011b). Since we only included RCTs, we started our assessment with high certainty, and assessed each criterion to consider whether we downgraded. We presented a summary of the evidence in the summary of findings table, which provides key information about the best estimate of the magnitude of the effect in relative terms, and absolute differences for each relevant comparison (Guyatt 2011b). In the summary of findings table, we provided information for the following outcomes: time in hospital, mortality, time to resolution of metabolic acidosis, final pH after correction, final bicarbonate after correction, and adverse effects.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116axYA2]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rapid intravenous rehydration, using fluid volumes of 70–100mls/kg over 3–6 h, with some of the initial volume given rapidly as initial fluid boluses to treat hypovolaemic shock for children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and severe dehydration. The evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of rapid versus slower rehydration remains uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 11th of May 2017 comparing different rates of intravenous fluid therapy in children with AGE and moderate or severe dehydration, using standard search terms. Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Non-RCTs and non-English articles were excluded. The primary endpoint was mortality and secondary endpoints included adverse events (safety) and treatment efficacy.

Main results

Of the 1390 studies initially identified, 18 were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 3 studies (n = 464) fulfilled a priori criteria for inclusion; most studied children with moderate dehydration and none were conducted in resource-poor settings. Volumes and rates of fluid replacement varied from 20 to 60 ml/kg given over 1–2 h (fast) versus 2–4 h (slow). There was substantial heterogeneity in methodology between the studies with only one adjudicated to be of high quality. There were no deaths in any study. Safety endpoints only identified oedema (n = 6) and dysnatraemia (n = 2). Pooled analysis showed no significant difference between the rapid and slow intravenous rehydration groups for the proportion of treatment failures (N = 468): pooled RR 1.30 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.93) and the readmission rates (N = 439): pooled RR 1.39 (95% CI: 0.68, 2.85).

Conclusions

Despite wide implementation of WHO Plan C guideline for severe AGE, we found no clinical evaluation in resource-limited settings, and only limited evaluation of the rate and volume of rehydration in other parts of the world. Recent concerns over aggressive fluid expansion warrants further research to inform guidelines on rates of intravenous rehydration therapy for severe AGE.

### European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition / European society for pediatric infectious diseases evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis in children in Europe: update 2014 [^115bEPsb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

These guidelines update and extend evidence-based indications for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis in Europe.

Methods

The guideline development group formulated questions, identified data, and formulated recommendations. The latter were graded with the Muir Gray system and, in parallel, with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Results

Gastroenteritis severity is linked to etiology, and rotavirus is the most severe infectious agent and is frequently associated with dehydration. Dehydration reflects severity and should be monitored by established score systems. Investigations are generally not needed. Oral rehydration with hypoosmolar solution is the major treatment and should start as soon as possible. Breast-feeding should not be interrupted. Regular feeding should continue with no dietary changes including milk. Data suggest that in the hospital setting, in non-breast-fed infants and young children, lactose-free feeds can be considered in the management of gastroenteritis. Active therapy may reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea. Effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii, diosmectite or racecadotril. Anti-infectious drugs should be given in exceptional cases. Ondansetron is effective against vomiting, but its routine use requires safety clearance given the warning about severe cardiac effects. Hospitalization should generally be reserved for children requiring enteral/parenteral rehydration; most cases may be managed in an outpatients setting. Enteral rehydration is superior to intravenous rehydration. Ultrarapid schemes of intravenous rehydration are not superior to standard schemes and may be associated with higher readmission rates.

Conclusions

Acute gastroenteritis is best managed using a few simple, well-defined medical interventions.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^113oXwEd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (GPS and JMS) independently extracted prespecified characteristics of each trial using a standardized, piloted data extraction form. We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by consulting a third review author (IDF). We extracted the following information:

characteristics of the study (first author, design, year of publication, sample size per group, and country);
characteristics of participants (age in months, days of disease, aetiology, electrolyte concentrations, pH, and degree of dehydration);
details of interventions (type of solution, composition, administered volume per treatment group); and
outcome results (for dichotomous outcomes the number of events and number of children per group, and for continuous outcomes, the mean and standard deviation (SD) for each treatment group). If authors did not provide these, we proceeded as explained in the Dealing with missing data.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors (GPG and JMS) independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, which includes the following domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding (masking) of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias (Higgins 2008). We judged each domain as low, unclear, or high risk of bias. We did not exclude trials on the basis of risk of bias, but conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the potential effects of high risk of bias in the meta‐analyses (see Sensitivity analysis). We considered industry funding as a potential source of bias (other bias) (Lundh 2017).

Measures of treatment effect

We performed all analyses according to the standards specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2020). We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^117FUYGW]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhea is the leading cause of death among children under five, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the African and South-East Asian regions. Deaths from diarrhea in this age group account for about 9% of all global fatalities, translating to over 1,300 young children dying each day, many of whom could be prevented with simple treatments. For instance, dehydration from acute diarrhea can be safely and effectively treated in over 90% of cases through oral rehydration, except in severe cases.

In developing countries, including Eritrea, treatment guidelines often rely on clinical presentation due to limited laboratory services and patient overload. However, adherence to these guidelines for managing common childhood illnesses, such as diarrhea and respiratory infections, remains low globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children and the Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) Chart Booklet, diarrhea management requires a systematic approach to assessment, management, and prevention. The essential elements in managing a child with diarrhea include providing Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), zinc, and counseling for continued feeding. Caregivers should also receive education on feeding and hygiene practices to reduce diarrhea morbidity.

The WHO guidelines recognize Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS) therapy as the gold standard for clinically effective and cost-efficient diarrhea management. ORS is recommended for all patients, regardless of age or causative agent, unless they are comatose or severely dehydrated, as it is less expensive, equally effective, and more practical than intravenous fluids. The new ORS formulation is officially recommended by WHO and UNICEF. Furthermore, antimicrobials are reserved for cases of bloody diarrhea, severe cholera, or serious non-intestinal infections. WHO states that antibiotic treatment is necessary in only 5% of childhood diarrhea cases. Anti-diarrheal drugs and anti-emetics should be avoided in young children with acute or persistent diarrhea or dysentery, as they do not prevent dehydration or improve nutritional status, and may cause dangerous, potentially fatal side effects.

Follow-up evaluations after laboratory-confirmed pathogen-specific diarrhea — Follow-up testing is not recommended in most people for case management following resolution of diarrhea (strong, moderate), although serial stool specimens using culture-dependent methods for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi, STEC, Shigella, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and other bacterial pathogens are recommended in certain situations by local health authorities following cessation of diarrhea to enable return to child care, employment, or group social activities (strong, moderate), and practitioners should collaborate with local public health authorities to adhere to return policies (strong, high). A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions including lactose intolerance (weak, low). Noninfectious conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), should be considered in people with symptoms lasting 14 or more days and unidentified sources (strong, moderate). Reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms (strong, high).

### Assessing safety and efficacy of a novel glucose-free amino acid oral rehydration solution for watery diarrhea management in children: a randomized, controlled, phase III trial [^113BTXim]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoeal disease remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children under the age of five, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. In 2015 alone, there were approximately 688 million cases of morbidity and 499,000 deaths attributed to diarrhoeal disease, accounting for around 12.5% of all deaths in this age group globally. Developed countries also face a considerable burden, with healthcare costs exceeding two billion dollars annually in the United States for hospital and outpatient care.

Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has been the standard fluid replacement since 1978, supported by global health organizations like WHO, UNICEF, and USAID. The WHO recommended glucose-based oral rehydration solution (GORS) with reduced osmolarity (250 mOsm/L or less) is considered the gold standard for managing mild-to-moderate watery diarrhoea in children. This solution leverages the co-transport of glucose and sodium across the small intestine, countering fluid losses and electrolyte imbalances.

Despite its proven effectiveness, GORS usage has not increased accordingly. Since 2000, surveys suggest less than 33% of children under age five with diarrhoea receive ORT. In developed countries healthcare professionals also prefer Intravenous therapy (IVT). IVT, while rapidly correcting fluid deficits, has drawbacks such as cost, specialized staff requirements, and potential complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and infections. In contrast, ORT offers several advantages supporting its wider adoption. Oral administration is non-invasive and less traumatic, especially for young children, and can be conveniently administered by caregivers in various settings, including at home and primary care centers. Additionally, ORT is cost-effective and associated with lower hospital admission rates and shorter stays. However, barriers hinder ORT's broader use. A lack of education for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals contributes to confusion between available ORT solutions and other types of drinks. Furthermore, changes in consumer and caregiver preferences, such as taste, affect ORT acceptance and result in products with more sugar and less salt than desired for deficit therapy.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^113a8hNS]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of acute gastroenteritis occur annually in children under 5 years. In this age group, gastroenteritis is the second biggest cause of mortality (after acute respiratory illnesses). The vast majority of deaths occur in low resource settings in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. A large case-control study, Global Enteric Multicentre study of gastroenteritis (GEMS), conducted in Africa and Asia showed that children with moderate/severe gastroenteritis seeking care at health centres are 8.5 times more likely to die than non-gastroenteritis controls. A third of the fatalities occurred < 7 days following enrolment — indicating that current treatment strategies may not be working in practice and/or are poorly implemented.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced guidance on the management of dehydration in children with diarrhoea, largely based on expert opinion. In children (without severe malnutrition), oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended for children with diarrhoea with some dehydration, defined as two or more of the following: restlessness/irritability, sunken eyes, drinks eagerly/thirsty and/ or skin pinch goes back slowly (plan B). Intravenous fluids are recommended for resuscitation of children with severe dehydration, defined as the presence of two or more of the following clinical features: sunken eyes, skin pinch goes back very slowly ≥ 2 seconds (s), lethargy and/or inability to drink (under the protocol called 'plan C'), using 100 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or 0.9% saline. This is the approximate volume estimated to have been lost in children with 10% dehydration and is recommended to be given over 3 h (or 6 h in children < 1 year). Plan C consists of two steps in which the volume and rate of infusion are different and also differ by age group (< 1 year and ≥ 1 year). In Step 1 30 ml/kg over 30 min (or 1 h if < 1 year) and then in Step 2 70 ml/kg over 2.5 h (or 5 h if < 1 year). For children presenting with shock (defined as the presence of all three of weak and fast pulse, temperature gradient and capillary refilling time > 3 s), WHO also recommends initial fluid boluses given for shock (i.e. up to 3 boluses of 20 ml/kg of normal (0.9%) saline given as rapidly as possible) followed directly by Step 2, i.e. 90–130 ml/kg. These management guidelines are recommended in resource-poor settings, despite no formal testing in a clinical trial. A review of the evidence underpinning WHO management guidelines in 2012, with regard to shock and rehydration management, focused principally on the type of fluid for resuscitation but did not consider the rate or volume.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^115KAQ4R]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult acute diarrhea — management algorithm begins with passage of ≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 h plus an enteric symptom and then triages by syndrome and severity. For watery diarrhea with mild illness, management is hydration only and patients may use loperamide 4 mg initially to control stooling. For watery illness with no or low-grade fever (≤ 100°F), consider ≤ 48 h of loperamide therapy. For dysenteric diarrhea with no or low-grade fever (≤ 100°F), it specifies microbiologic assessment, then anti-microbial agent directed to cause for all but STEC infection. In severe illness with fever (≥ 101°F) in a single case (not outbreak), listed actions include to consider microbiologic assessment and empiric treatment with Azithromycin 1 g in single dose OR 500 mg once daily for 3 days. Persistent diarrhea (14–30 days) should be worked up by culture and/or culture-independent microbiologic assessment, then treated with an anti-microbial agent directed to cause.

Symptomatic relief — Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate). Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

### Intravenous rehydration for severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis [^115ugbbX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

I n 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund and World Bank Group Interagency estimated that 17 million children under five years were severely undernourished. The most extreme form, severe acute malnutrition (SAM), is a leading cause of pediatric hospital admissions in Africa. Many such children have additional complications including marked dehydration due to diarrhea, which is associated with high in-hospital mortality(27–41%) –. Current recommendations for rehydration in children with SAM differ from those without SAM. First, intravenous rehydration is not recommended in SAM on the grounds that malnourished children are at high risk of cardiac compromise and sodium overload. Second, low sodium oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are not recommended for similar rationale. Although such guidance documents have been in place for over two decades, no prioror subsequent evidence has been provided to support these recommendations. Thus, oral rehydration is the recommended option with intravenous boluses provided only in the event of shock. This approach results in children requiring a nasogastric tube to administer oral rehydration, since most are unable to take or retain oral fluids. Additionally, most cases are managed on busy, overcrowded pediatric wards or dedicated nutrition units with limited numbers of nursing staff who can ensure close supervision to support safe implementation of oral-nasogastric rehydration and monitor for signs of shock. Shock complicates ~25% of pediatric cases with severe dehydrationwith high in-hospital mortality (> 40%) –.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^1164kQq3]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 6 — The guideline panel suggests IV fluid administration at the early treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state there is no research evidence regarding use of D10 vs. D5 IV fluids in this setting and no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made due to lack of evidence and potential for delay if specialized fluids are utilized; IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating clinician and provided similarly to other children with acute onset vomiting, with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. Background notes that a prior pediatric expert consensus recommended dextrose 10% (D10) over dextrose 5% (D5), but the guideline panel found no published evidence supporting this practice, and the panel was unable to judge the desirable effects of D10 versus D5 given the lack of evidence.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^113dF6H3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs) are used to provide critical supportive care for children who are acutely ill. IVFs are required if sufficient fluids cannot be provided by using enteral administration for reasons such as gastrointestinal illness, respiratory compromise, neurologic impairment, a perioperative state, or being moribund from an acute or chronic illness. Despite the common use of maintenance IVFs, there is high variability in fluid prescribing practices and a lack of guidelines for fluid composition administration and electrolyte monitoring. The administration of hypotonic IVFs has been the standard in pediatrics. Concerns have been raised that this approach results in a high incidence of hyponatremia and that isotonic IVFs could prevent the development of hyponatremia. Our goal in this guideline is to provide an evidence-based approach for choosing the tonicity of maintenance IVFs in most patients from 28 days to 18 years of age who require maintenance IVFs. This guideline applies to children in surgical (postoperative) and medical acute-care settings, including critical care and the general inpatient ward. Patients with neurosurgical disorders, congenital or acquired cardiac disease, hepatic disease, cancer, renal dysfunction, diabetes insipidus, voluminous watery diarrhea, or severe burns; neonates who are younger than 28 days old or in the NICU; and adolescents older than 18 years old are excluded. We specifically address the tonicity of maintenance IVFs in children. The Key Action Statement of the subcommittee is as follows: 1A: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that patients 28 days to 18 years of age requiring maintenance IVFs should receive isotonic solutions with appropriate potassium chloride and dextrose because they significantly decrease the risk of developing hyponatremia (evidence quality: A; recommendation strength: strong).

### Randomized double-blind trial of ringer lactate versus normal saline in pediatric acute severe diarrheal dehydration [^1168UhGK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Ringer lactate (RL) versus normal saline (NS) in the correction of pediatric acute severe diarrheal dehydration, as measured by improvement in clinical status and pH (≥ 7.35).

Methods

A total of 68 children ages 1 month to 12 years with acute severe diarrheal dehydration (World Health Organization [WHO] classification) were randomized into RL (n = 34) and NS groups (n = 34) and received 100mL/kg of the assigned intravenous fluid according to WHO PLAN-C for the management of diarrheal dehydration. The primary outcome was an improvement in clinical status and pH (≥ 7.35) at the end of 6 hours. Secondary outcomes were changes in serum electrolytes, renal and blood gas parameters, the volume of fluid required for dehydration correction excluding the first cycle, time to start oral feeding, hospital stay, and cost-effectiveness analysis.

Primary outcome was achieved in 38% versus 23% (relative risk = 1.63, 95% confidence interval 0.80–3.40) in RL and NS groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes in electrolytes, renal, and blood gas parameters. None required second cycle of dehydration correction. Median (interquartile range) time to start oral feeding (1.0 [0.19–2.0] vs 1.5 [0.5–2.0] hours) and hospital stay (2.0 [1.0–2.0] vs 2.0 [2.0–2.0] days) was similar. The median total cost was higher in RL than NS group ((Equation is included in full-text article.)120 [(Equation is included in full-text article.)120-(Equation is included in full-text article.)180] vs (Equation is included in full-text article.)55 [(Equation is included in full-text article.)55-(Equation is included in full-text article.)82], P ≤ 0.001).

Conclusion

In pediatric acute severe diarrheal dehydration, resuscitation with RL and NS was associated with similar clinical improvement and biochemical resolution. Hence, NS is to be considered as the fluid of choice because of the clinical improvement, cost, and availability.

### Racecadotril for acute diarrhoea in children [^1169SWm8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute diarrhoea is a leading cause of death for children under five years of age. Most deaths are caused by excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Racecadotril is an anti-secretory drug that has been used for acute diarrhoea in children as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of racecadotril for treating acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, March 2019); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), up to 4 March 2019, for clinical trials regardless of publication language or status.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared racecadotril to placebo or no intervention in addition to standard care (oral rehydration therapy) in children under five with acute diarrhoea. The primary outcomes were failure of oral rehydration, duration of diarrhoea, and number of stools. The secondary outcomes were stool output, length of the hospital stay, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. We presented dichotomous data with risk ratios (RR) and continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). Where appropriate, we combined trials with meta-analysis and used a random-effects model if there was significant heterogeneity (I² ≥ 50%). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Seven RCTs with a total of 1140 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were carried out on children aged three months to five years, in outpatient and inpatient facilities from France, Spain, Peru, India, Kenya, and Ecuador. The efficacy and safety of racecadotril were compared to placebo or no treatment. Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 192 participants; low-certainty evidence). Data on duration of diarrhoea, number of stools in the first 48 hours are insufficient to reach a conclusion; stool output in the first 48 hours appears to be lower in the two trials measuring this, although the data is not combinable. Length of hospital stay was similar in two studies measuring this, and overall there was no evidence that racecadotril increased overall rate of adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; 5 RCTs, 688 participants; low-certainty evidence). Most adverse events in the racecadotril group were mild or moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Racecadotril seems to be a safe drug but has little benefit in improving acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. Current evidence does not support routine use of racecadotril in management of acute diarrhoea in children under five outside of the context of placebo controlled RCTs. 18 December 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All studies identified during the most recent search (4 Mar, 2019) have been incorporated in the review, and no ongoing studies identified.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^117N1sNW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines acute diarrhoea as the passage of unusually loose or watery stools, usually at least three times in 24 hours, which lasts less than 14 days (WHO 2005). The American Academy of Pediatrics defines acute gastroenteritis as a diarrhoeal disease of rapid onset, with or without additional symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain (American Academy of Pediatrics 1996). Both terms are commonly used to describe the gastrointestinal infection caused by specific micro‐organisms such as rotavirus, norovirus, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and others (Guerrant 1990). We use the term 'acute diarrhoea' in this review to cover both acute diarrhoea and acute gastroenteritis.

Acute diarrhoea accounts for over 0.5 million deaths annually in children under five years old (Liu 2015). Although most cases of acute diarrhoea are self‐limiting, dehydration, the most common and dangerous complication, may occur in some children. During diarrhoea, there is an increased loss of water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate) in the liquid stools. Water and electrolytes are also lost through vomit, sweat, and urine. Dehydration occurs when these losses are not replaced adequately and a deficit of water and electrolytes develops (WHO 2005).

### Inability to reduce morbidity of diarrhea by ORS: can we design a better therapy? [^1145ixH7]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Diarrheal disease is a worldwide problem that still causes significant morbidity and mortality among children. Currently, oral rehydration solution (ORS) is the standard of care for acute diarrhea in pediatric patients. Although effective in reducing mortality, ORS does not alleviate diarrheal symptoms, thus reducing caregiver compliance and therapeutic efficacy. This article will briefly review the current problem of pediatric diarrhea and the shortcomings of current therapies; however, the focus of this review is to examine the intestinal calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). The author summarizes the evidence suggesting that targeting the CaSR will enable clinicians to address all four major pathophysiological mechanisms of diarrheal disease, and substantiates the need for future research regarding this therapy.

### Gastroenteritis in children: part II. prevention and management [^112QRZSY]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of gastroenteritis in children focuses on preventing dehydration. A child with minimal or no dehydration should be encouraged to continue his or her usual diet plus drink adequate fluids. Many studies have shown that a child's regular diet reduces the duration of diarrhea. Oral rehydration therapy with a rehydration solution can be used to treat diarrhea in children with mild to moderate dehydration. Ondansetron can decrease vomiting or help avoid the need for intravenous fluid, but it increases episodes of diarrhea. Probiotics can be used to shorten the course of diarrhea. Good handwashing reduces the incidence of acute gastroenteritis, but not rotavirus. The introduction of two rotavirus vaccines in the United States in 2006 significantly reduced the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis. The oral, live vaccines have strong safety records, despite a minimal incidence of intussusception.

### Parental management of childhood diarrhea [^116r2rmi]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the prevalence of therapies used by parents to manage acute diarrhea in their children and determine extent of parental adherence to current management guidelines and utilization of functional foods. Parents (N = 623) of children with diarrhea were surveyed in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department. Most (53%) treated their child's diarrhea with appropriate fluids, including oral rehydration solution (52%), but 14% used treatments not recommended in current guidelines (antidiarrheals, 8%; fluids high in simple sugars, 6%). In addition, 13% used functional foods (yogurt, 11%; probiotics, 4%). Children whose parents did not adhere to guidelines were older (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01–1.02 years) and Hispanic (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1–3.9). Although most parents use appropriate fluids to treat their children's diarrhea, functional foods and antidiarrheal medications were also frequently administered. Further data on effectiveness of functional foods and education regarding avoidance of potentially harmful medications are needed.

### Oral versus intravenous rehydration for treating dehydration due to gastroenteritis in children [^1147LQSh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dehydration associated with gastroenteritis is a serious complication. Oral rehydration is an effective and inexpensive treatment, but some physicians prefer intravenous methods.

Objectives

To compare oral with intravenous therapy for treating dehydration due to acute gastroenteritis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (March 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), LILACS (1982 to March 2006), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant organizations.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT) with oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in children up to 18 years of age with acute gastroenteritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Jadad score. We expressed dichotomous data as a risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT), and continuous data as a weighted mean difference (WMD). We used meta-regression for subgroup analyses.

Main Results

Seventeen trials (1811 participants), of poor to moderate quality, were included. There were more treatment failures with ORT (RD 4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 7, random-effects model; 1811 participants, 18 trials; NNT = 25). Six deaths occurred in the IVT group and two in the ORT groups (4 trials). There were no significant differences in weight gain (369 participants, 6 trials), hyponatremia (248 participants, 2 trials) or hypernatremia (1062 participants, 10 trials), duration of diarrhea (960 participants, 8 trials), or total fluid intake at six hours (985 participants, 8 trials) and 24 hours (835 participants, 7 trials). Shorter hospital stays were reported for the ORT group (WMD -1.20 days, 95% CI -2.38 to -0.02 days; 526 participants, 6 trials). Phlebitis occurred more often in the IVT group (NNT 50, 95% CI 25 to 100) and paralytic ileus more often in the ORT group (NNT 33, 95% CI 20 to 100, fixed-effect model), but there was no significant difference between ORT using the low osmolarity solutions recommended by the World Health Organization and IVT (729 participants, 6 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Although no clinically important differences between ORT and IVT, the ORT group did have a higher risk of paralytic ileus, and the IVT group was exposed to risks of intravenous therapy. For every 25 children (95% CI 14 to 100) treated with ORT one would fail and require IVT.

### Variables associated with intravenous rehydration and hospitalization in children with acute gastroenteritis: a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials [^113NbSvP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Despite guidelines endorsing oral rehydration therapy, intravenous fluids are commonly administered to children with acute gastroenteritis in high-income countries.

Objective

To identify factors associated with intravenous fluid administration and hospitalization in children with acute gastroenteritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study is a planned secondary analysis of the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) and Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) probiotic trials. Participants include children aged 3 to 48 months with 3 or more watery stools in 24 hours between November 5, 2013, and April 7, 2017, for the PERC study and July 8, 2014, and June 23, 2017, for the PECARN Study. Children were from 16 pediatric emergency departments throughout Canada (6) and the US (10). Data were analyzed from November 2, 2018, to March 16, 2021.

Exposures

Sex, age, preceding health care visit, distance between home and hospital, country (US vs Canada), frequency and duration of vomiting and diarrhea, presence of fever, Clinical Dehydration Scale score, oral ondansetron followed by oral rehydration therapy, and infectious agent.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Intravenous fluid administration and hospitalization.

Results

This secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials included 1846 children (mean [SD] age, 19.1 [11.4] months; 1007 boys [54.6%]), of whom 534 of 1846 (28.9%) received oral ondansetron, 240 of 1846 (13.0%) received intravenous rehydration, and 67 of 1846 (3.6%) were hospitalized. The following were independently associated with intravenous rehydration: higher Clinical Dehydration Scale score (mild to moderate vs none, odds ratio [OR], 8.73; 95% CI, 5.81–13.13; and severe vs none, OR, 34.15; 95% CI, 13.45–86.73); country (US vs Canada, OR, 6.76; 95% CI, 3.15–14.49); prior health care visit with intravenous fluids (OR, 4.55; 95% CI, 1.32–15.72); and frequency of vomiting (per 5 episodes, OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.39–1.99). The following were independently associated with hospitalization: higher Clinical Dehydration Scale score (mild to moderate vs none, OR, 11.10; 95% CI, 5.05–24.38; and severe vs none, OR, 23.55; 95% CI, 7.09–78.25) and country (US vs Canada, OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.36–8.40). Oral ondansetron was associated with reduced odds of intravenous rehydration (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.13–0.32) and hospitalization (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21–0.89).

Conclusions and Relevance

Intravenous rehydration and hospitalization were associated with clinical evidence of dehydration and lack of an oral ondansetron-supported oral rehydration period. Strategies focusing on oral ondansetron administration followed by oral rehydration therapy in children with dehydration may reduce the reliance on intravenous rehydration and hospitalization.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Saccharomyces boulardii in infants and children with acute diarrhea [^111myody]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea is one of the most common infectious diseases and remains a leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries. Although important reductions in the number of deaths have been reported since several decades, millions children worldwide suffer from diarrhea every year and are at risk of dehydration and malnutrition. Dehydration is the principal cause of death from diarrhea. Fluids and electrolytes replacement therapy by oral rehydration solution (ORS) is consequently central in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the management of acute diarrhea in children. Nevertheless, oral rehydration has no effect on the duration of diarrhea, prompting a growing interest in adjunctive solution to limit the burden of the disease. Alongside rehydration therapy, the WHO also recommends the use of zinc supplementation which has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes. Other interventions have also been suggested and among them, there is considerable interest in the role of probiotics in promoting recovery from acute diarrhea. Indeed, several meta-analyses have shown that probiotic supplementation, as an adjunct to rehydration therapy in the management of acute diarrhea in children, is effective in reducing diarrhea duration. – These consistent pieces of evidence have led to universal recommendations in favor of the use of probiotics for the management of acute diarrhea from the European and International Societies for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. More specifically, experts have recommended the use of probiotic strains with clinically proven efficacy such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or S. cerevisiae variant boulardii (S. boulardii). On the contrary, recent clinical studies have found no benefit of probiotics on the duration of diarrhea. A systematic review and network meta-analysisdesigned to compare and determine the most effective pharmacologic or nutritional interventions in reducing diarrhea duration supports the recommendation towards the use of S. boulardii in the management of acute diarrhea in children. S. boulardii associated with zinc supplementation has been shown superior to both standard treatment, zinc supplementation alone or supplementation with any of the other probiotic strains tested. Although the efficacy of S. boulardii in various indications in children and adults is already well documented in the literature, it is the first time that the efficacy and safety of the S. boulardii CNCM I-3799 is evaluated in children with acute diarrhea.

### A randomized trial of plasma-lyte A and 0.9% sodium chloride in acute pediatric gastroenteritis [^116uAUSE]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) complicated by dehydration remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, requiring significant healthcare expenditure worldwide. Approximately 179 million cases of AGE occur in the US each year. Despite a decrease in positive laboratory diagnoses of AGE, likely attributable to rotavirus vaccination availability since 2006, substantial disease remains. The fluid loss associated with AGE not only causes dehydration, but can lead to metabolic acidosis and electrolyte disturbances.

Intravenous fluid therapy (IVT) is the mainstay of treatment for severe pediatric dehydration, and the requirement for continued IVT is the leading indication for hospitalization. However, recommendations for IVT are poorly standardized, and significant controversy exists as to the optimal fluid for use in children. In general, isotonic fluids are advised for acute rehydration with the most commonly administered fluids being 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) and Lactated Ringer's (LR) solution. However, 0.9% NaCl, which contains a supraphysiologic chloride concentration, can induce hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (HCA), which can exacerbate the low serum bicarbonate levels often associated with diarrhea and poor perfusion from dehydration. To prevent HCA, clinicians use LR, but concerns of hyponatremia due to low sodium concentration limit its use. Thus, there is a substantial need to further evaluate alternative isotonic crystalloids as a treatment for AGE.

Plasma-Lyte A (PLA, Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL), a balanced isotonic crystalloid, contains physiologic sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, and bicarbonate precursors in mEq/L: Na 140, K 5, Cl 98, Mg 3, Acetate 27, and gluconate 23, pH 7.4). It is utilized as a source of water and electrolytes or as an alkalinizing agent. Several studies in adults have reported a reduction in the incidence of hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis with balanced solutions (eg, LR and PLA) over 0.9% NaCl. The osmolarity of Plasma-Lyte A is 294 mOsmol/L, within the pediatric reference range. Of note, isotonic Plasma-Lyte has different naming conventions around the globe and hence different publications may refer to Plasmalyte A, Plasmalyte, or Plasmalyte 148. In the Unites States, there are 2 naming formulations which are identical in ionic composition but which differ in solution pH: Plasma-Lyte A (used here) which has a pH of 7.4 and Plasma-lyte 148 which has a pH of 5.5.

### Gastrointestinal infections in the pediatric population [^115QmtMw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the literature concerning gastrointestinal infections in the pediatric population, primarily in developed countries. Searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were performed in August 2009 to locate studies published in the last 18 months.

Recent Findings

Several independent guidelines based on systematic reviews of the best available evidence related to rotavirus vaccination and to the management of acute gastroenteritis were recently published. Despite subtle differences, there is agreement between the scientific societies that rotavirus vaccination should be offered to all children worldwide. Likewise, there is consensus in the guidelines that rehydration therapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute gastroenteritis and should be applied promptly. For oral rehydration, a reduced osmolality oral rehydration solution should be used. Regular feeding should not be interrupted and should be carried on following initial rehydration. The use of some antiemetics and antidiarrheal drugs has been studied; however, they are generally not necessary. The use of probiotics with documented efficacy may be considered. Antibiotics should not be routinely administered to children with gastroenteritis.

Summary

This review discusses the most recent relevant guidelines related to gastrointestinal infections in children, which may facilitate provision of more standardized advice and treatment to patients by healthcare providers.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^1165bxRM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

The WHO recommends the use of Ringer's lactate to rehydrate children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea, and suggests the use of 0.9% saline when Ringer's lactate is not available (WHO 2005). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of either Ringer's lactate or 0.9% saline (American Academy of Pediatrics 1996). In contrast, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)/European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) guidelines recommend the use of 0.9% saline, and only recommend Ringer's lactate in severe cases of shock (Guarino 2014). The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines only recommend the use of 0.9% saline (NICE 2009). Additional solutions, such as Dhaka Solution, with different electrolyte compositions have been used in different contexts, and are recommended by some guidelines as alternatives to Ringer's lactate, if this is not available, before considering 0.9% saline (WHO 2005), although there is no evidence to support their use. Table 3 displays the electrolyte composition of some solutions that have been used for intravenous rehydration of children with acute diarrhoea. Moreover, a survey amongst paediatric emergency physicians in Canada showed that 0.9% saline is the preferred solution for intravenous rehydration (Freedman 2011). Thus, there are several alternative treatments and heterogeneity in the recommendations of the most important guidelines. This heterogeneity may be caused by the time of publication of the guidelines, but mostly reflects the lack of appropriate evidence.

2
Composition of some intravenous solutions used for rehydration in children with diarrhoea

One recent Cochrane Review found that critically ill children and adults treated with 0.9% saline for resuscitation had higher chloride levels, lower bicarbonate levels, and lower pH levels than children treated with balanced solutions, but failed to demonstrate differences in mortality (Antequera Martin 2019). The review's conclusions are not applicable to children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea because authors aimed to determine the effect of the solutions on resuscitation of critically ill people regardless of their diagnoses. Although the Cochrane Review's authors considered subgroup analyses by age or disease, they could not perform them. Additionally, the review authors did not consider studies in children with severe dehydration unless they were considered to be critically ill, which potentially resulted in missing specific evidence for children with acute diarrhoea and dehydration.

### Ondansetron and probiotics in the management of pediatric acute gastroenteritis in developed countries [^116R2aKD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common and impactful disease, typically managed with supportive care. There is considerable interest in the role of adjunctive therapies, particularly ondansetron and probiotics in improving AGE outcomes. The purpose of this review is to present the latest evidence regarding the use of these agents in children with AGE in developed countries.

Recent Findings

Single-dose oral ondansetron is effective and safe in reducing hospital admissions and the use of intravenous rehydration in children with AGE in emergency-department-based trials. Ondansetron use has increased significantly; however, 'real-world' studies of effectiveness have documented less impressive clinical impacts. Similarly, probiotic consumption is growing rapidly. Although several strains appear to reduce the duration of diarrhea in hospitalized children, current data are insufficient to support the routine use of probiotics in outpatient pediatric AGE.

Summary

Ondansetron and probiotics may improve patient outcomes in pediatric AGE. Appropriate strategies are needed to optimally integrate oral ondansetron into clinical practice to maximize its potential benefits. Although probiotics remain a promising option, there are challenges in generalizing the data available to patients presenting for outpatient care. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively guide the clinical use of probiotics in outpatients in developed countries.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^112acgxv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Ancillary management — antimotility, antinausea, and antiemetic agents: Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate); loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). An antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate). During acute gastroenteritis, more children receiving ondansetron, compared with placebo, had resolution of vomiting and ondansetron reduced the immediate need for hospitalization or intravenous rehydration; however, ondansetron did not decrease hospitalization rates at 72 hours after discharge and diarrhea was reported as a side effect. A recommendation cannot be made for the routine use of antiemetic agents for acute gastroenteritis in children < 4 years of age or in adults; bismuth subsalicylate is mildly effective, and racecadotril reduces stool volume but is not available in North America.

### Oral ondansetron in management of dehydrating diarrhea with vomiting in children aged 3 months to 5 years: a randomized controlled trial [^112xGHPE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of oral ondansetron in facilitating successful rehydration of under-5-year-old children suffering from acute diarrhea with vomiting and some dehydration.

Study Design

Children (n = 170) aged 3 months to 5 years with acute diarrhea with vomiting and some dehydration were enrolled in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The participants were randomized to receive either single dose of oral ondansetron (n = 85) or placebo (n = 85) in addition to standard management of dehydration according to World Health Organization guidelines. Failure of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), administration of unscheduled intravenous fluids, and amount of oral rehydration solution intake in 4 hours were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcome measures included duration of dehydration correction, number of vomiting episodes, adverse effects, and caregiver satisfaction.

Results

Failure of ORT was significantly less in children receiving ondansetron compared with those receiving placebo (31% vs 62%; P < .001; relative risk 0.50, 95% CI 0.35–0.72). Almost one-half of the children in the ondansetron group received intravenous fluids compared with those in the placebo group, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.074; relative risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.30–1.07). The oral rehydration solution consumption was significantly more in the ondansetron group (645 mL vs 554 mL; mean difference 91 mL; 95% CI: 35–148 mL). Patients in the ondansetron group also showed faster rehydration, lesser number of vomiting episodes, and better caregiver satisfaction.

Conclusion

A single oral dose of ondansetron, given before starting ORT to children < 5 years of age with acute diarrhea and vomiting results in better oral rehydration.

### Update on prolonged and persistent diarrhea in children [^114xaokp]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight recent advances in our understanding of prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea in children. The focus is on the contribution of these illnesses to the global burden of diarrhea, their impact on childhood growth and development, novel epidemiologic links between prolonged and persistent diarrheal episodes, and strategies for their prevention and management.

Recent Findings

Although less common than acute diarrhea, prolonged and persistent episodes of diarrhea in childhood constitute a significant portion of the global burden of diarrhea. These episodes also play a key role in the vicious cycle of childhood diarrhea and malnutrition in which undernutrition is both a risk factor and an outcome of diarrhea. Increased efforts to provide WHO-recommended zinc therapy for all children with diarrhea in developing countries will significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. In children who develop persistent diarrhea, yogurt-based or amino acid-based diets may accelerate their recovery.

Summary

In addition to increased implementation of strategies already known to effectively prevent and manage acute diarrhea, further research is needed to address the recognition, prevention, and treatment of prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea in resource-limited settings.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^111GRniC]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

World Health Organization rehydration management guidelines (plan C) for severe dehydration are widely practiced in resource-poor settings, but never formally evaluated in a trial. The Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Therapy trial raised concerns regarding the safety of bolus therapy for septic shock, warranting a formal evaluation of rehydration therapy for gastroenteritis.

Methods

A multi-centre open-label phase II randomised controlled trial evaluated two rehydration strategies in 122 Ugandan/Kenyan children aged 60days to 12years with severe dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. We compared the safety and efficacy of standard rapid rehydration using Ringer's lactate (100 ml/kg over 3h (6h if < 1 year), incorporating 0.9% saline boluses for children with shock (plan C) versus slower rehydration: 100 ml/kg Ringer's lactate over 8h (all ages) without boluses (slow: experimental). The primary outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) within 48h including cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included clinical, biochemical and physiological measures of response to treatment by intravenous rehydration.

Results

One hundred twenty-two eligible children (median (IQR) age 8 (6–12) months) were randomised to plan C (n = 61) or slow (n = 61), with two (2%) lost to follow-up at day 7). Following randomisation mean (SD) time to start intravenous rehydration started was 15 min (18) in both arms. Mean (SD) fluid received by 1 hour was greater in plan C (mean 20.2 ml/kg (12.2) and 33.1 ml/kg (17) for children < 1year and > - 1 year respectively) versus 10.4 ml/kg (6.6) in slow arm. By 8 hours volume received were similar mean (SD) plan C: 96.3 ml/kg (15.6) and 97.8 ml/kg (10.0) for children < 1 and ≥ 1 year respectively vs 93.2 ml/kg (12.2) in slow arm. By 48-h, three (5%) plan C vs two (3%) slow had an SAE (risk ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.12–3.85, p = 0.65). There was no difference in time to the correction of dehydration (p = 0.9) or time to discharge (p = 0.8) between groups. Atrial natriuretic peptide levels rose substantially by 8 hours in both arms, which persisted to day 7. Day 7 weights suggested only 33 (29%) could be retrospectively classified as severely dehydration (≥ 10% weight loss).

Conclusion

Slower rehydration over 8 hours appears to be safe, easier to implement than plan C. Future large trials with mortality as the primary endpoint are warranted.

### Slow progress in diarrhea case management in low and middle income countries: evidence from cross-sectional national surveys, 1985–2012 [^113QuWJg]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Data characteristics

Data on various indicators were available for a total of 71–116 countries from one or more surveys in each country (from either DHS and/or MICS), during the time period from 1985 to 2012 and the total number of surveys ranged from 71 to 282 in all the countries (data not shown), depending on the case management indicator that was assessed.

In total, data about diarrhea case management was available from 285 surveys (77 countries). The numbers for the total surveys and countries included in this analysis varied since the number of DHS and MICS done in each country differed and data on some indicators was not available in some surveys. Data on childhood diarrhea was available from DHS and MICS for a total of 914.1million under-5 children (Table 1).

Trends in case management of diarrhea

The number of surveys in each year, the overall population of under-5 children surveyed, and diarrhea case management indicators are shown in Table 1. Based on the current case management indicators from DHS and MICS data during the first decade of the 21st century the total numbers (in millions) of children suffering from diarrhea who were not given ORS, ORS-RHF and 'increased fluids' were 304.4, 348.5, 314.7, and 397.5 millions, respectively. Further 304.4 million children were not taken to a HCP. Though these estimates are only indicators of the magnitude of the problem of sub-optimal diarrhea management, the numbers may help mobilization of resources at global and national levels to improve childhood diarrhea case management. Overall use rates for ORS, ORS-RHF were < 50%. From pre-2000 to post-2000 period, the indicator ' increased fluids ' decreased from 41 to 31.5% and there was a marginal increase in ORS use rate (28.1 to 32.2%) and ORS-RHF rate (35.7 to 41.5%).

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1141S8pV]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

We did not publish a protocol prior to conducting this review. We registered our search strategies on PROSPERO on 21st May 2017 (review number 67532). We used pre-defined rules relating to eligibility criteria, information sources to be searched, study selection, data collection process, and assessment of risk of bias in identified studies.

Selection criteria and process

Population

Children aged 0 to 18 years with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis and moderate or severe dehydration. Due to the possible variation in the diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis, where this was not clearly defined in the manuscript, we planned to use either the ESPGHAN or WHO definition for acute gastroenteritis. Where the level of dehydration in trial participants was not clearly defined we used the WHO guideline definition for moderate and severe dehydration. We excluded studies with severe malnutrition and chronic or persistent diarrhoea according to WHO definitions (i.e. lasting ≥ 14 days).

Intervention

Interventions included any form of intravenous rehydration with isotonic solutions e.g. 0.9% sodium chloride or Ringer's lactate for rehydration. Studies that involved the use of hypotonic solutions were excluded since these are not recommended for intravenous rehydration.

Comparison

A comparator was considered as any of the above intravenous isotonic solution given at different rates for rehydration. Enteral therapies were not considered.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome of interest was mortality. Secondary endpoints included treatment efficacy (as defined in the study protocols - see below) and safety outcomes (within 28 days of rehydration). These included:
Proportion of participants with a pre-defined serious adverse event (other than death). Where this was not clear we used the definition from the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline: any adverse event is life-threatening, or requires hospitalisation or prolongation of hospital stay, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Pre-specified SAEs were new onset seizures, pulmonary oedema, cerebral oedema and cardiac failure.
Proportion of participants with dysnatraemia at 4–6 h after the initiation of intravenous rehydration. Dysnatraemia was defined as a serum sodium level outside the normal range (135–145 mmol/L). Where dysnatraemia was present at enrolment, we planned to compare the magnitude (percentage) of decrease or increase in serum sodium levels from baseline at enrolment.

### Rehydration: role for early use of intravenous dextrose [^115jLK8E]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis is a common reason for children to seek health care. Among the potential complications of acute gastroenteritis, the most common is dehydration. For mild to moderate dehydration, treatment options include oral and intravenous rehydration. Outpatient treatment failure for either method, when it occurs, is often due to persistent nausea and vomiting. Some authorities have suggested that the early administration of dextrose to patients receiving intravenous rehydration may help terminate vomiting and result in fewer outpatient treatment failures. The purpose of this report was to review the evidence supporting the effectiveness of early intravenous dextrose administration in the outpatient management of dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

(1 capsule = 2 mg)

Patients should receive appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed.

Acute Diarrhea

Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool. Daily dose should not exceed 16mg (eight capsules). Clinical improvement is usually observed within 48 hours.

Children: In children 2 to 5 years of age (20 kg or less), the non-prescription liquid formulation (IMODIUM® A-D 1 mg/7.5 mL) should be used; for ages 6 to 12, either IMODIUM® Capsules or IMODIUM® A-D Liquid may be used. For children 2 to 12 years of age, the following schedule for capsules or liquid will usually fulfill initial dosage requirements:

Recommended First Day Dosage Schedule

Two to five years: 1 mg t.i.d. (3mg daily dose) (13 to 20 kg)

Six to eight years: 2 mg b.i.d. (4mg daily dose) (20 to 30 kg)

Eight to twelve years: 2mg t.i.d. (6mg daily dose) (greater than 30 kg)

Recommended Subsequent Daily Dosage

Following the first treatment day, it is recommended that subsequent IMODIUM® doses (1 mg/10 kg body weight) be administered only after a loose stool. Total daily dosage should not exceed recommended dosages for the first day.

Chronic Diarrhea

Children: Although IMODIUM® has been studied in a limited number of children with chronic diarrhea; the therapeutic dose for the treatment of chronic diarrhea in a pediatric population has not been established.

Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM® should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.

The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM® administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116CuDrD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — diagnostic yield and selective testing report that among adults presenting with diarrhea to emergency departments in the United States, 17% of patients who submitted a stool specimen (as opposed to rectal swab) were found to have a bacterial enteric infection, that a bacterial etiology was found in 5%–11% of children seeking care in emergency departments and outpatient settings, and that restricting testing to patients with bloody stools, fever, or abdominal tenderness can increase the likelihood of identifying a bacterial pathogen; testing all patients with acute diarrhea for these pathogens would be inefficient.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^112hFBS8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary outcomes

1. Time in hospital

Two studies evaluating 90 children reported results on time in hospital or length of stay (Kartha 2017; Mahajan 2012). Balanced solutions likely results in a slight reduction of the time in hospital compared to 0.9% saline (MD −0.35 days, 95% CI −0.60 to −0.10; moderate‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1).

Sensitivity and subgroup analyses

We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses excluding studies with high or unclear risk of bias in the sequence generation or allocation concealment (selection bias) domains. Only one study was classified as such (Allen 2016). Its removal from the meta‐analysis did not yield any difference in comparison to the primary analysis (MD −0.33 days, 95% CI −0.59 to −0.07). We could not perform the planned subgroup analyses based on the type of balanced solution or the severity of the dehydration due to the low number of studies.

2. Mortality (during hospitalization)

One study including 22 children reported results on mortality (Mahajan 2012). There was one death in the 0.9% saline group and none in the balanced solution group. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of balanced solutions on mortality compared to 0.9% saline (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.39; very low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.2).

Sensitivity and subgroup analyses

We could not perform the planned sensitivity analysis excluding studies of high or unclear risk of selection bias. There was only one study for this analysis, and we judged it an unclear risk of selection bias. Similarly, we could not perform the planned subgroup analyses based on the type of balanced solution or the severity of the dehydration due to the low number of studies.

Secondary outcomes

3. Need for additional fluids

One study including 22 children reported results on the need for additional fluids (Mahajan 2012). Four children required additional fluids after the initial fluid therapy with balanced solutions compared to six children in the 0.9% saline group. The evidence suggests that balanced solutions probably produce no changes in the need for additional fluids compared to 0.9% saline (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.72; low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.3).

### Oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy… [^116rHa27]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

The development of oral therapy for the rehydration and maintenance of children with dehydrating diarrhea has become the worldwide mainstay of national diarrheal control programs. More recently, proper nutrition for children with diarrhea is viewed as an important adjunct to therapy, whereas antibiotics and other drugs play only a limited role. Intravenous therapy remains essential for diarrheal episodes associated with severe dehydration. The solution was tested for both rehydration and maintenance therapy among patients with severe and moderate dehydration and was found effective and safe when appropriately used. Providing additional drinking water at the bedside of rehydrated patients allowed for excretion of any excess salt intake. More importantly, oral therapy — first introduced at Dhaka — allowed fluid losses to be replaced in a timely manner and on a volume-for-volume basis with rehydration solution.

Since the purging rate of patients declines with time, this therapeutic method proved essential for safe and effective practical oral therapy that included maintenance of electrolyte and water balance without causing either excessive or inadequate replacement of water or salts. These methods were later further adapted and developed into simple guidelines suitable for use in less severely ill patients with cholera, for the treatment of persons with noncholera diarrheas, and for the instruction of nurses, paramedicals, and parents. Many physicians continue to recommend a variety of "clear liquids" to treat patients with diarrhea, instead of an appropriately composed ORS. These "clear fluids" can cause osmotic diarrhea and electrolyte imbalance, and they often contain inadequate sodium bicarbonate and excess sugar for appropriate replacement of stool losses.

These simple rules effectively teach the proper procedure for mixing and administering the solution, when to change to other dietary fluids and foods, and how to avoid therapeutic starvation. Several approaches are effective, but all of them include communicating to the parent or guardian simple guidelines enabling him or her to mix the solution appropriately. These guidelines also permit the amount of oral solution administered to be related to the condition of the child and the frequency of stools. When fluids with greater than 60 mEq/L of sodium are used for maintenance, other low-sodium fluids, such as breast milk, diluted or undiluted infant formula, or water, need to be administered as well to prevent sodium overload. The most widely used solutions in the United States, Pedialyte and Ricelyte, contain 45 and 50 mEq/L of sodium, respectively.
