## Question

Term pregnant woman with ruptured membranes develops sudden chills, dyspnea, confusion, hypoxemia, hypotension, crackles, and bright red bleeding with undetectable fibrinogen shortly after combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.

Two hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 40 weeks' gestation is evaluated for the sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension. The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current condition?

Answer Choices:
A. Apical ballooning of the left ventricle
B. Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins
C. Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space
D. Systemic bacterial infection

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis best explains a term pregnant patient with ruptured membranes who, shortly after combined spinal–epidural anesthesia, develops sudden chills, dyspnea, confusion, hypoxemia, hypotension, crackles, bright red bleeding, and undetectable fibrinogen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it matches a recognized obstetric emergency. Then, I should verify the timing relative to anesthesia and labor events. Next, I will examine each alternative diagnosis against the data, including Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, and sepsis. Finally, I will align the most likely diagnosis with guideline-based management implications to confirm the answer.

> Let me first confirm the syndrome. The constellation of sudden hypoxemia, hypotension, altered mental status, and profound coagulopathy with undetectable fibrinogen in the peripartum period is classic for amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), also known as anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy, which is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion characterized by rapid cardiopulmonary collapse and DIC in temporal relation to labor or delivery [^0671eb72] [^e91cfae4] [^47dbd3a4].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and triggers. AFE classically occurs during labor, at delivery, or immediately postpartum; here, the event follows rupture of membranes and neuraxial anesthesia, both of which can coincide with uterine activity and pressure changes that facilitate amniotic fluid entry into maternal circulation, and the onset within hours of admission fits the expected window for AFE presentation [^0671eb72] [^845c4046].

> I will now examine Option A, apical ballooning of the left ventricle (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). Initially, I thought the acute pulmonary edema and shock could fit, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; Takotsubo typically presents with chest pain or dyspnea and reversible LV wall motion abnormalities without the profound, consumptive coagulopathy seen here, so the undetectable fibrinogen makes Takotsubo unlikely as the primary driver of this collapse [^0671eb72].

> Next, I should review Option C, anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space implying high neuraxial blockade or local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). High spinal could cause hypotension and respiratory compromise, but it would not explain the severe coagulopathy and bright red bleeding; LAST would more often present with seizures and arrhythmias rather than DIC, and the timing and pattern do not match LAST, so this option is inconsistent with the laboratory findings [^59d25d9a].

> Let me consider Option D, systemic bacterial infection or sepsis. Sepsis can cause shock and coagulopathy, but the tempo here is too abrupt for typical chorioamnionitis, and the undetectable fibrinogen with massive hemorrhage is far more characteristic of AFE-related consumptive coagulopathy than sepsis alone; moreover, the absence of fever and the classic peripartum collapse pattern argue against sepsis as the primary etiology in this scenario [^notfound].

> Now, Option B, amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins, aligns tightly with AFE pathophysiology. AFE is triggered by entry of amniotic fluid and fetal debris into maternal circulation, provoking an anaphylactoid response with pulmonary vasoconstriction, right ventricular failure, and systemic inflammatory activation leading to DIC; the timing after membrane rupture and neuraxial anesthesia, the abrupt hypoxemia and shock, and the undetectable fibrinogen with bright red bleeding are all classic for AFE, and guidelines emphasize recognizing AFE clinically when this triad appears in the peripartum period [^0671eb72] [^a164dd13] [^47dbd3a4].

> Hold on, I should verify management implications to ensure internal consistency. AFE management is supportive with immediate resuscitation, early recognition of right ventricular failure, avoidance of fluid overload, and aggressive treatment of coagulopathy with balanced transfusion and early fibrinogen repletion; this aligns with the need for urgent massive transfusion and hemostatic resuscitation implied by undetectable fibrinogen and ongoing bleeding, reinforcing the diagnosis rather than contradicting it [^5ea646f8] [^ac59ba84] [^cf6e9b45].

> Putting this together, the most likely underlying cause is amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins with subsequent AFE, given the classic triad of hypoxemia, hypotension, and coagulopathy, the peripartum timing, and the lack of a better-fitting alternative explanation; therefore, the correct answer is B [^0671eb72] [^e91cfae4].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **amniotic fluid embolism (AFE)** [^0671eb72], given the classic triad of sudden hypoxemia, hypotension, and coagulopathy with undetectable fibrinogen [^047cb9eb] occurring shortly after rupture of membranes and neuraxial anesthesia [^notfound]. AFE is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion [^e91cfae4] and requires immediate supportive care, including oxygenation, hemodynamic support, and aggressive management of DIC with blood products [^5ea646f8] [^ac59ba84]. The other options do not fit the full picture: apical ballooning (Takotsubo) lacks coagulopathy, local anesthetic toxicity would present with seizures or arrhythmias rather than DIC, and systemic infection would typically show fever and a more gradual course [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features supporting amniotic fluid embolism

AFE typically presents with the following **clinical features**, which are consistent with this patient's presentation:

- **Sudden onset of dyspnea and hypoxemia**: The patient presents with severe dyspnea and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation 82% on room air), which are hallmark features of AFE [^0671eb72].

- **Hypotension and cardiovascular collapse**: The patient exhibits profound hypotension (blood pressure 70/30 mmHg), indicating cardiovascular collapse, another classic feature of AFE [^0671eb72].

- **Coagulopathy and hemorrhage**: The presence of undetectable fibrinogen and bright red bleeding from the cervical canal indicates disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a common complication of AFE [^047cb9eb].

- **Altered mental status**: The patient experiences confusion, which is consistent with cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxemia seen in AFE [^notfound].

- **Timing**: AFE typically occurs during labor, delivery, or immediately postpartum, often associated with rupture of membranes or uterine manipulation [^0671eb72].

---

## Pathophysiology of amniotic fluid embolism

AFE is believed to result from the entry of amniotic fluid and fetal debris into the maternal circulation, triggering a **severe anaphylactoid reaction** [^3a78c6d9]. This reaction leads to:

- **Pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypertension**: Causing acute right ventricular failure and hypoxemia [^a164dd13].

- **Systemic inflammatory response**: Leading to capillary leak, hypotension, and multi-organ dysfunction [^notfound].

- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: Consumption of clotting factors, including fibrinogen, resulting in severe hemorrhage [^047cb9eb].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While AFE is the most likely diagnosis, other conditions should be considered and excluded:

| **Condition** | **Rationale for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Apical ballooning (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) | - Typically presents with chest pain and cardiac dysfunction <br/> - Does not usually cause severe coagulopathy or hemorrhage [^notfound] |
| Local anesthetic toxicity | - Presents with seizures, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse <br/> - Does not cause coagulopathy or hemorrhage [^59d25d9a] |
| Systemic bacterial infection (sepsis) | - Usually presents with fever, leukocytosis, and a more gradual onset <br/> - Does not typically cause sudden severe coagulopathy without preceding infection [^notfound] |

---

## Management of amniotic fluid embolism

Immediate management of AFE includes:

- **Supportive care**: Oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamic support with vasopressors and inotropes [^5ea646f8].

- **Management of coagulopathy**: Aggressive replacement of blood products, including packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets [^ac59ba84].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Involving obstetrics, anesthesia, critical care, and neonatology teams [^13dc01bf].

- **Consideration of extracorporeal support**: In severe cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered [^0e3aecda].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **amniotic fluid embolism (AFE)** [^0671eb72], characterized by sudden hypoxemia, hypotension, and coagulopathy. Immediate recognition and aggressive supportive management are critical to improving maternal outcomes [^5ea646f8].

### Sudden respiratory and circulatory collapse after cesarean section: amniotic fluid embolism or other reasons?-a case report [^394f77e1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Conclusion

After an uncomplicated caesarean section at term, this healthy parturient had a sudden cardiorespiratory collapse. An unexpectedly high level of neuraxial anesthesia need to be considered as a cause of intraoperative cardiorespiratory collapse. However, in this case, so much time had passed since the injection of local anesthetics, and subsequent events seemed unlikely to be directly related to an anesthesia complication. Moreover, the parturient was very young and had no history of heart disease, and the intraoperative electrocardiography did not suggest arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and infarction. Therefore, cardiovascular events were also excluded.

Amniotic-fluid embolism (AFE), although extremely rare, is well known and dreadful for obstetricians, and because it seemed the most likely explanation for this patient's condition at the time of the cardiopulmonary collapse, this diagnosis will immediately become the focus of the consideration. AFE is characterized by acute and rapid collapse, that affects pregnant women shortly before, during, or immediately following labor and childbirth, as a result of amniotic fluid or fetal material entering the maternal circulatory system. The rate at which it occurs is approximately 1 in 40,000 births and the estimated mortality (death) rate is 11–44%. The typical presentation of AFE includes two phases. A first phase is marked by acute respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse. This is followed by a second phase which is characterised by massive hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) or consumptive coagulopathy develops. Unfortunately, there is no quick, standard laboratory test for AFE, therefore the diagnosis is one of exclusion based on presenting symptoms and clinical course, very often on postmortem report. As in this patient, sudden onset of dyspnea in the face of cardiovascular collapse should lead the clinician to suspect AFE and initiate aggressive and supportive treatment. However, there was no evidence of bleeding. After a short period, she made an uneventful initial recovery. Particularly, later on, the patient developed a rash, which indicated the presence of other cause for the sudden onset of cardiorespiratory compromise. Then, AFE should be overdiagnosed.

Background

Sudden respiratory and circulatory collapse after cesarean section is a clinical condition that may lead to poor maternal outcome. Because a number of clinical events in pregnancy may be responsible for cardiopulmonary collapse, sometimes, it is difficult to make a timely exact diagnosis. Importantly, establishment of appropriate supportive treatment is required. We present a healthy parturient suffering from unexplained cardiopulmonary collapse after an uneventful cesarean section and briefly discuss the more common reasons and the management for the clinical settings.

Amniotic fluid embolism — typical presentation and diagnostic considerations include a triad of sudden hypoxia and hypotension, followed in many cases by coagulopathy, all occurring in relation to labor and delivery; the diagnosis is clinical based on these elements and exclusion of other likely causes, and amniotic fluid embolism should be considered in the differential diagnosis in any pregnant or immediately postpartum woman with sudden cardiovascular collapse or cardiac arrest, seizures, severe respiratory difficulty, or hypoxia, particularly if followed by an otherwise unexplained coagulopathy.

Pulmonary embolism is the primary cause of acute respiratory decompensation during pregnancy. Regardless of the nature of the embolism, a high index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and aggressive resuscitation need to be instituted to achieve a successful maternal and fetal outcome. Several clinical characteristics will assist practitioners to distinguish among the different forms of embolism and to institute specific measures of treatment.

### Case report of amniotic fluid embolism coagulopathy following abortion; use of viscoelastic point-of-care analysis [^e49aa2c7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case demonstrates the potential advantages of the use of viscoelastic point-of-care coagulation analyzers for the management of coagulopathy in the setting of a suspected AFE. While legal induced abortions are safe procedures which can be performed in an outpatient setting in most cases, our case also serves as a reminder to clinicians that rare pregnancy-related complications including AFE can occur.

When confronted with pregnancy-related cardiovascular collapse and profound coagulopathy, AFE should be considered in the differential diagnosis, along with pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, anesthetic complication, anaphylaxis, and acute massive blood loss. When coagulopathy is associated with cardiovascular dysfunction, and massive blood loss has been ruled out, as in our case, AFE should be suspected. Classically a clinical triad of hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy is seen in AFEs, with common symptoms including dyspnea, cyanosis, and loss of consciousness. However, this triad is not universally present. The diagnosis of AFE is a diagnosis of exclusion that relies on clinical presentation, as no reliable gold standard laboratory testing to confirm AFE currently exists. There is growing interest in biomarkers, such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, in aiding in diagnosis.

### Sudden respiratory and circulatory collapse after cesarean section: amniotic fluid embolism or other reasons?-a case report [^a327860d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

For a healthy parturient, a cardiopulmonary collapse that suddenly occurs shortly after an uneventful caesarean section is a relatively rare event and presents a significant challenge for the anesthesia provider.

Case Presentation

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is characterized by acute and rapid collapse and is well known to the obstetric team. Our patient experienced sudden cardiovascular collapse, severe respiratory difficulty and hypoxia, in the absence of other explanations for these findings at the time, and thus AFE was immediately become the focus of the consideration. However, there is no quick, standard laboratory test for AFE, therefore the diagnosis is one of exclusion based on presenting symptoms and clinical course. After given symptomatic treatment, the patient made an uneventful initial recovery in a short period and developed a rash. We recognized that the postpartum shock was associated with delayed anaphylaxis of antibiotics.

Conclusions

These observations have implications for understanding whenever administering drugs in surgery, which may affect the anesthesiologist's judgment regarding the complications of anesthesia. Even though serious complications of common perioperative drugs may rarely occur, anesthesia providers should be aware of the consideration. Early recognition and effective treatment are more important than prompt diagnosis.

### Amniotic fluid embolism [^77b4ad13]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism is a catastrophic syndrome occurring during labor and delivery or immediately postpartum. Although presenting symptoms may vary, common clinical features include shortness of breath, altered mental status followed by sudden cardiovascular collapse, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and maternal death. It was first recognized as a syndrome in 1941, when two investigators described fetal mucin and squamous cells during postmortem examination of the pulmonary vasculature in women who had unexplained obstetric deaths. Since then, many studies, case reports, and series have been published in an attempt to elucidate the etiology, risk factors, and pathogenesis of this mysterious obstetric complication.

### Sudden onset of syncope and disseminated intravascular coagulation at 14 weeks of pregnancy: a case report [^2a374ef8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Although there is a lack of international consensus regarding the diagnostic criteria for AFE/ASP, Clark et al. proposed 4 uniform criteria for research studies: the sudden onset of cardiorespiratory arrest or hypotension with respiratory compromise; documentation of overt DIC; clinical onset during labor or within 30 min of delivery of the placenta; and the absence of fever during labor. Based on these criteria, only classic and typical presentations are recognized as true AFE/ASP. Because our patient did not satisfy the first or third criterion, it is possible that an etiology other than AFE/ASP was responsible for the sudden onset of syncope and DIC. As we did not perform any drug or toxicology screening, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that her presentation was attributable to poisoning or medication. Less typical presentations of AFE/ASP are classified as the following nonspecific medical conditions, each much more common than AFE/ASP: hemorrhage, sepsis, anesthetic accident, pulmonary thromboembolism, or systemic anaphylaxis. However, based on our patient's clinical and laboratory findings, these other medical conditions are not likely to account for her initial condition, with sudden-onset syncope and DIC. Furthermore, the details of the onset of syncope with DIC; the absence of apparent clinical signs associated with poisoning; the absence of a significant medical history, including seizures or syncopal episodes; and the absence of medication use, collectively indicate a low possibility of poisoning or medication as the etiology of her presentation.

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) synopsis — clinical features and diagnostic considerations: Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by sudden hemodynamic and respiratory compromise during labor or shortly after delivery that can lead to cardiac arrest, with disseminated intravascular coagulation and resultant hemorrhage described as a hallmark feature. Historic descriptions attributing AFE to fetal cells obstructing the pulmonary vasculature are stated to be incorrect. Echocardiography for increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular failure, and viscoelastic testing for hyperfibrinolysis, have been proposed to aid in timely diagnosis, although national diagnostic guidelines vary without a reference standard. These recommendations inform the management of pregnant patients with life-threatening AFE, including cardiac arrest, and refer to Figure 5 for pregnancy modifications to standard ALS.

### Amniotic fluid embolism [^f763e7fa]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism is one of the most catastrophic complications of pregnancy. First described in 1941, the condition is exceedingly rare and the exact pathophysiology is still unknown. The etiology was thought to be embolic in nature, but more recent evidence suggests an immunologic basis. Common presenting symptoms include dyspnea, nonreassuring fetal status, hypotension, seizures, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Early recognition of amniotic fluid embolism is critical to a successful outcome. However, despite intensive resuscitation, outcomes are frequently poor for both infant and mother. Recently, aggressive and successful management of amniotic fluid embolism with recombinant factor VIIa and a ventricular assist device, inhaled nitric oxide, cardiopulmonary bypass and intraaortic balloon pump with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have been reported and should be considered in select cases.

### Pulmonary embolism and amniotic fluid embolism in pregnancy [^c9af2676]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism and pulmonary embolism are 2 of the most common causes of maternal mortality in the developed world. Symptoms of pulmonary embolism include tachycardia, tachypnea, and shortness of breath, all of which are common complaints in pregnancy. Heightened awareness leads to rapid diagnosis and institution of therapy. Amniotic fluid embolism is associated with maternal collapse. There are currently no proven therapies, although rapid initiation of supportive care may decrease the risk of mortality.

### Fetal outcome in the critically ill pregnant woman [^77e44526]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Management of the critically ill pregnant woman is complicated by potential adverse effects of both maternal illness and ICU interventions on the fetus. This paper reviews the potential risks to the fetus of maternal critical illness, including shock, hypoxemia, and fever, as well as the effects of critical care management, such as drug therapy and radiological investigations. The authors' recommended approach to management is provided. Prior publications and new data presented identify that there is insufficient information to prognosticate accurately on fetal outcome after maternal critical illness, although maternal shock, hypoxemia and early gestational age are likely significant risk factors.

Proposed pathophysiology of amniotic fluid embolism — per figure, disruption of the maternal/fetal interface with potential passage of amniotic fluid to maternal circulation initiates pathways that include acute respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia; increased levels of pulmonary vasoconstrictors and mechanical obstruction from cellular and acellular components of amniotic fluid leading to acute right ventricular failure and hemodynamic collapse from right ventricular infarction and/or interventricular septum displacement to the left and decreased left sided cardiac output; and activation of Factor VII and platelets with consequent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with inflammatory amplification of the clotting cascade, in which hemorrhage contributes to hemodynamic instability, diffuse intravascular clotting from DIC contributes to ischemic distal organ dysfunction and multi organ failure, and late onset left ventricular failure with cardiogenic pulmonary edema and systemic hypotension may occur.

### Consumptive coagulopathy involving amniotic fluid embolism: the importance of earlier assessments for interventions in critical care [^7c85b8d8]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We herein proposed for the first time a clinically available index, the H/F ratio, which indicated severity of consumptive coagulopathy in the early phase of onset in AFE patients. Furthermore, we propose a preemptive strategy of assessments and interventions for AFE based on the Japanese AFE criteria and H/F ratio shown in Figure 3. When patients have dyspnea, hypotension, impaired consciousness, or postpartum hemorrhage during labor or a few hours after delivery, AFE needs to be clinically differentiated from other critical diseases, such as pulmonary thromboembolism, peripartum cardiomyopathy, or intracranial hemorrhage, based on the Japanese AFE diagnostic criteria. In the case of cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the first priority; nevertheless, the following proposed second screening is recommended simultaneously during resuscitation or immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation, because cardiac arrest, also recognized as one of the symptoms of AFE, and resuscitation induce hyperfibrinolytic DIC. We propose a complete blood count and measurement of fibrinogen levels, as well as-dimer if possible, in the second screening. If the H/F ratio (both in g/L) is calculated as more than 100, which is evaluated as "preceding consumptive coagulopathy", physicians are encouraged to administer promptly coagulation factors with fresh frozen plasma or a cryoprecipitate. A calculated H/F ratio of less than 100 suggests that the patient is also affected by dilutional coagulopathy due to considerable bleeding. However, if the fibrinogen level is less than 1.5 g/L, the earlier replacement of blood coagulation factors is recommended according to the Japanese guidelines. Based on our previous report, earlier interventions with plasma-derived blood products might further inhibit an anaphylactoid reaction in the lungs and uterus effectively. On the other hand, repeated screening of blood coagulability is recommended when fibrinogen levels are maintained at more than 1.5 g/L, because patients may be at risk of further deteriorations in blood coagulation. However, the H/F ratio may not be accurately evaluated after transfusions with blood products due to modified hemoglobin and fibrinogen values. When patients are included in the first screening based on the Japanese AFE diagnostic criteria, those with-dimer higher than 40, indicating highly elevated PIC (Fig. 2 F), are considered to have hyperfibrinolysis, which may be treated with antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, a universally available antifibrinolytic drug. Previously reported doses of tranexamic acid were between 1 and 2 g based on the findings of large randomized control trials on postpartum hemorrhage and severe trauma.

Objective

We sought to provide evidence-based guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of amniotic fluid embolism.

Study Design

A systematic literature review was performed using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. The search was restricted to English-language articles published from 1966 through March 2015. Priority was given to articles reporting original research, in particular randomized controlled trials, although review articles and commentaries were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion. Evidence reports and published guidelines were also reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used for defining the strength of recommendations and rating quality of the evidence. Consistent with US Preventive Task Force guidelines, references were evaluated for quality based on the highest level of evidence.

Results and Recommendations

We recommend the following: (1) we recommend consideration of amniotic fluid embolism in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiorespiratory collapse in the laboring or recently delivered woman (GRADE 1C); (2) we do not recommend the use of any specific diagnostic laboratory test to either confirm or refute the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism; at the present time, amniotic fluid embolism remains a clinical diagnosis (GRADE 1C); (3) we recommend the provision of immediate high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation with standard basic cardiac life support and advanced cardiac life support protocols in patients who develop cardiac arrest associated with amniotic fluid embolism (GRADE 1C); (4) we recommend that a multidisciplinary team including anesthesia, respiratory therapy, critical care, and maternal-fetal medicine should be involved in the ongoing care of women with AFE (Best Practice); (5) following cardiac arrest with amniotic fluid embolism, we recommend immediate delivery in the presence of a fetus ≥ 23 weeks of gestation (GRADE 2C); (6) we recommend the provision of adequate oxygenation and ventilation and, when indicated by hemodynamic status, the use of vasopressors and inotropic agents in the initial management of amniotic fluid embolism. Excessive fluid administration should be avoided (GRADE 1C); and (7) because coagulopathy may follow cardiovascular collapse with amniotic fluid embolism, we recommend the early assessment of clotting status and early aggressive management of clinical bleeding with standard massive transfusion protocols (GRADE 1C).

### Amniotic fluid embolism and isolated coagulopathy: atypical presentation of amniotic fluid embolism [^9b63eb0b]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old multigravida presented at 32 weeks of gestation with polyhydramnios and an anencephalic fetus. Abnormal bleeding as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation complicated an emergency Caesarean section for severe abdominal pain thought to be due to uterine rupture. Massive transfusion with blood products was necessary and the abdomen packed to control bleeding. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where she made a slow but complete recovery. Amniotic fluid embolism with atypical presentation of isolated coagulopathy is the likely diagnosis in this case. The case serves to demonstrate that amniotic fluid embolism may present with symptoms and signs other than the classical pattern of dyspnoea, cyanosis and hypotension.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^d97b2c9c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

SMFM Clinical Guidelines No. 9 — amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) diagnosis and management recommendations state: we recommend consideration of amniotic fluid embolism in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiorespiratory collapse in the laboring or recently delivered woman (GRADE 1C). We do not recommend the use of any specific diagnostic laboratory test to either confirm or refute the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism; at the present time, amniotic fluid embolism remains a clinical diagnosis (GRADE 1C). We recommend the provision of immediate high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation with standard basic cardiac life support and advanced cardiac life support protocols in patients who develop cardiac arrest associated with amniotic fluid embolism (GRADE 1C). We recommend that a multidisciplinary team including anesthesia, respiratory therapy, critical care, and maternal-fetal medicine should be involved in the ongoing care of women with AFE (Best Practice). Following cardiac arrest with amniotic fluid embolism, we recommend immediate delivery in the presence of a fetus ≥ 23 weeks of gestation (GRADE 2C). We recommend the provision of adequate oxygenation and ventilation and, when indicated by hemodynamic status, the use of vasopressors and inotropic agents in the initial management of amniotic fluid embolism, and excessive fluid administration should be avoided (GRADE 1C). Because coagulopathy may follow cardiovascular collapse with amniotic fluid embolism, we recommend the early assessment of clotting status and early aggressive management of clinical bleeding with standard massive transfusion protocols (GRADE 1C).

### Obstetric emergencies [^74625045]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Obstetric hemorrhage is still a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Prevention, early recognition, and prompt intervention are the keys to minimizing complications. Resuscitation can be inadequate because of under-estimation of blood loss and misleading maternal response. A young woman may maintain a normal blood pressure until sudden and catastrophic decompensation occurs. All members of the obstetric team should know how to manage hemorrhage because timing is of the essence. Good communication with the blood bank ensures timely release of appropriate blood products. A well-coordinated team is one of the most important elements in the care of a compromised fetus. If fetal anoxia is presumed, there is less than 10 minutes to permanent fetal brain damage. Antepartum anesthesia consultation should be encouraged in parturients with medical problems.

### A postpartum death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States [^ea9ddea5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited U.S. reports of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection describe a few critical cases and no maternal mortality.

Case

A 36-year-old patient at 37 weeks of gestation presented with shortness of breath, fever, cough, and sore throat for 1 week. Within 3 hours of admission, she experienced respiratory distress, required intubation, and underwent cesarean delivery and transfer to the intensive care unit. She subsequently decompensated, with multiorgan failure, sepsis, and cardiopulmonary arrest within 36 hours, despite aggressive supportive care and investigational therapies.

Conclusion

A pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection can experience a rapid onset of critical complications that may prove fatal, despite an indolent presentation. The pathogenesis leading to rapid deterioration is unknown.

### Hemodynamic changes associated with neuraxial anesthesia in pregnant women with COVID 19 disease: a retrospective case-control study [^19fb7916]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective, propensity-matched, case-controlled trial assessing COVID-19 positive vs COVID-19 negative parturients receiving epidural or spinal anesthesia, no significant differences were detected in hypotensive events, MAP variability, and HR responses. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes were also similar in both groups. Increased BMI was associated with MAP declines of > 20% from baseline in COVID-19 positive parturients but not in the COVID-19 negative group.

Symptomatic cases in our study presented with fever, dyspnea, fatigue, and cough, which was similar to the presenting signs and symptoms of seven hundred cases hospitalized in seven city hospitals in Louisville, Kentucky. The most common cause of preterm delivery in our COVID-19 positive cohort was preeclampsia with severe features. However, it is noteworthy that preeclampsia-like symptoms have been described in pregnant women with severe COVID-19 infection that are not preeclamptic. This is distinguishable by LDH, uterine artery pulsatility index, and angiogenic factors such as tyrosine kinase-1 and placental growth factor. These tests were not performed in parturients included in our study.

Chen et al. described excessive hypotension in 12/14 parturients who received EA with ropivacaine compared to 3 parturients who received general anesthesia for CS. However, information provided by the authors on the blood pressure trends and vasopressors requirements were limited. In contrast, Qi Zhong et al. reported on 49 COVID-19 positive parturients that had spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine 0.75% for CS and orthopedic surgeries and did not find intraoperative cardiorespiratory compromise or instability in hemodynamics.

High incidences of hypertension, hypotension, and tachycardia have been described in parturients with severe COVID-19 infection. ACE2 receptor mediated RAAS dysfunction is believed to be the cause of these cardiovascular manifestations. Atrioventricular block, elevated troponin levels, and pericardial effusion have also been described in severe disease. Breslin et al. reported upon 18 COVID-19 positive obstetric parturients with intrapartum EA, spinal, or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, and no hemodynamic instability was noted in any of the parturients. In our study, hemodynamic responses were similar between 27 COVID-19 positive parturients and 27 controls utilizing epidural anesthesia for labor. Larger MAP declines were observed in the spinal anesthetic recipients due to the more profound sympathectomy associated with spinal blocks; however, these episodes of hypotension were similar in both COVID-19 positive and negative cohorts.

### Case report of amniotic fluid embolism coagulopathy following abortion; use of viscoelastic point-of-care analysis [^2bbc9d85]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

While most often occurring in the setting of labor and delivery, AFE have been reported with legal medical and surgical abortions, spontaneous abortions, and obstetric procedures including amniocentesis and amnioinfusions. If an AFE is suspected while caring for a patient at an outpatient facility, prompt transfer to a hospital should be arranged, with attention to adequately oxygenating and ventilating the patient, and monitoring for signs of hemorrhage and coagulopathy while awaiting transfer. Fluid overload should be avoided as AFE are associated with acute cor pulmonale (severely dilated hypokinetic right ventricle), followed by left ventricular failure with risk of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

In this case, coagulopathy was suspected based on ongoing post-procedure vaginal bleeding without evidence of an alternative etiology of hemorrhage, disproportionate oozing from minor trauma to the cervix, lack of clotted blood in the vagina or on perineal-pads in the setting of ongoing vaginal bleeding, and acute hypotension and hypoxia, with clinical concern for an AFE. If there is concern for coagulopathy, the potential for progression to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy should be considered. Traditional laboratory measurements of the coagulation profile were used as the initial evaluation for coagulopathy. Unfortunately, formal laboratory assessments of coagulopathy are time consuming, and in the setting of brisk hemorrhage it is often not appropriate to delay treatment while awaiting results given risk of worsening coagulopathy and blood loss. Moreover, the rapidly evolving coagulation profiles can complicate clinical assessment of laboratory results. For a faster, low-cost bedside assessment of coagulation status, clinicians may use the Lee-White whole-blood clotting test (i.e. "red-top-tube test). A clotting time longer than 10 min at room temperature is indicative of coagulopathy, while lysis of clot within 1 h suggests fibrinolysis. While useful as an adjuvant to laboratory assessment in quickly determining the presence of coagulopathy, whole-blood clotting tests fail to provide factor-specific guidance. In the setting of clinical evidence of coagulopathy or severe hemorrhage, early initiation of a massive transfusion protocol with 1:1:1 ratios of red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets is recommended without awaiting laboratory assessments. Coordination and close communication with anesthesia colleagues additionally plays a critical role in responding to severe coagulopathy.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^ac59ba84]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism — coagulopathy management: Disseminated intravascular coagulation is present in most cases, and medical management includes administering blood products to maintain a platelet count above 50,000/mm3 with normal (or close to normal) activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio. In massive hemorrhage, blood products should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory results, and early aggressive resuscitation with packed red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets at a ratio of 1:1:1 results in improved outcomes. Because coagulopathy may follow cardiovascular collapse with amniotic fluid embolism, we recommend the early assessment of clotting status and early aggressive management of clinical bleeding with standard massive transfusion protocols (GRADE 1C).

### Anesthetic anaphylactic shock in an emergency cesarean section: a case report [^eac79cae]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Given the sudden onset of hypotension, hypoxia, and bronchospasm, it was essential to differentiate anaphylactic shock from amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). AFE typically presents with a rapid onset of cardiovascular collapse, respiratory distress, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, in this case: (1) Timing and Triggers: The reaction occurred immediately after the administration of succinylcholine, before the abdominal incision, making drug-induced anaphylaxis more likely. (2) Clinical Presentation: The patient exhibited bronchospasm, a common feature in anaphylactic reactions but less typical in AFE. Additionally, there was no evidence of coagulopathy or bleeding, which are hallmark features of AFE. (3) The patient responded rapidly to epinephrine and corticosteroids, which are standard treatments for anaphylaxis. In contrast, AFE treatment typically focuses on supportive care for respiratory and cardiovascular collapse and managing DIC if it occurs. In conclusion, the clinical presentation and response to treatment strongly supported the diagnosis of anaphylactic shock over AFE. It is worth noting that, although rare, propofol can potentially cause anaphylactic shock. We ruled out propofol-induced anaphylaxis based on the following considerations: Timing: The anaphylactic reaction occurred immediately after succinylcholine administration, while propofol had been given earlier without an immediate adverse response. Clinical Presentation: The characteristic signs of anaphylaxis, including a rapid drop in blood pressure, elevated airway pressure, and generalized erythema with swelling, are more typical of reactions associated with neuromuscular blocking agents like succinylcholine. However, more specific diagnostic tests were lacking at the time.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^42e2d7b9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism conclusions — Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but often lethal condition, and maternal and perinatal mortalities appear to have decreased during the last decades likely because of improvements in the delivery of critical care, recognition of atypical or milder cases with no cardiorespiratory collapse, and the likely inclusion of patients with conditions other than amniotic fluid embolism. The diagnosis remains clinical and is often one of exclusion because no single specific diagnostic test is currently available, and treatment is mainly supportive involving delivery of the fetus when indicated, respiratory support (usually in the form of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation), and hemodynamic support with the judicious use of fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, and pulmonary vasodilators; rapid initiation of treatment, aided by a high index of clinical suspicion, is essential. The recurrence rate of amniotic fluid embolism is unknown but appears to be low, much of the published literature is of poor quality and likely includes a significant number of patients with other conditions, and uniform diagnostic criteria for research publications are badly needed.

### Hemodynamic changes associated with neuraxial anesthesia in pregnant women with COVID 19 disease: a retrospective case-control study [^a1874f29]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In pregnant women hospitalized with pneumonia, maternal fever and hypoxemia may contribute to the development of obstetric complication like preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of the membrane, and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. Preeclampsia-like symptoms have been described in pregnant women with severe COVID-19 infection that are not preeclamptic. Spinal and epidural anesthesia is associated with less frequent and less severe hypotension in preeclamptic parturients and require smaller doses of vasopressors than normotensive controls with term and preterm pregnancy. Cervical exams are relatively contraindicated in parturients with premature rupture of membranes, which limits the ability to determine onset of labor, regular painful contracton and 2 requests for analgesics have been used as indicator to allow labor epidural.

Neuraxial anesthetics may have a significant impact on the hemodynamics of COVID-19 positive parturients. Chen et al. presented a case series of 17 parturients with COVID-19 who had CS, 14 under EA and 3 under GA. These parturients were either asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms without hypoxemia or supplemental oxygen requirement. Under neuraxial block, 12 of the 14 COVID-19 positive parturients experienced severe hypotension, which did not improve with fluid boluses, left uterine tilt, and vasopressors. The authors propose the exaggerated hypotensive response to neuraxial block is related to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) II receptor binding of SARS-Cov-2 creating instability in the circulatory system. Although this exaggerated hypotensive response has inspired development of clinical protocols for the anesthetic management of COVID-19 positive parturients, more recent literature has questioned Chen et al.'s conclusions as standard of care hypotension prevention measures for parturients were not practiced as part of the study.

### Sudden onset of syncope and disseminated intravascular coagulation at 14 weeks of pregnancy: a case report [^3a4ff11f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), also known as anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy (ASP), typically occurs during labor and may result in cardiorespiratory collapse and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There are reports describing less typical presentations of AFE/ASP in which patients do not necessarily have the classic triad of hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy. AFE/ASP rarely occurs in the absence of labor, but such cases may involve medical or surgical abortion, spontaneous miscarriage, or obstetrical procedures including amniocentesis and amnioinfusion. There are, however, no previously reported cases of AFE/ASP with sudden loss of consciousness and disseminated intravascular coagulation occurring during early pregnancy, in the absence of any intervention or obstetric event.

Case Presentation

A 32-year-old G3P2 Japanese woman had sudden-onset syncope at 14weeks' gestation. On arrival at our hospital, her level of consciousness was severely disturbed as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale. Although her vital signs were initially stable, blood samples collected intravenously and by femoral artery puncture did not coagulate. A subchorionic hematoma with active extravasation of blood was apparent on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Two hours after her arrival, she developed hypovolemic shock with progression of DIC, presumably due to intrauterine and retroperitoneal bleeding. After transfusion of blood products; treatments for DIC including the use of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, ulinastatin, and corticosteroids; and hysterectomy, her level of consciousness and physical condition improved remarkably. Later investigation of preoperative blood samples revealed that serum levels of AFE/ASP-associated markers were elevated. Immunohistochemical studies on the excised, unruptured uterus showed that amniotic fluid components were present inside a uterine blood vessel.

Conclusions

This is the first reported patient with sudden-onset syncope and DIC, but without apparent cardiorespiratory collapse, with the highly likely etiology of AFE/ASP occurring at the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy and in the absence of intervention or delivery. Maternal collapse with DIC during any stage of pregnancy should be considered an AFE/ASP-associated event, even in the absence of labor or obstetric procedures. This event may occur in the presence of subchorionic hematoma alone.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^047cb9eb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism — coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation notes that disseminated intravascular coagulation is present in up to 83% of cases and that the coagulopathy of amniotic fluid embolism may occur in conjunction with the cardiopulmonary manifestations, be manifest only after initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation has been completed, or in very rare cases may be the only finding in women without cardiorespiratory compromise. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is commonly manifested by hemorrhagic complications including bleeding from venipunctures or surgical sites, hematuria, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and vaginal bleeding. However, bleeding from incompletely controlled atony followed by hypovolemic shock and either a consumptive or dilutional coagulopathy cannot be attributed to amniotic fluid embolism, nor does amniotic fluid embolism occur as a mild coagulopathy followed hours later by sudden cardiovascular collapse in the absence of interval hemorrhage and hypovolemia.

### The clinical course of COVID in pregnancy [^006036ae]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses unique challenges to the medical community as the optimal treatment has not been determined and is often at the discretion of institutional guidelines. Pregnancy has previously been described as a high-risk state in the context of infectious diseases, given a particular susceptibility to pathogens and adverse outcomes. Although ongoing studies have provided insight on the course of this disease in the adult population, the implications of COVID-19 on pregnancy remains an understudied area. The objective of this study is to review the literature and describe clinical presentations among pregnant women afflicted with COVID-19.

### Induction of labor at term following membrane rupture… [^28bc5150]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Ten percent of pregnancies beyond 36 weeks' gestation are complicated by spontaneous premature rupture of membranes. Multiple studies have compared the use of expectant management with the use of active labor induction in women who do not begin spontaneous labor following membrane rupture. Traditionally, labor is induced to prevent chorioamnionitis and neonatal sepsis. The use of intravenous oxytocin and the incidence of cesarean delivery are lower when prostaglandins are applied to ripen the cervix. Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E. 1 analog, has been shown to be as effective in inducing labor as dinoprostone. Wing and Paul prospectively compared vaginally administered misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin for labor induction in women with ruptured membranes who have not begun labor. A total of 197 women were randomized to treatment: 98 women received misoprostol and 99 received oxytocin. A 25-μg dose of misoprostol was placed in the posterior vaginal fornix.

If adequate uterine contraction frequency was not demonstrated, a single repeat dose of misoprostol was administered six hours later. Oxytocin was given intravenously by an incremental infusion protocol to a maximum of 20 mU per minute. The mean estimated gestational age of the patients in both groups was 38 weeks. A similar percentage of subjects in both treatment groups had a treatment success. A total of 76 percent of the misoprostol-treated group and 74 percent of the oxytocin-treated group delivered vaginally within 24 hours of treatment initiation. Parity influenced the success of labor induction, regardless of the treatment arm. In the misoprostol group, 63 percent of nulliparous women and 86 percent of multiparous women were delivered within 24 hours. In the oxytocin group, 60 percent of the nulliparous patients and 86 percent of the multiparous group were delivered in the same time period. The duration from induction to delivery in both groups was similar.

Thirty of the women who were treated with misoprostol required two doses. Uterine hyperstimulation did not occur in either treatment group. Abnormal fetal heart rate monitor tracings occurred equally in both groups. Evidence of intra-amniotic infection was equal in both groups. Neonatal sepsis was suspected in 21 percent of infants born to misoprostol-treated women and in 27 percent of infants born to oxytocin-treated women. Approximately 86 percent of women receiving misoprostol were delivered vaginally, compared with 83 percent of women treated with oxytocin. In the misoprostol-treated group, 13 women had cesarean deliveries; in the oxytocin-treated group, 17 women had cesarean deliveries. Neonatal outcomes did not differ between treatment groups. The authors conclude that vaginal administration of misoprostol is an effective alternative to oxytocin infusion for labor induction.

Because the majority of cesarean deliveries in the misoprostol-treated women were performed for labor dystocia rather than for failed induction, misoprostol appears to be effective in causing cervical dilatation and effacement, and in inducing labor when premature rupture of the membranes has occurred.

Summary of recommendations and conclusions — based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A), neuraxial analgesia does not appear to increase the cesarean delivery rate and, therefore, should not be withheld for that concern, and opioids are associated with adverse effects for the woman and the fetus or newborn, most significantly respiratory depression, so attention should be paid to respiratory status; based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B), spinal anesthesia, combined spinal–epidural, or general anesthesia are suitable for emergent cesarean delivery when no epidural is in place.

### Amniotic fluid embolism [^76226576]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Incidence

Amniotic fluid embolism is a catastrophic syndrome that occurs during pregnancy or in the immediate postpartum period. Multiple case reports have described the clinical findings and have reported variable success with supportive care. There has been discrepancy with respect to the incidence and mortality of amniotic fluid embolism. One likely explanation for this inconsistency is the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic studies to definitively identify cases of amniotic fluid embolism, leading to both over- and underreporting. Despite the variation in reported incidence and mortality, amniotic fluid embolism remains a life-threatening condition with significant morbidity and mortality for the pregnant woman. It is the fifth most common cause of maternal mortality in the world.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism continues to be a clinical diagnosis and a diagnosis of exclusion based on the rapid development of a complex constellation of findings with sudden cardiovascular collapse, acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and neurologic impairment. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, a high index of suspicion is warranted. Suspected risk factors have included tumultuous labor, trauma, multiparity, increased gestational age, and increased maternal age. However, many patients who develop amniotic fluid embolism have no obvious risk factors.

Management

Patients with amniotic fluid embolus are best managed using a multidisciplinary approach. There are no pharmacologic or other therapies that prevent or treat the amniotic fluid embolism syndrome, and supportive care typically involves aggressive treatment of multiple types of shock simultaneously. In this article we discuss the clinical presentation of amniotic fluid embolism syndrome as well as current opinions regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.

### Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma in a pregnant patient [^276ad936]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is a rare occurrence during pregnancy with only five cases described in the literature since 1900. Even in the general population, the frequency of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is extremely low and the etiology unclear. Several theories exist for the cause of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma, however, none has gained uniform acceptance. A case of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma during pregnancy in a 27-year-old, gravida 2, para 1, female at term with 36 hours duration of both paresthesia and progressive weakness of the lower extremities is presented. In addition, all previous known cases are summarized, including outcome. We hypothesize that the cause of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is multifactorial, and pregnancy-induced structural changes in arterial walls and hemodynamic changes may play a role. In addition, we postulate that the origin of the bleeding is arterial, rather then venous. Lastly, the symptoms, diagnosis, and management of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma during pregnancy are discussed.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: principles of early clinical management [^118d2110]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism is an uncommon, but potentially lethal, complication of pregnancy. Because amniotic fluid embolism usually is seen with cardiac arrest, the initial immediate response should be to provide high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We describe key features of initial treatment of patients with amniotic fluid embolism. Where available, we recommend performing transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography as soon as possible because this is an easy and reliable method of identifying a failing right ventricle. If such failure is identified, treatment that is tailored at improving right ventricular performance should be initiated with the use of inotropic agents and pulmonary vasodilators. Blood pressure support with vasopressors is preferred over fluid infusion in the setting of severe right ventricular compromise. Amniotic fluid embolism-related coagulopathy should be managed with hemostatic resuscitation with the use of a 1:1:1 ratio of packed red cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets (with cryoprecipitate as needed to maintain a serum fibrinogen of > 150–200 mg/dL). In cases that require prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation or, after arrest, severe ventricular dysfunction refractory to medical management, consideration for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be given.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^59d25d9a]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism differential diagnosis and immediate evaluation — In suspected acute events, cardiac troponins and a 12 lead electrocardiograph should be obtained as soon as possible, and computed tomography angiography or a ventilation perfusion scan may be useful for pulmonary embolism, although in cases complicated by profuse bleeding, thromboembolism is unlikely. High spinal anesthesia is unlikely to cause a dramatic drop in cardiac output or hemorrhagic manifestations, while inadvertent intravascular injection of local anesthetics may cause seizures and cardiovascular collapse; if local anesthetic toxicity is likely, consideration should be given to the use of intravenous lipids (20% Intralipid). For venous air embolism, normobaric 100% oxygen should be used, the patient should be turned to the left lateral decubitus, aspiration of blood via a central line may be performed to aspirate bubbles of air, and if an arterial air embolism is suspected, hyperbaric oxygen therapy should be considered, if available. Eclampsia with new-onset seizures in the later half of pregnancy is a possibility but is not commonly associated with cardiorespiratory arrest and acute profound coagulopathy; transfusion reactions may cause acute pulmonary edema and coagulopathy when incompatible blood is administered. Anaphylactic shock is a possibility, with bronchospasm reported in about 15% of cases of amniotic fluid embolism; if anaphylaxis is suspected, treatment with epinephrine, steroids, and inhaled bronchodilators is indicated, and bedside echocardiography demonstrating right ventricular dysfunction favors the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism over anaphylaxis and most of the other conditions that may mimic amniotic fluid embolism.

### Sudden onset of syncope and disseminated intravascular coagulation at 14 weeks of pregnancy: a case report [^92c0351e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Our patient initially exhibited sudden-onset collapse with DIC. The term "collapse" refers to a range of medical conditions, from simple syncope to a catastrophic cardiac event heralding imminent death. Its causes include hemorrhage, thromboembolism, AFE/ASP, cardiac disease, sepsis, drug toxicity or overdose, eclampsia, intracranial hemorrhage, and anaphylaxis. The onset of DIC during pregnancy is caused by preeclampsia; eclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome; acute fatty liver; placental abruption; postpartum hemorrhage; AFE/ASP; and sepsis. Because AFE/ASP is capable of provoking both maternal collapse and DIC, we speculated that AFE/ASP might be the most likely cause for this patient's presentation, despite the absence of severe hypoxia.

A rare obstetric emergency, AFE/ASP occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal bloodstream, rapidly triggering cardiorespiratory collapse and DIC. Kanayama et al. analyzed more than 400 patients with AFE and reported that there are 2 etiologies. First, fetal materials may create physical obstruction in the maternal microvessels in various organs, including the lung. Second, the amniotic liquid itself may cause an anaphylactoid reaction that leads to cardiopulmonary or cerebral vasospasm and activation of platelets, white blood cells, and complement. The former type of AFE/ASP is characterized mainly by cardiopulmonary collapse, whereas the latter, termed DIC-type AFE, involves the presence of DIC and atonic bleeding. The DIC type of AFE is conceptually similar to ASP because both implicate the anaphylactoid reaction to amniotic fluid components as the cause of maternal collapse with coagulopathy. The serum markers Zn-CP1; STN; complement C3, C4, C5a; and IL-8 have been used as indicators for AFE/ASP.

### Current concepts in the management of disseminated intravascular coagulation [^81153d02]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation is a clinicopathological syndrome where widespread intravascular coagulation occurs in response to an inciting process. The pathophysiology for this disorder is complex with an important role for thrombin, the central regulator of the coagulation process. Since the clinical spectrum of DIC is variable due to its dynamic nature, the laboratory diagnosis should ideally be not based on a single marker or an isolated set of results. The treatment should primary focus on the management of the underlying triggering condition with blood products used as resuscitative measures. Newer therapeutic modalities have been recently tried with success although the management of DIC still remains a major challenge.

The anesthetic management of labor, delivery, and cesarean delivery in patients with active or resolving Guillain-Barre syndrome is not well defined. Using a combined spinal and epidural (CSE) technique in such a rare clinical situation has not been previously reported.

Case Report

A 32-year-old woman gravida 2, para 0 was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome at 21 weeks of pregnancy. Paralysis spread up to the T4 level. Three months later, she was admitted for labor at term. She presented in severe labor pain and it was decided to proceed with CSE analgesia. No unusual hemodynamic instability, signs of autonomic dysfunction, or increased sensitivity to local anesthetics was noted. After several hours, delivery by cesarean section was required and epidural anesthesia was then used. The patient had an uncomplicated postpartum course.

Conclusion

Careful evaluation and documentation of the patient's baseline neurological status, a thorough discussion with the patient regarding the risks and benefits of the technique for labor analgesia, and an appreciation of the limited experience with this kind of clinical situation are important.

### Sudden onset of syncope and disseminated intravascular coagulation at 14 weeks of pregnancy: a case report [^0fe0ac6c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) occurs when amniotic fluid enters the bloodstream of the gravid mother, usually during labor, triggering a serious and rapid reaction that can result in cardiorespiratory collapse and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Also known as anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy (ASP), AFE accompanies anaphylaxis-like symptoms of shock. These symptoms cannot be explained by simple occlusion of the mother's pulmonary microvasculature by amniotic fluid components.

A rare but devastating condition, AFE/ASP occurs in approximately 1 in 40,000 deliveries, with a reported mortality ranging from 20 to 60%. Reportedly, 70% of AFE/ASP occurs during vaginal delivery, 11% after delivery, and 19% during cesarean delivery. There are reports of AFE/ASP occurring in the second trimester during induced abortion. These events rarely occur in the absence of labor, but there are reports of AFE/ASP occurring during medical or surgical abortion, spontaneous miscarriage, or obstetric procedures including amniocentesis and amnioinfusion. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of AFE/ASP occurring during the course of a viable pregnancy without intervention or delivery.

We present a patient who very likely had AFE/ASP manifesting with sudden-onset syncope and DIC but without apparent cardiorespiratory collapse. The patient was in early pregnancy, and there was no intervention or delivery to precipitate the event.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation [^abafb255]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation in obstetrics is commonly seen associated with massive hemorrhage due to different etiological factors. It may also be seen with intrauterine demise, infections, and hepatic conditions. It is associated with very high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A battery of laboratory tests (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and plasma fibrinogen) can be used in the diagnosis, but no single test in isolation is sensitive and specific enough for diagnosis. Cornerstone of management is to identify the underlying pathology for disseminated intravascular coagulation. This chapter looks into molecular basis of obstetric DIC and identifies important laboratory tests, along with management. It also identifies topics of future research in the field of obstetric DIC.

### Presumed antepartum amniotic fluid embolism [^061b2043]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid embolism is seldom recognized in nonperipartum patients. The pathophysiology is uncertain and diagnosis imprecise, making management after stabilization difficult.

Case

A 37-year-old woman at 28 weeks' gestation presented with signs and symptoms consistent with amniotic fluid embolism including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. A ventilation-perfusion scan demonstrated unmatched perfusion defects, but other radiographic studies were negative; the patient was treated with heparin. Four days after presentation she had spontaneous rupture of membranes followed by hypoxemia, necessitating cesarean delivery. A pulmonary arteriogram after the operation showed multiple filling defects; the patient was discharged on warfarin.

Conclusion

Amniotic fluid embolism is a difficult diagnosis to make, at best. Anticoagulation may be a therapeutic option.

### Peripartum HFpEF: identification of a novel phenotype and the Need for Cardio-obstetrics management [^737fdabe]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing and managing PPCM remains challenging, as it is often a diagnosis of exclusion despite the existence of several guidelines. The diverse range of presentations, varying from subtle signs to severe manifestations like acute HF, pulmonary edema, or cardiogenic shock, further complicates the management of PPCM. This emphasizes the critical need for increased awareness and physician education to allow for early recognition and accurate diagnosis to facilitate timely and appropriate interventions. ACOG recommends all pregnant or postpartum women who experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort, palpitations, arrhythmias, or fluid retention undergo evaluation for PPCM. Diagnostic testing for PPCM includes a combination of clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging studies (Figure 1). Clinical evaluation involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, and assessment of symptoms. ESC recommends performing an electrocardiogram in all patients with suspected PPCM as it is a safe and cost-effective diagnostic tool that can aid in distinguishing PPCM from other causes of symptoms; however, it is important to note that there is no specific electrocardiogram pattern that is diagnostic of PPCM.

### Anesthetic management for cesarean section in a patient with rupture of a cerebellar arteriovenous malformation [^049199e5]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage in the pregnant patient is a rare cause of peripartum morbidity, and it presents a diagnostic and management dilemma. The case of a term parturient who presented with headache is presented. Clinical suspicion led to the diagnosis of ruptured cerebellar arteriovenous malformation. Optimal timing of interventions, both neurosurgical and obstetric, are discussed. We chose to pursue Cesarean section prior to definitive neurosurgical intervention in this term parturient. Delivery of the fetus before surgery eliminates concern for adverse pregnancy outcome when interventions for cerebral protection are used, such as hyperventilation, administration of mannitol, barbiturate coma, and induced hypertension or hypotension. Subsequent management options, including general, spinal, epidural, and combined-spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia for Cesarean delivery, are discussed. We selected CSE anesthesia so as to provide a hemodynamically stable delivery followed by planned endovascular embolization.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 209: obstetric analgesia and anesthesia [^cb35029c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Obstetric analgesia and anesthesia — effects of combined spinal–epidural versus epidural on uterine tone and fetal heart rate are reported: In a randomized trial of low-risk laboring women, elevated uterine tone was documented in approximately 42% with combined spinal–epidural analgesia compared with approximately 17% with epidural analgesia. Furthermore, nearly one third of women had fetal heart rate abnormalities in the first 15 minutes after combined spinal–epidural analgesia, these abnormalities were independent of maternal hypotension but related to the speed of pain relief, and fetal outcomes, including rates of cesarean delivery, low Apgar scores, and neonatal acidemia, did not differ between groups.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine special statement: checklist for initial management of amniotic fluid embolism [^1c6fb2bf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare syndrome characterized by sudden cardiorespiratory collapse during labor or soon after delivery. Because of its rarity, many obstetrical providers have no experience in managing amniotic fluid embolism and may therefore benefit from a cognitive aid such as a checklist. We present a sample checklist for the initial management of amniotic fluid embolism based on standard management guidelines. We also suggest steps that each facility can take to implement the checklist effectively.

### Sudden respiratory and circulatory collapse after cesarean section: amniotic fluid embolism or other reasons?-a case report [^de799301]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

We recognized that the clinical course and hemodynamic changes were more similar to patients with anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis occurring during pregnancy is a clinical condition that can be life threatening and almost always an unanticipated reaction. Little is known about the epidemiology of immediate allergic hypersensitivity occurring during childbirth, however, the exact incidence is probably underestimated. For a susceptible pregnant woman, any agent can potentially trigger anaphylaxis. Nevertheless, antibiotics, prophylactic administration for decreasing the incidence of postpartum uterine infection and wound infection, are the most commonly reported triggers of anaphylaxis during caesarean section. In the case, the patient with no history of anaphylaxis and in an emergency cesarean section of no time to skin test, as our institutional general rule, intravenous clindamycin was used after clamping of the umbilical cord, which appeared to be the main culprit agents.

The hallmarks of anaphylaxis are cardiovascular collapse, bronchospasm, and cutaneous–mucous signs. The classic symptoms usually occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen. Sometimes, however, it can occur a half-hour or longer after exposure. Thus, sudden respiratory and circulatory collapse usually represent the inaugural event. The subcutaneous vascular bed is susceptible to vasoconstrictive influences on the early stage of anaphylaxis, and the absence of mucocutaneous sign or symptom does not exclude the diagnosis. Ultimately, mucocutaneous signs may appear after the normalization of the arterial blood pressure. It is more important to recognize the signs and symptoms rapidly and treat effectively than to diagnosis, a basic principle similar to that in AFE. The management rules for the treatment of an anaphylactic attack during pregnancy include (1) withdraw the suspected culprit agent and immediately call for help, (2) maintain airway with 100% oxygen and administer early intravenous epinephrine, (3) before childbirth, position the patient in left lateral uterine displacement and make a plan for emergency caesarean section.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as other embolic events including amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) remain a leading cause of maternal death in the United States and worldwide. The pregnant patient is at a higher risk of developing VTE including pulmonary embolism. In contrast, AFE is a rare, but catastrophic event that remains incompletely understood. Here the authors review the cause of VTE in pregnancy and look at contemporary and evidence-based practices for the evaluation, diagnosis, and management in pregnancy. Then the cause and diagnostic difficulty of AFE as well as what is known regarding the pathogenesis are reviewed.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: an Australian-New zealand population-based study [^8fe220ce]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

In women who survive the initial cardiopulmonary compromise, management of coagulopathy and major obstetric haemorrhage assume critical importance. Peri-partum hysterectomy is frequently required to control bleeding and a significant number of women will require admission to intensive or high dependency care services, as well as increased levels of care for their newborn. Not all centres that care for pregnant women may have onsite access to these facilities, especially in rural or remote areas and this study highlights the importance for all centres to have procedures to ensure timely transfer of women and their babies to appropriate centres.

The mortality associated with AFE was initially reported to be very high, with case fatality rates of 67–86% reported in some of the first case series of AFE. The case fatality rate of 15% reported here is consistent with previous reports from Australia, the UK, Netherlands, Canada and the USA. Factors that may contribute to a lower case fatality rates include an improved awareness of the condition so that women with less severe AFE are now included in registries, in addition to improvements in the resuscitation of pregnant women and advances in intensive care. The cornerstone of management is early recognition of the condition with prompt supportive measures. Premonitory symptoms, shortness of breath, hypotension and acute fetal compromise are consistently the earliest indications of AFE and should not be ignored.

### Characteristics of women of reproductive age with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by pregnancy status-United States, January 22-June 7, 2020 [^2b865424]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

As of June 16, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in 2,104,346 cases and 116,140 deaths in the United States. * During pregnancy, women experience immunologic and physiologic changes that could increase their risk for more severe illness from respiratory infections. To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22–June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15–44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (> 50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2–1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2–2.4). Sixteen (0.2%) COVID-19–related deaths were reported among pregnant women aged 15–44 years, and 208 (0.2%) such deaths were reported among nonpregnant women (aRR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5–1.5). These findings suggest that among women of reproductive age with COVID-19, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with nonpregnant women, but their risk for death is similar. To reduce occurrence of severe illness from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and measures to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasized for pregnant women and their families.

### An unusual cause of dyspnea in a pregnant woman: supraglottic hemangioma [^47693bf5]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is a common complaint among pregnant women; upper airway obstruction is a rare cause of it. We report a case of supraglottic hemangioma in a 20-year-old pregnant woman who presented with increasing dyspnea and hoarseness at 40 weeks of gestation. She gave birth to a healthy 3,100-g girl by caesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia. She was able to breathe easily during the postpartum period. This case represents a rare instance of dyspnea caused by a supraglottic hemangioma in a pregnant woman.

### Dinoprostone (Cervidil) [^ff13d8f2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 For Hospital Use Only

CERVIDIL should be administered in a hospital setting with an obstetrical care facility.

5.2 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation

CERVIDIL should be used with caution in women at high risk of postpartum disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Physiologic or pharmacologic induction of labor, including the use of CERVIDIL, is associated with an increased risk of DIC during the postpartum period. Women aged 30 years or older, those with complications during pregnancy and those with a gestational age over 40 weeks have an increased risk of DIC during the postpartum period. As soon as possible, assess for an evolving fibrinolysis in the immediate post-partum period. Therapy consisting of prompt removal of the source of procoagulant material, replacement of depleted clotting factors and, in some cases, anti-coagulation with heparin should be instituted promptly.

5.3 Amniotic Fluid Embolism Syndrome

The use of dinoprostone-containing products, including CERVIDIL, can result in inadvertent disruption and subsequent embolization of antigenic tissue causing the development of Amniotic Fluid Embolism Syndrome, a rare and often fatal obstetric condition.

Carefully monitor patients for clinical signs of Amniotic Fluid Embolism Syndrome including hypotension, hypoxemia and respiratory failure, DIC, coma or seizures and provide supportive care as needed.

5.4 Uterine Tachysystole and Uterine Hypersystole/Hypertonicity

The use of CERVIDIL may cause uterine tachysystole with or without fetal heart rate changes (see Table 1). While using CERVIDIL, carefully monitor uterine activity, fetal status and the progression of cervical dilatation and effacement. Remove CERVIDIL with any evidence of uterine tachysystole, uterine hypersystole/hypertonicity, fetal distress, or if labor commences. CERVIDIL is contraindicated when prolonged contraction of the uterus is detrimental to fetal safety or uterine integrity, such as previous cesarean section or major uterine surgery, because of the risk of uterine rupture and obstetrical complications (e.g., need for hysterectomy and the occurrence of fetal or neonatal death). Prostaglandins, including CERVIDIL, may potentiate the effect of oxytocin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Remove CERVIDIL at least 30 minutes before administration of an oxytocic agent is initiated and continue to carefully monitor uterine activity. Remove CERVIDIL prior to amniotomy or following rupture of membranes because the higher vaginal pH that occurs with rupture of membranes may result in higher release rate of dinoprostone.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: what obstetricians need to know [^8ffd4997]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days (range, 2–14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49–56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54–73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17–29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).

### Extracorporeal therapies for amniotic fluid embolism [^aff1cc2d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic disease with significant mortality. Because the cardiopulmonary dysfunction associated with AFE is self-limited, the disease could be well suited to the use of extracorporeal therapies.

Case

A woman progressed into cardiac arrest immediately after an elective cesarean delivery. Owing to severe hypoxemia and hypotension, AFE was suspected and peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was quickly initiated. Subsequent evolution was complicated by intrabdominal bleeding, which required massive transfusion and multiple surgeries. The patient recovered well, with a healthy newborn. We have identified 19 similar cases in the literature and present their outcomes as a series.

Conclusion

Extracorporeal therapies can support severely ill women affected by AFE and could be considered even in the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding.

### Amniotic fluid embolism [^969f1df0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism remains one of the most devastating conditions in obstetric practice with an incidence of approximately 1 in 40,000 deliveries and a reported mortality rate ranging from 20% to 60%. The pathophysiology involves an abnormal maternal response to fetal tissue exposure associated with breaches of the maternal-fetal physiologic barrier during parturition. This response and its subsequent injury involve activation of proinflammatory mediators similar to that seen with the classic systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Maternal treatment is primarily supportive, whereas prompt delivery in the mother who has sustained cardiopulmonary arrest is critical for improved newborn outcome.

An analysis of 216 subjects in the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System showed reduced risk of death with transfusion of concentrated fibrinogen (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21–0.92) and platelets (aOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10–0.52), highlighting the importance of coagulation factors in addition to red blood cells.

Amniotic fluid embolism — clinical presentation and timing is described as dramatic in its classic form, with a period of anxiety, change in mental status, agitation, and a sensation of doom that may precede the event; patients may progress rapidly to cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity, asystole, ventricular fibrillation, or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. In cases occurring prior to delivery, electronic fetal monitoring will demonstrate decelerations, loss of variability, and terminal bradycardia. In rare instances, amniotic fluid embolism may occur during the first or second trimesters of pregnancy, at the time of pregnancy termination, or amniocentesis.

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) — immediate supportive treatment in suspected cases outlines an algorithm beginning with suspected AFE to start immediate high quality CPR-ACLS and call for help, provide immediate notification to neonatology, maternal-fetal medicine and/or obstetric care provider, anesthesiology, intensive care, and consider immediate delivery in viable pregnancies either operative vaginal delivery or emergent cesarean section. The early phase commonly characterized by right ventricular failure (may confirm with bedside transthoracic echocardiography) directs to avoid excessive fluid resuscitation, consider norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure, address right ventricular failure with inotropes such as dobutamine or milrinone, and decrease pulmonary afterload with inhaled nitric oxide or inhaled/intravenous prostacyclin if indicated. The second phase characterized by left ventricular failure and cardiogenic pulmonary edema advises to maintain hemodynamics with use of norepinephrine and inotropes such as dobutamine or milrinone and to limit excessive fluid administration. Coagulopathy may have immediate or delayed onset following cardiovascular collapse; activate massive transfusion protocols where available, provide aggressive treatment of uterine atony, and search for anatomic etiologies of bleeding such as pelvic lacerations.

Sentinel events in severe maternal morbidity screening — screen-positive cases or individual outcomes and diagnoses should not automatically be considered sentinel events, and context determined from detailed review is needed. For example, hemorrhage due to placenta previa would not qualify as a sentinel event because bleeding in this context is part of the natural course of the illness.

Nevertheless, soon after the uterine package, her SBP suddenly dropped to 60mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO 2) fell below 70%. The contraction was still weak with prolonged haemorrhage. The tracheal cannula with 100% oxygen was applied. Further emergency treatment included anti-shock treatment (dexamethasone, metaraminol, and epinephrine), fluid infusion and supplement with red blood cells (8U), fresh frozen plasma (8U), and platelets (1U). Her vital signs recovered approximately 20 min later. The amount of blood loss was secondly estimated to be 3500mL. A repeated coagulation test indicated a fibrinogen level of 1.2 g/L. BPs and SaO 2 collapsed again when contractions were intensified with haemorrhage still. Finally, a hysterectomy was performed. Then the patient's vital signs stabilized, and coagulation function improved. On the seventh day after Cesarean, she was discharged with fibrinogen at 3.45 g/L.

Case 2

A 35-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1 (with histories of normal full-term delivery and first-trimester pregnancy loss), was admitted to our hospital at 38 + 3 weeks of gestation in November 2021. BPs and antenatal examinations were always regular during gestation. The patient complained that the fibrinogen level (2.54 g/L) was lower than five weeks ago (3.53 g/L), and her urine protein was 3 + with SBP of 147mmHg and DBP of 95mmHg. There was no contraction, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, chest tightness or anxiousness. The patient denied family heredity of coagulation disorders. After admission, we kept continuous observation of BPs and FHRT. Her BPs were unstably elevated. The SBP varied from 140 to 170mmHg, and DBP varied from 90 to 110mmHg. Labetalol (100 mg orally q6h) was administrated; however, there was no obvious improvement. The fibrinogen level measured 2.22 g/L.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^84af2505]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism — use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is described only as rescue therapy and is not routinely recommended because of bleeding risk and limited evidence of benefit. The use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been reported for cases refractory to resuscitation; however, anticoagulation during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may worsen bleeding in profoundly coagulopathic patients with active hemorrhage, and therefore extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is controversial and not routinely recommended in the management of amniotic fluid embolism.

### Consumptive coagulopathy involving amniotic fluid embolism: the importance of earlier assessments for interventions in critical care [^a90c7118]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare disease that is associated with high maternal and/or fetal morbidity and mortality rates. It is mainly characterized by the abrupt onset and rapid progression of maternal cardiopulmonary insufficiency, concomitant with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). Its histopathological diagnosis has been classically defined, that is, detection of fetal components in pulmonary vessels; however, this is only applicable in fatal cases examined by autopsy and not in surviving cases. A consensus of clinical diagnostic criteria has not been universally established, and different diagnostic criteria for AFE have been reported worldwide. The diagnostic criteria reported by Clark et al (Clark criteria) were originally employed in an attempt to establish uniform criteria for research with strictly defined symptoms and conditions; however, they do not include strongly suspected clinical cases with missing coagulation data supporting overt DIC. The criteria were recently evaluated and validated by Stafford et al. Previous case reports suggested that cardiopulmonary insufficiency and refractory DIC have already advanced in patients clinically diagnosed with AFE by Clark criteria, and thus, the opportunity for earlier preemptive interventions and a better prognosis is missed. The onset of AFE generally occurs in the delivery room, in which human resources for critical care are more limited than that in an ICU. Under these conditions, blood transfusions, hemostatic interventions, and maternal life-support are often performed before the evaluation of coagulopathy, as recommended by some obstetric guidelines, which may be one of the major factors compromising detailed analyses of coagulopathy in AFE.

### Aortocaval compression resulting in sudden loss of consciousness and severe bradycardia and hypotension during cesarean section in a patient with subvalvular aortic stenosis [^5bfdfa23]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Maternal cardiac arrest during cesarean section (CS) is an extremely rare but devastating complication. Preventing emergency events from developing into maternal cardiac arrest is one of the most challenging clinical scenarios.

Case Presentation

A 35-year-old pregnant woman with subvalvular aortic stenosis who was scheduled for elective CS under epidural anesthesia, and experienced devastating supine hypotensive syndrome, but was successfully resuscitated after delivery.

Conclusions

The performance of tilt position strictly or high-quality continue manual left uterine displacement (LUD) should be performed until the fetus is delivered, otherwise timely delivery of the fetus may be the best way to optimize the deadly condition.

Figure 1.
Categorization of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) by the Japanese and Clark's criteria (A) and a new proposal of the possible latent stage of Clark group (B). A, The relationship between the Japanese and Clark diagnostic criteria for AFE and the definition of AFE groups in the present study. Regarding symptoms, Clark criteria strictly require cardiopulmonary arrest or respiratory compromise with hypotension in addition to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), whereas the Japanese criteria diagnose AFE based on only one of four symptoms (i.e. severe bleeding of more than 1,500 mL, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and DIC). In the present study, AFE patients were classified into two groups: AFE (Clark) (the population in the white part) and AFE (Non-Clark) (that in the gray part). B, The scheme representing a promising population for preemptive treatment using the hemoglobin (H)/fibrinogen (F) ratio among Non-Clark group. The Non-Clark AFE group included a population complicated by preceding consumptive coagulopathy, which may develop cardiopulmonary insufficiency; in other words, "the possible latent stage of the Clark group", in consideration of previous case reports. The identification of these potential Clark group patients by referring to the Japanese criteria in combination with an H/F ratio of more than 100 may enable physicians to provide preemptive treatments in the earlier stage, which may prevent fatal AFE.

### Can cell salvage be used for resuscitation in a patient with amniotic fluid embolism and hepatic laceration? A case report [^4c2a7c93]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare disease which has an incidence of approximately 1/40,000. Although AFE is a rare disease, it is a potentially fatal condition, as well as a leading cause of unpredictable maternal death in developed countries. Typical clinical symptoms of AFE include hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy. Moreover, with rapid progression, it may cause cardiac arrest and death. The coagulopathy observed in AFE may differ from that observed in other forms of obstetric hemorrhages. It presents as coagulation dysfunction without significant hemoglobin decrease, because it may primarily be a depletion rather than dilutional process. However, as the disease progresses, the number of red blood cells also decreases. The diagnosis of AFE may be delayed by a lag in laboratory tests on coagulation function. AFE diagnosis is a type of exclusive diagnosis. When a patient exhibits the above symptoms, the clinician should actively initiate supportive treatment. Patients with AFE may recover within a few hours if immediate resuscitation measures are taken upon the onset of transient hemodynamic decompensation and coagulopathy. Maintaining hemodynamic support and blood infusion is important during AFE interventions and ICS focuses on returning ample red blood cells (RBCs) to the patient in time. ICS has been widely used in obstetrics. However, previous research on ICS for rescuing patients with AFE is scarce. Here we present the case of a woman with obstetric hemorrhage who was diagnosed with AFE and was treated with ICS.

Covid-19 and pregnancy

Approximately 80.0% of COVID-19 cases in pregnant women were asymptomatic or exhibited mild symptoms. In mild cases of the disease, pregnant women exhibited similar symptoms to non-pregnant women. The most common symptoms were fatigue (54.5%), followed by a cough (50.1%) and fever (27.6%). Other symptoms included dyspnea (21.0%), myalgia (16.0%) and a sore throat (11.0%). In severe cases of COVID-19, pregnant women required more frequent hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation than non-pregnant women of childbearing age. Five percent of infected pregnant women were diagnosed with severe or critical forms of pneumonia requiring respiratory support. In addition, in the incidence of respiratory distress, fetal distress, miscarriage, preterm delivery and coagulopathy accompanied by liver dysfunction and even the mother's death as a result of COVID-19 was observed in pregnant women.

### Association of pregnancy characteristics and maternal mortality with amniotic fluid embolism [^3a78c6d9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Maternal mortality has more than doubled during the past 3 decades in the US, with most recent national estimates of 17.3 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2017. Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), despite its rarity, is a leading cause of maternal mortality that often presents as sudden cardiovascular collapse, respiratory distress, and coagulopathy. The reported incidence ranges from 0.8 to 7.7 per 100 000 births, with similarly wide reports of case mortality ranging from 11% to 43%. These wide ranges are likely attributable to the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria. Recent evidence also suggests at least one-fifth of all cases of AFE were most likely incorrectly diagnosed (possible overdiagnosis), underscoring the diagnostic challenges surrounding AFE.

Amniotic fluid embolism was first reported nearly a century ago and thought to be secondary to fetal debris occluding maternal pulmonary circulation. However, this assumption has been challenged for a variety of reasons, including the lack of evidence of pulmonary vessel obstruction in many cases of AFE. One plausible alternative hypothesis includes maternal exposure to fetal antigen that triggers complex physiologic derangements, including the activation of proinflammatory mediator systems. However, the exact cause of AFE remains unknown.

Although the exact pathophysiologic mechanism is unknown, several risk factors are identified for AFE based on maternal, fetal, placental, and delivery factors. Continued validation and exploration of risk factors for AFE may lead to a better understanding of AFE pathophysiology. Furthermore, there is a paucity of recent US data on maternal outcomes after AFE. Thus, the objective of the current study was to examine the pregnancy characteristics and maternal outcomes related to AFE from 2016 to 2019 in the US.
