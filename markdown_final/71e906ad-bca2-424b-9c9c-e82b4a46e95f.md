## Question

is bismuth subsalicylate safe after gi bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bismuth subsalicylate is safe to use after a gastrointestinal bleed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology of bismuth subsalicylate and its salicylate component and how that impacts hemostasis. Then, I should review post-GI bleed management principles and guideline-based cautions about agents that increase bleeding risk. Next, I will consider practical issues such as stool darkening that might confound monitoring for rebleeding. After that, I need to check for any specific, guideline-supported therapeutic roles for bismuth in the post-bleed setting, particularly H. pylori eradication. Finally, I should assess special populations and drug–drug interactions, synthesize the risk–benefit profile, and give clear clinical recommendations with monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and potential hemostatic effects here; bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes to bismuth and salicylic acid in the GI tract, and the salicylate component is pharmacologically active, which means it can impair platelet function and contribute to salicylate toxicity with overuse, while case data also describe coagulopathy particularly in cirrhosis, so I need to be cautious about post-bleed use where platelet-dependent hemostasis is critical [^113kPeWq] [^113kPeWq] [^116iu7Zo] [^112pS5Um].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should anchor this against post-bleed principles where agents that increase GI bleeding risk are avoided, and while BSS is not an NSAID, its salicylate moiety raises a similar concern for platelet dysfunction and mucosal irritation in the early healing window, so by analogy with strong label warnings against NSAIDs after recent GI bleeding, BSS looks risky unless there is a compelling, guideline-supported indication that outweighs that risk [^115G235w] [^1115DSvr].

> Next, I should review how we manage patients after a GI bleed; risk stratification with tools like Glasgow Blatchford and Rockall is standard, endoscopy is performed within 12–24 hours for high-risk presentations, and prevention of rebleeding focuses on addressing the cause and avoiding agents that worsen hemostasis, which all reinforces that routine symptomatic BSS use right after a bleed is not favored [^116Wnxuj] [^112Rs5po] [^114mEdu2] [^114LR9xo].

> I need to check practical monitoring issues as well; BSS can darken stools and tongue, which is usually benign, but in the immediate post-bleed period this may confound assessment for melena recurrence, so using BSS for symptom control could obscure clinical monitoring and complicate decision-making if the patient rebleeds [^114ewuQx] [^116zMWmW].

> Now, let me examine whether there is any therapeutic role for BSS right after a bleed; the key scenario is H. pylori–associated ulcer bleeding where eradication therapy is indicated, and optimized bismuth-containing quadruple therapy is a first-line eradication option in current ACG guidance, which implies a short, supervised course of bismuth can be appropriate once the patient is stabilized and endoscopic hemostasis is achieved, and when eradication is needed to reduce ulcer recurrence and future rebleeding risk [^114qTnSw] [^112xjDij].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought eradication reduces rebleeding by 70–80%, but let me verify; the classic NEJM trial in prior bleeders taking aspirin or NSAIDs showed that eradication and antisecretory strategies variably impacted rebleeding depending on the ongoing antiplatelet or NSAID exposure, and while eradication reduces ulcer recurrence and future bleeding risk in H. pylori–positive ulcers, the magnitude differs by context, so I should not overstate the exact percentage reduction in every subgroup despite consistent directionality of benefit with cure of H. pylori [^111qdExV] [^116WK1c5].

> But wait, what if the patient has specific vulnerabilities; I should double-check high-risk populations where BSS is more problematic, including cirrhosis with baseline coagulopathy, older adults at risk of salicylate accumulation, concomitant anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy with elevated rebleeding risk, and pregnancy or lactation if using bismuth-based regimens with metronidazole and tetracycline, which strengthens the case to avoid routine BSS post-bleed and to use bismuth-containing quadruple therapy only when clearly indicated and carefully supervised [^112pS5Um] [^116iu7Zo] [^1159J6si] [^111GULr1].

> I should confirm drug–drug and regimen-specific cautions if bismuth quadruple therapy is chosen; metronidazole mandates strict avoidance of alcohol and disulfiram, tetracycline has the methoxyflurane contraindication and intracranial hypertension risk, and anticoagulant interactions may necessitate closer monitoring, which means risk mitigation and patient counseling are essential when bismuth-containing regimens are used after a bleed [^1121LigR] [^113bH5Mb] [^116M1zpr] [^1159J6si].

> Pulling this together, the risk–benefit analysis is clear for most situations: routine use of bismuth subsalicylate after a GI bleed for symptomatic control offers no proven benefit and carries salicylate-related risks for platelet dysfunction, potential coagulopathy, gastric irritation, and confounding of stool monitoring, so it should be avoided; the exception is a short, guideline-recommended bismuth-containing quadruple therapy course for confirmed H. pylori infection in the stabilized post-bleed patient, undertaken with endoscopic control, acid suppression, and close supervision to achieve eradication and reduce future recurrence and rebleeding risk [^114qTnSw] [^114ewuQx] [^116iu7Zo].

> Concretely, if H. pylori testing is positive after hemostasis, I would initiate optimized bismuth quadruple therapy with PPI plus bismuth plus tetracycline plus metronidazole for 14 days, using standard dosing and counseling on adherence and adverse effects, while avoiding alcohol and contraindicated co-medications, and if H. pylori testing is negative or eradication is not indicated at that time, I would avoid BSS entirely for symptom control and prioritize acid suppression, eradication of risk factors, and careful monitoring for rebleeding signs instead [^114qTnSw] [^111FuCq7] [^1121LigR].

No, bismuth subsalicylate is **not safe following a recent GI bleed** due to its salicylate component [^116iu7Zo], which can impair platelet function and increase rebleeding risk [^116iu7Zo] [^112pS5Um]. It is **especially risky** in patients with coagulopathy, liver disease, or those on anticoagulants or antiplatelets [^1159J6si]. Use **PPIs or H2 blockers** [^111NEbxv] instead, and avoid bismuth subsalicylate until hemostasis is confirmed [^112Rs5po] and bleeding risk is low.

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to GI bleeding

Bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the GI tract to bismuth and salicylic acid [^113kPeWq]; the salicylate is systemically absorbed and can impair platelet function, **increasing bleeding risk**, particularly following a recent GI bleed [^11177b74].

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

Although trials specifically in post-GI bleed patients are limited, case reports and clinical experience **highlight significant risks**:

- **Salicylate toxicity**: Chronic use can cause salicylate toxicity, including coagulopathy and bleeding complications [^11177b74] [^116iu7Zo].

- **Coagulopathy**: Documented in patients with underlying liver disease, exacerbating bleeding risk [^112pS5Um].

- **Black stools**: Can mimic melena, complicating clinical assessment of ongoing bleeding [^116zMWmW] [^114ewuQx].

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend bismuth subsalicylate** for patients with recent GI bleeding and instead emphasize [^113styHD]:

- **Risk stratification**: Use validated scoring systems (e.g. Rockall, Glasgow-Blatchford) [^114LR9xo] to guide management decisions [^114mEdu2].

- **Alternative therapies**: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 receptor antagonists are preferred for acid suppression and ulcer healing.

- **Avoidance of salicylates**: Salicylate-containing medications should be avoided due to their potential to impair platelet function and increase bleeding risk.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing safety

Several patient-specific factors **significantly affect the safety** of bismuth subsalicylate following a GI bleed:

| **Patient factor** | **Impact on safety** |
|-|-|
| Age (elderly) | Increased risk of bleeding and salicylate toxicity [^111icbSE] |
| Comorbidities (e.g. liver disease, coagulopathy) | Higher risk of bleeding complications [^112pS5Um] |
| Concurrent medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelets) | Increased bleeding risk due to impaired platelet function |
| Renal impairment | Increased risk of salicylate accumulation and toxicity [^112HoEYF] |

---

## Alternative medications and therapies

Given these risks with bismuth subsalicylate, **alternative medications and therapies are recommended** for patients recovering from a GI bleed:

- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Effective in reducing gastric acid secretion, promoting ulcer healing, and preventing rebleeding [^111NEbxv].

- **H2 receptor antagonists**: Useful for acid suppression and ulcer healing.

- **Sucralfate**: Provides a protective barrier over ulcers, promoting healing without affecting platelet function.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If bismuth subsalicylate is considered (e.g. for H. pylori eradication) [^114qTnSw], **careful monitoring is essential**: perform regular clinical assessments for recurrent bleeding, salicylate toxicity, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and periodically evaluate coagulation parameters, renal function, and salicylate levels when clinically indicated [^113kPeWq].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bismuth subsalicylate is **not recommended** following a recent GI bleed because its salicylate component [^1141EvCn] impairs platelet function and increases bleeding risk. PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and sucralfate are preferred alternatives. If bismuth subsalicylate is deemed necessary, careful monitoring and individualized risk assessment are essential.

### Salicylate toxicity from chronic bismuth subsalicylate use [^11177b74]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening confusion, falls, and hearing impairment. An initial workup for infectious, metabolic, and structural causes was unrevealing. However, further history revealed that he had been ingesting one to two bottles of Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) daily for gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms.

On his second day of admission, the plasma salicylate concentration was 2.08 mmol/L (reference range 1.10–2.20 mmol/L), despite no sources of salicylate in the hospital. He was diagnosed with chronic salicylate toxicity, and Pepto-Bismol use was discontinued. The patient was treated supportively with isotonic intravenous fluids only, and plasma salicylate concentration fell to less than 0.36 mmol/L. Concurrently, all his symptoms resolved.

This case highlights the potential adverse effects of over-the-counter medications. The diagnosis of chronic salicylate toxicity is challenging, especially in the elderly and in undifferentiated presentations, as it can be missed if not suspected.

### Bismuth subsalicylate coagulopathy in a patient with chronic liver disease [^112pS5Um]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Low credibility.

Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) is the active ingredient in several over-the-counter antacid and antidiarrheal medications. Coagulopathy in the context of acetylsalicylic acid toxicity is well documented, but it is not documented in cases of bismuth subsalicylate overuse. This case report presents coagulopathy resulting from BSS poisoning in a patient with underlying cirrhosis. The patient's elevated prothrombin time suggests inhibition of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Furthermore, the patient exhibited decreased factor V activity, which is crucial for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Patients with cirrhosis often present with hypoprothrombinemia, a condition that may be exacerbated by salicylate-induced coagulopathy. Given the widespread use of BSS products, it is important for physicians to recognize coagulopathy as a potential manifestation of toxicity, particularly in patients with underlying liver disease.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^116WK1c5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Evaluable patients were defined as having a confirmed duodenal ulcer within two years prior to treatment and having taken 14 days of bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline (ranging from 11 to 17 days). Eradication was defined as the absence of H. pylori infection confirmed by culture, histology, rapid urease test, and/or urea breath test, conducted from at least four weeks post-treatment up to one year post-treatment.

- **Study 2**: This study evaluated the long-term outcomes in patients treated for active duodenal ulcers by frequently monitoring for ulcer recurrence for up to one year after therapy. Patients who received bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), metronidazole (MTZ), and tetracycline hydrochloride (TCN) for two weeks with ranitidine were compared to those who received ranitidine alone. The ulcer recurrence rates at six months and one year, regardless of post-treatment eradication status, are summarized for duodenal ulcer patients who were H. pylori positive at baseline.

		- Includes all patients randomized to therapy who were H. pylori positive at baseline (verified by culture, histology, and/or urea breath test) with ulcer healing and 24 or 48 weeks of endoscopic follow-up data.

- **Eradication of H. pylori in patients with a history of duodenal ulcer disease**: A controlled, multicenter trial (Study 4) in the U.S. compared the rates of eradication of H. pylori following 14 days of treatment with Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets, Metronidazole Tablets, and Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules versus a control group using bismuth subsalicylate.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^116Wnxuj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the ACG 2012 guidelines recommend performing endoscopy within 12 hours of hospital admission for patients with UGIB who exhibit high-risk clinical features, such as tachycardia, hypotension, bloody emesis, or bloody nasogastric aspirate.

### Can risk stratification improve the management of acute upper-gastrointestinal bleeding [^115cNFiT]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute upper-gastrointestinal bleeding is a common indication for emergency admission to the hospital. Risk-stratification scores have been devised to identify patients at risk of re-bleeding or death; however, these scores have usually required both clinical and endoscopic assessment. Two recent studies have employed clinical criteria alone to identify low-risk patients that may not require admission or in-patient endoscopy. While each of these studies has individual merit, both are unable to answer the question of whether risk stratification improves health outcomes or resource use in acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage. They will nevertheless help the development of guidelines that enable patients to be managed more efficiently and outcomes to be compared more fairly.

### Biaxin [^1112sWiz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

In a U.S. double-blind, randomized, multicenter, dose-comparison trial, clarithromycin + ranitidine bismuth citrate therapy was evaluated. Ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. for the first 2 weeks was found to have an equivalent H. pylori eradication rate (based on culture and histology) compared to ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks plus clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. for the first 2 weeks.

H. pylori eradication was defined as no positive test 4 weeks following the end of treatment. Patients needed two negative tests to be considered eradicated of H. pylori. The following patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis:

- **Exclusion criteria**:
	- Patients not infected with H. pylori pre-study
	- Dropouts
	- Patients with major protocol violations
	- Patients with missing H. pylori tests

Patients excluded from the intent-to-treat analysis included those not infected with H. pylori pre-study and those with missing H. pylori tests pre-study. Patients were assessed for H. pylori eradication 4 weeks following treatment, regardless of their healing status at the end of treatment.

The relationship between H. pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer recurrence was assessed in a combined analysis of six U.S. randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials using ranitidine bismuth citrate with or without antibiotics. The results from approximately 650 U.S. patients showed that the risk of ulcer recurrence within 6 months of treatment…

### Black tongue secondary to bismuth subsalicylate: Case report and review of exogenous causes of macular lingual pigmentation [^111uskzg]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Macular pigmentation of the tongue can be acquired following exposure to exogenous agents. Black lingual hyperpigmentation was observed during the full-body skin examination of a man with a history of remetastatic malignant melanoma. His tongue spontaneously returned to its normal pink color later that day. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) was suspected as the pigment-inducing agent; subsequently, re-challenge with the antacid confirmed it to be the cause of his acquired, albeit transient, black tongue.

The ingestion of medications, including other antacids, analgesics, antidepressants, antihypertensives, and several antimicrobials, has been associated with the development of acquired macular lingual pigmentation. In addition, hyperpigmentation of the tongue has been observed following the deposition of amalgam and the injection of local anesthesia, doxorubicin, interferon alpha, or ribavirin. Also, inhalation of heroin, methaqualone vapors, or tobacco has resulted in lingual hyperpigmentation.

All of the patients with acquired macular lingual hyperpigmentation had tongues with a smooth surface without enlargement of the filiform papillae. Many of the individuals with hyperpigmented tongues had either black or dark skin color. The onset of tongue pigmentation varied from less than one day to several years after initial exposure to the associated exogenous agent. The color of the tongue usually returned to normal after the pigment-inducing agent was discontinued.

### Management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Guideline recommendations from the International Consensus Group [^113styHD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

This update of the 2010 International Consensus Recommendations on the management of patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) refines previous important statements and presents new clinically relevant recommendations.

- **Methods**: An international multidisciplinary group of experts developed the recommendations. Data sources included evidence summarized in previous recommendations, as well as systematic reviews and trials identified from a series of literature searches of several electronic bibliographic databases from inception to April 2018. Using an iterative process, group members formulated key questions. Two methodologists prepared evidence profiles and assessed the quality (certainty) of evidence relevant to the key questions according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Group members reviewed the evidence profiles and, using a consensus process, voted on recommendations and determined the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional.

- **Recommendations**:
	- **Preendoscopic management**: The group suggests using a Glasgow Blatchford score of 1 or less to identify patients at very low risk for rebleeding, who may not require hospitalization. In patients without cardiovascular disease, the suggested hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion is less than 80 g/L, with a higher threshold for those with cardiovascular disease.
	- **Endoscopic management**: The group suggests that patients with acute UGIB undergo endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation. Thermocoagulation and sclerosant injection are recommended as treatment modalities.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^112w3wyt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Treatment: There is no specific antidote for salicylate poisoning. If there are no contraindications, vomiting should be induced as soon as possible with syrup of ipecac, or gastric lavage should be instituted, provided that no more than one hour has elapsed since ingestion. Activated charcoal and a cathartic may be administered as primary decontamination therapy in those cases where more than one hour has elapsed since ingestion, or to further decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract in those who have already received ipecac or gastric lavage. Plasma salicylate levels may be useful; a common nomogram can be used to help predict the severity of intoxication. Supportive and symptomatic treatment should be provided, with emphasis on correcting fluid, electrolyte, blood glucose, and acid-base disturbances. Elimination may be enhanced by urinary alkalinization, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion. Since hemodialysis aids in correcting acid-base disturbances, this method may be preferred over hemoperfusion.

- **Metronidazole**: Symptoms of metronidazole toxicity include nausea, vomiting, and neurotoxic effects such as ataxia, seizures, and peripheral neuropathy.

	- **Treatment**: There is no specific antidote for metronidazole overdose. Management of the patient should consist of symptomatic and supportive therapy. Metronidazole is dialyzable.

- **Tetracycline**: Therapeutic and overdose quantities of tetracycline can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

	- **Treatment**: There is no specific antidote for tetracycline overdose. Management of the patient should consist of symptomatic and supportive therapy.

### Preventing recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection who are taking low-dose aspirin or naproxen [^111qdExV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). High credibility.

Many patients who have had upper gastrointestinal bleeding continue to take low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for musculoskeletal pain. It is uncertain whether infection with Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for bleeding in such patients.

- **Methods**: We studied patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were infected with H. pylori and who were taking low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs. We evaluated whether eradication of the infection or omeprazole treatment was more effective in preventing rebleeding. We recruited patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding that was confirmed by endoscopy. Their ulcers were healed by daily treatment with 20 mg of omeprazole for eight weeks or longer. Then, those who had been taking aspirin were given 80 mg of aspirin daily, and those who had been taking other NSAIDs were given 500 mg of naproxen twice daily for six months. The patients in each group were then randomly assigned separately to receive 20 mg of omeprazole daily for six months or one week of eradication therapy, consisting of 120 mg of bismuth subcitrate, 500 mg of tetracycline, and 400 mg of metronidazole, all given four times daily, followed by placebo for six months.

- **Results**: We enrolled 400 patients (250 of whom were taking aspirin and 150 of whom were taking other NSAIDs). Among those taking aspirin, the probability of rebleeding during the six-month period was 1.9 percent for patients who received eradication therapy and 0.9 percent for patients who received omeprazole.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^114ewuQx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Laboratory test interactions**: Bismuth absorbs x-rays and may interfere with x-ray diagnostic procedures of the gastrointestinal tract. Bismuth subsalicylate may cause a temporary and harmless darkening of the stool; however, this change does not interfere with standard tests for occult blood. Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and hexokinase glucose. Values of zero may be observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide (NAD+ NADH). Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole (322 nm) at pH 7.

- **Development of drug resistant bacteria**: Prescribing bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^111FuCq7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019).

- **Dosage and administration**:
	- **Adults**: The recommended dosages are bismuth subsalicylate, 525 mg (two 262.4 mg chewable tablets); metronidazole, 250 mg (one 250-mg tablet); and tetracycline hydrochloride, 500 mg (one 500-mg capsule), taken four times daily for 14 days, plus an H2 antagonist approved for the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer. Patients should be instructed to take the medicines at mealtimes and at bedtime. The bismuth subsalicylate tablets should be chewed and swallowed, while the metronidazole tablet and tetracycline hydrochloride capsule should be swallowed whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces). Concomitantly prescribed H2 antagonist therapy should be taken as directed.

- **Fluid intake**:
	- Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluid, particularly with the bedtime dose of tetracycline hydrochloride, is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

- **Missed doses**:
	- Missed doses can be made up by continuing the normal dosing schedule until the medication is gone. Patients should not take double doses. If more than 4 doses are missed, the prescriber should be contacted.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^116M1zpr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Central and peripheral nervous system effects**: Metronidazole: Cases of convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, and peripheral neuropathy (including optic neuropathy) have been reported with metronidazole. Encephalopathy has been reported in association with cerebellar toxicity characterized by ataxia, dizziness, and dysarthria. CNS lesions seen on MRI have been described in reports of encephalopathy. These symptoms are generally reversible within days to weeks upon discontinuation of metronidazole. CNS lesions seen on MRI have also been described as reversible. Peripheral neuropathy, mainly of sensory type, has been reported and is characterized by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported with metronidazole. Symptoms can occur within hours of dose administration and generally resolve after metronidazole therapy is discontinued.

- **Tetracycline**: Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause IH. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted.

### Resumption of anticoagulant therapy after anticoagulant-related gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VeRkV]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is permanently discontinued in up to 50% of patients following a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. A previous meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of thromboembolism and death, and a non-statistically significant increased risk of re-bleeding associated with resumption. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to determine the risks of reGI bleeding, thromboembolism, and death in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for new references from January 2014 to September 2017. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies involving adults with OAC-related GI bleeding were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's ROBINS-I tool. Pooled relative risk (RR) ratios were calculated using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: We identified 12 observational studies involving 3,098 patients. There was an increased risk of reGI bleeding (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.47–2.48, I² = 0%, 11 studies), and a reduced risk of thromboembolism (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68, I² = 59.8%, 9 studies) and death (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38–0.70, I² = 71.8%, 8 studies) in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not. Eleven studies were judged to be at serious risk of bias due to confounding.

- **Conclusions**: Resuming OAC after OAC-related GI bleeding appears to be associated with an increase in reGI bleeding, but a reduction in thromboembolism and death. Further prospective data are needed to identify accurate risk factors and optimize management strategies.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1171TjRv]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Multiple comprehensive international guidelines exist for the management of UGIB. The most recently updated of these include guidance from the American College of Gastroenterology and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. The seventh iteration of the Baveno consensus was published in 2022 and provided updated evidence-based recommendations on the management of variceal bleeding. These guidelines are referenced throughout the paper, and where differences do exist, usually in areas with less evidence, relevance and applicability were considered.

### Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding [^113vEFdS]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

This is one of a series of statements discussing the utilization of GI endoscopy in common clinical situations. The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy prepared this text. In preparing this guideline, a MEDLINE literature search was performed, and additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and from recommendations of expert consultants. When little or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and reports from recognized experts. Guidelines for appropriate utilization of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance to these recommendations.

### Evolution of the use, effectiveness and safety of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for infection between 2013 and 2021: results from the European registry on management (Hp-EuReg) [^111jg7mQ]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

During the study period, 15,582 (31%) patients out of a total of 49,690 received a bismuth-based treatment. The mean age of patients was 50 years (± 17.8); 8,897 (62%) were women. The most frequent indications were non-investigated dyspepsia (21%), functional dyspepsia (33%), and peptic ulcer (17%). The most frequently prescribed scheme was ScBQT, concomitantly with a PPI, in 6,668 cases (43% of all bismuth treatments). The remaining 8,914 cases were non-ScBQT (NScBQT) using different antibiotic combinations. These NScBQT encompassed 45 different treatment schemes. Of these, 26 schemes were used in fewer than 10 patients and a further 7 were prescribed in more than 100 patients. The latter schemes were selected for further analysis, as described in the Methods section. The most frequently used NScBQTs were PPI+CAB, PPI+LAB, and PPI+MTB (online supplemental file 4).

### Risk stratification in upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112RWpqp]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding is a common clinical problem that accounts for a large number of hospitalizations and results in substantial health care expenditures. Risk stratification after UGI hemorrhage involves the use of clinical and endoscopic parameters to predict the likelihood of rebleeding and death. This information can guide management decisions, such as the necessity of hospital admission, the application of endoscopic hemostatic therapy, and the length of inpatient stay. This concise review examines the literature on risk stratification in UGI hemorrhage and attempts to integrate evidence-based data into the clinical decision-making process.

### Proposed risk stratification in upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: Is hospitalisation essential [^113NsHbK]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (UGIH) are typically admitted to the hospital regardless of the bleed's severity. The aim of this study was to identify patients who could be safely managed without hospitalisation and immediate inpatient endoscopy.

- **Methods**: Based on a literature review, a protocol was devised using clinical and laboratory data regarded as being of prognostic value. A retrospective observational study of consecutive patients who attended the emergency department (ED) with UGIH was conducted during one calendar month.

- **Results**: Fifty-four patients were identified, of whom 44 (81%) were admitted. Twelve suffered an adverse event. One of the 10 patients (10%) initially discharged from the ED was later admitted. Strict implementation of the protocol would have resulted in the safe discharge of a further 15 patients (34% of those admitted), and a saving of an estimated 37 bed days per month.

- **Conclusions**: Patients at low risk from UGIH may be identified in the ED. If validated, this protocol may improve patient management and resource utilisation.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk scores: who, when and why [^114isajK]. World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology (2016). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Rockall score for upper GI bleeding" is a prediction tool for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and variceal hemorrhage.

The Initial Rockall Score is a clinical calculator used for predicting mortality due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. This scoring system is applicable to patients who present with upper GI bleeding, regardless of the underlying cause. The score is calculated based on three parameters: age, shock, and presence of comorbidity. The higher the score, the higher the risk of mortality.

The clinical utility of the Initial Rockall Score is to aid in risk stratification of patients with upper GI bleeding, helping clinicians to identify high-risk patients who may require more aggressive management or intervention. It can also assist in decision-making regarding hospital admission and discharge.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Initial Rockall Score. However, it should be noted that this score does not take into account the severity or source of the bleeding and therefore should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and diagnostic tools.

The Initial Rockall score is designed to estimate the risk of mortality due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding by evaluating three factors: age, the presence and degree of shock, and any major comorbidities. Each factor is assigned a score, and these scores are then summed to provide an overall risk score.

For age, the scoring is:

- **Less than 60 years**: 0 points
- **Between 60 and 79 years**: 1 point
- **80 years or older**: 2 points

Shock is assessed based on blood pressure and other clinical signs, and comorbidities are evaluated for their potential impact on patient outcomes.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly [^111icbSE]. Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding affects a substantial number of elderly people and is a frequent indication for hospitalization. Bleeding can originate from either the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract, and patients with gastrointestinal bleeding present with a range of symptoms. In the elderly, the nature, severity, and outcome of bleeding are influenced by the presence of medical comorbidities and the use of antiplatelet medication. This review discusses trends in the epidemiology and outcome of gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients. Specific causes of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding are explored, and recommendations for approaches to endoscopic diagnosis and therapy are provided.

### Structure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient bismuth subsalicylate [^1129ikTo]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Determining the structure of pharmaceutical compounds is invaluable for drug development but remains challenging, especially for those that form as small crystals with defects. Bismuth subsalicylate, among the most commercially significant bismuth compounds, is an active ingredient in over-the-counter medications such as Pepto-Bismol, used to treat dyspepsia and H. pylori infections. Despite its century-long history, the structure of bismuth subsalicylate is still under debate. Here, we show that advanced electron microscopy techniques, namely three-dimensional electron diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy, can provide insight into the structure of active pharmaceutical ingredients that are difficult to characterize using conventional methods due to their small size or intricate structural features.

Hierarchical clustering analysis of three-dimensional electron diffraction data from ordered crystals of bismuth subsalicylate revealed a layered structure. A detailed investigation using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy showed variations in the stacking of layers, the presence of which has likely hindered structure solution by other means. Together, these modern electron crystallography techniques provide a toolbox for structure determination of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug discovery, as demonstrated by this study of bismuth subsalicylate.

### Potassium-competitive acid blocker vs proton-pump inhibitor in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy who are at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding: Rationale and design of the randomized PROTECT-HBR trial [^114oqPMq]. American Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is recommended for patients receiving chronic antithrombotic therapy who are at high risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. However, concerns about the long-term safety and efficacy of chronic PPI use have emerged. Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CAB) represent a novel class of acid suppressants, offering more acid stability, a rapid onset of action, less variability with CYP2C19 polymorphisms, and a longer duration of action compared to PPIs.

- **Design**: The PROTECT-HBR trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group clinical trial. Approximately 3,320 patients with known cardiac or vascular disease receiving antithrombotic drugs (either antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents) and who are at high risk of GI bleeding will be randomized to receive either P-CAB (tegoprazan 50 mg once daily) or PPI (rabeprazole 20 mg once daily) for up to 12 months. The primary endpoint is a composite outcome of upper GI clinical events, including overt or occult GI bleeding, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction, or perforation at 12 months. Secondary endpoints include cardiovascular events and safety outcomes.

- **Results**: As of December 2024, approximately 1,460 patients were enrolled from 32 participating sites in South Korea. Complete enrollment is anticipated to occur around the mid- or late-term of 2025, with primary results expected by 2027.

PROTECT-HBR is a large-scale, multicenter clinical trial that will provide a pivotal comparison of the efficacy and safety of the novel P-CAB, tegoprazan, with those of traditional PPIs.

### Major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism [^116Yksuh]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Low credibility.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a frequent site of bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE). At-risk patients have not been consistently identified yet.

- **Methods**: We used the RIETE registry to assess the clinical characteristics of patients developing major GI bleeding during the course of anticoagulation. Then, we built a predictive score based on multivariable analysis, aiming to identify patients at increased risk for major GI bleeding.

- **Results**: We included 87,431 patients with acute VTE. During the course of anticoagulation, 778 (0.89%) suffered major GI bleeding, 815 (0.93%) non-major GI bleeding, and 1462 (1.67%) had major bleeding outside the GI tract. During the first 30 days after major GI bleeding, 7.6% of patients re-bled, 3.9% had VTE recurrences, and 33% died. On multivariable analysis, male sex, age ≥ 70 years, initial VTE presentation as pulmonary embolism, active cancer, prior VTE, recent major bleeding in the GI tract, esophageal varicosities, anemia, abnormal prothrombin time, renal insufficiency, and use of corticosteroids were associated with an increased risk for major GI bleeding. Using the predictive score, 39,591 patients (45%) were at low risk; 36,602 (42%) at intermediate risk; 9315 (11%) at high risk; and 1923 (2.2%) at very high risk. Their rates of major GI bleeding were: 0.21%, 0.96%, 2.41%, and 6.08%, respectively. The c-statistic was 0.771 (95% CI: 0.755–0.786).

- **Conclusions**: We have developed a score which has the potential to identify patients at increased risk for GI bleeding, but further validation is necessary.

### Sprix [^115G235w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sprix is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcers and/or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation [see Contraindications (4)].

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ketorolac, can cause serious gastrointestinal adverse events such as inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Notably, only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

- **Risk factors for GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation**: Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include the longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients.

### Anticoagulant-associated gastrointestinal bleeding: Framework for decisions about whether, when and how to resume anticoagulants [^117EJMk9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most frequent single site of oral anticoagulant (OAC)-associated major bleeding. Patients with major GI bleeding experience morbidity and a substantial risk of short-term all-cause mortality up to 10%. While OACs are frequently discontinued during acute bleeding, there is substantial uncertainty about whether, when, and how OACs should be resumed after bleeding has resolved. Limited evidence suggests a lower risk of thromboembolism and death, and a higher risk of rebleeding with OAC resumption. However, the absolute risks and optimal timing of anticoagulation remain uncertain based on these observational studies at risk of bias, particularly due to baseline confounding.

In addition to an individualized approach to determining the benefits and harms of treatment decisions informed by the best available evidence about thrombosis and rebleeding, discussions should meaningfully incorporate patient values and preferences. The objective of this review is to provide a framework for decision-making by summarizing the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of OAC-associated GI bleeding, providing an approach for assessment and risk stratification for OAC resumption and its timing, and outlining strategies for the prevention of rebleeding.

### A COX-2-specific inhibitor plus a proton-pump inhibitor: is this a reasonable approach to reduction in NSAIDs' GI toxicity [^11142sZW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The two prevailing approaches to decrease risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated gastrointestinal (GI) events are the use of a COX-2 inhibitor or co-therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). A major limitation of each approach is that, in patients at the highest risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, neither treatment is effective when used as a stand-alone strategy. An important question is whether combination therapy with a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI has improved GI safety compared to a traditional NSAID plus a PPI.

This study evaluated high GI risk patients who were taking, along with their NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor, either the PPI, esomeprazole, or the placebo. It confirms that our approach of adding PPIs to reduce NSAIDs' ulcer risks is an effective strategy. However, this study did not show a safety advantage for using a COX-2 inhibitor instead of a traditional NSAID in high GI risk patients who take PPIs. Thus, there continues to be no prospective data to support a GI benefit of COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI over traditional NSAID plus a PPI in high-risk patients.

### A "rare" case of melena in a 3-year-old [^116zMWmW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Melena is a potential sign of life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however, there are numerous substances ingested that result in a stool appearance similar to melena. Examples of such substances include black licorice, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron supplements. We report a case of a well-appearing 3-year-old Vietnamese girl presenting to our emergency department after two episodes of "black, sticky" stool. The cause of her "melena" was determined after her father revealed that she had ingested two bowls of pork blood soup during the preceding 12 hours. This case highlights the need for a careful dietary history and cultural considerations in children presenting with what may appear to be melena.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^111NEbxv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the step-wise management of patients with overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemodynamic status is first assessed, and resuscitation is initiated as needed. Patients are risk-stratified based on features such as hemodynamic status, comorbidities, age, and laboratory tests. Pre-endoscopic erythromycin is considered to increase diagnostic yield at the first endoscopy. A pre-endoscopic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) may be considered to decrease the need for endoscopic therapy but does not improve clinical outcomes. Upper endoscopy is generally performed within 24 hours. The endoscopic features of ulcers direct further management. Patients with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessels receive endoscopic therapy (e.g. bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, sclerosant, clips), and those with an adherent clot may receive endoscopic therapy; these patients then receive intravenous PPI with a bolus followed by continuous infusion. Patients with flat spots or clean-based ulcers do not require endoscopic therapy or intensive PPI therapy.

Rebleeding after endoscopic therapy is treated with a second endoscopic treatment; if bleeding persists or recurs, treatment with surgery or interventional radiology is undertaken. The prevention of rebleeding is based on the etiology of the bleeding ulcer. Helicobacter pylori is eradicated, and after cure is documented, anti-ulcer therapy is generally not given. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are stopped; if they must be resumed, a low-dose COX-2-selective NSAID plus PPI is used.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^113kPeWq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics for the components of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules, when coadministered, have not been studied. There is no information about the gastric mucosal concentrations of bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline after administration of these agents concomitantly or in combination with an acid suppressive agent. The systemic pharmacokinetic information presented below is based on studies in which each product was administered alone.

- **Bismuth subsalicylate**: Upon oral administration, bismuth subsalicylate is almost completely hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to bismuth and salicylic acid. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of bismuth subsalicylate following oral administration can be described by the individual pharmacokinetics of bismuth and salicylic acid.

- **Bismuth**: Less than 1% of bismuth from oral doses of bismuth subsalicylate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation. Absorbed bismuth is distributed throughout the body and is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 90%). Bismuth has multiple disposition half-lives with an intermediate half-life of 5 to 11 days and a terminal half-life of 21 to 72 days. Elimination of bismuth is primarily through urinary and biliary routes, with a renal clearance of 50 ± 18 mL/min. The mean trough blood bismuth concentration after 2 weeks of oral administration of 787 mg bismuth subsalicylate (3 chewable tablets) four times daily remains to be further annotated.

- **Contraindications**:

- **Constipation**: Lotronex should not be initiated in patients with constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **History of severe bowel or hepatic disorders**: Lotronex is contraindicated in patients with a history of the following:
	- Chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation
	- Intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, and/or adhesions
	- Ischemic colitis, impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or hypercoagulable state
	- Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
	- Diverticulitis
	- Severe hepatic impairment

- **Concomitant use of fluvoxamine**: Concomitant administration of Lotronex with fluvoxamine is contraindicated. Fluvoxamine, a known strong inhibitor of CYP1A2, has been shown to increase mean alosetron plasma concentrations (AUC) approximately 6-fold and prolong the half-life by approximately 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^112xjDij]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The components of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets, Metronidazole Tablets, and Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules — in combination with an H2 antagonist — are indicated for the eradication of H. pylori for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or with a history of duodenal ulcer). The eradication of H. pylori has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence in patients with active duodenal ulcer disease (see CLINICAL STUDIES and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of these medications and other antibacterial drugs, Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets, Metronidazole Tablets, and Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Expert review [^112Rs5po]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and best practice advice statements regarding the use of endoscopic therapies in treating patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This review is framed around the 10 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, which reflect landmark and recent published articles in this field. It also reflects the experiences of the authors, who are gastroenterologists with extensive experience in managing and teaching others to treat patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB).

- **Best practice advice 1**: Endoscopic therapy should achieve hemostasis in the majority of patients with NVUGIB.
- **Best practice advice 2**: Initial management of the patient with NVUGIB should focus on resuscitation, triage, and preparation for upper endoscopy. After stabilization, patients with NVUGIB should undergo endoscopy with endoscopic treatment of sites with active bleeding or high-risk stigmata for rebleeding.
- **Best practice advice 3**: Endoscopists should be familiar with the indications, efficacy, and limitations of the current treatment modalities for NVUGIB.

Adverse reactions in clinical trials reveal that, due to the diverse settings in which they are conducted, direct comparison to other drug trials may not be valid and may not accurately represent real-world outcomes. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) when all three components were administered together appear in Table 1. These were predominantly gastrointestinal and were reversible, rarely leading to therapy discontinuation.

- **Common adverse reactions (≥ 1%)**: darkening of the tongue, black or dark stools, and metallic taste. This includes reactions reported at ≥ 1% in patients taking bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline during Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4. In Studies 1, 2, and 3 (N = 197), most patients were also on acid suppression therapy.

- **Less common adverse reactions (< 1%)**:
		- **Gastrointestinal**: dry mouth, dysphagia, eructation, GI monilia, glossitis, intestinal obstruction, rectal hemorrhage, stomatitis.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^112PSMut]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Tetracycline is present in human milk at concentrations similar to maternal serum levels. However, it binds with calcium in human milk. Data indicate that oral absorption of tetracycline in infants is low due to the calcium binding in human milk. It is not known whether bismuth subsalicylate is excreted in human milk.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules in pediatric patients infected with H. pylori have not been established. Tetracycline use in children may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. These medications should not be used in children up to 8 years of age (see WARNINGS).

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, elderly patients may have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant diseases or other drug therapies. Bismuth subsalicylate, a component of these medications, is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in this population.

### Low-volume polyethylene glycol and bisacodyl for bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy: a meta-analysis [^112XsqGY]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

OR 1.15; 95% CI: 0.81–1.64, P = 0.44; I² = 10%, P = 0.34, and nausea - OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49–0.88, P < 0.05. Bisacodyl, at a dose of 5 mg, has been withdrawn from the market in the United States per FDA recommendations due to safety concerns, specifically ischemic colitis. Given this recent event, further randomized controlled trials need to be performed to evaluate the benefit of 2 L PEG with 5 mg of bisacodyl.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis shows that low-volume (2 L) PEG with bisacodyl demonstrates less nausea and vomiting without adversely affecting bowel preparation. Therefore, low-volume PEG with bisacodyl appears to be a reasonable alternative to the traditional 4 L PEG for bowel preparation in appropriate patients. However, given the increased risk of ischemic colitis with larger doses of bisacodyl and PEG, additional randomized controlled trials with low-dose bisacodyl and PEG would be extremely beneficial.

- **Summary box**:

	- **What is already known**:
		Adequate bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy is extremely important. Many studies have evaluated alternative bowel preparation methods to improve tolerability without affecting the efficacy of the traditional 4 L polyethylene glycol (PEG). Adding bisacodyl to 2 L PEG may improve tolerability without sacrificing efficacy; however, studies have varied in their results.

	- **What the new findings are**:
		2 L PEG with bisacodyl does improve patient tolerability compared to the traditional 4 L PEG. 2 L PEG with bisacodyl demonstrates no statistically significant.

### Key points from the revised Maastricht consensus report: The impact on general practice [^115d831M]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcers, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post-gastric cancer resection, first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes. Advisable indications include functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Because H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, nor does it exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression.

Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce rebleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs. Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^117Mt6rd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Busulfan

Metronidazole has been reported to increase plasma concentrations of busulfan, which can result in an increased risk for serious busulfan toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules should not be administered concomitantly with busulfan unless the benefit outweighs the risk. If no therapeutic alternatives are available and the concomitant administration with busulfan is medically necessary, frequent monitoring of busulfan plasma concentration should be performed, and the busulfan dose should be adjusted accordingly.

- **Inhibitors of CYP450 liver enzymes**: The simultaneous administration of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules, along with drugs that inhibit microsomal liver enzymes (such as cimetidine), may result in a prolonged half-life and decreased plasma clearance of metronidazole.

- **Inducers of CYP450 liver enzymes**: The simultaneous administration of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules, along with drugs that induce microsomal liver enzymes (such as phenytoin or phenobarbital), may accelerate the elimination of metronidazole, resulting in reduced plasma concentrations of metronidazole. Impaired clearance of phenytoin has also been reported in this situation. It is important to monitor phenytoin concentrations during treatment with bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^1159J6si]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Oral contraceptives**: As with many antibacterial preparations, the concomitant use of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules may reduce the effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives; breakthrough bleeding may occur. Patients should be advised to use an additional or different form of contraception. Women who become pregnant while taking bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules should be advised to notify their prescriber immediately.

- **Anticoagulants**: Individual components of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules have the potential to interact with anticoagulants. Monitoring anticoagulant therapy with appropriate adjustment of the anticoagulant dosage may be warranted if therapy is instituted.

- **Lithium**: In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term metronidazole therapy has been associated with elevation of serum lithium and, in a few cases, signs of lithium toxicity. Serum lithium and serum creatinine should be obtained several days after beginning metronidazole to detect any increase that may precede clinical symptoms of lithium toxicity.

- **Antidiabetic agents**: There is a possible enhanced hypoglycemic effect when given with salicylates.

- **Cimetidine**: The simultaneous administration of drugs that decrease microsomal liver enzyme activity, such as cimetidine, may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole.

### Proton pump inhibitor treatment initiated prior to endoscopic diagnosis in upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116VrEPo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common reason for emergency hospital admission. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production and are used to manage upper GI bleeding. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of proton pump inhibitors initiated before endoscopy in people with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of PPI treatment initiated prior to endoscopy in people with acute upper GI bleeding.

- **Search methods**: We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and major conference proceedings up to October 2008 for the previous versions of this review, and in April 2018, October 2019, and June 3, 2021, for this update. We also contacted experts in the field and searched trial registries and references of trials for any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with a PPI (oral or intravenous) versus control treatment with either placebo, histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) or no treatment, prior to endoscopy in hospitalised people with uninvestigated upper GI bleeding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted study data, and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes assessed at 30 days were mortality (our primary outcome), rebleeding, surgery, high-risk stigmata of recent haemorrhage (active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel or adherent clot) at index endoscopy, endoscopic haemostatic treatment at index endoscopy, and time to discharge.

### Diclofenac sodium [^1115DSvr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include a longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

- **Strategies to minimize the GI risks in NSAID-treated patients**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

### Towards personalised management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113A8nA2]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies for individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider a patient's personal needs, as well as the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management: pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment, endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis, and post-endoscopic management. We emphasize the need for personalized management strategies based on patient characteristics, the nature of bleeding lesions, and the clinical setting, including available resources.

The lower limit for this calculation was -2.2 but was truncated to 0 for reporting purposes.

- **Evaluable patients**: Evaluable patients were defined as having a history of a confirmed duodenal ulcer prior to treatment and having taken ≥ 70% of each component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules (bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, tetracycline hydrochloride) during the 14-day dosing period. Eradication was defined as no evidence of H. pylori infection by two or three diagnostic tests (culture, histology, and rapid urease test) from at least 4 weeks to 6 weeks post-treatment. Excluded from the evaluable population were patients who were noncompliant with medication, patients who were not infected with H. pylori at baseline, and patients without ulcer documentation. Three patients in the Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules group and one patient in the Control group were included as eradication failures because they withdrew from the study due to treatment-related adverse events.

- **Patient inclusion criteria**: Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline and had confirmed duodenal ulcer disease. All dropouts were included as failures of therapy. Eradication was defined as no evidence of H. pylori infection by culture, histology, or rapid urease test.

Compliance with the triple therapy regimen was also evaluated in the clinical study. In the intent-to-treat population, 93% of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules…

### Structure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient bismuth subsalicylate [^1127DQ53]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Structure determination of pharmaceutical compounds is invaluable for drug development but remains challenging for those that form as small crystals with defects. Bismuth subsalicylate, among the most commercially significant bismuth compounds, is an active ingredient in over-the-counter medications such as Pepto-Bismol, used to treat dyspepsia and H. pylori infections. Despite its century-long history, the structure of bismuth subsalicylate is still under debate. Here we show that advanced electron microscopy techniques, namely three-dimensional electron diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy, can give insight into the structure of active pharmaceutical ingredients that are difficult to characterize using conventional methods due to their small size or intricate structural features. Hierarchical clustering analysis of three-dimensional electron diffraction data from ordered crystals of bismuth subsalicylate revealed a layered structure. A detailed investigation using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy showed variations in the stacking of layers, the presence of which has likely hindered structure solution by other means. Together, these modern electron crystallography techniques provide a toolbox for structure determination of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug discovery, demonstrated by this study of bismuth subsalicylate.

### SPL drug information for Bismuth subsalicylate [^112HoEYF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of bismuth subsalicylate PO:

- **Constipation, diarrhea**: Use caution with a history of gastrointestinal disorders or in those prone to gastrointestinal disturbances. Monitor patients closely for gastrointestinal symptoms while on bismuth hydrochloride and provide dietary recommendations for managing constipation or diarrhea. If gastrointestinal side effects like constipation or diarrhea occur, adjust fluid intake, offer dietary changes, and consider symptomatic treatments as appropriate.

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Use extreme caution with impaired renal function. Use bismuth hydrochloride cautiously in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction and monitor renal function regularly during treatment. Discontinue the medication, provide appropriate renal support, and consult a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

- **Tremor, encephalopathy**: Use extreme caution with a history of neurological disorders, as well as those who are at risk of neurotoxicity. Administer bismuth hydrochloride within recommended doses and duration, and closely monitor patients for signs of neurotoxicity. Promptly discontinue the medication, provide supportive care, and consult with a neurologist for further assessment and management.
