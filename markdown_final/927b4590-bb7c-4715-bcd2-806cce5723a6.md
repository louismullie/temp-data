## Question

Hypertrophy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "hypertrophy" across skeletal muscle and the heart, with emphasis on mechanisms, clinical implications, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the term "hypertrophy" and distinguishing skeletal muscle from cardiac contexts. Then, I should verify the mechanistic distinctions between physiological and pathological hypertrophy in each domain. Next, I will examine skeletal muscle hypertrophy, including dose–response, the hypertrophy–strength dissociation, and practical training principles. After that, I should review cardiac hypertrophy, including HCM versus secondary LVH, diagnostics, risk stratification, and therapies. Finally, I will synthesize cross-cutting principles and highlight controversies and uncertainties that require cautious interpretation and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't conflate domains. In skeletal muscle, hypertrophy refers to an increase in muscle fiber size driven by increased protein synthesis relative to breakdown, typically in response to mechanical loading and resistance training, with internal cellular programs governing the magnitude of response to external stimuli [^111xN8ee]. In the heart, hypertrophy denotes cardiomyocyte enlargement without proliferation, initially adaptive to reduce wall stress, but with distinct physiological (e.g., athlete's heart) and pathological forms (e.g., pressure overload, HCM) that differ in signaling, structure, and outcomes [^111NNk8y]. Hold on, I should verify the HCM definition: contemporary guidance defines HCM as LV wall thickness ≥ 15 mm (or z-score > 2 in children) not explained by abnormal loading, with sarcomeric mutations accounting for a substantial fraction of cases, though not all, reflecting multifactorial etiologies in some patients [^113bN7UA] [^113S6NEf].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to avoid oversimplification. In skeletal muscle, mechanotransduction, ribosomal biogenesis, gene expression, and satellite cell activity integrate to increase myofibrillar protein accretion; importantly, internal biology often limits the extent of hypertrophy even when external training variables are optimized, which helps explain interindividual variability and the diminishing returns with training experience [^111xN8ee]. In the heart, physiological hypertrophy engages adaptive signaling (e.g. PI3K/Akt, IGF-1), whereas pathological hypertrophy involves maladaptive programs (e.g. MAPKs, Wnt, NFAT), fibrosis, electrical remodeling, and metabolic derangements that predispose to arrhythmias and failure; I need to ensure I note that recent work emphasizes metabolic reprogramming as a key driver in both forms [^111NNk8y].

> I will now examine skeletal muscle hypertrophy dose–response and the load–volume interplay. Wait, let me verify the claim that hypertrophy is load-independent when taken to failure: multiple network meta-analyses indicate that in untrained and recreationally trained adults, hypertrophy gains are similar across low, moderate, and high loads when sets are performed to volitional failure, whereas strength gains are load-dependent and favor higher loads due to neural and task-specific adaptations [^1118siXK] [^1137Hg4X]. But hold on, I should double-check the nuance: training status modifies this, with untrained individuals gaining more and trained individuals requiring greater volume to overcome attenuated anabolic signaling; thus, volume (number of weekly sets) becomes increasingly important with training experience, and many studies are short-term, limiting extrapolation beyond roughly 14 weeks [^1137Hg4X] [^115KkxB9].

> Let me consider the hypertrophy–strength dissociation so I don't overstate size as a proxy for performance. Evidence shows a weak correlation between changes in muscle size and changes in strength after training, and strength can be maintained despite detraining-induced atrophy; moreover, low- and high-load programs can yield similar hypertrophy but divergent strength outcomes, reinforcing partly independent mechanisms such as neural drive and motor unit recruitment for strength versus protein accretion for size [^112cXi2J]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought higher loads universally yield greater hypertrophy, but that's not correct; when effort is equated to failure, hypertrophy appears comparable across loads, whereas strength consistently favors higher loads, aligning with specificity and neural adaptation principles [^1118siXK] [^1137Hg4X].

> Now, I should translate this into practical training principles while acknowledging uncertainty. For hypertrophy, total weekly sets per muscle group in the 10–20 range, taken close to failure (about 2–3 reps in reserve), with loads spanning roughly 30–85% 1-RM, can be effective; progression in load, reps, or sets over time is essential, and periodization helps sustain adaptation as the ceiling effect emerges in trained individuals [^notfound]. I need to ensure I emphasize that many trials are short and often in untrained cohorts, so individualization and longer-term monitoring are prudent, especially as anabolic signaling becomes attenuated with training tenure [^1137Hg4X].

> Turning to cardiac hypertrophy, I should distinguish secondary LVH from HCM before discussing management. Secondary LVH arises from pressure or volume overload (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis) and can regress with blood pressure control and valve interventions; risk tracks with LV geometry patterns and is tightly linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, underscoring the importance of aggressive risk factor modification and guideline-directed antihypertensive therapy [^115ft7Ft] [^11681SNL]. Let me verify the prognostic data: concentric and eccentric patterns carry independent risk beyond blood pressure alone, and contemporary imaging (echo, CMR) refines diagnosis and risk attribution in hypertensive heart disease [^115ft7Ft] [^11681SNL].

> For HCM, I should confirm epidemiology and core pathophysiology. HCM affects roughly 1 in 500 to 1 in 200 adults, with sarcomeric mutations explaining about 30–50% of cases; phenotypic expression is heterogeneous, with dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction in many, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and a small but important risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly in certain phenotypes and ages [^111k4Zww] [^114bwSAp] [^113tHpvS]. Hold on, I should verify the obstruction prevalence; yes, approximately 60% have measurable LVOTO, though severity varies and not all are symptomatic [^111CeNiJ].

> Next, I should review diagnostics and family screening so I don't miss cascade implications. Echocardiography remains first-line to confirm unexplained LVH and assess obstruction, while CMR adds tissue characterization, scar detection, and morphologic detail; ECG and ambulatory monitoring inform arrhythmia burden, and exercise testing can unmask gradients or ischemia in selected patients [^111k4Zww]. I need to check family evaluation guidance: obtain a three-to-four generation pedigree, offer genetic testing to the proband with cascade testing of first-degree relatives, and initiate serial cardiac screening in at-risk relatives beginning in childhood, given early onset and variable penetrance; re-evaluation of variant classification every 2–3 years is advised due to evolving knowledge [^114bMXBc] [^111yZCED] [^116TEn2a].

> I should confirm risk stratification for sudden death because this drives ICD decisions. Contemporary models incorporate maximal wall thickness (≥ 30 mm confers markedly increased risk, especially in younger patients), family history of HCM-related SCD, unexplained recent syncope, nonsustained VT, and abnormal blood pressure response to exercise; however, guideline algorithms differ between societies, so shared decision-making is essential to balance sensitivity and specificity in individual patients [^116idaKZ] [^1143fVWA]. Wait, let me verify the absolute risk estimates; modern series place HCM-related mortality near 0.5% per year, reflecting improved risk stratification and ICD utilization, though residual risk persists in high-risk phenotypes [^116HQTSF].

> Management should be layered and mechanism-targeted, so I will outline it carefully. For obstructive HCM with refractory symptoms, guideline-directed medical therapy includes beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and disopyramide; septal myectomy remains the gold standard for persistent obstruction, with alcohol septal ablation as a catheter-based alternative in selected centers, and these strategies improve symptoms and outcomes when appropriately selected [^114mYMvY] [^114TU5Bk]. For nonobstructive HCM, symptom control is individualized, and cardiac myosin inhibitors (e.g., mavacamten) have emerged as disease-modifying therapy in obstructive disease and are being studied in nonobstructive phenotypes; anticoagulation is indicated for atrial fibrillation to prevent embolic stroke, and advanced heart failure therapies, including transplant, are reserved for end-stage disease [^114TU5Bk] [^113bQ9zN]. I should double-check the exercise recommendations: historically restrictive, but contemporary guidance supports mild-to-moderate recreational activity with individualized prescriptions and shared decision-making, including nuanced considerations for competitive athletes in low-risk genotypes after comprehensive evaluation [^113SbEET] [^1179TtCC].

> Let me synthesize cross-cutting principles so I don't leave the reasoning fragmented. Hypertrophy is context-dependent: in skeletal muscle, it is generally beneficial and driven by loading with internal biology constraining magnitude; in the heart, hypertrophy can be adaptive or maladaptive, and distinguishing physiological from pathological forms alters prognosis and management entirely [^111xN8ee] [^111NNk8y]. I need to ensure I emphasize that mechanistic insights increasingly inform therapy, from myosin inhibition in HCM to translational control targets in muscle, yet translation requires caution given species differences and the need for robust human data [^114TU5Bk] [^112jxD2E] [^115RmxTA]. Finally, shared decision-making is central in HCM for genetics, ICDs, septal therapies, and exercise, aligning patient values with evolving evidence and center expertise [^116WbqDi].

> But wait, what about uncertainties and controversies I should flag explicitly. The hypertrophy–strength relationship remains debated, with evidence of partial dissociation and ongoing questions about optimal load, volume, and proximity-to-failure strategies across training ages; similarly, in HCM, risk stratification is imperfect, exercise guidance is shifting but underpowered, and long-term effects of myosin inhibition and gene-based approaches await larger trials [^112cXi2J] [^1137Hg4X] [^1143fVWA] [^1117oRBv]. Hold on, I should verify that I've acknowledged the evidence gaps; yes, many exercise and pharmacotherapy studies are small and short-term, so individualized care and longitudinal follow-up remain essential while evidence matures [^114TU5Bk].

Hypertrophy is the **increase in tissue size** due to enlargement of individual cells, not an increase in cell number [^notfound]. In skeletal muscle, it reflects increased protein synthesis and fiber size from resistance training [^112jxD2E], with load, volume, and training status shaping the response [^1118siXK] [^1137Hg4X]. In the heart, hypertrophy can be **physiological** (exercise, pregnancy) or **pathological** (pressure/volume overload, HCM) [^111NNk8y]; pathological hypertrophy carries higher arrhythmia and heart failure risk [^117CchDU] and may require medical or surgical management [^113bQ9zN]. Diagnosis relies on imaging (echo, CMR) [^111k4Zww] and, in HCM, genetic testing [^113FVAvy]; management is individualized and guided by guidelines [^113bQ9zN].

## Skeletal muscle hypertrophy

### Mechanisms

- **Protein synthesis**: Increased translation and ribosome biogenesis drive protein accretion [^112jxD2E].
- **Satellite cells**: Provide nuclei to support larger fiber size [^notfound].
- **Mechanotransduction**: Converts mechanical load into molecular signals (e.g. mTOR, MAPK) [^notfound].
- **Hormonal milieu**: Testosterone, GH, and IGF-1 modulate hypertrophy [^notfound].

---

### Factors influencing skeletal muscle hypertrophy

| **Factor** | **Influence on hypertrophy** |
|-|-|
| Resistance training load | Similar hypertrophy across loads when effort is high; strength gains favor higher loads [^1118siXK] [^1137Hg4X] |
| Training volume | Higher volume enhances hypertrophy, especially in trained individuals [^115KkxB9] [^1137Hg4X] |
| Training status | Trained individuals show attenuated hypertrophic responses; untrained have larger gains [^1137Hg4X] |
| Nutrition | Adequate protein intake supports hypertrophy [^notfound] |
| Hormonal environment | Testosterone, GH, IGF-1 promote hypertrophy [^notfound] |

---

### Clinical implications

Hypertrophy increases **strength**, improves **metabolic health**, and enhances **functional capacity** [^notfound]; however, excessive training can cause injury or overtraining, and responses vary with age, sex, and genetics [^notfound].

---

## Cardiac hypertrophy

### Physiological cardiac hypertrophy

Physiological hypertrophy is an **adaptive response** to increased workload (e.g. exercise, pregnancy) [^111NNk8y] and is characterized by normal or enhanced function, normal architecture, and no fibrosis or arrhythmias; it is typically reversible with load removal [^111EMEHa].

---

### Pathological cardiac hypertrophy

Pathological hypertrophy arises from chronic stressors such as hypertension, valvular disease, or HCM [^117ALDdZ]; it features **fibrosis**, myocyte disarray, arrhythmias, and progression to heart failure [^113bN7UA]. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a **genetic disorder** with sarcomeric mutations [^112YsfFC], asymmetric LVH, and a risk of SCD [^111CeNiJ].

---

### Clinical implications

Pathological hypertrophy increases the risk of **arrhythmias**, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death [^117CchDU]; management includes risk stratification, medical therapy, and, in selected cases, septal reduction or ICD implantation [^116HQTSF].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Imaging**: Echocardiography, CMR, and CT assess hypertrophy and function [^112X4wgJ].
- **Electrocardiography**: Detects LVH and electrical abnormalities [^111zkyhY].
- **Genetic testing**: Identifies sarcomeric mutations in HCM [^112YsfFC].

---

## Therapeutic interventions

- **Medical therapy**: Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and myosin inhibitors for HCM [^114TU5Bk].
- **Surgical interventions**: Septal myectomy, alcohol septal ablation for obstructive HCM [^116HQTSF].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Exercise, weight management, and blood pressure control [^113SbEET].

---

## Conclusion

Hypertrophy is a **cellular enlargement** with distinct skeletal and cardiac forms. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy improves function and metabolism [^notfound], whereas cardiac hypertrophy can be adaptive or pathological, with significant clinical consequences [^111NNk8y]. Accurate diagnosis and individualized management are essential for optimal outcomes [^113orEnW] [^113hhcGF].

### Animal models for inducing muscle hypertrophy: are they relevant for clinical applications in humans? [^115RmxTA]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

Muscle hypertrophy is an adaptive response to overload. Progressive resistance exercise (PRE) is thought to be among the best means to achieve hypertrophy in humans. While functional adaptations to PRE in muscles of humans are made in the clinic, it is difficult to evaluate hypertrophic responses and underlying mechanisms because the adaptations require many weeks or months before they become evident and there is a large variability in response to PRE among humans. In contrast, various animal models have been shown to induce rapid and extensive muscle hypertrophy and some models allow precise control of the exercise parameters. By examining the animal models of muscle hypertrophy and understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each, clinicians may be able to evaluate and use relevant data from these models to design new strategies for modification of PRE in humans. The purpose of this article is to review animal models that are currently used in basic research laboratories, discuss the hypertrophic and functional outcomes, and relate these to PRE used in the clinic.

### The problem of muscle hypertrophy: revisited [^112cXi2J]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

In this paper we revisit a topic originally discussed in 1955, namely the lack of direct evidence that muscle hypertrophy from exercise plays an important role in increasing strength. To this day, long-term adaptations in strength are thought to be primarily contingent on changes in muscle size. Given this assumption, there has been considerable attention placed on programs designed to allow for maximization of both muscle size and strength. However, the conclusion that a change in muscle size affects a change in strength is surprisingly based on little evidence. We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength.

### Hypertrophy of the heart: a new therapeutic target? [^116DTKhx]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies call into question the necessity of hypertrophic growth of the heart as a "compensatory" response to hemodynamic stress. These findings, coupled with recent progress in dissecting the molecular bases of hypertrophy, raise the prospect of suppressing hypertrophy without provoking circulatory insufficiency. In this article, we focus on signaling pathways that hold promise as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. We also summarize observations from animal models and clinical trials that suggest benefit from an antihypertrophic strategy.

### Mechanisms of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy: implications in health and disease [^115yRTdU]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Concluding remarks

Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate the loss of muscle mass in disease. The lack of any efficient drug that counteracts muscle loss suggests that our view of the mechanistic insights that control atrophying muscle is still limited and needs further exploration.

### Resistance training load effects on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1118siXK]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There are three important findings from our systematic review and network meta-analysis of the dose–response relationship between resistance training load and gains in muscle hypertrophy and strength. First, in untrained and recreationally trained individuals (i.e. not strength athletes), muscle hypertrophy gains are likely to be similar regardless of resistance training load when performed to volitional failure over relatively short periods of intervention. In line with the physiological adaptation principle of diminishing returns, untrained participants exhibit greater muscle hypertrophy compared with those with even modest prior experience in resistance training. Furthermore, undertaking more resistance training sessions provides superior muscle size gains in those with previous training experience. Second, effects on muscle strength are load dependent, with higher loads resulting in greater gains over the relatively short interventions reviewed. Finally, the results for muscle hypertrophy and strength were maintained even when only the higher-quality studies were considered, that is, studies with less risk of bias. Therefore, although improvements in muscle hypertrophy seem to be load independent for untrained and recreationally trained individuals, muscle strength increases are superior with high-load resistance training programs of short duration.

### Mechanisms of physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy [^111NNk8y]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyocytes exit the cell cycle and become terminally differentiated soon after birth. Therefore, in the adult heart, instead of an increase in cardiomyocyte number, individual cardiomyocytes increase in size, and the heart develops hypertrophy to reduce ventricular wall stress and maintain function and efficiency in response to an increased workload. There are two types of hypertrophy: physiological and pathological. Hypertrophy initially develops as an adaptive response to physiological and pathological stimuli, but pathological hypertrophy generally progresses to heart failure. Each form of hypertrophy is regulated by distinct cellular signalling pathways. In the past decade, a growing number of studies have suggested that previously unrecognized mechanisms, including cellular metabolism, proliferation, non-coding RNAs, immune responses, translational regulation, and epigenetic modifications, positively or negatively regulate cardiac hypertrophy. In this Review, we summarize the underlying molecular mechanisms of physiological and pathological hypertrophy, with a particular emphasis on the role of metabolic remodelling in both forms of cardiac hypertrophy, and we discuss how the current knowledge on cardiac hypertrophy can be applied to develop novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse pathological hypertrophy.

### Dissociation of hypertrophic growth from changes in myocyte contractile function [^111EMEHa]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Increases in myocyte size and impairment of contractile function are both features of the pathophysiologic hypertrophic process. In this short review, we re-present evidence, both in human disease and in animal models, that the 2 phenomena can be dissociated in both time and relative degree. Additionally, in an animal model, physiologic growth concurrent with pathophysiologic hypertrophy induces similar changes in myocyte macroarchitecture but without the deleterious consequences for contractile function.

### What causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? [^113S6NEf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a global and relatively common cause of patient morbidity and mortality and is among the first reported monogenic cardiac diseases. For 30 years, the basic etiology of HCM has been attributed largely to variants in individual genes encoding cardiac sarcomere proteins, with the implication that HCM is fundamentally a genetic disease. However, data from clinical and network medicine analyses, as well as contemporary genetic studies show that single gene variants do not fully explain the broad and diverse HCM clinical spectrum. These transformative advances place a new focus on possible novel interactions between acquired disease determinants and genetic context to produce complex HCM phenotypes, also offering a measure of caution against overemphasizing monogenics as the principal cause of this disease. These new perspectives in which HCM is not a uniformly genetic disease but likely explained by multifactorial etiology will also unavoidably impact how HCM is viewed by patients and families in the clinical practicing community going forward, including relevance to genetic counseling and access to healthcare insurance and psychosocial wellness.

### An evidence-based narrative review of mechanisms of resistance exercise-induced human skeletal muscle hypertrophy [^111xN8ee]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Skeletal muscle plays a critical role in physical function and metabolic health. Muscle is a highly adaptable tissue that responds to resistance exercise (RE; loading) by hypertrophying, or during muscle disuse, RE mitigates muscle loss. Resistance exercise training (RET)-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a product of external (e.g. RE programming, diet, some supplements) and internal variables (e.g., mechanotransduction, ribosomes, gene expression, satellite cells activity). RE is undeniably the most potent nonpharmacological external variable to stimulate the activation/suppression of internal variables linked to muscular hypertrophy or countering disuse-induced muscle loss. Here, we posit that despite considerable research on the impact of external variables on RET and hypertrophy, internal variables (i.e., inherent skeletal muscle biology) are dominant in regulating the extent of hypertrophy in response to external stimuli. Thus, identifying the key internal skeletal muscle-derived variables that mediate the translation of external RE variables will be pivotal to determining the most effective strategies for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy persons. Such work will aid in enhancing function in clinical populations, slowing functional decline, and promoting physical mobility. We provide up-to-date, evidence-based perspectives of the mechanisms regulating RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.

### Resistance training load effects on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114McTLz]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, the present study explored the resistance training dosage for muscle hypertrophy and strength in healthy young adults. Our findings suggest that to promote muscle hypertrophy, varying loads of resistance training can be undertaken, and one strategy is to perform the exercise to the point of volitional failure. However, other approaches for maximizing recruitment of the motor unit pool maybe as effective, without the issues described previously regarding performing high numbers of repetitions with light loads. Thus, a practical application of our results is that a high-load resistance training program (≥ 80% of 1-RM, or ≤ 8 RM) can target both outcomes in shorter periods of training, whereas a moderate range of repetitions (9–15 RM) should be part of the resistance training program for those who do not tolerate exercising at higher (i.e. higher intensity or higher resistance) loads, eliciting gains in muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength superior to a low-load program. Furthermore, our results can also be applied to those participants with experience in resistance training, indicating a superior muscle hypertrophy effect undertaking more resistance training sessions.

### Molecular determinants of myocardial hypertrophy and failure: alternative pathways for beneficial and maladaptive hypertrophy [^112AS1Nj]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The implementation of molecular biological approaches has led to the discovery of single genetic variations that contribute to the development of cardiac failure. In the present review, the characteristics that are invariably associated with the development of failure in experimental animals and clinical studies are discussed, which may provide attractive biological targets in the treatment of human heart failure. Findings from the Framingham studies have provided evidence that the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy is the main risk factor for subsequent development of heart failure in man. Conventional views identify myocardial hypertrophy as a compensatory response to increased workload, prone to evoke disease. Recent findings in genetic models of myocardial hypertrophy and human studies have provided the molecular basis for a novel concept, which favours the existence of either compensatory or maladaptive forms of hypertrophy, of which only the latter leads the way to cardiac failure. Furthermore, the concept that hypertrophy compensates for augmented wall stress is probably outdated. In this article, we provide the molecular pathways that can distinguish beneficial from maladaptive hypertrophy.

### Electrical remodeling in cardiac hypertrophy [^114wxDR8]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In recent years, electrical remodeling has emerged as an important pathophysiologic mechanism in many types of cardiac pathology. Because clinical heart disease often involves both hypertrophic and failure phenotypes, identification of disease-specific mechanisms is essential. This review focuses on mechanisms of electrical remodeling in cardiac hypertrophy, emphasizing transmembrane Ca2+ fluxes and Ca(2+)-responsive signaling pathways. Where information is available, the remodeling of hypertrophy is contrasted with what is known about heart failure.

### Is there a sex difference in the prognosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1111hXS5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Based on current evidence, our results suggest that female sex is associated with a higher risk of HCM‐related events, HCM‐related death, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, noncardiovascular death, and all‐cause mortality. There is no association between sex and AF or SCD. Future guidelines may emphasize sex‐specific risk assessment, diagnosis, or management for HCM.

### Resistance training volume enhances muscle hypertrophy but not strength in trained men [^115KkxB9]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Resistance training (RT) is the primary exercise intervention for increasing muscle mass in humans. It is theorized that the volume of training performed in a RT bout — herein determined by the formula: repetitions /×/ sets — plays a significant role in chronic muscular adaptations such as muscle size and strength. As compared with single-set routines, acute studies indicate that performing multiple sets augments the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and muscle protein synthesis (MPS), suggesting that higher volumes of training are warranted for maximizing the hypertrophic response. However, although acute signaling and MPS studies can help to generate hypotheses as to potential long-term RT responses, longitudinal studies directly assessing hallmark adaptations, such as muscular strength and muscle hypertrophy, are necessary to draw evidence-based conclusions for exercise prescription.

When evaluating the results of longitudinal research on the topic, many of the studies have failed to show statistically significant differences in hypertrophy between lower and higher RT volumes. However, low sample sizes in these studies raise the potential for type II errors, invariably confounding the ability to draw conclusive inferences regarding probability. A recent meta-analysis showed a dose–response relationship between the total number of weekly sets and increases in muscle growth. However, the analysis was only able to determine dose–response effects up to 10 total weekly sets per muscle group due to the paucity of research on higher-volume RT programs. Thus, it remains unclear whether training with even higher volumes would continue to enhance hypertrophic adaptations and, if so, at what point these results would plateau. An added limitation to these findings is that only two of the 15 studies that met inclusion criteria were carried out in individuals with previous RT experience. There is compelling evidence that resistance-trained individuals respond differently than those who are new to RT. A "ceiling effect" makes it progressively more difficult for trained lifters to increase muscle mass, thereby necessitating more demanding RT protocols to elicit further muscular gains. Indeed, there is emerging evidence that consistent RT can alter anabolic intracellular signaling, indicating an attenuated hypertrophic response. Thus, findings from untrained individuals cannot necessarily be generalized to a resistance-trained population.

### Targeted therapies in pediatric and adult patients with hypertrophic heart disease: from molecular pathophysiology to personalized medicine [^113tHpvS]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a myocardial disease defined by an increased left ventricular wall thickness not solely explained by abnormal loading conditions. It is often genetically determined, with sarcomeric gene mutations accounting for around 50% of cases. Several conditions, including syndromic, metabolic, infiltrative, and neuromuscular diseases, may present with left ventricular hypertrophy, mimicking the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype but showing a different pathophysiology, clinical course, and outcome. Despite being rare, they are collectively responsible for a large proportion of patients presenting with hypertrophic heart disease, and their timely diagnosis can significantly impact patients' management. The understanding of disease pathophysiology has advanced over the last few years, and several therapeutic targets have been identified, leading to a new era of tailored treatments applying to different etiologies associated with left ventricular hypertrophy. This review aims to provide an overview of the existing and emerging therapies for the principal causes of hypertrophic heart disease, discussing the potential impact on patients' management and clinical outcome.

### Resistance training load effects on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1137Hg4X]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

As revealed by the meta-regression, muscle hypertrophy derived from low-, moderate-, and high-load resistance training regimes, despite the modest and nonsignificant difference between them, seems to be affected by training status and number of sessions completed, that is, volume. Untrained participants exhibit a greater magnitude of muscle hypertrophy compared with those recreationally trained. As reported in previous literature, trained muscles may already present with an increased cross-sectional area and lower anabolic signaling as observed in reduced AMPK and Akt phosphorylation after a resistance training session, resulting in an attenuated hypertrophic response in participants with previous resistance training experience. However, our findings also indicate greater muscle hypertrophy in recreationally trained participants who undertake a higher number of sessions compared with those undertaking less. It seems that participants with longer experience in resistance training (range, 2–7 yr), although still not highly trained, require a higher volume of training to produce the same or greater hypertrophic adaptation exhibiting the principle of diminishing returns. Thus, although there were no differences between training loads for muscle hypertrophy, the meta-regression results suggest that novice participants are likely to experience superior gains than those with previous experience in resistance training undertaking the same volume, whereas a greater number of sessions may provide additional muscle hypertrophy for those with experience in resistance training. Given the lack of studies with more than 14-wk duration, any interpretation of these results for longer periods should be viewed with caution.

In contrast to muscle hypertrophy, muscle strength, as defined by 1-RM testing, was found to be dependent on high loads. This finding is expected following 1) the principle of specificity as participants allocated in higher-load resistance training groups trained more closely to the requirement for the 1-RM test and presented greater transfer to this outcome, and 2) a combination of both neural and skeletal muscle adaptations derived from higher-load resistance training programs resulting in greater effects on muscle strength (,–). Moreover, the magnitude of change in low- versus high-load resistance training was consistent with that previously reported by Schoenfeld et al. and across all load comparisons favoring the highest loads. Regarding the difference between moderate- and high-load resistance, this comparison approached statistical significance (P = 0.072), and the ES of ~0.3 suggests a possible superior gain with high-load training protocols.

### Hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy risk: beyond adaptive cardiomyocytic hypertrophy [^117ALDdZ]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The heart is a remarkably adaptive organ, capable of increasing its minute output and overcoming short-term or prolonged pressure overload. The structural response, in addition to the foregoing functional demands, is that of myocardial hypertrophy. Then, why should an adaptive response increase cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? Evidence shows that the functional performance of hypertrophied cardiomyocytes is impaired, and that additional alterations develop in cardiomyocytes themselves, the extracellular matrix and the intramyocardial vasculature, leading to myocardial remodelling and providing the basis for the adverse prognosis associated with pathological LVH in hypertensive patients (i.e., hypertensive heart disease, HHD). As molecular information accumulates, the pathophysiological understanding and the clinical approach to HHD are changing. The time has come to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the prognosis of HHD on the basis of reversing or even preventing the aforementioned changes in the ventricular myocardium.

### Narrative review: harnessing molecular genetics for the diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112YsfFC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Unexplained cardiac hypertrophy, the diagnostic criterion for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), occurs in 1 in 500 adults. Insights into the genetic cause and molecular pathophysiology of HCM are reshaping clinical paradigms for diagnosis and treatment of this common myocardial disorder. Human genetic studies have established that dominant mutations in the proteins that make up the contractile apparatus (the sarcomere) cause HCM. With the current availability of clinical gene-based diagnostics, pathogenic mutations in affected patients can be defined, which can suggest a clinical course and allow definitive preclinical identification of family members at risk for HCM. Genetic discoveries have also fostered mechanistic investigations in model organisms that are engineered to carry human HCM mutations. Novel therapeutic targets have emerged from these fundamental studies and are currently under clinical assessment in humans. The combination of contemporary gene-based diagnosis with new strategies to attenuate disease development and progression is changing the natural history of lifelong cardiac symptoms, arrhythmias, and heart failure from HCM.

### Update on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a guide to the guidelines [^117YTLxw]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder, affecting 1 in 500 individuals worldwide. Existing epidemiological studies might have underestimated the prevalence of HCM, however, owing to limited inclusion of individuals with early, incomplete phenotypic expression. Clinical manifestations of HCM include diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ischaemia, atrial fibrillation, abnormal vascular responses and, in 5% of patients, progression to a 'burnt-out' phase characterized by systolic impairment. Disease-related mortality is most often attributable to sudden cardiac death, heart failure, and embolic stroke. The majority of individuals with HCM, however, have normal or near-normal life expectancy, owing in part to contemporary management strategies including family screening, risk stratification, thromboembolic prophylaxis, and implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators. The clinical guidelines for HCM issued by the ACC Foundation/AHA and the ESC facilitate evaluation and management of the disease. In this Review, we aim to assist clinicians in navigating the guidelines by highlighting important updates, current gaps in knowledge, differences in the recommendations, and challenges in implementing them, including aids and pitfalls in clinical and pathological evaluation. We also discuss the advances in genetics, imaging, and molecular research that will underpin future developments in diagnosis and therapy for HCM.

### Translational control: implications for skeletal muscle hypertrophy [^112jxD2E]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is characterized, in part, by increases in protein mass per fiber. This increased accumulation of protein results from a net increase in protein synthesis relative to breakdown. Increases in rates of protein synthesis (translation) have been reported across different models of resistance exercise and across all species studied. However, although an increase in protein synthesis after exercise is reported commonly, the mechanisms underlying this response are not understood clearly. Therefore, the aim of the current review was to select areas of research within which translational control has been well-studied. The logic is that the mechanisms described in this review have the potential to contribute to the changes seen in protein synthesis after high-resistance exercise. The field of translational control has seen rapid growth in the past 5 to 10 years and although attempts have been made to include all contributing studies, apologies are given from the start because many have undoubtedly been overlooked.

Refining the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — current diagnosis relies on binary cutoffs for left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, which due to imprecision and variability by sex, body size, and comorbidities can lead to overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis; because the phenotype extends beyond left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), evolving toward a molecular or pathway-based approach, when possible, will enable greater diagnostic accuracy, improve patient stratification, and facilitate implementation of increasingly targeted therapies.

Gray and white circles represent study-specific estimates based on risk of bias assessment (low risk, and some concern or high risk of bias, respectively); diamonds represent pooled estimates of random-effects meta-analysis.

In the univariate network meta-regression, the covariates (i.e. year of publication, experimental design, sex, training status, number of sessions, assessed limb, and prescription method) did not explain the variation in muscle hypertrophy gains (P = 0.278–0.986; Supplemental Digital Content Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content 4, univariate meta-regression results). Regarding the multivariate model, there was a significant interaction for training status (P = 0.033), with untrained participants presenting higher effects on muscle hypertrophy in low- versus high-load resistance training comparison (Table 3). The number of sessions seems to influence the results in both moderate- versus low-load (P = 0.031) and high- versus moderate-load (P = 0.045) resistance training, with a higher number of sessions resulting in greater effects on muscle hypertrophy (Table 3). The remaining variables (i.e. year of publication, experimental design, sex, assessed limb, and prescription method) were not significant in explaining variations in muscle hypertrophy (P = 0.145–0.999).

### Phenotypic diversity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115cvKji]. Human Molecular Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, the main focus of human genetic studies on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) switched from discovering novel genes and defining disease-causing mutations to studies of mutation distribution in disease populations. Eventually these studies will define genotype-phenotype relationships, which may provide clues to understanding the disease process and help to select the most appropriate treatment strategy. Animal models engineered to recapitulate human disease provide a unique tool to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms and evaluate potential therapies. In this review, we present the spectrum of clinical HCM in the context of the genetic heterogeneity of this common human disease. Recent progress made in understanding molecular pathways that result in cardiac hypertrophy and the factors that modify these processes are discussed.

### Is bigger better? Exploring the compensatory versus pathological nature of amygdala hypertrophy [^1179BZMZ]. Epilepsy Currents (2025). Medium credibility.

However, a few studies have challenged whether AE is a phenomenon only observed in nonlesional epilepsy and whether it is benign. In a recent study published in Neurology, Zubal et al reported AE, or hypertrophy, in a large sample of patients with TLE-HS (N = 135) and examined its laterality, clinical features, and potential mechanisms. Using three measures of tissue properties — gray matter density, shape, and volume — the authors observed amygdala hypertrophy contralateral to the seizure focus across all measures in patients with both left and right TLE-HS. One marker of hypertrophy (ie, increased amygdala volume) was also replicated in an external validation cohort. Notably, contralateral amygdala hypertrophy was associated with poorer verbal memory, longer epilepsy duration, and a history of psychosis in patients with left TLE, while in patients with right TLE, hypertrophy was linked to a higher frequency of generalized convulsive seizures. There were no indicators of ipsilateral amygdala hypertrophy in either patient group. Overall, Zubal et al's study provides compelling evidence that contralateral amygdala hypertrophy is observed in TLE-HS across imaging measures and patient cohorts — and may signify a more severe TLE phenotype than previously appreciated.

But why does amygdala hypertrophy occur? Although the amygdala is known to be part of the epileptogenic network in TLE, its response to seizures and the significance of its increased size in the contralateral hemisphere remain a mystery. Early debates centered around whether amygdala hypertrophy was a cause or a consequence of TLE, with studies favoring the latter interpretation — that hypertrophy results from enduring seizures. However, whether this anomaly represents a compensatory mechanism gone awry or merely a harmful effect of seizures is still debated. Zubal et al considered both possibilities. In a subset of patients who had functional MRI, amygdala hypertrophy was associated with increased right parietal activation during a memory encoding task, which the authors suggested could indicate a compensatory process. However, they provided stronger support that it reflects the harmful effect of seizures, given the strong associations between amygdala hypertrophy, longer epilepsy duration, and increased frequency of secondary generalized seizures. Furthermore, longitudinal studies have shown that up to 66% of patients with amygdala hypertrophy exhibit decreases in amygdala volume in follow-up scans, with this volume reduction correlating with decreased seizure frequency or complete seizure resolution. These findings support the interpretation of amygdala hypertrophy as a dynamic, reactive process that diminishes as seizures subside.

### Genetic testing and counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an evidence-based practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^113bN7UA]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — clinical definition, diagnosis, pathology, and genetic counseling context are summarized as follows: HCM is a common hereditary condition with a prevalence of 1 in 500 adults and is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy measuring 15 mm or greater (or z-score > 2 in children) occurring without another cardiac or systemic cause of hypertrophy. Diagnosis is established through cardiac imaging with echocardiography remaining the primary modality, and histopathology commonly shows myocyte disarray, myocyte hypertrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. Clinical manifestations can range from asymptomatic LVH to chest pain, progressive heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias, and seldom, sudden cardiac death. Genetic counseling is a process supporting families to understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of the genetic contributions to disease; an International Expert Consensus Statement recommends that genetic testing should only be performed with appropriate genetic counseling, and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommends cardiac genetic counseling (Class I) for any patients with inherited cardiomyopathy regardless of whether genetic testing is being considered. Genetic testing for HCM is increasingly available due to advances in DNA sequencing technologies and reduced costs, and while a diagnosis of HCM is a well-supported indication for genetic testing and genetic counseling, optimal integration of genetic data into the clinical care of individuals with HCM should be instituted, including delivery via genetic counseling.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: current understanding and treatment objectives [^115zYj22]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has changed dramatically over the last few decades, and it is now understood to be caused by a mutation in one of several cardiac sarcomeric genes. Due to complications such as outflow tract obstruction, diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias, stroke, infective endocarditis and sudden cardiac death, appropriate and early identification of these patients is imperative. This review attempts to summarise the current state of knowledge on HCM, and provide insight of the appropriate investigations needed in patients with HCM. It also outlines treatment strategies for these patients. Much remains unknown about this complex and intriguing disease, and continued research in identifying the genetic basis of HCM, along with the assessment of therapeutic strategies, will help to optimise patient care.

Risk of bias assessment

For muscle hypertrophy, 87.5% of the studies have some concern (21 of 24 studies), whereas the remaining have a high risk (3 of 24 studies, or 12.5%) in the overall risk of bias assessment (Table 1). The concerns in muscle hypertrophy assessment were mainly due to the randomization process as studies did not report concealment allocation (some concerns: 23 of 24 studies, or 95.8%) or did not follow any randomization (high risk: 1 of 24 studies, or 4.2%, 4.2%). Furthermore, studies were considered to have some concerns in the measurement of the outcome (8 of 24 studies, or 33.3%) when evaluating muscle hypertrophy through unblinded evaluations and evaluations requiring technician or assessor direct analysis and interpretation (e.g. muscle ultrasound imaging), whereas they had a high risk (3 of 24 studies, or 12.5%) when they did not use a reliable technique of assessment (e.g. skinfold or circumference). In the subgroup analysis for muscle hypertrophy, best-quality studies were those considered with low risk on the measurement of the outcome.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a brief overview [^111CeNiJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex, heterogeneous disorder that affects approximately 1 in every 500 persons worldwide and about 750,000 Americans. It is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy that is usually asymmetric, with enlarged myocytes in disarray, unexplained by loading conditions. Obstruction to left ventricular outflow occurs in approximately 60% of patients. The natural history and cardiac morphology of HCM are quite heterogeneous. Although most patients with HCM are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, a minority are disabled by dyspnea, angina, or syncope, develop advanced heart failure, or die suddenly.

The study of biomarkers and their signalling pathways has allowed the development of new therapeutic strategies in a range of disorders. The aim of the present systematic review is to provide an overview of different biomarkers in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that could give some insight into the pathophysiologic mechanism(s) underlying the typical clinical and histological manifestations of the disease. Several pathophysiological models are presented and discussed, including studies that have investigated these biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic reasons, in relation to disease progression and/or mortality.

### Concentric versus eccentric remodeling [^115YQa7r]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac hypertrophy has long been recognized as one of the heart's mechanisms for compensating a pressure or volume overload. This compensation has often been viewed as a feedback loop in which the concentric hypertrophy, which develops in pressure overload, normalizes wall stress while the eccentric hypertrophy, which develops in volume overload, allows for an increase in total stroke volume to compensate that which is lost from regulation. While the concentric hypertrophy of pressure overload often is compensatory, many examples are noted where either too little hypertrophy occurs to normalize stress or in other cases, in which hypertrophy exceeds the amount needed for normalization. These observations invoke nonmechanical mechanisms which modulate the degree to which the mechanical signal of pressure overload is translated into an increase in myocardial mass. Hypertrophy develops when the rate of myocardial protein synthesis exceeds that of protein degradation. It now appears that in pressure overload this imbalance is created as synthesis rate increases while in volume overload hypertrophy appears to accrue because degradation rate decreases.

METHODS

Study selection procedure

The study was undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, and the method used was based on the minimum criteria established by the Cochrane Back Review Group. The review included published data from experimental studies that evaluated the effects of low (< 60% of 1-RM, or > 15 RM), moderate (between 60% and 79% of 1-RM, or 9–15 RM), and high (≥ 80% of 1-RM, or ≤ 8 RM) loads in resistance training performed until volitional failure in healthy adults. The primary outcomes of this review were muscle hypertrophy (i.e. defined as a measure of muscle mass or size) and muscle strength (i.e. defined by 1-RM tests). Studies were excluded when 1) they did not present sufficient information regarding the comparisons between different loads or pretraining and posttraining values in the resistance training programs; 2) interventions were shorter than 6 wk; 3) specific outcomes for this review or sufficient information were not reported (e.g. baseline and postintervention assessment, and within- and between-group mean difference); 4) resistance training involving blood flow restriction protocols; and 5) written in a language other than English. In the search strategy, titles and abstracts were first independently evaluated. When abstracts did not provide sufficient information, they were selected for full-text evaluation. Eligibility was assessed independently by two authors (P. L. and J. L. T.), with differences resolved by consensus.

The search was conducted up to December 2019 using the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The terms used were as follows: "resistance training until failure" and "muscle hypertrophy" or "muscle strength" in association with a list of sensitive terms to search for experimental studies. In addition, a manual search was performed in the reference lists provided in the selected articles as well as in a previous systematic review to detect studies potentially eligible for inclusion. The search strategy used is shown in the Supplemental Digital Content Table S1 (see in Supplemental Digital Content 1, literature search strategy).

### Genetic testing and counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an evidence-based practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^11553r7y]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common hereditary condition affecting approximately 1 in 500 adults. It is characterized by marked clinical heterogeneity with individuals experiencing minimal to no symptoms, while others may have more severe outcomes including heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Genetic testing for HCM is increasingly available due to advances in DNA sequencing technologies and reduced costs. While a diagnosis of HCM is a well‐supported indication for genetic testing and genetic counseling, incorporation of genetic services into the clinical setting is often limited outside of expert centers. As genetic counseling and testing have become more accessible and convenient, optimal integration of genomic data into the clinical care of individuals with HCM should be instituted, including delivery via genetic counseling. Drawing on recommendations from recent disease guidelines and systematic evidence reviews, we highlight key recommendations for HCM genetic testing and counseling. This practice resource provides a comprehensive framework to guide healthcare providers in the process of genetic test selection, variant classification, and cascade testing for genetic evaluation of HCM.

### Hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy [^11681SNL]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

In the initial stage, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is adaptive, but in time, it transforms to maladaptive LVH which is specific for the development of various phenotypes that cause heart failure, initially with preserved, but later with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Pathophysiological mechanisms, which are characteristic for remodeling procedure, are numerous and extremely complex, and should be subjected to further research with the aim of making a comprehensive overview of hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and discovering new options for preventing and treating HHD. The contemporary methods, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomography (CT) provide very accurate morphological and functional information on HHD. The objective of this review article is to summarize the available scientific information in terms of prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnostics, prevention, contemporary therapeutic options, as well as to present potential therapeutic solutions based on the research of pathological mechanisms which are at the core of HHD.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a systematic review [^117CchDU]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Throughout the past 40 years, a vast and sometimes contradictory literature has accumulated regarding hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a genetic cardiac disease caused by a variety of mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins and characterized by a broad and expanding clinical spectrum.

Objectives

To clarify and summarize the relevant clinical issues and to profile rapidly evolving concepts regarding HCM.

Data Sources

Systematic analysis of the relevant HCM literature, accessed through MEDLINE (1966–2000), bibliographies, and interactions with investigators.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Diverse information was assimilated into a rigorous and objective contemporary description of HCM, affording greatest weight to prospective, controlled, and evidence-based studies.

Data Synthesis

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a relatively common genetic cardiac disease (1:500 in the general population) that is heterogeneous with respect to disease-causing mutations, presentation, prognosis, and treatment strategies. Visibility attached to HCM relates largely to its recognition as the most common cause of sudden death in the young (including competitive athletes). Clinical diagnosis is by 2-dimensional echocardiographic identification of otherwise unexplained left ventricular wall thickening in the presence of a nondilated cavity. Overall, HCM confers an annual mortality rate of about 1% and in most patients is compatible with little or no disability and normal life expectancy. Subsets with higher mortality or morbidity are linked to the complications of sudden death, progressive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with embolic stroke. Treatment strategies depend on appropriate patient selection, including drug treatment for exertional dyspnea (beta-blockers, verapamil, disopyramide) and the septal myotomy-myectomy operation, which is the standard of care for severe refractory symptoms associated with marked outflow obstruction; alcohol septal ablation and pacing are alternatives to surgery for selected patients. High-risk patients may be treated effectively for sudden death prevention with the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

Conclusions

Substantial understanding has evolved regarding the epidemiology and clinical course of HCM, as well as novel treatment strategies that may alter its natural history. An appreciation that HCM, although an important cause of death and disability at all ages, does not invariably convey ominous prognosis and is compatible with normal longevity should dictate a large measure of reassurance for many patients.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111k4Zww]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common often inherited global heart disease, with complex phenotypic and genetic expression and natural history, affecting both genders and many races and cultures. Prevalence is 1:200–1:500, largely based on the disease phenotype with imaging, inferring that 750,000 Americans may be affected by HCM. However, cross-sectional data show that only a fraction are clinically diagnosed, suggesting under-recognition, with most clinicians exposed to small segments of the broad disease spectrum. Highly effective HCM management strategies have emerged, altering clinical course and substantially lowering mortality and morbidity rates. These advances underscore the importance of reliable HCM diagnosis with echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. Family screening with noninvasive imaging will identify relatives with the HCM phenotype, while genetic analysis recognizes preclinical sarcomere gene carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy, but with the potential to transmit disease. Comprehensive initial patient evaluations are important for reliable diagnosis, accurate portrayal of HCM and family history, risk stratification, and distinguishing obstructive versus nonobstructive forms.

### Exercise and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: two incompatible entities? [^1179TtCC]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A greater understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underpinning hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has translated to improved medical care and better survival of affected individuals. Historically these patients were considered to be at high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) during exercise; therefore, exercise recommendations were highly conservative and promoted a sedentary life style. There is emerging evidence that suggests that exercise in HCM has a favorable effect on cardiovascular remodeling and moderate exercise programs have not raised any safety concerns. Furthermore, individuals with HCM have a similar burden of atherosclerotic risk factors as the general population in whom exercise has been associated with a reduction in myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, especially among those with a high‐risk burden. Small studies revealed that athletes who choose to continue with regular competition do not demonstrate adverse outcomes when compared to those who discontinue sport, and active individuals implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator do not have an increased risk of appropriate shocks or other adverse events. The recently published exercise recommendations from the European Association for Preventative Cardiology account for more contemporary evidence and adopt a more liberal stance regarding competitive and high intensity sport in individuals with low‐risk HCM. This review addresses the issue of exercise in individuals with HCM, and explores current evidence supporting safety of exercise in HCM, potential caveats, and areas of further research.

Results

Study Selection

As shown in Figure 1, 1525 publications and 13 conference abstracts were identified in the initial literature search (PubMed = 684; Cochrane Library = 3; Embase = 838; other source = 13). After excluding duplicates and screening the titles and abstracts, 83 remained for full‐text assessment. Thirty‐one studies were excluded for the following reasons: (1) studies without data of interest (n = 4); (2) certain publication types with no data (n = 7); (3) studies without appropriate methods (n = 3); (4) studies that did not focus on HCM (n = 6); (5) studies that did not target certain populations (n = 2) or outcomes (n = 8); and (6) duplicated cohorts (n = 1). All the excluded studies with the corresponding reasons are shown in Table S4. Ultimately, 27 studies with 42 365 individuals (27 471 male subjects and 14 894 female subjects) were included.,

It is also striking to note that the evidence base cited in the 2011 consensus document is mainly at level B or C. There is a clear need for more evidence and longer term follow up to assess the usefulness of these algorithms. In view of the wide phenotypic expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, future studies should include information from cohorts of patients, which are representative of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients in the general population. This will require international collaboration as well as the use of high quality registry data, an issue which has been recognised recently by the European Society of Cardiology. Ultimately, it requires expert input from the cardiology team and clear communication with an informed patient to ensure that both the art and science of medicine are utilised in the best interests of the patient.

### Pharmacological treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: current practice and novel perspectives [^111DvjEX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is entering a phase of intense translational research that holds promise for major advances in disease-specific pharmacological therapy. For over 50years, however, HCM has largely remained an orphan disease, and patients are still treated with old drugs developed for other conditions. While judicious use of the available armamentarium may control the clinical manifestations of HCM in most patients, specific experience is required in challenging situations, including deciding when not to treat. The present review revisits the time-honoured therapies available for HCM, in a practical perspective reflecting real-world scenarios. Specific agents are presented with doses, titration strategies, pros and cons. Peculiar HCM dilemmas such as treatment of dynamic outflow obstruction, heart failure caused by end-stage progression and prevention of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias are assessed. In the near future, the field of HCM drug therapy will rapidly expand, based on ongoing efforts. Approaches such as myocardial metabolic modulation, late sodium current inhibition and allosteric myosin inhibition have moved from pre-clinical to clinical research, and reflect a surge of scientific as well as economic interest by academia and industry alike. These exciting developments, and their implications for future research, are discussed.

### Exercise and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: two incompatible entities? [^115FzhdM]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

A greater understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underpinning hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has translated to improved medical care and better survival of affected individuals. Historically these patients were considered to be at high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) during exercise; therefore, exercise recommendations were highly conservative and promoted a sedentary life style. There is emerging evidence that suggests that exercise in HCM has a favorable effect on cardiovascular remodeling and moderate exercise programs have not raised any safety concerns. Furthermore, individuals with HCM have a similar burden of atherosclerotic risk factors as the general population in whom exercise has been associated with a reduction in myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, especially among those with a high-risk burden. Small studies revealed that athletes who choose to continue with regular competition do not demonstrate adverse outcomes when compared to those who discontinue sport, and active individuals implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator do not have an increased risk of appropriate shocks or other adverse events. The recently published exercise recommendations from the European Association for Preventative Cardiology account for more contemporary evidence and adopt a more liberal stance regarding competitive and high intensity sport in individuals with low-risk HCM. This review addresses the issue of exercise in individuals with HCM, and explores current evidence supporting safety of exercise in HCM, potential caveats, and areas of further research.

### Management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^116HQTSF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a relatively common, globally distributed, and often inherited primary cardiac disease, has now transformed into a contemporary highly treatable condition with effective options that alter natural history along specific personalized adverse pathways at all ages. HCM patients with disease-related complications benefit from: matured risk stratification in which major markers reliably select patients for prophylactic defibrillators and prevention of arrhythmic sudden death; low risk to high benefit surgical myectomy (with percutaneous alcohol ablation a selective alternative) that reverses progressive heart failure caused by outflow obstruction; anticoagulation prophylaxis that prevents atrial fibrillation-related embolic stroke and ablation techniques that decrease the frequency of paroxysmal episodes; and occasionally, heart transplant for end-stage nonobstructive patients. Those innovations have substantially improved outcomes by significantly reducing morbidity and HCM-related mortality to 0.5%/y. Palliative pharmacological strategies with currently available negative inotropic drugs can control symptoms over the short-term in some patients, but generally do not alter long-term clinical course. Notably, a substantial proportion of HCM patients (largely those identified without outflow obstruction) experience a stable/benign course without major interventions. The expert panel has critically appraised all available data and presented management insights and recommendations with concise principles for clinical decision-making.

### Myocyte proliferation and ventricular remodeling [^112Upv3n]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Improvement in the methodological approach to the analysis of the myocardium has provided clear evidence of cardiac myocyte proliferation, questioning the general belief that the growth of the adult heart under physiological and pathological conditions can occur only by cellular hypertrophy. Myocyte regeneration contributes via myocyte death to the physiological turnover of myocytes and via myocyte hypertrophy to cardiac remodeling. Several questions, however, remain to be answered. Among them, it is still unknown whether myocyte multiplication exerts a positive and/or negative effect on ventricular anatomy and cardiac function. The addition of newly generated myocytes leads to cavitary dilation with relative thinning of the wall. Conversely, myocyte proliferation, characterized by the parallel addition of cells, can be expected to increase wall thickness, decrease chamber size, and ameliorate cardiac performance.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: clinical update [^111bm68e]. JACC: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heritable cardiomyopathy, manifesting as left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of a secondary cause. The genetic underpinnings of HCM arise largely from mutations of sarcomeric proteins; however, the specific underlying mutation often remains undetermined. Patient presentation is phenotypically diverse, ranging from asymptomatic to heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormal ventricular configuration result in dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction in most patients. The goal of therapeutic interventions is largely to reduce dynamic obstruction, with treatment modalities spanning lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapies, and septal reduction therapies. A small subset of patients with HCM will experience sudden cardiac death, and risk stratification remains a clinical challenge. This paper presents a clinical update for diagnosis, family screening, clinical imaging, risk stratification, and management of symptoms in patients with HCM.

### Disease pathways and novel therapeutic targets in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113RSwxF]. Circulation Research (2011). Low credibility.

As described in earlier reviews in this series on the molecular basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), HCM is one of the archetypal monogenic cardiovascular disorders to be understood at the molecular level. Twenty years after the discovery of the first HCM disease gene, genetic studies still confirm that HCM is principally a disease of the sarcomere. At the biophysical level, myofilament mutations generally enhance Ca(2+) sensitivity, maximal force production, and ATPase activity. These defects ultimately appear to converge on energy deficiency and altered Ca(2+) handling as major common paths leading to the anatomic (hypertrophy, myofiber disarray, and fibrosis) and functional features (pathological signaling and diastolic dysfunction) characteristic of HCM. In this review, we provide an account of the consequences of HCM mutations and describe how specifically targeting these molecular features has already yielded early promise for novel therapies for HCM. Although substantial efforts are still required to understand the molecular link between HCM mutations and their clinical consequences, HCM endures as an exemplar of how novel insights derived from molecular characterization of Mendelian disorders can inform the understanding of biological processes and translate into rational therapies.

### Current management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114TU5Bk]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common yet under-recognized genetic structural heart condition characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients may present with obstructive disease characterized by an elevated left ventricular outflow tract gradient or non-obstructive disease. Long established medical and surgical treatment options for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and refractory symptoms can be effective in eliminating outflow tract gradients and improving symptoms. Cardiac myosin inhibitors have emerged as a new class of evidence based medical therapy for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an alternative to septal reduction therapies. However, effective treatments for patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy remain limited, with several clinical trials ongoing. Variants in cardiac sarcomeric genes are the primary genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and are being investigated as targets for gene based therapies. Stratification of the risk of sudden death is an important component of caring for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Recommendations for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation are based on well validated risk factors in combination with shared decision making. Atrial fibrillation is common in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and anticoagulation is strongly recommended for stroke prevention. Rhythm control is essential for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Historically, vigorous exercise has been restricted; however, newer data suggest that the arrhythmic risk is less than previously thought and emphasize an individualized approach. Advanced heart failure is an uncommon but important cause of morbidity and mortality. Early identification is key to improving outcomes with advanced therapies including cardiac transplantation. The management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is rapidly evolving toward a more personalized approach, based on genotype and phenotype, to alter disease progression and improve patients' outcomes.

### Pharmacological treatment options for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: high time for evidence [^114Uu3eJ]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting over one million individuals in Europe. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients often require pharmacological intervention for control of symptoms, dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, and microvascular ischaemia. Current treatment strategies in HCM are predicated on the empirical use of long-standing drugs, such as beta-adrenergic and calcium blockers, although with little evidence supporting their clinical benefit in this disease. In the six decades since the original description of the disease, < 50 pharmacological studies enrolling little over 2000 HCM patients have been performed, the majority of which were small, non-randomized cohorts. As our understanding of the genetic basis and pathophysiology of HCM improves, the availability of transgenic and preclinical models uncovers clues to novel and promising treatment modalities. Furthermore, the number of patients identified and followed at international referral centres has grown steadily over the decades. As a result, the opportunity now exists to implement adequately designed pharmacological trials in HCM, using established as well as novel drug therapies, to potentially intervene on the complex pathophysiology of the disease and alter its natural course. Therefore, it is timely to review the available evidence for pharmacological therapy of HCM patients, highlight the most relevant gaps in knowledge, and address some of the most promising areas for future pharmacological research, in an effort to move HCM into the era of evidence-based management.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertension [^115ft7Ft]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The left ventricle (LV) is a primary target for HTN end-organ damage. In addition to being a marker of HTN, LV geometrical changes: concentric remodeling, concentric or eccentric LV hypertrophy (LVH) are major independent risk factors for not only CVD morbidity and mortality but also for all-cause mortality and neurological pathologies. Blood pressure control with lifestyle changes and antihypertensive agents has been demonstrated to prevent and regress LVH. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of literature on the relationship between HTN and LV geometry abnormalities with a focus on diagnosis, prognosis, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment approaches.

### Genetic testing and counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an evidence-based practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^116nfgxN]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

Pre-test probability and indications for genetic testing in HCM — Clinical information and family history inform the likelihood of a positive genetic test result, and establishing the pre-test probability is intended to guide interpretation of results and recommendations for additional testing and cardiac screening. Genetic testing prediction scoring systems that incorporate clinical phenotype and family history are available for adults and children, and younger age at diagnosis increases the likelihood of a positive result. The overall detection rate of a disease-causing variant among individuals ≤ 21 years is 78% compared to 33% among individuals diagnosed as an adult, and individuals assigned female at birth, those with a family history of HCM and/or sudden death, and those with greater asymmetric hypertrophy are more likely to have a positive genetic test result. Lower pre-test probability should not preclude offering testing; all individuals with a clinical diagnosis of HCM or unexplained LVH should be offered genetic testing regardless of age, onset, family history, or degree of hypertrophy, and genetic testing for HCM should be considered if the cause of LVH remains uncertain.

For a "Healthy" first-degree relative of proband, prompts include "Do they have cardiac symptoms?" and "What tests were performed? ECG, ECHO, MRI, monitor, stress test?" and "What were the results?". For relatives with HCM, suggested prompts include "How was HCM diagnosed?" with follow-ups on arrhythmia history such as "Cardiac arrest, ICD, ICD discharges, atrial fibrillation, ablation?", imaging ("Were stress ECHO, MRI performed?"), treatments ("Medication, myectomy, ablation?"), and whether "Did they have genetic testing?". For relatives with heart attack (HA), questions include "What do you know about the HA?" with details on circumstances, treatments like "Surgery, stents, bypass, ICD, medications?", symptoms, and coronary risk factors. For relatives with sudden cardiac death or sudden unexplained death, prompts cover circumstances ("At rest, exertional, witness, CPR, AED used?"), prior cardiac history and therapies, and whether "Was an autopsy performed?". For relatives with heart failure (HF), prompts address cause ("Enlarged heart, dilated or hypertrophic, HCM/LVH, acquired?"), transplant history ("If yes, what age?"), coronary disease history, and risk factors. For relatives with enlarged heart/thick heart, prompts include "What part of the heart was enlarged? Dilated or thick?" and "Did the cardiologist recommend family screening?" with consideration of other causes such as "Competitive athlete, uncontrolled high blood pressure".

### Genetic testing and counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an evidence-based practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^115a4qqw]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common hereditary condition affecting approximately 1 in 500 adults. It is characterized by marked clinical heterogeneity with individuals experiencing minimal to no symptoms, while others may have more severe outcomes including heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Genetic testing for HCM is increasingly available due to advances in DNA sequencing technologies and reduced costs. While a diagnosis of HCM is a well-supported indication for genetic testing and genetic counseling, incorporation of genetic services into the clinical setting is often limited outside of expert centers. As genetic counseling and testing have become more accessible and convenient, optimal integration of genomic data into the clinical care of individuals with HCM should be instituted, including delivery via genetic counseling. Drawing on recommendations from recent disease guidelines and systematic evidence reviews, we highlight key recommendations for HCM genetic testing and counseling. This practice resource provides a comprehensive framework to guide healthcare providers in the process of genetic test selection, variant classification, and cascade testing for genetic evaluation of HCM.

### Differing strategies for sudden death prevention in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1143fVWA]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Sudden death (SD) has traditionally been the most visible and feared complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Substantial progress in reducing the occurrence of these catastrophic events represents a new paradigm in disease management. Prevention of SD in HCM has resulted from introduction of primary prevention ICDs that reliably terminate life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as well as a matured risk stratification algorithm capable of reliably identifying those patients at highest risk. This initiative has been a major determinant of reducing HCM-related mortality to a low rate of 0.5%/year. In such a heterogeneous heart disease as HCM, no perfect risk stratification strategy is possible, and available approaches differ in terms of sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with SD risk. Major cardiovascular societies, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology in the United States and European Society of Cardiology in Europe have promoted different risk stratification guidelines creating the potential for judging SD risk in a given HCM patient differently based on commitment to a particular societal guideline or country of residence. In this review, we provide a critical but balanced assessment of these two divergent SD prevention strategies with regard to their respective strengths and weaknesses, as a guide to clinicians directly engaged in this important management issue.

### Genetics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: established and emerging implications for clinical practice [^114bwSAp]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathogenic variation in genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere is responsible for 30%-40% of cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The main clinical utility of genetic testing is to provide diagnostic confirmation and facilitation of family screening. It also assists in the detection of aetiologies, which require distinct monitoring and treatment approaches. Other clinical applications, including the use of genetic information to inform risk prediction models, have been limited by the challenge of establishing robust genotype-phenotype correlations with actionable consequences, but new data on the interaction between rare and common genetic variation, as well as the emergence of therapies targeting disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms, herald a new era for genetic testing in routine practice.

### Prevention of sudden death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: bridging the gaps in knowledge [^111kbG5P]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the most devastating complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Although the annual rate of SCD in the general HCM population is < 1% per year according to contemporary series, there is still a small subset of patients who are at increased risk of SCD. The greatest challenge in the management of HCM is identifying those at increased risk as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is a potentially life-saving therapy. In this review, we sought to summarize the available data on SCD in HCM and provide a clinical perspective on the current differing and somewhat conflicting European and American recommendations on risk stratification, with balanced guidance with regards to rational clinical decision making. Additionally, we sought to learn more on the actual implementation of the guidelines by HCM experts worldwide.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) family evaluation — careful family history, counseling about genetic transmission, and genetic testing are cornerstones of care; screening first-degree relatives can begin at any age using genetic testing, serial imaging, or electrocardiographic surveillance, and because recommendations hinge on variant pathogenicity, reported pathogenicity should be reconfirmed every 2 to 3 years with input from specialized HCM genetics expertise.

Developing therapies to attenuate or prevent disease progression in HCM — developing safe, effective medical therapy that can forestall disease progression is a major therapeutic goal using existing medications (e.g., valsartan) or emerging medications (e.g., cardiac myosin inhibitors); if the specific genetic etiology is identified, gene-based therapies offer the potential for durably impacting disease with a single intervention and testing is starting in humans; establishing disease-modifying and preventive therapies requires more robust and granular understanding of pathogenesis, including predictors of disease development, predictors of adverse outcomes, and intermediate phenotypes that accurately track disease progression and response to therapy.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cardiac screening — baseline testing, intervals, and modifiers: Baseline cardiology testing is recommended for all first-degree, at-risk relatives and should include echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and examination by a cardiologist. It is recommended that genotype-positive relatives undergo serial cardiac screening by electrocardiogram and echocardiogram every 1–2 years through adolescence (< 20 years) and every 3–5 years in adulthood (≥ 21 years). A recent SER found an average penetrance of 62% across all studies and 24% during childhood. Indications to increase frequency may include young age of onset in the family, family history of severe disease and/or sudden cardiac death, and the presence of multiple genetic variants. Conversely, there may be indications where less frequent cardiac screening can be considered for at-risk family members; factors that may indicate lower risk include older age of HCM diagnosis, presence of modifiable risk factors (i.e., obesity, hypertension), negative family history of HCM, and sudden cardiac death. When at at-risk relatives present with cardiac symptoms, these should be immediately investigated. Clinical management, initiation of therapies, and lifestyle advice are typically only indicated based on a clinical diagnosis of HCM, and not for genotype-positive but clinically unaffected relatives.

### Apical ischemia is a universal feature of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113ks5XR]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is defined by unexplained hypertrophy. Of the various morphologies, apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy appears characteristic with differences in the genetics, ECG, and outcomes. This article demonstrates that all patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with both early and advanced disease, have apical ischemia. This ubiquitous finding highlights its potential future use as an imaging biomarker that may help the diagnosis in mild disease and may also be a candidate therapeutic target. Its presence cannot be a risk factor on its own (being ubiquitous), but there is scope to further understand how the extent or depth of ischemia links to disease progression (scar and aneurysms) and risk.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in 500 people and has genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Defined by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) ≥ 15 mm, the apical variant (apical HCM [ApHCM]) is diagnosed when LVH predominates in the left ventricular (LV) apex. ApHCM is the most distinctive of the HCM morphologies with ethnic differences, an increased prevalence in athletes, a lower prevalence of sarcomeric gene mutations, characteristic structural features including apical scar and aneurysm formation, and an altered risk profile with more atrial fibrillation/stroke but similar mortality. –

Assessing clinical phenotype for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) genetic evaluation — An individual's clinical phenotype includes both their clinical cardiac diagnosis and family history. The clinical cardiac diagnosis of HCM or unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) should be confirmed by review of medical records with documentation of hypertrophy by imaging, myocardial scar by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and any left ventricle outflow obstruction, while considering other causes of hypertrophy such as pressure overload or infiltrative/storage disorders. Family history informs genetic test selection, pre-test probability, result interpretation, and family screening, and although it may be collected before genetic testing it can also be gathered after proband testing. When initiating genetic testing for HCM, it remains most informative to test the most severely affected person in the family, and in some situations the most informative individual may be deceased and options for post-mortem genetic testing should be explored.

Systematic evidence review and meta-analysis — methods for HCM genetic testing and counseling: The methods are part of a larger systematic evidence review addressing the question, 'Do genetic testing and genetic counseling lead to improved outcomes for individuals diagnosed with HCM and their at-risk relatives?' The present manuscript reports on uptake domains including the uptake of genetic testing by probands, the uptake of cascade screening by at-risk relatives (defined as the percentage with genetic testing, cardiac screening (e.g. echocardiography), or a combination of the two), the uptake of genetic counseling by probands and at-risk relatives, and the influence of genetic testing on family communication, cascade screening, and patient-reported outcomes.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — hypertrophy, family history, and syncope as sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk features: Studies describe an independent relationship between hypertrophy and SCD when hypertrophy is ≥ 30 mm, with risk increasing in a linear manner and carrying more prognostic significance in younger patients; a young adult with hypertrophy that approaches 30 mm may have similar or greater SCD risk than an older patient with maximal wall thickness ≥ 30 mm. Patients are at increased SCD risk if a first‑degree relative experienced SCD presumably caused by HCM, and family history appears to be an independent predictor though supporting studies are small and observational. Unexplained or non–neurally mediated syncope was associated with SCD risk only when it occurred within the past 6 months.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^11314jCT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:

- Definition: HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by LVH and a non-dilated left ventricle with preserved or increased ejection fraction.
- Pathophysiology: HCM is most frequently caused by genetic mutations in genes (β-myosin heavy chain [MYH7] and myosin binding protein C [MYBPC3]) encoding sarcomere proteins. LVH leads to diastolic dysfunction, reduced systolic output volume, decreased peripheral and myocardial perfusion, cardiac arrhythmia and/or HF and finally increased risk of SCD.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of HCM in the US is low, with an estimated 200 cases per 100,000 population. HCM incidence is bimodal (peak incidence in the second decade and third decade of life).
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations include symptoms due to increased LV end-diastolic pressure (exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, orthopnea, peripheral edema, and HFpEF), LV outflow obstruction (exertional or immediately post-exertional syncope, ventricular arrhythmia), chest pain, palpitations, VT. Disease progression may lead to AF, hypertension, valvular disease, HF, and SCD.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: HCM is associated with an annual mortality rate of 0.5%, and mortality is higher in children. However, SCD is often the first clinical manifestation.

### New perspectives on the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1137NtqM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important genetic heart muscle disease for which prevalence in the general population has not been completely resolved. For the past 20 years, most data have supported the occurrence of HCM at about 1 in 500. However, the authors have interrogated a number of relevant advances in cardiovascular medicine, including widespread fee-for-service genetic testing, population genetic studies, and contemporary diagnostic imaging, as well as a greater index of suspicion and recognition for both the clinically expressed disease and the gene-positive-phenotype-negative subset (at risk for developing the disease). Accounting for the potential impact of these initiatives on disease occurrence, the authors have revisited the prevalence of HCM in the general population. They suggest that HCM is more common than previously estimated, which may enhance its recognition in the practicing cardiovascular community, allowing more timely diagnosis and the implementation of appropriate treatment options for many patients.

Shared decision-making in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — For patients with HCM or at risk for HCM, shared decision-making is recommended (COR 1, LOE B-NR) in developing a plan of care that includes a full disclosure of the risks, benefits, and anticipated outcomes of all options, and the opportunity for patients and caregivers to express their goals and concerns; decisions around genetic testing, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation, advanced therapies for relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), and participation in competitive or high-intensity exercise are particularly critical for these dialogues, and some of these discussions could represent opportunities for referral to centers with more comprehensive experience.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) family screening — yield, onset, and longitudinal follow-up: Echocardiographic screening of first-degree relatives yielded 10% to 15% throughout childhood and adolescence, with a median age at HCM onset of 8.9 (4.7–13.4) years and a median time from onset to a major cardiac event of 1.5 years. These data support family screening initiated in childhood and repeated on a periodic basis in children and adults. Large studies report 5% to 10% phenotype-positive at first screening and another 3% to 5% before 18 years of age; penetrance is lower in individuals who are > 18 years of age, so continued screening into adulthood is warranted although frequency of screening can be lowered. Although systematic evidence is absent, most physicians continue clinical screening until midlife (approximately 50 years of age) because adult disease can manifest at a lower frequency.

1.7 Current practice and future perspectives

Based on the best available evidence, it seems reasonable to offer all patients with HCM a comprehensive evaluation (Figure 2). This will allow for a more individualized approach guided by the patient's risk, symptoms, and baseline fitness. The exercise prescription should be specific and abide by the "FITT" principle (frequency, intensity, time [duration], type of exercise). 84 Unless significant concerns exist, the exercise prescription should satisfy current WHO recommendations for physical activity. 85 Maximal intensity should not exceed 70% of HRR, which approximately equates to 80% of maximal predicted HR or 14 to 16 of the Borg scale. Individuals at high risk of SCD, limited by symptoms or with low baseline fitness should be optimized on medical therapy and commenced at a lower exercise level which could then be gradually increased based on their response. It seems reasonable that for individuals who would qualify for competitive sport, based on the Sport Cardiology Section of EAPC recommendations, 42 not to restrict the intensity level of recreational exercise. For competitive athletes, recommendations should be guided by the Sport Cardiology Section of EAPC recommendations. 42 Ultimately, decisions relating to exercise prescription should take into consideration the wishes of a well‐informed patient.

Figure 2
Proposed approach to exercise prescription

Future research relating to competitive athletes should focus on large, multicenter registries as the option of randomized studies does not seem pragmatic. Large, randomized, multicenter studies, however, are possible in the general HCM population and should explore benefits and safety of different exercise regimes including higher intensity programs and high intensity interval training, which are likely to be more appealing to the expanding population of younger patients.

2 CONCLUSION

It is clear that we are in the early stages of gathering data on safety of exercise in HCM, but the advances in our understanding of the condition and its relation to exercise as a trigger of fatal arrhythmias should not be ignored. Previous consensus guidelines regarding exercise prescription were based on historical data and were overly restrictive. The new guidelines propose a less restrictive approach, under specific circumstances and after detailed discussion with the athlete and other stakeholders. Although this is a welcomed perspective, one must remain mindful that adequately powered, large cohort studies with long‐term follow‐up are currently lacking. Therefore, at present, an individualized rather than a one‐size fits all approach is preferable.

### Sudden death related cardiomyopathies-hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1136gX8V]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a form of inherited cardiomyopathy. Most individuals with HCM experience minimal symptoms throughout their lifetime. However, those with HCM are at risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), the most feared complication of HCM. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation has played a large role in transforming this disease from one with an ominous prognosis to one with mortality rates that are on par with the general public. Since the early 2000s, balance between SCD prevention and unnecessary ICD placement has been sought, this is reflected in the evolution of SCD risk stratification models for patients with HCM. This review discusses key concepts pertaining to HCM, with emphasis on prevention of SCD, and summarizes and compares the recommendations for ICD implantation in current guidelines.

### Family screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: is it time to change practice guidelines? [^113uB67x]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Current guidelines recommend initiating family screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) after age 10 or 12years unless early screening criteria are met. The aim was to evaluate if current screening guidelines miss early onset disease.

Methods and Results

Children who underwent family screening for HCM before age 18years were analysed. Major cardiac events (MaCEs) were defined as death, sudden cardiac death (SCD), or need for major cardiac interventions (myectomy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion, transplantation). Of 524 children screened, 331 were under 10years of age, 9.9% had echocardiographic evidence of HCM, and 1.1% were symptomatic at first screening. The median (interquartile range) age at HCM onset was 8.9 (4.7–13.4) years, and at MaCE was 10.9 (8.5–14.3) years with a median time to MaCE from HCM onset of 1.5 (0.5–4.1) years. About 52.5% phenotype-positive children and 41% with MaCEs were < 10years old. Only 69% children with early HCM met early screening criteria. Cox regression identified male gender, family history of SCD, and pathogenic variants in MYH7/MYBPC3 as a predictor of early onset HCM and MaCEs.

Conclusion

A third of children not eligible for early screening by current guidelines had phenotype-positive HCM. MYH7 and MYBC3 mutation-positive patients were at highest risk for developing early HCM and experiencing an event or requiring a major intervention. Our findings suggest that younger family members should be considered for early clinical and genetic screening to identify the subset in need of closer monitoring and interventions.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic needs in nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115uYK3M]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects individuals worldwide with an estimated prevalence of over 1 in 500 individuals. Nonobstructive HCM accounts for approximately 30% to 70% of cases, is extremely heterogeneous, and is associated with a notable degree of morbidity, including daily life limitations, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, progression to heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. No approved pharmaceutical therapies target the pathophysiology of nonobstructive HCM, although several clinical trials are underway. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of nonobstructive HCM, focusing on epidemiology, natural history, genetics, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, burden of disease, and current treatments and ongoing clinical trials.

1 INTRODUCTION

The benefits of exercise on cardiovascular health and all‐cause mortality are well established. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, studies have demonstrated a nearly threefold increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes with underlying cardiovascular conditions when compared to sedentary individuals. 10 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), first described by Teare 11 is a genetic disorder, characterized by the presence of increased left ventricular wall thickness (≥ 15 mm) that is not solely explained by abnormal loading conditions. 12 Historically, HCM was considered to be the leading cause of SCD in athletes. 13, 14, 15 International recommendations therefore stood firm on the exclusion of athletes with HCM from most competitive sports. 16, 17 Although scientific bodies approach the issue of participation of nonathletic patients with HCM in recreational sport in a more liberal fashion, guidance regarding safe levels of exercise remains vague. 18 Consequently, patients adopt a sedentary lifestyle, with significant impact on their physical and psychological well‐being. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26

HCM is the most common ICC encountered in clinical practice and is thought to affect around 1 in 500 adults. 27, 28, 29, 30 Recent data suggest that the prevalence may even be as high as 1 in 200. 31 Extrapolating such figures indicate that approximately 120 000 people in the United Kingdom and 20 million people worldwide are affected, 32 representing a significant global burden. 33 The implementation of primary and secondary preventative strategies; preparticipation screening, 34, 35, 36, 37 mandated familial evaluation following SCD or diagnosis of ICC in a family, 38 education around cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillators 39, 40 have resulted in an expansion of the HCM population. Furthermore, advances in management such as implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation have led to a reduction in mortality. 41 As a result, HCM mortality rates are now comparable to the general population. 42 Consequently, the need to reduce cardiovascular risk over a normal lifespan becomes a priority in these individuals.

TABLE 1
Risk of bias of included studies.

In the muscle strength overall risk of bias assessment, 87.0% of the studies have some concern (20 of 23 studies), whereas the remaining have a high risk (3 of 23 studies, or 13.0%; Table 1). The concerns were mainly due to the randomization process as studies did not report concealment allocation (some concerns: 20 of 23 studies, or 87.0%) or if the participants were not randomly assigned in the experimental groups (high risk: 3 of 23 studies, or 13.0%), and on the measurement of the outcome (some concerns: 23 of 23 studies, or 100%) as studies assessed muscle strength with no blinding of testers. In the subgroup analysis for muscle strength, best-quality studies were considered those not presenting high risk in overall risk of bias assessment The individual risk of bias assessment is shown in Supplemental Digital Content Figures S1A and B (Supplemental Digital Content 3, individual risk of bias assessment).

Data extraction

The data extraction was performed via a standardized form. Information regarding participants, resistance training protocols, outcomes, and assessment techniques was collected. Study characteristics, intervention duration, number of sessions, sex, experimental design, training status, assessed outcomes, and resistance training prescription method were extracted, along with the main outcomes, whereas outcomes were extracted in their absolute units (e.g. kilograms for 1-RM assessments; millimeters or centimeters for muscle thickness). When graphs were used instead of numerical data, the graphs were measured using a specific tool for data extraction (WebPlotDigitizer, San Francisco, CA).

Assessment of risk of bias

The risk of bias of individual studies was evaluated according to the second version of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2), focusing on different aspects of trial design, conduct, and reporting. Each assessment using the RoB 2 tool is focused on the outcome level. The six-item instrument used to evaluate each included randomized controlled trial in each outcome of interest is as follows: 1) randomization process, 2) deviation from intended interventions, 3) missing outcome data, 4) measurement of the outcome, 5) selection of the reported result, and 6) overall analysis. Overall risk of bias was expressed as "low risk of bias" if all domains where classified as low risk, "some concerns" if some concern was raised in at least one domain but not classified as at high risk in any other, or "high risk of bias" if at least one domain was classified as high risk, or have multiple domains with some concerns.

### Genetic testing and counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an evidence-based practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^112MvKS7]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

Family communication — hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) probands should be encouraged to share diagnoses and genetic results with relatives, and counseling increases awareness of screening recommendations though test results alone do not predict communication. Many families have incomplete cascade testing leaving distant relatives uncertain despite elevated HCM risk; cascade testing of more distant relatives is indicated when intervening relatives are untested, and families need to be advised that a positive result in this context reveals genotype status of the untested intervening relatives. When the proband genotype is unknown or negative, serial cardiac screening remains appropriate; families should be informed that cardiomyopathy can be pre-symptomatic, and limitations of cardiac evaluation and symptom vigilance with prompt screening at the recommended interval should be discussed.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) genetics — proband-first testing, cascade testing, and family clinical screening are outlined as follows: Genetic testing for HCM is first performed in an individual in the family with clear phenotype evidence of HCM, usually the proband (index case). If a definitely pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is identified, then cascade genetic testing at at-risk relatives can be offered. Cascade testing involves targeted testing of first-degree relatives for the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant found in the proband. When cascade testing is performed in an at-risk relative, those who are found not to carry the disease-causing gene variant can be released from further (lifelong) clinical surveillance, whereas those who are found to carry the disease-causing gene variant should undergo clinical screening at regular intervals. Family members of a patient where genetic testing is not done or is negative also require clinical screening at regular intervals because there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in age of onset and disease progression within members of the same family. Genetic testing in a phenotype-negative relative without a known genetic diagnosis in the proband has a very low yield of identifying a genetic cause of HCM, and a negative test in this situation will not change recommendations for ongoing clinical screening.

### Nighttime MUCH, left ventricular hypertrophy, and kidney function among patients with CKD… [^112UnTYP]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a major public health problem, affecting 10. 8% of the Chinese population. 1 Hypertension is a common complication in patients with CKD, with a prevalence of 65% in patients with normal or nearly normal kidney function and up to 95% in patients with end stage kidney disease. 2 Given that hypertension is a strong risk factor for incident cardiovascular diseases, progression of kidney diseases, and mortality in the CKD population, 3, 4 strict blood pressure intervention and monitoring are needed to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular risk. Figure 3 shows unadjusted and adjusted ORs of LVH associated with the hypertension subtypes. Compared with controlled hypertension, MUCH and sustained hypertension were associated with higher odds of LVH in fully adjusted analyses. In the univariate analyses, compared with controlled hypertension, MUCH and sustained hypertension were significantly associated with increased risk of the composite kidney outcome and ESKD. Similarly, a US population-based analysis reported that 27. 9% participants in the CKD subgroup had masked asleep hypertension. 20 Among 738 White patients with treated hypertension and controlled clinic BP measurements, 48. 5% patients had nighttime MUCH. 32 Among 1808 untreated outpatients recruited from a hypertension clinic, Zhang et al33 reported that 11. 6% patients had isolated nighttime hypertension with increased carotid intima-media thickness and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio compared with patients without hypertension. A cross-sectional and observational cohort that enrolled 1492 patients with CKD and an eGFR of 20 to 70 mL/min/1.

73 m2 reported that MUCH was associated with lower eGFR and greater LVMI only in the presence of elevated nighttime BP, 16 suggesting that nighttime hypertension played an important role in target organ damage in patients with MUCH.

### Anatomical and biochemical adaptations of muscle to different exercises… [^1171TvdQ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

"Work-hypertrophy" is a universally accepted concept of physiology. It implies that all effort leads to muscle enlargement and, by the same token, hypertrophy always accompanies increased ability for muscular performance. This implication is generally true, but understanding of the process may need modification. First, what is meant by hypertrophy: increase in girth of a limb, volume of a muscle, or the related weight. Or, are we referring to the individual muscle fiber, the smallest anatomical unit of muscle. In work-hypertrophy, the gross and microscopic dimensions are regarded as running parallel courses and, therefore, as being interchangeable. There would be no serious error if in hypertrophy the sum of the enlarged parts equalled an increased whole. But such an equation is not always found. Consequently, human experiments relying on gross dimension such as girth as an index of hypertrophy may fail to reveal the true state of affairs. Furthermore, in the Gordon EE.

### Tonsillectomy vs modified uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for hypertrophy and obstructive sleep apnea… [^1133gnhU]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate whether mUPPP is more effective than TE alone in treating adult patients with tonsillar hypertrophy and moderate to severe OSA. Design, Setting, and Participants. The study cohort comprised 93 patients with a mean body mass index of 29. 0, calculated as weight in kg divided by height in m2. The first line of treatment is nonsurgical, with continuous positive airway pressure or a mandibular retaining device. These approaches are often effective, 1, 8 but adherence to treatment remains a challenge because many patients use them insufficiently or not at all. 9, 10 For these patients, pharyngeal surgery may be an option, as recommended in a recent review by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
11. Of 245 patients screened for participation, 93 were enrolled. This cohort had a mean BMI of 29.
0. The regression model revealed that AHI and BMI at baseline were confounding factors, so they were adjusted for. The adjusted results showed a small mean postoperative difference in AHI of 6. 4 events/h in favor of TE. The findings of this RCT were counterintuitive to what we expected: a more extensive surgery should be more effective than a less extensive surgery. There are several possible explanations. First, the study population was selected to have tonsillar hypertrophy, with approximately two-thirds of the included patients having a tonsil size of 3 or 4. Indeed, in a sample of individuals without OSA, only approximately 6% were considered to have large tonsils.

34 Likewise, the findings of this study cannot be generalized to patients with severe obesity, patients younger than 30 years or older than 65 years, or women because they were underrepresented.

### Menopause, benign prostatic hypertrophy, tuberculosis… [^114Cbehr]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

What treatment options are available for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. Estrogen-containing systemic hormone therapy is an effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms. Physicians should prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to improve symptoms because of the potential risks of long-term use of hormone therapy. Nonhormonal medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, fezolinetant, gabapentin, clonidine, and oxybutynin, are reasonable alternatives. Which nonpharmacologic treatments are recommended for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hypertrophy. Limiting evening fluid intake, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, toilet and bladder training, sitting to urinate, urethral milking, double voiding, bladder retraining, pelvic floor exercises, and mindfulness techniques are recommended to improve symptoms.

What is the preferred treatment for latent tuberculosis infection. Preferred treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection are three to four months in duration and include isoniazid plus rifapentine, rifampin alone, or isoniazid plus rifampin. What is the treatment for recurrent, symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia. According to consensus guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology, catheter ablation is typically recommended as the first-line treatment for recurrent symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia. When is oxygen indicated for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Guidelines from several organizations recommend prescribing long-term oxygen for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who experience severe resting hypoxemia, defined as resting oxygenation saturation of 88% or less, to improve mortality.

Patients should be instructed to use oxygen for at least 15 hours per day with a goal of oxygen saturation between 88% and 92%. Long-term oxygen therapy is not recommended for patients with moderate resting, nocturnal, or exertional hypoxemia. How effective is the eradication of Helicobacter pylori for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. According to a systematic review of 29 studies, H. pylori eradication effectively treats and often cures functional dyspepsia. Patients with proven eradication had a greater likelihood of symptomatic improvement.

### Definition of benign prostatic hypertrophy-national cancer institute… [^116mvMpv]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

benign prostatic hypertrophyListen to pronunciationA benign condition in which the prostate gland is larger than normal. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and urethra, which can slow or block the flow of urine from the bladder. This can cause urinary symptoms, such as feeling a need to urinate often or right away, waking up many times during the night to urinate, trouble urinating, leaking urine, pain during urination or after ejaculation, and blood in the urine. Benign prostatic hypertrophy does not increase a person's risk of developing prostate cancer. However, if not treated, it can lead to a weak bladder, urinary retention, urinary tract infections, bladder stones, or bladder or kidney damage. Benign prostatic hypertrophy is most common in older men. Also called benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH, and enlarged prostate.
