## Question

How are hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes correlated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes are correlated, including how they influence each other, what mechanisms connect them, and what the clinical implications are for outcomes and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and epidemiology to set thresholds and context. Then, I should verify the bidirectional relationship: diabetes causing hypertriglyceridemia and hypertriglyceridemia increasing diabetes risk. Next, I will examine the mechanistic links, especially insulin resistance and lipotoxicity. After that, I should review clinical outcomes, including glycemic control, cardiovascular disease, microvascular complications, and pancreatitis with severe elevations. Finally, I need to consider guideline-based measurement and management implications, including fasting versus nonfasting testing and residual cardiovascular risk strategies.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and prevalence so I don't build on shaky ground. Hypertriglyceridemia in adults is generally defined as fasting triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL or nonfasting greater than 175 mg/dL, with severe hypertriglyceridemia flagged at fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL because of pancreatitis risk, which aligns with ADA 2025 guidance; importantly, I should double-check that these cut-points are consistently applied across studies, but these thresholds are the clinical standard in diabetes care settings [^112zZaeQ] [^115Xzkmj] [^113qAKgL]. In large type 2 diabetes cohorts, approximately 39% have triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, about 19% have moderate hypertriglyceridemia, and roughly 2% have severe levels, which helps scope the burden in routine care [^114BKeWp]. In the broader statin-treated US adult population, hypertriglyceridemia remains common and clinically meaningful, reinforcing that this is not a niche issue I can ignore [^1153mx68].

> Now, I should verify the first direction: diabetes and insulin resistance as drivers of hypertriglyceridemia. Pathophysiologically, insulin resistance increases adipocyte lipolysis with higher non-esterified fatty acid flux to the liver, promotes hepatic overproduction of large VLDL particles, and impairs lipoprotein lipase–mediated clearance, yielding the typical diabetic dyslipidemia triad of high triglycerides, low HDL-C, and small dense LDL; moreover, these atherogenic lipid changes can precede overt type 2 diabetes by several years, which suggests they are integral to the metabolic trajectory rather than incidental findings [^114ru4sm] [^114gmL45] [^1153mx68] [^114xJFoJ].

> But wait, what about the reverse direction: does hypertriglyceridemia signal or promote incident type 2 diabetes? Epidemiologically, elevated triglycerides and especially a higher triglyceride/HDL-C ratio predict future diabetes, and changes in triglycerides over time track with diabetes risk independent of baseline factors; furthermore, higher triglycerides are associated with inadequate glycemic control among insulin-treated patients, which strengthens the clinical signal I should not dismiss [^1135QXTZ] [^1139FoCA] [^116W1WJB] [^111skdbA]. Hold on, let's not jump to causal conclusions too fast: Mendelian randomization analyses have not consistently supported a direct causal role for genetically elevated triglycerides on insulin resistance or glycemia, so I should frame triglycerides as a robust risk marker that may contribute via metabolic intermediates, but not as a uniformly proven causal driver by genetics alone [^114wcSX4].

> I need to check the mechanistic bridge linking elevated triglycerides to glucose dysregulation. Excess lipid availability increases circulating NEFAs and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that induce lipotoxicity in liver, muscle, and pancreatic beta cells; acute lipid infusions in humans impair glucose tolerance, reduce insulin sensitivity, and can blunt glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, while triglyceride metabolites such as diacylglycerol activate kinases that antagonize insulin signaling, jointly reinforcing insulin resistance and beta-cell stress; additionally, hyperglycemia may upregulate apoCIII, a key regulator that slows triglyceride clearance, closing the loop between glucose and triglyceride excess [^111E3uR3] [^113py54K] [^1159NgLk] [^113FdLqf].

> Next, I should review how triglycerides correlate with glycemic control in real-world data. Elevated triglycerides positively correlate with HbA1c in large cohorts of people with type 2 diabetes, and each 1% increase in HbA1c has been associated with roughly a 9% increase in triglycerides, independent of other covariates; this strengthens the notion that triglycerides are not just noise but track with the degree of dysglycemia in clinical practice [^111skdbA] [^114BKeWp] [^112ahnPb]. Hmm, wait a minute, correlation is not causation, but given the mechanistic plausibility and the dose-response pattern, triglycerides appear to be both a barometer of metabolic control and a potential contributor to the dysglycemic milieu [^111E3uR3].

> I will now examine cardiovascular risk because it is often conflated with the triglyceride story. Initially, I might be tempted to state that higher triglycerides independently cause more cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes, but hold on, I should verify the adjusted analyses: meta-analytic data show that while higher triglycerides associate with higher cardiovascular risk, the signal attenuates and often loses independence after adjustment for other lipid parameters, suggesting that triglycerides are a marker for a cluster of atherogenic remnants, apoB-containing particles, and low HDL rather than a solitary culprit; this nuance matters at the bedside [^117QvrV8] [^116KYps6] [^114pT2Jp]. Let me reconsider therapeutic implications: despite the independence debate, in statin-treated patients with controlled LDL-C and triglycerides in the 135–499 mg/dL range, adding icosapent ethyl reduces ASCVD events, and major guidelines endorse its consideration in appropriate high-risk patients, which indicates that targeting triglyceride-rich remnant risk can translate into outcome benefits beyond LDL lowering [^112EpGL5] [^115JUt2M] [^1137e2e1] [^116BinoB].

> I should also confirm links with microvascular and limb complications. Hypertriglyceridemia has been associated with higher risk of diabetic macular edema and increased central retinal thickness, and higher triglycerides have correlated with neuropathy progression and, in longer-term observational data, with limb outcomes, although the amputation signal is less consistent after multivariable adjustment; still, these associations nudge me to pay attention to triglycerides beyond macrovascular endpoints [^115RAtWc] [^111RyjYw] [^117HqqxQ].

> Now, I need to ensure I address severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis, where the correlation with diabetes carries immediate clinical risk. Severe fasting triglycerides at or above 500 mg/dL warrant evaluation and treatment to prevent pancreatitis, and very severe levels show an exponential rise in acute pancreatitis risk, with diabetes frequently present as a secondary driver; case series and large electronic health record data reinforce both the pancreatitis and mortality risks at extreme triglyceride levels, and insulin therapy can acutely lower triglycerides in diabetic hypertriglyceridemia during pancreatitis episodes [^1179LXZ5] [^113qAKgL] [^113Scj7S] [^114yyG7V] [^115KY3zz].

> Hold on, I should verify measurement and evaluation caveats so we don't misclassify risk. Nonfasting samples are acceptable for general screening, but triglycerides rise postprandially and calculated LDL-C can be misleading in hypertriglyceridemia, so fasting profiles and consideration of non-HDL-C or apoB are prudent when triglycerides are elevated; guidelines recommend repeating fasting sampling for markedly high nonfasting triglycerides and evaluating secondary causes such as diabetes, kidney or liver disease, hypothyroidism, alcohol, and medications before attributing to primary dyslipidemia, with treatment prioritizing pancreatitis prevention at higher levels [^114mzsFf] [^114CWiLv]. I should double-check that our plan aligns with diabetes standards of care, which emphasize identifying secondary contributors and considering targeted therapy, including icosapent ethyl for residual ASCVD risk in appropriate patients [^114dWnAz] [^11387jrQ] [^112EpGL5].

> In summary, let me tie this together and make sure I'm not overstating any link. Diabetes and insulin resistance drive a characteristic dyslipidemia with elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, and small dense LDL via increased fatty acid flux and VLDL overproduction; elevated triglycerides and higher TG/HDL-C ratios, in turn, predict incident diabetes and worse glycemic control, with biologically plausible lipotoxic mechanisms, while cardiovascular risk associations are consistent but often not independent after adjustment, though targeting triglyceride-rich remnant risk with icosapent ethyl can reduce events in selected statin-treated patients; when triglycerides are very high, pancreatitis prevention becomes paramount, and fasting measurement with evaluation for secondary causes is essential to safe, effective care [^114ru4sm] [^112zZaeQ] [^1139FoCA] [^111skdbA] [^117QvrV8] [^112EpGL5] [^1179LXZ5] [^114mzsFf].

---

Hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes are tightly linked through insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction; **insulin resistance** drives VLDL overproduction [^114ru4sm] and impairs clearance [^111kwuPb], while **β-cell dysfunction** [^111E3uR3] worsens glycemic control and triglyceride levels. Elevated triglycerides are common in diabetes [^114BKeWp] [^1153mx68] and predict **incident diabetes, poor glycemic control, and microvascular complications** [^116W1WJB] [^111skdbA] [^111RyjYw]; they also mark increased **cardiovascular risk**, though not always as an independent driver [^117QvrV8] [^111oreV3]. Management centers on **lifestyle, glycemic control, and statins** [^112zZaeQ], with fibrates [^114CWiLv] or omega-3s [^112EpGL5] [^1137e2e1] for severe hypertriglyceridemia [^1179LXZ5] or persistent elevations.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes

### Insulin resistance and hepatic VLDL overproduction

Insulin resistance increases **adipose lipolysis**, increasing hepatic NEFA flux [^114gmL45] and promoting hepatic triglyceride synthesis and VLDL overproduction [^114ru4sm]. Reduced LPL activity impairs clearance of VLDL and chylomicrons [^1153mx68], further elevating triglycerides [^114ru4sm].

---

### β-cell dysfunction and impaired insulin secretion

Lipotoxicity from elevated triglycerides and NEFAs impairs **β-cell function and insulin secretion** [^113py54K], worsening hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia [^111E3uR3]. Hyperglycemia upregulates apoCIII, inhibiting lipolysis and clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, thereby linking hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia [^113FdLqf].

---

## Epidemiological evidence of association

- **Prevalence**: Hypertriglyceridemia is common in diabetes [^1153mx68], with 39% of T2D patients having triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL [^114BKeWp].

- **Incident diabetes**: Elevated triglycerides predict new-onset diabetes [^1135QXTZ], with a 12.62-fold higher risk in men whose triglycerides rise from low to high tertiles over 5 years [^116W1WJB].

- **Glycemic control**: Higher triglycerides associate with worse glycemic control (higher HbA1c) in T2D [^111skdbA].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

### Cardiovascular disease (CVD)

Atherogenic dyslipidemia — elevated triglycerides with low HDL and small dense LDL — increases **cardiovascular risk** in diabetes [^111kwuPb]. Higher triglyceride levels are associated with increased CVD risk in T2D [^117QvrV8], though not always independently of other lipid parameters [^111oreV3].

---

### Microvascular complications

- **Neuropathy**: Elevated triglycerides correlate with faster progression of diabetic neuropathy [^111RyjYw].

- **Retinopathy**: Hypertriglyceridemia associates with diabetic macular edema and retinopathy progression.

- **Nephropathy**: Higher triglycerides associate with albuminuria and renal impairment in diabetes [^114BKeWp].

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle management includes **weight loss** to reduce insulin resistance and triglycerides [^115Xzkmj]; a diet low in saturated fat, with controlled carbohydrates and limited alcohol [^114CWiLv]; and regular physical activity to lower triglycerides and improve insulin sensitivity [^117BhF6u].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Statins**: First-line for dyslipidemia in diabetes [^112zZaeQ]; reduce CVD risk.

- **Fibrates**: For severe hypertriglyceridemia or persistent elevations despite statins [^114CWiLv].

- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Lower triglycerides; consider icosapent ethyl in high-risk patients with elevated triglycerides on statins [^112EpGL5] [^1137e2e1].

- **Glycemic control**: Improves lipid profiles and reduces triglycerides [^114kpv9f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ADA 2025 recommends evaluating and treating secondary or lifestyle causes in people with diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, and considering **icosapent ethyl** for patients with ASCVD or risk factors with triglycerides 135–499 mg/dL while on statins [^112zZaeQ] [^112EpGL5] [^115JUt2M]. ESC 2023 recommends considering **high-dose icosapent ethyl** with statins for patients with hypertriglyceridemia [^116BinoB].

---

Hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes are interlinked through insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction, with elevated triglycerides being common in diabetes and associated with incident diabetes, poor glycemic control, and complications. **Management should target lifestyle, glycemic control, and statins**, adding fibrates or omega-3s when needed.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112zZaeQ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in terms of managing dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend addressing and treating several factors. These include lifestyle factors, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; secondary factors, such as diabetes, chronic liver or kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, and hypothyroidism; and medications that can raise triglyceride levels. This approach is advised for adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia, defined as having fasting triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL (or > 1.7 mmol/L) or non-fasting triglycerides greater than 175 mg/dL (or > 2.0 mmol/L).

### Association between triglyceride level and glycemic control among insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes [^111skdbA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Elevated blood triglyceride levels are known to increase the risks of diabetes and prediabetes. However, it is still unclear whether elevated triglyceride levels are associated with inadequate glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Objective**: To investigate the association between elevated triglyceride levels and inadequate glycemic control among insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: We recruited 20,108 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were treated with a sufficient dose of insulin. These patients were from the 2013 China National HbA1c Surveillance System study conducted in Mainland China. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the association of triglyceride level with inadequate glycemic control.

- **Results**: Overall, 56.0% of the subjects had elevated triglyceride levels (≥ 1.70 mmol/L); the prevalence of HbA1c ≥ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was 67.2% and 83.4%, respectively. The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of HbA1c ≥ 7.0% were 1.06 (0.98, 1.15), 1.35 (1.23, 1.48), and 3.12 (2.76, 3.53) for those with triglyceride levels in ranges of 1.70 to 2.29, 2.30 to 3.39, and ≥ 3.40 mmol/L, respectively, compared with those with triglyceride levels of < 1.70 mmol/L. There was a similar association between triglyceride levels and HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. This association was confirmed by subgroup analyses. There was also a strong nonlinear dose-response relationship between triglyceride level and inadequate glycemic control.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated triglyceride levels were strongly associated with inadequate glycemic control.

### Serum triglycerides as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies [^111oreV3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Low credibility.

We acknowledge that our study had several limitations. First, most of the included studies were observational, but several were randomized control trials, which might have led to heterogeneities. Furthermore, because our study is a literature-based meta-analysis, the lack of access to individual patient data might lead to heterogeneities in triglyceride (TG) contrast level and adjustments. Meanwhile, differences in the definition of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and effect size types (odds ratio [OR], relative risk [RR], or hazard ratio [HR]) must be mentioned as well. However, a random-effects model and subgroup analyses were conducted to minimize the impact of heterogeneity.

Second, a single baseline TG estimation may have led to the misclassification of study participants in each category, and multiple determinations of TG during follow-up would increase precision. Third, although we used the most fully adjusted relative risk from each study to calculate the pooled result, there are many confounders that may affect the outcome, such as lifestyle and socio-economic status, for example, cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking, antihypertension and lipid-lowering drugs, and antidiabetic medication. Further well-designed clinical trials are needed to overcome all these confounders.

Finally, evidence suggests that postprandial (non-fasting) TG levels may have a stronger association with CVD than fasting levels in the general population. However, in our study, only one study reported on the relationship between postprandial TG and CVD, so we could not evaluate this issue robustly.

### Overproduction of very low-density lipoproteins is the hallmark of the dyslipidemia in the metabolic syndrome [^114ru4sm]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2008). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is a key feature of the metabolic syndrome and often progresses to type 2 diabetes. Both insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are characterized by dyslipidemia, which is an important and common risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Diabetic dyslipidemia is a cluster of potentially atherogenic lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities that are metabolically interrelated. Recent evidence suggests that a fundamental defect is an overproduction of large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, which initiates a sequence of lipoprotein changes, resulting in higher levels of remnant particles, smaller LDL, and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

These atherogenic lipid abnormalities precede the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by several years, and it is thus important to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the overproduction of large VLDL particles. Here, we review the pathophysiology of VLDL biosynthesis and metabolism in the metabolic syndrome. We also review recent research investigating the relationship between hepatic accumulation of lipids and insulin resistance, and sources of fatty acids for liver fat and VLDL biosynthesis. Finally, we briefly discuss treatments for lipid management of dyslipidemia and potential future therapeutic targets.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2025 guidelines for medical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly concerning dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, recommend considering the addition of icosapent ethyl. This is advised to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or other cardiovascular risk factors who are already on statin therapy. This recommendation applies to patients with controlled LDL-C but elevated triglycerides, specifically within the range of 135–499 mg/dL (1.5–5.6 mmol/L).

### Triglycerides/HDL cholesterol ratio and type 2 diabetes incidence: Panasonic cohort study 10 [^1135QXTZ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Low credibility.

Previous studies have investigated the association between the ratio of triglycerides (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the incidence of diabetes in adults, discovering that a high TG/HDL-C ratio was linked to an elevated risk of new-onset diabetes. However, the comparison of predicting diabetes development among lipid profiles, including the TG/HDL-C ratio and the ratio of TG/HDL-C cut-off value, has received limited attention. We examined the relationship between diabetes onset and the TG/HDL-C ratio, in addition to the applicable cut-off value for predicting diabetes onset.

- **Methods**: This study included 120,613 participants from the health examination database at Panasonic Corporation from 2008 to 2017. Cox regression analysis employing multivariable models was used to investigate the association between lipid profiles, particularly the ratio of TG/HDL-C and the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The multivariable model was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, systolic blood pressure, plasma glucose levels after fasting, smoking status, and exercise habits. Areas under time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) were employed to assess the prediction performance and cut-off values of each indicator. A fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL, a self-reported history of diabetes, or usage of antidiabetic medicines were used to identify T2D.

- **Results**: During the course of the study, 6,080 people developed T2D. The median follow-up duration was 6.0 (3–10) years. Multivariable analysis revealed that the ratio of TG/HDL-C

### Effects of hypertriglyceridemia with or without NEFA elevation on β-cell function and insulin clearance and sensitivity [^111E3uR3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and might contribute to its pathogenesis either directly or through elevation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs).

This study aimed at comparing the glucometabolic effects of acute hypertriglyceridemia alone or combined with NEFA elevation in subjects without diabetes. Twenty-two healthy lean volunteers underwent 5-hour intravenous infusions of either saline or Intralipid, without (n = 12) or with heparin (I + H; n = 10) to activate the release of NEFAs. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed during the last 3 hours of infusion. Insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion rate (ISR), model-derived β-cell function, and insulin clearance were measured after 2 hours of lipid infusion and during the OGTTs.

In fasting conditions, both lipid infusions increased plasma insulin and ISR and reduced insulin clearance without affecting plasma glucose and insulin sensitivity. These effects on insulin and ISR were more pronounced for I + H than Intralipid alone. During the OGTT, the lipid infusions markedly impaired glucose tolerance, increased plasma insulin and ISR, and decreased insulin sensitivity and clearance, without significant group differences. Intralipid alone inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (i.e. β-cell glucose sensitivity) and increased β-cell potentiation, whereas I + H had neutral effects on these β-cell functions.

In conclusion, in healthy nonobese subjects, mild acute hypertriglyceridemia directly reduces glucose tolerance and insulin.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^116BinoB]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically with respect to the management of dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of high-dose ethyl icosapent ethyl (2 g BID) in combination with a statin in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1179LXZ5]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus (hypertriglyceridemia), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia. Consider initiating medical therapy to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in patients with fasting triglyceride levels ≥ 500 mg/dL or ≥ 5.7 mmol/L.

### Comparison of the effects of triglyceride variability and exposure estimate on clinical prognosis in diabetic patients [^114XWsi1]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

A significant portion of atherosclerosis progression is attributed to dyslipidemia. In particular, lipid accumulation over a long duration is closely related to poorer cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. Along with increased serum lipid levels, the presence of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus is also one of the major risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is a leading cause of death in diabetic patients. Therefore, dyslipidemia, combined with diabetes mellitus, may result in increased cardiovascular risk and poorer clinical outcomes.

Importantly, dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetic patients is characterized by high serum triglyceride (TG) levels, which are thought to lead to increased small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. These small dense LDL particles are considered to be more atherogenic than large-buoyant LDL particles. This suggests that serum TG levels may play an important role, especially in diabetic patients. Previously, hypertriglyceridemia has been suggested as an important cardiovascular risk factor. It was reported that higher serum TG levels in diabetic patients correlate with higher mortality rates. However, there are also conflicting studies on the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on cardiovascular prognosis. Di Angelantonio et al. showed that the mean level of serum triglyceride (TG) is not significantly associated with coronary heart disease. Xia et al. also demonstrated that increased serum TG levels were associated with decreased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^11387jrQ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically in the management of dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend addressing and treating lifestyle factors, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. They also emphasize addressing secondary factors, including diabetes, chronic liver or kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, and hypothyroidism. Additionally, it is important to assess medications that may raise triglyceride levels in adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or non-fasting triglycerides greater than 175 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L).

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in managing dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia. It is advised to consider initiating medical therapy to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in patients with fasting triglyceride levels ≥ 500 mg/dL or ≥ 5.7 mmol/L.

### The association of hypertriglyceridemia with cardiovascular events and pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Scj7S]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a manifestation of several common metabolic disorders in the Western world. A recent cross-sectional study found that over 33% of adults in the United States had hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride levels over 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)), of whom over 50% had serum triglyceride levels exceeding 200 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L).

The association of hypertriglyceridemia with clinically important complications such as cardiovascular events and acute pancreatitis has been suggested by several studies. Previous epidemiologic studies demonstrated an increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, although there has always been significant confounding due to varying levels of adjustments for traditional risk factors and other lipid subfractions. As for pancreatitis, case series and uncontrolled studies reported that very severely elevated triglyceride levels are associated with lipemic serum, chylomicronemia syndrome, and increased risk of pancreatitis. Serum triglyceride levels of 1000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L) and higher have been observed in 12% to 38% of patients presenting with acute pancreatitis. However, the association with pancreatitis has not been evaluated in controlled studies or with less severe hypertriglyceridemia.

To update the evidence base to the present time (the last meta-analysis was performed six years ago), we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis. Our goal was to assess the magnitude of association and the quality of supporting evidence linking hypertriglyceridemia with cardiovascular events, mortality, and pancreatitis.

### Diabetes dyslipidemia [^113zimZH]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is associated with a considerably increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Intensive glycemic control has essentially failed to significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes in clinical trials. Dyslipidemia is common in diabetes, and there is strong evidence that cholesterol lowering improves cardiovascular outcomes, even in patients with apparently unremarkable lipid profiles. Here, the authors review the pathophysiology and implications of alterations in lipoproteins observed in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. They also explore the effect of medications commonly used in the management of diabetes on the lipid profile, the evidence for lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions, and national and international recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes.

### Interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes: Therapeutic implications [^114xJFoJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). High credibility.

The interactions between lipoproteins and diabetes are covered in several recent reviews, summarized in Figure 1. Clinically, these alterations manifest as either elevated levels of triglycerides (TG) above 200 mg/dL and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels above 200 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) above 100 mg/dL. However, the increase in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is caused by increased apoB-containing lipoproteins. For example, those with mixed hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and high levels of apoB face a higher risk of developing ASCVD (HR 3.3, 95% CI 2.06–5.30; p = 0.0008) than those with a mixed lipid phenotype, which is 2.17 (1.38–3.40; p < 0.0001) compared with those having the optimal lipid phenotype.

### Association of statin use and hypertriglyceridemia with diabetic macular edema in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy [^115RAtWc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

To investigate the effects of dyslipidemia and statin therapy on the progression of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in patients with type 2 diabetes, medical records of 110 patients with type 2 diabetes (comprising 70 statin users and 40 non-users) were retrospectively reviewed. The two outcome measures were the progression of diabetic retinopathy by two or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale, and diabetic macular edema assessed via optical coherence tomography. Serum lipid profiles were analyzed from six months prior to the diagnosis of diabetic macular edema.

- **Results**: Diabetic retinopathy progressed in 23% of statin users and 18% of non-users (p = 0.506). However, diabetic macular edema was present in 23% of statin users and 48% of non-users (p = 0.008). Statins effectively reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with and without diabetic macular edema (p = 0.043 and p = 0.031, respectively). Among statin users, patients with diabetic macular edema had significantly higher levels of triglycerides (p = 0.004) and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.033) than those without diabetic macular edema. Logistic regression analysis indicated that statin use significantly lowered the risk of diabetic macular edema [odds ratio (OR): 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12–0.91, p = 0.032]. Additionally, hypertriglyceridemia six months prior to the development of macular edema was significantly associated with increased central retinal thickness (OR: 1.52; 95% CI 1.14–2.02, p = 0.005).

### Diabetes dyslipidemia [^114kpv9f]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is a common feature of diabetes. There is an association between atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is greater at any given level of serum cholesterol in patients with diabetes, and its association with hypertriglyceridemia is stronger than in the general population. Importantly, there is strong and convincing evidence that cholesterol-lowering therapy significantly reduces CHD in patients both with and without diabetes. There also appears to be no threshold below which a further reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol might be beneficial.

Improved glycemic control generally has favorable effects on lipoprotein levels in diabetes, with a reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels through decreased circulating very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and by increased catabolism of LDL through reduced glycation and upregulation of LDL receptors. It is certainly possible that any cardiovascular benefit which might be derived from intensive glucose lowering is related to effects on lipoprotein metabolism rather than directly through altered glycemia.

This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.

### Preoperative triglycerides predict post-coronary artery bypass graft survival in diabetic patients: A sex analysis [^112hP6Pu]. Diabetes Care (2000). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is commonly observed in association with diabetes. Despite cross-sectional studies and isolated longitudinal analyses in patients without coronary artery disease, the suggestion that triglyceride levels are relevant to subsequent cardiovascular events in the setting of diabetes remains controversial. This study evaluates the predictive value of serum triglyceride levels on mortality in post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) diabetic patients with subsequent analysis by sex.

- **Research design and methods**: This longitudinal observational study, involving a large metropolitan hospital, consists of 1,172 diabetic post-CABG patients (792 men and 380 women) with lipid data collected between the years 1982 and 1992. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the risk of mortality and cardiac events associated with triglyceride levels in the highest quartile (> 2.90 mmol/l for men and > 3.12 mmol/l for women).

- **Results**: Elevated preoperative serum triglyceride values in post-CABG subjects with diabetes were correlated with increased overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26, 95% CI 1.00–1.59). The greatest influence of triglyceride levels was observed on overall (1.89, 1.30–2.73) and event-free survival (1.49, 1.06–2.08) in women. High triglyceride values were also modestly related to the risk of cardiac events in diabetic men (1.28, 0.99–1.66).

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that increased preoperative triglyceride levels predict increased late mortality and cardiac event risk in diabetic post-CABG patients, more strongly in women.

### Interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes: Therapeutic implications [^115rNAoz]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). High credibility.

There is a gap in knowledge about the clinical and pathophysiological implications resulting from the interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Most existing evidence comes from sub-analyses of cohorts, and scant information derives from randomized clinical trials. The expected clinical implications of T2D in patients with primary hyperlipidemias include an escalation of their already high cardiovascular risk. There is a need to accurately identify patients with this dual burden and adequately prescribe lipid-lowering therapies, with advancements in newer therapeutic options. This review provides an update on the interactions of primary hyperlipidemias — such as familial combined hyperlipidemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, multifactorial chylomicronemia, lipoprotein (a) — and type 2 diabetes.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^114mzsFf]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

One reason for the variability and heterogeneity of triglyceride (TG) measurements is the post-prandial regulation of TG-rich lipoproteins. Atherosclerosis has been suggested to be a 'post-prandial disease', with non-fasting TG contributing to atherogenesis. However, an oral fat tolerance test to assess post-prandial TG kinetics did not improve risk prediction in patients with coronary artery disease compared with fasting TG; indeed, post-prandial TG increase is highly correlated with fasting TG concentrations. Thus, a fat tolerance test provides no additional clinical information.

In general, non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentrations are highly correlated with each other and somewhat less with LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). However, in individuals with hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG), the calculated or directly measured LDL-C level may underestimate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. For general risk screening, non-fasting blood samples have similar prognostic value as fasting and are recommended to improve patient compliance and for practical reasons. However, non-fasting samples contain higher TG levels. When assessing patients with elevated TG, such as those with metabolic syndrome or diabetes, calculated LDL-C should be interpreted with caution; fasting samples remain the method of choice.

- **Joint statement**: The European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine recommend repeating a fasting sample when non-fasting TG levels are greater than 5 mmol/L (440 mg/dL). For non-fasting samples, TG levels greater than or equal to 2 mmol/L (175 mg/dL) should be flagged as abnormal.

### Serum triglycerides as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies [^1159NgLk]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Low credibility.

Evidence showed that triglyceride (TG) involvement in atherogenesis is indirect. The progression of coronary atherosclerosis is strongly stimulated by interactions between diabetes-associated factors and other elements, such as abnormal lipid metabolism and hypertriglyceridemia. These are pivotal factors. Hypertriglyceridemia exacerbates diabetes by impairing β-cell function and causing peripheral insulin resistance (IR). TG overload in islets interferes with glucose metabolism, and the accumulation of metabolites from fatty-acid esterification impairs β-cell function. This impairment decreases glucose-induced insulin secretion, leading to increased glycemic levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, thereby significantly raising the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Hypertriglyceridemia has a unidirectional relationship with peripheral IR. The metabolites of TG, such as free fatty acids and diacylglycerol, can regulate insulin-signaling pathways by activating several serine/threonine kinases. These kinases suppress insulin receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates, inducing peripheral IR. Many studies have indicated that IR leads to inflammation, altered coagulation, and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, an independent association between IR and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been reported.

In addition, TG is involved in atherogenesis by altering LDL-particle size. Some studies have indicated that LDL-particle size shows a significantly negative correlation with serum TG levels. This means that when serum TG is elevated, the LDL-particle size becomes smaller.

### Approach to the patient with moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^117BhF6u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder encountered in clinical practice. Plasma triglycerides are a marker for the concentration of triglycerides carried in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein particles, with a fasting triglyceride level of 1000 mg/dL. Because moderate hypertriglyceridemia increases atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, it is important to determine the underlying etiology to guide appropriate and timely management. This article provides stepwise recommendations on the diagnosis and management of moderate hypertriglyceridemia, based on three common scenarios encountered in clinical practice.

Initial steps in management include evaluating for secondary contributors, especially diabetes mellitus. Based on patient characteristics, appropriate management decisions include lifestyle adjustments aimed at weight loss and decreasing alcohol consumption, along with the use of statin and nonstatin therapies.

### Association of triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio to identify future prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus: over one-decade follow-up in the Iranian population [^117Hk5Sc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

To determine the association between the triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) and the risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: In a cohort of 5,064 subjects (2,247 of whom were men) aged ≥ 20 years, Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to examine the associations of TG/HDL-C with incident prediabetes and T2DM among normoglycemic men and women. Additionally, the association of this lipid ratio with incident T2DM was assessed among prediabetic subjects (n = 1,414). The multivariable analyses were adjusted for factors including age, body mass index, waist-to-height ratio, wrist circumference, systolic blood pressure, family history of T2DM, education level, history of cardiovascular diseases, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG).

- **Results**: Over a median follow-up period of 11.2 years, 2,140 new cases of prediabetes (1,070 in men) and 360 incident T2DM cases (152 in men) were identified among normoglycemic individuals. In the prediabetic population, 574 new cases of T2DM (252 in men) were reported. Across the entire population, compared to the first quartile (reference), higher quartiles of TG/HDL-C were significantly associated with increased risks of incident prediabetes and T2DM among normoglycemic individuals, as well as incident T2DM in the prediabetic population (all P for trend < 0.001). The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the fourth quartiles were 1.37 (1.20–1.58), 1.92 (1.34–2.75), and 1.57 (1.22–2.01) for prediabetes and T2DM, respectively. The sex-stratified analyses demonstrated similar significant associations in both sexes.

### Triglycerides and amputation risk in patients with diabetes: Ten-year follow-up in the DISTANCE study [^117HqqxQ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia has received little attention of late and is typically not considered a primary clinical target. Elevated triglycerides in concert with low HDL is associated with the metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk in healthy populations. However, the relationship between triglycerides and noncardiovascular complications has received less attention. In the EURODIAB cohort study, patients with type 1 diabetes and elevated triglycerides were at an increased risk for the development of peripheral neuropathy in bivariate, but not multivariate analyses. Furthermore, elevated triglycerides were recently found to correlate independently with loss of sural nerve myelin fiber density, a marker for progression of diabetic neuropathy.

On the other hand, there have only been a few studies that have directly looked into the role of hypertriglyceridemia as a potential risk factor for lower extremity amputation (LEA). In 1996, Humphries et al. followed a cohort of 1,564 Nauruans with diabetes over 12 years to define potential risk factors for nontraumatic LEA. They found that fasting glucose levels, duration of diabetes, and male sex were independent risk factors. Triglyceride levels were higher in patients that sustained amputations, but the result was not statistically significant. In 2006, Davis et al. conducted an observational cohort study, the Fremont Diabetes Study, that followed 1,294 patients with type 2 diabetes. They found that foot ulceration, a low arterial brachial index, elevated hemoglobin A1C level, and neuropathy were all independent predictors of LEA. Again, triglycerides were not highlighted as a significant factor.

### Prometheus: An observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study of hypertriglyceridemia in Russia [^112ahnPb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

The PROMETHEUS study included a separate analysis of outcomes in a sample of patients with both lipoprotein and HbA1c data. Within this nested sample, the correlation between HbA1c and triglycerides (TG) predicted a 9.3% increase in TG level with each one-unit increase in HbA1c level. This correlation is not unexpected given that the HbA1c test is conducted in individuals who have, or are suspected to have, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypertriglyceridemia is frequently seen in patients with diabetes and in those with metabolic syndrome. Indeed, the known relationship between TGs and fasting glucose has prompted the recommendation that hypertriglyceridemic states be promptly followed up to rule out the presence of T2DM.

Data from a study conducted in a middle-class urban population in India showed that the age-adjusted prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia was 71.0% versus 30.2% in the presence versus the absence of diabetes. Additionally, data from a cross-sectional study conducted in Turkey showed that mean serum levels of TG were significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared with those without.

The results of the PROMETHEUS study showed a correlation between TG and other lipid parameters. Specifically, increases in the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and decreases in the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were predicted to result in significant increases in TG. These results demonstrate the complex relationship between the levels of TG and lipoproteins, all of which are modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3I) has identified atherogenic dyslipidemia as a critical factor for these outcomes.

### Dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113zdsxY]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease in diabetes mellitus. The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are a high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentration, and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles. The lipid changes associated with diabetes mellitus result from increased free fatty acid flux secondary to insulin resistance. The availability of multiple lipid-lowering drugs and supplements provides new opportunities for patients to achieve target lipid levels. However, the variety of therapeutic options poses a challenge in the prioritization of drug therapy.

The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia is not increased in patients with diabetes mellitus, but mortality from coronary heart disease increases exponentially as a function of serum cholesterol levels, and lowering cholesterol with statins reduces diabetic patients' relative cardiovascular risk. Although drug therapy for dyslipidemia must be individualized, most people with diabetes mellitus are candidates for statin therapy and often need treatment with multiple agents to achieve therapeutic goals.

### Association between triglyceride to HDL cholesterol ratio and a risk of diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139FoCA]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the link between the triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) and the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched for cohort and case-control studies that reported on the link between TG/HDL-C and a risk of T2DM, with no restrictions on criteria used for the definition and categorization of low and high TG/HDL-C ratios.

- **Results**: A total of 20 studies were included. There was considerable variability in terms of the categorization of low or normal and higher TG/HDL-C ratio among the studies. Patients with high TG/HDL-C ratio had a markedly higher risk of developing T2DM compared with patients with low or normal TG/HDL-C. Each unit increase in the ratio correlated with the increased risk of diabetes. Subgroup analysis based on sex showed an increased risk of T2DM in males and females with a high ratio compared with the group with a low/normal ratio.

- **Conclusion**: Higher TG/HDL-C ratio correlates with increased risk of T2DM. Despite limitations, the study demonstrates a possible value of using TG/HDL-C ratio as a biomarker for diabetes risk.

### Interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes: Therapeutic implications [^111j2Afh]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Primary hyperlipidemias are a group of monogenic and polygenic diseases characterized by severe disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. These entities are characterized by severe forms of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or both (mixed hyperlipidemias). These groups of disorders are relatively common and pose a significant burden due to increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is known that several primary hyperlipidemias have a bidirectional risk for the development of diabetes. However, little attention has been focused on the interaction of different primary hyperlipidemias and its clinical implications. In this review, we focus on the association of primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Hypertriglyceridemia [^114bw22e]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a commonly encountered lipid abnormality frequently associated with other lipid and metabolic derangements. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends obtaining a fasting lipid panel in adults over the age of 20. The discovery of hypertriglyceridemia should prompt an investigation for secondary causes such as a high fat diet, excessive alcohol intake, certain medications, and medical conditions (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism). In addition, patients should be evaluated for other components of the metabolic syndrome, which include abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high triglyceride, and hypertension. Hypertriglyceridemia is classified as primary hypertriglyceridemia when there are no secondary causes identified. Primary hypertriglyceridemia results from various genetic defects leading to disordered triglyceride metabolism. It is important to treat hypertriglyceridemia to prevent pancreatitis by reducing triglyceride levels to < 500 mg/dL. Furthermore, lowering triglycerides while treating other dyslipidemias and components of the metabolic syndrome will reduce coronary events. However, it is controversial how much isolated hypertriglyceridemia correlates directly with coronary artery disease, and further studies are needed to clarify whether treatment for this condition leads to meaningful clinical outcomes. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) are the first line of treatment for hypertriglyceridemia. These changes include a low saturated fat, carbohydrate-controlled diet combined with alcohol moderation.

### Serum triglycerides as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies [^117QvrV8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). High credibility.

The importance of triglycerides (TG) level as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has been extensively investigated in the general population; however, their relationship in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is uncertain. We aimed to assess the association of TG with CVD in individuals with T2DM.

- **Research design and methods**: We searched bibliographic databases for studies published until June 2018, reporting on the relationship between TG and CVD in T2DM patients. A random-effects model with inverse variance weighting was used to compute pooled estimates of the most fully adjusted risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) according to TG categories, unit TG, and logarithm (log) of TG for CVD.

- **Results**: A total of 31 studies were included, involving 132,044 T2DM patients with 10,733 incident cardiovascular events. The pooled RR (95% CI) of CVD for an increase in baseline TG, log TG by 1-mmol/L and categorized in the highest vs. the lowest TG in T2DM were 1.06 (1.02, 1.09), 1.30 (1.18, 1.42), and 1.30 (1.16, 1.46), corresponding to a CVD risk increase of 6%, 30%, and 30%, respectively. The pooled RR (95% CI) of CVD for per 1-mmol/L TG increment in eight studies and TG categories in three studies were 1.03 (0.98, 1.08) and 1.39 (0.92, 2.1) in T2DM patients adjusted for other lipid parameters, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: In T2DM patients, an elevated triglyceride level cannot serve as an independent marker for an increased risk of cardiovascular events; however, higher serum TG levels tend to be associated with increased risk.

### Effects of hypertriglyceridemia with or without NEFA elevation on β-cell function and insulin clearance and sensitivity [^113py54K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The natural history of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is typically characterized by an early increase in insulin availability due to elevated insulin production and reduced insulin clearance, coupled with a parallel reduction in insulin responsiveness. The biological mechanisms responsible for maintaining chronic hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in the absence of significant hyperglycemia remain largely unknown. Key features of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are hypertriglyceridemia and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Mounting evidence suggests that elevated triglycerides and NEFAs are not innocent bystanders in the context of metabolic syndrome but may further exacerbate insulin resistance and the attendant metabolic dysregulation.

- **Effects of excess lipid availability**: On the other hand, the effects of excess lipid availability on insulin secretion and clearance are still debated. Most prior human studies focused primarily on the metabolic consequences of increased NEFA availability during infusion of both lipid emulsions and heparin, the latter to activate the conversion of the infused triglycerides into NEFAs and glycerol. Acute and chronic elevation of plasma NEFA concentration consistently induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, acute NEFA elevation had a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion, while prolonged NEFA elevation impaired glucose-stimulated β-cell function, particularly in subjects without diabetes. Few available studies focused specifically on the effects of triglyceride elevations by employing low-grade lipid infusions without heparin.

### Hypertriglyceridemia in statin-treated US adults: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [^1153mx68]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertriglyceridemia:

- **Definition**: Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, which is associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease.

- **Pathophysiology**: Underlying pathophysiology occurs through abnormalities in hepatic VLDL production and intestinal chylomicron synthesis; dysfunctional LPL-mediated lipolysis or impaired remnant clearance. Primary etiology includes genetic mutations (LPL, APOC3, APOA5 genes), while secondary etiologies may consist of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, alcohol use, renal disease, pregnancy, and MASLD.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the US is estimated at 29% in men and 21% in women.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, lipemia retinalis, tuberous xanthoma, palmar crease xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, focal neurologic symptoms (irritability), and epigastric pain with an increased risk of pancreatitis seen mostly with both familial chylomicronemia and primary mixed hyperlipidemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, T2DM, and acute pancreatitis with a reduction in health-related QoL.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypertriglyceridemia with high (150–500 mg/dL) and very high levels (> 500 mg/dL) is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality with hazard ratios of 1.49 (95% CI 1.36–1.63, p < 0.001) and 3.08 (95% CI 1.46–6.50, p < 0.01), respectively.

### Elevated plasma triglyceride concentration and risk of adverse clinical outcomes in 1.5 million people: A CALIBER linked electronic health record study [^114yyG7V]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

Assessing the spectrum of disease risk associated with hypertriglyceridemia is needed to inform potential benefits from emerging triglyceride-lowering treatments. We sought to examine the associations between a full range of plasma triglyceride concentrations and five clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: We used linked data from primary and secondary care for 1.5M people to explore the association between triglyceride concentration and risk of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, new onset diabetes, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality over a median of 6–7 years follow-up.

- **Results**: Triglyceride concentration was available for 1,530,411 individuals (mean age 56.6 ± 15.6 years, 51.4% female), with a median of 1.3 mmol/L (IQR: 0.9 to 1.9). Severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as > 10 mmol/L, was identified in 3,289 (0.21%) individuals, including 620 with > 20 mmol/L. In multivariable analyses, a triglyceride concentration > 20 mmol/L was associated with very high risk for acute pancreatitis (Hazard ratio (HR) 13.55 (95% CI 9.15–20.06)); chronic pancreatitis (HR 25.19 (14.91–42.55)); and high risk for diabetes (HR 5.28 (4.51–6.18)) and all-cause mortality (HR 3.62 (2.82–4.65)) when compared to the reference category of ≤ 1.7 mmol/L. An association with myocardial infarction, however, was only observed for more moderate hypertriglyceridemia between 1.7 and 10 mmol/L. We found a risk interaction with age, with higher risks for all outcomes, including mortality among those ≤ 40 years compared to > 40 years.

- **Conclusions**: We highlight an exponential association between severe hypertriglyceridemia and various adverse clinical outcomes.

### Diabetes and lipids: A review and update on lipid biomarkers and cardiovascular risk [^1174gZef]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review existing and new evidence regarding the relationship between diabetes and dyslipidemia and to provide an update on the lipid biomarkers used to assess cardiovascular risk, along with the guidelines reflecting these changes.

- **Methods**: We conducted a literature review pertaining to diabetes and lipids using the MEDLINE/PubMed database. We reviewed articles in English, primarily published between 1994 and early 2025. Also included are guidelines published by professional organizations recognized nationally or internationally in the fields of diabetes, lipids, and cardiovascular disease.

- **Results**: Studies evaluating the relationship between diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia have provided practice-changing evidence. Lipid markers such as apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a), as well as the concept of lipid variability, have emerged as treatment targets.

- **Conclusion**: Over the past 30 years, non-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lipid markers have been identified to further stratify individuals with diabetes who are at risk for future cardiovascular events. Treatment targets and pharmacological therapy have been studied and continue to be updated.

### Serum triglycerides as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies [^116KYps6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Low credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we pooled the data for triglyceride (TG) levels of 132,044 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects from 31 studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to comprehensively investigate the predictive role of TG levels and assess the factors influencing the predictive ability of TG. Our study findings provide useful implications for the development of disease prevention strategies.

Firstly, increased TG levels are associated with an increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, this association remained statistically insignificant when adjusted for other blood lipid parameters; it affirms the findings of previous studies that reported TG is not an independent risk factor for incident CVD in the T2DM population. In contrast, the data from the general population confirmed that fasting serum TG are independently associated with the risk of CVD, even after adjustment for other lipid parameters. Furthermore, our results indicated that a higher TG level tends to increase the risk of CVD primarily due to an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but not stroke.

Secondly, subgroup analyses on the impact of TG on CVD showed prominence among T2DM individuals with a mean age less than 65 years. This is consistent with a recent cross-sectional study which found that a higher TG level was associated with an increased risk of CVD among patients with a short duration of diabetes. In contrast, a lower TG level was associated with an increased risk of CVD in patients with a longer duration of diabetes, and this association was mainly driven by CHD.

### Association of statin use and hypertriglyceridemia with diabetic macular edema in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy [^114rVPq6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the use of statins by patients with type 2 diabetes and pre-existing diabetic retinopathy did not increase the risk of retinopathy progression but was protective against the development of diabetic macular edema. Hypertriglyceridemia is a potential surrogate marker for diabetic macular edema in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, clinicians should closely monitor hypertriglyceridemia in patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking statins. The use of a statin with supplemental therapy (fenofibrate, niacin, and/or fish oil) should be considered for patients with diabetic retinopathy to prevent the onset and reduce the severity of diabetic macular edema.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114CWiLv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia. The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, e-mail discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The Task Force recommends that the treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

### Interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes: Therapeutic implications [^116bvi8e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Phenotypically, FD is characterized by mixed hyperlipidemia with moderately severe elevations in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels; typically, these values range from 300 to 400 mg/dl, apoB > 2.5, and VLDL-C/triglyceride ratio > 0.3. Some physical findings may also be present, such as xanthochromia striata palmaris, though this appears in a minority of patients.

Diagnosis can be challenging since the gold standard Fredrickson's criteria for diagnosing FD (TG between 150 and 1000 mg/dl and VLDL-C/TG ratio > 0.30) require ultracentrifugation, an expensive test not widely available in clinical care settings. Therefore, some groups have proposed alternative simple criteria for diagnosis:

- **ApoB/total cholesterol ratio**

- **ApoB algorithm of Sniderman**

- **Non-HDL-C/apoB ratio**

- **Remnant cholesterol/TG ratio**

- **Most recent by Sampson et al**: This method uses a new formula to calculate VLDL-C, which includes apoB, and utilizes a VLDL-C/TG ratio > 0.194 (sensitivity = 73.9%; specificity = 82.6%; AUC = 0.8685) to identify FD.

### Mendelian randomization studies do not support a role for raised circulating triglyceride levels influencing type 2 diabetes, glucose levels, or insulin resistance [^114wcSX4]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Observed association between triglyceride SNPs and fasting insulin, fasting glucose, HOMA-B, and HOMA-IR. Associations between individual SNPs and each continuous outcome, meta-analyzed across the four nondiabetic studies, are given. None of the SNPs were associated with any of the four outcomes except for rs7819412 (XKR6-AMAC1L2 locus), where there was some evidence for a positive association with fasting insulin (P = 0.004) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.004). There was no evidence that carriers of greater numbers of (weighted) triglyceride-raising alleles were at risk for increased fasting glucose or fasting insulin levels. There was no heterogeneity between studies except for the allele score–glucose association (I² = 80.9%, P = 0.001). Removing the study influencing this heterogeneity, Go-DARTS, resulted in a nominal association between allele score and raised fasting glucose (P = 0.03).

- **Expected effect size of the association**: Estimates of the expected ORs and 95% CIs for the allele score–type 2 diabetes association show that for the allele score and each quintile comparison, the 95% CIs of the observed ORs excluded the expected point estimate ORs estimated from the function of the SNP–triglyceride and triglyceride–type 2 diabetes correlations and vice versa.

### Low triglyceride levels are associated with a better metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes [^1135Jfq7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2011). Low credibility.

Although it is well known in the literature that high triglyceride serum (TG) levels can jeopardize metabolic control, little is known about the influence of low TG on patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution of TG serum levels in individuals with T1D and their relationship with metabolic control.

Findings:

- **Patient classification**: We reviewed the medical charts of 180 patients with T1D, who were classified into groups according to their TG levels:
	1. Low (below 50 mg/dL)
	2. Normal (50–150 mg/dL)
	3. High (above 150 mg/dL)

- **TG level distribution**: TG levels were low in 21.1% (n = 38; group 1), normal in 68.6% (n = 123; group 2), and high in 10.6% (n = 19; group 3).

- **Association with metabolic control**: High TG was associated with poor metabolic control (p < 0.001). Patients with TG lower than 50 mg/dL had a lower HbA1c than those with TG between 50 and 150 mg/dL (7.41 ± 1.50% vs. 8.56 ± 1.94%; p = 0.002).

Conclusion: TG levels lower than 50 mg/dL were common and might be associated with better metabolic control in patients with T1D, although it is not clear whether low TG is the cause or consequence of better metabolic control.

### The nature and characteristics of hypertriglyceridemia in a large cohort with type 2 diabetes [^114BKeWp]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) in a large, diverse healthcare system cohort with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to examine associations between triglyceride levels and demographic factors, glycemic control, and body weight. Additionally, the study investigates whether triglyceride levels are associated with markers of fatty liver and renal disease.

A total of 19,086 individuals with T2D were studied between 2015 and 2020. We compared groups with normotriglyceridemia (499 mg/dl [> 5.64 mmol/l]) and performed both univariate and multivariate correlational analyses with triglyceride levels as a continuous variable.

Results indicated that 39% of participants had triglyceride levels ≥ 150 mg/dl (< 1.7 mmol/l), 19% had moderate HTG, and 2% had severe HTG. There was a lower proportion of Blacks in all HTG categories compared to Whites. No overall gender difference in prevalence was observed except that severe HTG was more common in men, and as HTG severity increased, mean age decreased. Triglycerides correlated with HbA1c and were associated with BMI, LDL-C, diastolic BP, transaminases, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio, independent of HbA1c.

This study fills gaps in our knowledge of the distribution and clinical associations of HTG in T2D and characterizes the features of the small but important group with severe HTG. It demonstrates the influence of age, sex, and race; confirms the moderate effects of glycemic control and obesity on triglyceride levels; and provides evidence of these associations.

### Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol: stars or second leads in diabetes [^11654srq]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients remains high despite modern effective therapies, such as statins. Some of the risk may be attributed to other components of metabolic dyslipidemia, namely high triglyceride levels, low HDL cholesterol levels, and small dense LDL. Attempts at controlling this form of dyslipidemia have ended with either conflicting or entirely disappointing results. We are in dire need of additional therapeutic options for these high-risk patients. Ongoing trials with currently available therapies are expected to provide some much-needed answers, and new therapies are eagerly awaited.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115Xzkmj]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For patients with diabetes mellitus experiencing dyslipidemia, specifically hypertriglyceridemia, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend addressing and treating lifestyle factors such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, secondary factors including diabetes, chronic liver or kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, and hypothyroidism should also be managed, along with medications that raise triglycerides in adult patients. Patients with fasting triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or nonfasting triglycerides greater than 175 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) should receive particular attention.

### Diabetic hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis masquerading as biliary pancreatitis [^115KY3zz]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2002). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus significantly affects plasma lipid metabolism, particularly triglycerides. One complication of hypertriglyceridemia is acute pancreatitis. This report presents a case of diabetic hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis that initially presented as biliary pancreatitis. The initiation of insulin therapy resulted in the resolution of hypertriglyceridemia and the cessation of acute pancreatitis episodes.

### Low triglyceride as a marker for increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients with long-term type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional survey in China [^112TgQnW]. Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews (2018). Low credibility.

There are inconsistent findings regarding associations between triglyceride levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to test whether the association between triglycerides and CVD depends upon the duration of diabetes.

- **Methods**: From April 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 223,612 patients with T2DM from 630 hospitals in China. Cardiovascular disease was defined as having either prior coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetic foot. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of triglyceride for CVD. Relative excess risk due to interaction, attributable proportion due to interaction, and synergy index were used to estimate the effect size of additive interaction between low triglyceride, i.e. < 1.7 mmol/L, and duration of diabetes, i.e. ≥ 15 years.

- **Results**: Among 223,612 T2DM patients, 31,898 (14.27%) suffered from CVD. A low level of triglyceride was associated with a decreased risk of CVD (univariable OR, 0.91, 95% CI, 0.88–0.93; multivariable OR, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.92–0.97) among patients with < 15 years of duration of diabetes but increased risk of CVD (univariable OR, 1.12, 95% CI, 1.04–1.21; multivariable OR, 1.18, 95% CI, 1.09–1.27) among those patients with 15 or more years of duration of diabetes, with significant additive interactions (relative excess risk due to interaction, 0.39, 95% CI, 0.25–0.52; attributable proportion due to interaction, 0.20, 95% CI, 0.14–0.27; and synergy index, 1.80, 95% CI, 1.43–2.28).

Whereas a high triglyceride level was associated with increased CVD risk, a low triglyceride level's association with CVD risk varied depending on the duration of diabetes.

### Diabetes dyslipidemia [^115KCoW2]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is associated with a considerably increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Intensive glycemic control has essentially failed to significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes in clinical trials. Dyslipidemia is common in diabetes, and there is strong evidence that cholesterol lowering improves cardiovascular outcomes, even in patients with apparently unremarkable lipid profiles.

- **Pathophysiology and implications**: The authors review the pathophysiology and implications of the alterations in lipoproteins observed in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
- **Effect of diabetes medications**: They also discuss the effect of medications commonly used in the management of diabetes on the lipid profile.
- **Interventions and recommendations**: The evidence for lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions is explored, along with national and international recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1137e2e1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning the management of dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, the Endocrine Society 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester to reduce cardiovascular risks. This recommendation applies to adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on a statin at LDL goal, with residual triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), and with two additional traditional risk factors or risk-enhancing factors.

### Transcriptional activation of apolipoprotein CIII expression by glucose may contribute to diabetic dyslipidemia [^113FdLqf]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver are common in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the factors connecting alterations in glucose metabolism with plasma and liver lipid metabolism remain unclear. Apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII), a regulator of hepatic and plasma triglyceride metabolism, is elevated in type 2 diabetes. In this study, we analyzed whether apoCIII is affected by altered glucose metabolism.

- **Methods and results**:
	- Liver-specific insulin receptor-deficient mice display lower hepatic apoCIII mRNA levels than controls, suggesting that factors other than insulin regulate apoCIII in vivo. Glucose induces apoCIII transcription in primary rat hepatocytes and immortalized human hepatocytes via a mechanism involving the transcription factors carbohydrate response element-binding protein and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α. ApoCIII induction by glucose is blunted by treatment with agonists of farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α but not liver X receptor, i.e. nuclear receptors controlling triglyceride metabolism. Moreover, in obese humans, plasma apoCIII protein correlates more closely with plasma fasting glucose and glucose excursion after oral glucose load than with insulin.

- **Conclusions**:
	- Glucose induces apoCIII transcription, which may represent a mechanism linking hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes.

### Hypertriglyceridemic hyperapob: The unappreciated atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114gXRRG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in insulin and glucose metabolism do not seem to entirely account for the high frequency of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. An important additional factor may be hypertriglyceridemic hyperapoB, an atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia that is common in these patients. The major features of hypertriglyceridemic hyperapoB are hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased numbers of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles.

This article reviews the pathophysiology of this disorder, focusing on the changes in lipoprotein particle number and composition rather than lipoprotein lipid levels. The in vitro and in vivo evidence that small, dense LDL are more atherogenic than normal, larger, buoyant LDL is summarized, and the particularly high-risk state conferred by increased numbers of small, dense LDL is delineated.

This review demonstrates how abnormalities in the plasma lipoproteins may relate to the effectiveness with which adipose tissue traps and retains fatty acid. The effects of increased fatty acid flux on the hepatic metabolism of lipids and apoB secretion are detailed, and the mechanisms by which fibrates and statins may improve these are described. An understanding of these principles should provide the physician with a more physiologic basis on which to choose appropriate therapy.

### Changes in triglyceride levels over time and risk of type 2 diabetes in young men [^116W1WJB]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The association between changes in triglyceride concentrations over time and diabetes is not well understood. This study aimed to assess whether triglyceride determinations taken five years apart can predict incident type 2 diabetes.

Triglyceride levels were measured at baseline (time 1) and five years later (time 2) in 13,953 apparently healthy men aged 26–45 years, with triglyceride levels below 300 mg/dl (< 3.39 mmol/l), followed by a subsequent follow-up period of 5.5 years.

During 76,742 person-years of follow-up, 322 cases of diabetes were reported. A multivariate model, adjusted for factors such as age, BMI, total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, family history of diabetes, fasting glucose, blood pressure, physical activity, and smoking status, revealed a continuous independent increase in incident diabetes with rising time 1 triglyceride levels (P(trend) < 0.001). Men who progressed from the lowest tertile of time 1 triglyceride levels to the highest tertile over the follow-up period (low-high) exhibited a hazard ratio (HR) of 12.62 (95% CI 3.52–31.34) compared to those remaining in the lowest tertile at both time points (reference group: low-low). In contrast, men who stayed at the highest tertile throughout the follow-up (high-high) had a HR for diabetes of 7.08 (2.52–14.45), whereas those whose triglyceride levels decreased to the lowest tertile (high-low) exhibited a HR of 1.97 (0.67–6.13).

Alterations in triglyceride levels during the follow-up period were associated with changes in BMI, physical activity, and eating breakfast habits (P < 0.05), but triglyceride level changes remained an independent modifier of diabetes risk even after adjusting for these factors.

### Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol: Stars or second leads in diabetes [^114pT2Jp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The question of whether hypertriglyceridemia causes coronary artery disease (CAD) or is simply a marker for accompanying lipoprotein abnormalities — especially low HDL cholesterol levels and small dense LDL particles — remains controversial. A meta-analysis of 17 population-based prospective studies found that increased plasma triglyceride (TG) levels were associated with heightened coronary disease risk in both men and women after adjusting for HDL cholesterol and other risk factors. A direct atherogenic effect of TG-rich particles, particularly intermediate-density lipoprotein and remnant particles, has been presumed.

In a more recent meta-analysis, adjusting for established coronary risk factors, especially HDL cholesterol, significantly attenuated the risk magnitude associated with high TG levels. The odds ratio was about 1.7 for individuals with TG levels in the top third of the population compared to those in the bottom third.

Two recent studies provide insight into nonfasting TG levels as a cardiovascular disease risk factor. In the Women's Health Study, adjusting for levels of total and HDL cholesterol, as well as measures of insulin resistance (diabetes, BMI, and C-reactive protein), weakened the association between TG levels and cardiovascular event risk, showing little independent relationship with such events. In contrast, nonfasting TG levels were linked to incident cardiovascular events, independent of traditional risk factors, other lipid levels, and markers of insulin resistance.

### Lipoprotein disorders associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance [^111kwuPb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with a marked increase in coronary artery disease (CAD). In subjects with type 2 diabetes, the characteristic lipoprotein abnormality is increased triglycerides, increased small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, and decreased concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but relatively normal absolute concentrations of LDL cholesterol.

In observational studies, both increased LDL and decreased HDL cholesterol predict the development of CAD. In clinical trials, both fibric acids and statins have been shown to reduce CAD in subjects with diabetes. An interesting future clinical trial would be to assess whether fibric acids make an additional contribution to reduce CAD in patients already on statin therapy.

### Lipoprotein abnormalities and their consequences for patients with type 2 diabetes [^114gmL45]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Dyslipidaemia is common in patients with Type 2 diabetes and is considered responsible for significant CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Patients with Type 2 diabetes are at high risk of complications associated with atherosclerosis and should therefore receive preventive interventions. At the level of the adipocyte, impaired insulin action leads to increased rates of intracellular hydrolysis of triglycerides with the release of NEFA. This rise in NEFA provides substrate for the liver that, in the presence of impaired insulin action and relative insulin deficiency, is associated with complex alterations in plasma lipids:

- **Plasma VLDL levels are raised**:
	1. Increased VLDL levels are associated with post-prandial hyperlipidaemia compounded by impaired LPL activity, which may independently be associated with CAD.
	2. Remnant particles can deliver more cholesterol to macrophages than LDL-C particles. Thrombogenic alterations in the coagulation system also result from hypertriglyceridaemia.

- **Plasma HDL-C levels are reduced**:
	1. The reduction in cardioprotective HDL-C leads to decreased cholesterol efflux from tissues — the first step in reverse cholesterol transport to the liver from peripheral tissues.
	2. The antioxidant and antiatherogenic activities of HDL-C are reduced when circulating levels are low.

- **LDL-C particles become small and dense**:
	- Small, dense LDL-C particles are considered more atherogenic than their larger, buoyant counterparts because they (a) are more prone to oxidation and (b) may more readily adhere to and subsequently invade vascular tissues.

### The correlation of triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio with muscle mass in type 2 diabetes patients [^1149W8Yp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio is correlated with metabolic diseases. The prevalence of sarcopenia is significantly higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients compared with healthy controls. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the correlation of TG/HDL-C ratio with muscle mass in T2DM patients.

- **Method**: Our study consists of 1048 T2DM inpatients recruited from the department of endocrinology. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was detected with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry method. Low muscle mass was diagnosed using the criteria of SMI less than 7.0 kg/m² (in male subjects) or 5.4 kg/m² (in female subjects).

- **Result**: The prevalence of low muscle mass was 20.9% and 14.5% in male and female groups respectively. SMI was correlated with TG/HDL ratio after adjustment for age, duration of diabetes, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and HbA1c in the male subgroup. In the female subgroup, SMI was associated with the TG/HDL ratio after adjustment for age and DBP.

- **Conclusion**: Higher TG/HDL-C ratio is correlated with muscle mass in T2DM patients.

### Elevated triglycerides correlate with progression of diabetic neuropathy [^111RyjYw]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and its continuation, the Epidemiology of Diabetes and its Complications, established hyperglycemia as the primary cause of diabetes complications. Consistent with these studies, we initially found that elevated A1C correlated with loss of sural nerve MFD. However, when directly comparing participants with a similar degree of baseline diabetic neuropathy (i.e. similar sural nerve MFD), A1C did not differ between rapidly progressing and non-progressing participants; it was not a specific marker for diabetic neuropathy progression in this study. This suggests that other factors may underlie variation in the progression of diabetic neuropathy.

In the last decade, abnormalities in insulin signaling, caused by insulin deficiency, as in type 1 diabetes, or insulin resistance, as in type 2 diabetes, have been invoked as additional pathogenetic components in diabetic neuropathy. This is underscored by the data from the longitudinal Rochester Study, in which type 1 diabetes was found to be a major risk factor for the severity of diabetic neuropathy. Experimental studies also suggest that insulin deficiency is a major contributor to diabetic neuropathy because of the prominent neurotrophic effects of insulin. For this reason, the number of participants with type 1 diabetes and those treated with insulin was balanced when defining the progressing and non-progressing groups.

In contrast to A1C, baseline serum triglycerides were significantly elevated in the rapidly progressing compared with the non-progressing groups.

### Investigation and management of hypertriglyceridaemia [^1139s6tz]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

While the precise definition of hypertriglyceridaemia remains contentious, the condition is becoming more common in Western populations as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus rises. Although there is strong epidemiological evidence that hypertriglyceridaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it has been difficult to demonstrate this through drug intervention studies, as drugs that reduce triglycerides also raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Precise target values have also been difficult to agree upon, although several new guidelines for coronary risk management now include triglycerides.

The causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are numerous. The more severe forms have a genetic basis and may lead to an increased risk of pancreatitis. Several types of hypertriglyceridaemia are familial and associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Secondary causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are also numerous, and it is important to exclude these before starting treatment with specific triglyceride-lowering agents. Lifestyle management is also very effective and includes weight reduction, restricted alcohol and fat intake, and exercise.

### Insulin secretion is increased in non-diabetic subjects with fasting hypertriglyceridaemia [^1123HhCA]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The elevation of triglycerides is strongly linked with insulin resistance, but it has not been evaluated in relationship to insulin secretion. The aim of this study was to determine whether hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with abnormal insulin secretion.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional study was carried out. Eligible subjects, apparently healthy men and non-pregnant women aged 20–65 years, were recruited. According to the triglyceride levels, subjects were allocated in the groups with hypertriglyceridaemia and normotriglyceridaemia. Hypertriglyceridaemia was defined by serum triglyceride levels ≥ 150 mg/dL. Insulin secretion was evaluated by the first phase of insulin secretion (1st PIS) and the second phase of insulin secretion (2nd PIS). A regression linear analysis was performed to evaluate the association between hypertriglyceridaemia (independent variable) and the first and second phase insulin secretion (dependent variables).

- **Results**: A total of 247 apparently healthy subjects were enrolled; 113 (45.7%) with hypertriglyceridaemia and 134 (54.3%) in the control group. The simple regression linear analysis showed a significant association between hypertriglyceridaemia and the 1st PIS [B = 207.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 33.5–380.5, p = 0.02] and the 2nd PIS [B = 48.7; 95% CI 9.2–88.2, p = 0.01]. A multiple regression linear analysis adjusted by age, sex, body mass index, and waist circumference was performed, showing that fasting hypertriglyceridaemia remained significantly associated with the 1st PIS [B = 184.3; 95% CI 13.0–355.7, p = 0.03] and the 2nd PIS.
