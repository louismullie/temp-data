## Question

etiology of fainting episodes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the etiology of fainting episodes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the overarching classification framework. Then, I should verify the relative frequencies of major etiologic categories across settings. Next, I will examine reflex (neurally mediated) syncope, followed by cardiac and orthostatic causes, and then consider age-related patterns and special populations. After that, I need to check the initial diagnostic approach and its yield. Finally, I will integrate mechanism-specific treatment implications and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and classification so I don't anchor on a vague concept of "fainting". Syncope is transient loss of consciousness due to global cerebral hypoperfusion, with abrupt onset, brief duration, and rapid, complete recovery; it is distinct from seizures, psychogenic pseudosyncope, and other nonsyncopal causes of transient loss of consciousness, which I should keep in mind to avoid misclassification later [^461c3d02] [^1d50c5aa]. The accepted etiologic classification includes reflex (neurally mediated) syncope, cardiac syncope, and orthostatic hypotension, with a residual "unexplained" category when the initial evaluation is non-diagnostic; I should double-check that this triad plus unexplained is consistent across contemporary guidelines, which it is [^c56ba33f] [^ff6a8c45].

> Next, I should review frequencies to set pretest probabilities. Wait, let me verify the figures across settings because ED cohorts differ from syncope units and community data. In ED cohorts, reflex syncope accounts for roughly 35–48%, cardiac syncope about 5–21%, and orthostatic hypotension around 4–24%, with 17–33% remaining unexplained; in dedicated syncope units, reflex syncope predominates at 56–73%, cardiac 6–37%, orthostatic 1–10%, and unexplained 5–20%, reflecting selection bias toward more complex cases [^bb00ee8d] [^e197237e]. I should also note that a large review aggregating 5248 patients reported 59.3% reflex, 10.4% cardiac, 9.1% orthostatic, and 11.3% unexplained, which aligns with guideline ranges and supports the hierarchy of reflex > cardiac > orthostatic in mixed populations [^ff2a56e8].

> I will now examine reflex (neurally mediated) syncope, since it is the most common. Vasovagal syncope typically follows upright posture or emotional stress, with a prodrome of nausea, diaphoresis, pallor, and warmth, and is diagnosed primarily by history and exam; I need to ensure I don't overcall testing when the story is classic, as guidelines emphasize history-based diagnosis in typical cases [^a49d5be2] [^e19ef66c]. Situational syncope includes micturition, defecation, cough, laugh, and swallow triggers; cough syncope, for example, likely reflects a combination of markedly elevated intrathoracic pressure reducing venous return and a neurally mediated vasodepressor-bradycardia response, so trigger avoidance and cough treatment are foundational [^a1dee150] [^7cbd9a13]. Carotid sinus syndrome is important in older adults, with cardioinhibitory forms causing prolonged asystole and vasodepressor forms causing hypotension; prevalence can approach 20% in some elderly syncope cohorts, so I should keep a low threshold for carotid sinus massage in patients over 40 with compatible presentations [^c0fdb772] [^4b97a78b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benignity; I need to check prognostic nuances. Although reflex syncope is generally benign, recurrence is common and can be predicted by prior frequency; in the POST dataset, patients with at least one syncope in the prior year had a 40% likelihood of recurrence versus 7% if none in the prior year, and meta-analytic data show high spontaneous remission after evaluation, especially in observational cohorts, which helps frame counseling and the threshold for therapy [^9e9b73cd] [^c75c2419]. I should confirm that mechanism-specific therapy is now emphasized: counter-pressure maneuvers and education are first-line; for refractory cases, fludrocortisone or midodrine target the hypotensive phenotype, while pacing is reserved for documented bradycardia/asystole in the cardioinhibitory phenotype, aligning with contemporary reviews and guidelines [^192cb1d8] [^4e931ceb].

> Next, I should review cardiac syncope, which carries the highest risk. Arrhythmic causes include bradyarrhythmias such as sinus node dysfunction, AV block, and device malfunction, and tachyarrhythmias including SVT, VT, and inherited arrhythmia syndromes like LQTS, Brugada, CPVT, and ARVC; I need to ensure I ask about exertional syncope, family history of premature SCD, and medication exposures that prolong QT or cause bradycardia [^c56ba33f] [^b16b87d8]. Structural causes include severe aortic stenosis, HOCM, acute MI, pulmonary embolism, tamponade, and aortic dissection; syncope in these settings reflects inadequate cardiac output or obstruction, and management must treat the underlying disease, with ICD consideration in high-risk phenotypes such as HOCM or ischemic cardiomyopathy with ventricular arrhythmias [^75a8fc90] [^949fca16]. I should double-check that clinical features increasing the likelihood of cardiac syncope include older age, exertional or supine syncope, brief prodrome or sudden LOC, known heart disease, and abnormal ECG, which are repeatedly validated in systematic reviews and guidelines [^1a587b08] [^2430db72].

> Let me consider orthostatic hypotension carefully, because it is common and multifactorial. OH is defined by a sustained drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing, and prevalence rises with age from about 5% in those under 50 to 30% in those over 70; I should confirm medication contributors and volume status before labeling primary autonomic failure [^a5723d75]. Primary autonomic failure includes Parkinson disease, pure autonomic failure, and MSA, while secondary causes include diabetic neuropathy, amyloidosis, and renal failure; drug-induced OH is common with antihypertensives, diuretics, antidepressants, and dopaminergic agents, so a meticulous medication reconciliation is essential [^a5723d75]. Initial OH and delayed OH are variants that can be missed without timed measurements; I need to ensure I measure BP at 1, 3, and 10 minutes if suspicion remains high despite a normal 3-minute test, as recommended in autonomic testing frameworks [^notfound].

> I should confirm age-related patterns because they shift the differential. In children and adolescents, vasovagal syncope dominates, accounting for roughly 75% of cases, with breath-holding spells in toddlers and primary arrhythmias such as LQTS, CPVT, and WPW as key cardiac concerns; exertional syncope, family history of SCD, and abnormal ECG should trigger cardiology evaluation [^e00343cf] [^a12c755a]. In adults, vasovagal remains common, but cardiac and orthostatic etiologies rise with age; in older adults, carotid sinus syndrome, medication-induced OH, and arrhythmias are frequent, and up to 37% may remain unexplained despite appropriate evaluation, partly due to amnesia and absent prodromes [^c0fdb772] [^f8904dbb]. The lifetime incidence of syncope is about 40%, with a bimodal peak around 15–20 years and again after 70 years, reinforcing the need to tailor pretest probabilities by age [^b8d8ddd0].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation and diagnostic yield so I don't over-order tests. The cornerstone is a careful history, physical exam including orthostatic vitals, and a 12-lead ECG; this identifies the cause in roughly 23–50% of patients and enables risk stratification to decide on disposition and further testing [^4b97a78b] [^7396cc1d]. I need to check which historical features push probability toward cardiac versus noncardiac causes; exertional or supine syncope, brief prodrome, known heart disease, and abnormal ECG favor cardiac, whereas standing-only events, long prodrome with nausea/diaphoresis, and situational triggers favor reflex syncope, which is supported by guideline tables and validated clinical scores [^2430db72] [^1a587b08]. Routine labs and neuroimaging have low yield unless guided by specific suspicions; echocardiography is appropriate when structural heart disease is suspected, and ambulatory ECG monitoring or implantable loop recorders are reserved for unexplained cases with high-risk features or recurrent events [^7396cc1d] [^fb4c15b4].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or high risk? I should double-check for red flags that mandate expedited cardiac evaluation: syncope during exertion, supine syncope, family history of premature SCD, structural heart disease, abnormal ECG, or high-risk features on validated tools such as EGSYS or OESIL, which increase the likelihood of cardiac syncope and justify inpatient or accelerated workup [^1a587b08] [^7396cc1d]. In contrast, typical vasovagal syncope in a young person with normal ECG generally requires no further testing beyond education and trigger avoidance, though I should counsel on injury prevention and consider counter-pressure maneuvers if recurrent [^a49d5be2] [^4e931ceb].

> I need to ensure I integrate mechanism-specific treatment implications, because therapy hinges on the pathophysiology rather than the label alone. For reflex syncope, education, hydration, salt liberalization, and counter-pressure maneuvers are first-line; fludrocortisone or midodrine are reasonable for frequent hypotensive phenotypes, and pacing is reserved for documented cardioinhibitory asystole or prolonged pauses, ideally after establishing a mechanism with ambulatory monitoring or tilt testing when needed [^192cb1d8] [^4e931ceb]. For cardiac syncope, treatment targets the arrhythmia or structural disease: device therapy for bradyarrhythmias or malignant ventricular arrhythmias, catheter ablation for tachyarrhythmias, and definitive therapy for obstruction or ischemia; I should confirm that ICD indications follow disease-specific guidelines, particularly in HOCM and ischemic cardiomyopathy [^75a8fc90]. For orthostatic hypotension, remove offending drugs, treat volume depletion, and consider midodrine, droxidopa, or fludrocortisone in selected cases, tailoring to comorbidities and monitoring for supine hypertension [^a5723d75].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Most fainting is due to reflex mechanisms, especially vasovagal syncope, but cardiac causes, though less common, carry the highest risk and must be actively excluded when red flags are present; orthostatic hypotension is common in older adults and often multifactorial; and a focused history, exam, and ECG diagnose a substantial fraction of cases and guide safe disposition and selective testing, which is consistently endorsed by major guidelines and systematic reviews [^a55d4b08] [^7396cc1d] [^1a587b08]. I should emphasize that prognosis and recurrence risk vary by etiology, with cardiac syncope portending the highest 1-year mortality, whereas vasovagal syncope has high recurrence but low mortality; this risk framing should inform counseling and the threshold for intervention [^5509c18d] [^c75c2419].

Fainting (syncope) is most often due to **reflex syncope** (vasovagal, situational, or carotid sinus) [^a55d4b08], which is benign and triggered by pain, fear, standing, or specific actions [^e19ef66c] [^7cbd9a13]. Cardiac causes (arrhythmias, structural heart disease) are less common but carry higher risk and require urgent evaluation [^5509c18d] [^1a587b08]. Orthostatic hypotension is common in older adults, often from medications or autonomic failure [^a5723d75] [^c0fdb772]. Initial assessment with history, exam, and ECG identifies the cause in about half of cases [^4b97a78b]; further testing (tilt, Holter, echo) is guided by risk and recurrence [^6a8cfa38]. Management is cause-specific: reflex syncope uses education, hydration, salt, and counter-pressure maneuvers [^4e931ceb]; cardiac syncope may need pacing, ablation, or ICDs [^75a8fc90]; orthostatic hypotension requires medication review, hydration, and compression [^a5723d75].

## Classification of syncope

Syncope is classified into **three main categories** based on mechanism:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Reflex (neurally mediated) syncope | - Vasovagal (common faint) <br/> - Situational (cough, micturition, defecation, swallow) <br/> - Carotid sinus hypersensitivity [^c56ba33f] |
| Cardiac syncope | - Arrhythmias (brady/tachy) <br/> - Structural heart disease (aortic stenosis, HCM, MI) <br/> - Pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection [^c56ba33f] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | - Primary autonomic failure (Parkinson's, MSA) <br/> - Secondary (diabetes, amyloid) <br/> - Volume depletion, medications [^c56ba33f] |

## Common etiologies

### Reflex syncope

Reflex syncope is the **most common type**, accounting for ~60% of cases [^64683caa]. Vasovagal syncope is triggered by pain, fear, or prolonged standing and is often preceded by prodromal symptoms (nausea, diaphoresis, pallor) [^e19ef66c]. Situational syncope occurs with specific actions such as coughing, micturition, defecation, swallowing, or laughing [^7cbd9a13]. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is common in older adults, often triggered by neck movements or tight collars [^c0fdb772].

---

### Cardiac syncope

Cardiac syncope accounts for ~10–20% of cases and is associated with **higher mortality** [^5509c18d]. Arrhythmias include bradyarrhythmias (sinus node dysfunction, AV block) and tachyarrhythmias (VT, SVT, AF) [^c56ba33f]. Structural heart disease includes aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism [^c56ba33f].

---

### Orthostatic hypotension

Orthostatic hypotension is common in older adults and accounts for ~10–20% of cases [^notfound]. Primary autonomic failure includes Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure [^c56ba33f]. Secondary causes include diabetes, amyloidosis, and medications (antihypertensives, diuretics, antidepressants) [^c56ba33f].

---

## Age-related differences

- **Children and adolescents**: Reflex syncope (vasovagal, situational) is most common; cardiac causes are rare but include congenital heart disease and arrhythmias [^e00343cf].
- **Adults**: Reflex syncope remains common; cardiac causes increase with age [^b8d8ddd0].
- **Elderly**: Orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and carotid sinus hypersensitivity are more frequent; polypharmacy is common [^c0fdb772].

---

## Diagnostic approach

The initial evaluation includes a **detailed history, physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and ECG**, which identify the cause in ~50% of cases [^4b97a78b]. Additional tests — such as tilt-table testing, ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and neurologic evaluation — are guided by clinical suspicion and risk stratification [^6a8cfa38].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Reflex syncope**: Education, hydration, salt intake, counter-pressure maneuvers, and avoidance of triggers [^4e931ceb].
- **Cardiac syncope**: Treat underlying arrhythmias or structural disease (pacemaker, ablation, ICD, surgery) [^75a8fc90].
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Medication review, hydration, compression stockings, and pharmacologic therapy (midodrine, fludrocortisone) [^a5723d75].

---

Fainting is most often due to **reflex syncope**, but cardiac and orthostatic causes must be excluded, especially in older adults or when red flags are present. A structured evaluation and cause-specific management reduce recurrence and improve outcomes [^7396cc1d].

Treatment of syncope — general principles: The principal goals of treatment for patients with syncope are to prolong survival, limit physical injuries, and prevent recurrences. The importance and priority of these different goals are dependent on the cause of syncope; for example, in patients with VT causing syncope, the mortality risk is clearly predominant, while in patients with reflex syncope the prevention of recurrences and/or limitation of injuries. Knowledge of the cause of syncope has a key role in selection of treatment, and once the cause has been ascertained, the second goal is to assess the mechanism leading to syncope.

Syncope — structural cardiovascular disease mechanisms — Structural cardiovascular diseases can cause syncope when circulatory demands exceed the heart's ability to increase output, and syncope is of great concern when fixed or dynamic obstruction to left ventricular outflow is present. The faint may result from inadequate blood flow due to mechanical obstruction, but in several cases is not solely due to restricted cardiac output and may involve an inappropriate reflex, orthostatic hypotension, or arrhythmia (particularly atrial fibrillation), making mechanisms multifactorial. Recognizing the heart as the cause is justified to allow correction of the underlying structural disease when possible.

METHODS

Reporting of this SR is consistent with recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses as applicable to diagnostic accuracy reviews. We developed a protocol for the SR with input from methodologists with expertise in systematic reviews (A.W. R.S.) and a content expert (V.T.). We registered the protocol in PROSPERO, an international prospective registry of systematic reviews (registration ID: CRD42023428455).

Population–intervention–comparator–outcome question

The proposed PICO question is as follows: In patients 16 years of age or older who present to the ED with syncope for whom no underlying serious or life‐threatening condition is found during the index ED visit (population), are risk stratification tools (intervention), better than unstructured clinical judgment (i.e. usual care; comparison), for providing accurate prognosis and aiding disposition decision for outcomes within 30 days (outcome)?

Expert reference librarians designed and conducted a comprehensive literature search with input from one of the authors (R.S.). The search strategy incorporated medical subject headings and text words related to CDRs (clinical prediction guides, decision support techniques, algorithms, multivariate analyses, logistic models, risk assessment) and syncope (fainting, loss of consciousness, drop attack, near syncope). We searched the following databases: PubMed (1946 to June 2023), EMBASE (1946 to June 2023), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL; 1937 to June 2023), Wiley Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Wiley Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Wiley Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and.

For the gray literature search, we conducted bibliographic searches of abstracts presented at scientific meetings published in Academic Emergency Medicine, Annals of Emergency Medicine, Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine, Emergency Medicine Journal, European Journal of Emergency Medicine, Emergency Medicine Australasia, and African Journal of Emergency Medicine in English. We consulted syncope and CDR development experts for additional published or unpublished reports. Lastly, we reviewed the bibliographies of all retrieved articles to identify potentially relevant articles not identified in the electronic search strategy.

We uploaded citations into an SR software program (DistillerSR, Ottawa, ON, Canada), followed by full‐text screening. The PubMed (Ovid interface) search strategy is displayed in Appendix 1.

### Characteristics of syncope in Japan and the pacific rim [^4c7d0584]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

As is true in the Western world, syncope of cardiac and non-cardiac origin is one of the common clinical presentations in daily medical practice in Japan and Asia. However, the underlying disorders and social backgrounds associated with syncope may differ, from those encountered in Western countries, particularly in Japan. While non-cardiac causes, neurally-mediated reflex faints in particular, are highly prevalent, out-of-hospital deaths by drowning due to syncope occurring during bathing at home are not rare in Japan, particularly in the elderly. Other underlying cardiac or non-cardiac disorders are also noteworthy, particularly Brugada syndrome and coronary vasospasm, which may present as isolated syncope. In addition, the characteristic clinical presentation of micturition and defecation syncope is not uncommon. This review is focused on these specific underlying diseases in the light of the guidelines issued by the Japanese Circulation Society regarding the diagnosis and treatment of syncope.

### Syncope: therapeutic approaches [^8eb1cbdf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common clinical problem characterized by transient, spontaneously self-terminating loss of consciousness with complete and prompt recovery; the cause is insufficiency of cerebral oxygen/nutrient supply most often due to a transient fall of systemic arterial pressure to levels below those tolerated by cerebrovascular autoregulation. Careful and thorough evaluation of the cause of syncope is warranted in all patients. Determining that certain individuals are at "low mortality risk" is inadequate; syncope, although often benign from a mortality perspective, tends to recur, is associated with risk of physical injury, diminishes quality-of-life, and might lead to restriction from employment or avocation. However, the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of syncope is challenging for many reasons. First, syncope is only 1 of many causes of transient loss of consciousness. Second, the patient's symptoms are fleeting, and the patient is generally fully recovered when seen in the clinic; only infrequently are there helpful physical findings. Third, spontaneous events are often unwitnessed by medical professionals; consequently, the medical history of symptom events is usually a "second-hand" or "third-hand" story. Finally, there is often an excessive sense of diagnostic "urgency" that tends to result in a rush to undertake multiple poorly considered "diagnostic" testing procedures; a deliberate approach based on initial risk stratification is more likely to reap the dual rewards of a correct diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment in a cost-effective manner.

### Trauma and syncope: looking beyond the injury [^ff2a56e8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Causes of syncope

There are several different causes of TLoC as shown in figure 1. Some are benign and others, such as cardiac syncope, are associated with a greater mortality. It is therefore important to recognize the potential cause of the fall for risk stratification and management. The role of the trauma team is to stabilize and refer onward or safely discharge the patient with suspected syncope. After stabilization, the question trauma teams must answer is: was this fall due to a TLoC and what was the cause?

Figure 1
Classifications of TLoC and syncope. TLoC can be broadly categorized into a traumatic and non-traumatic loss of consciousness, with non-traumatic further subdivided into four groups: syncope, psychogenic pseudo-syncope, epileptic seizures, and rare miscellaneous causes. Syncope is categorized into four types: reflex, cardiac, orthostatic hypotension, and unexplained syncope. Their relative mean frequencies are stated.TLoC, transient loss of consciousness.

Syncope is probable where TLoC occurs with features present that are indicative of reflex syncope, cardiac syncope, or orthostatic hypotension (OH)-induced syncope (table 1), without any features suggestive of non-syncopal causes (table 2). A review of major research publications describing syncope in 5248 patients identified the mechanism as 59.3% reflex syncope, 10.4% cardiac syncope, 9.1% syncope due to OH, and 11.3% remained unexplained syncope.

Table 1
Causes of syncope

Table 2
Non-syncopal conditions presenting with collapse

Reflex syncope occurs when a neural trigger causes vasodilation and/or bradycardia when activated inducing cerebral hypoperfusion. Vasovagal syncope, or fainting in common parlance, is the most common form of reflex syncope and is associated with diaphoresis, nausea, pallor, and warmth after upright posture or emotional triggers. Reflex syncope also includes situational syncope, which is a faint triggered in a specific situation including micturition, coughing, sneezing, defecation, laughing, swallowing, or stretching. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity can induce carotid sinus syndrome and is rare under the age of 40. This is a condition where the blood pressure sensing system in the carotid arteries becomes oversensitive and induces a significant and inappropriate bradycardia and/or hypotension with carotid pressure. Major trauma is more frequently associated with carotid sinus syndrome (24.3%) than other syncope types (2.2–7.9%) presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — Management of specific conditions notes that although potential causes of syncope are multiple, a treatment decision is usually fairly straightforward for patients with cardiac causes of syncope or orthostatic causes. VVS is the most common cause of syncope in the general population, yet treatment remains challenging in patients who have recurrences despite conservative therapy. Studies are needed to differentiate "arrhythmic syncope" versus "nonarrhythmic syncope" versus "aborted SCD" in patients with inheritable arrhythmic conditions, prospectively designed multicenter or national registries are needed to gather clinical information from patients with reflex syncope to better our understanding on other associated conditions, plausible mechanisms, effectiveness of therapeutic interventions, and natural history of these uncommon conditions, and RCTs are needed to continue the identification of effective treatment approaches to patients with recurrent reflex syncope.

### A guide to disorders causing transient loss of consciousness: focus on syncope [^1d50c5aa]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Episodes of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) events pose diagnostic difficulties, as the causes are diverse, carry vastly different risks, and span various specialties. An inconsistent terminology contributes to the confusion. Here, we present a classification scheme for TLOC, based on ongoing multidisciplinary efforts including those of the Task Force on Syncope of the European Society of Cardiology. We also discuss the pathophysiology of TLOC and the key clinical features that aid diagnosis. TLOC is defined as an apparent loss of consciousness with an abrupt onset, a short duration, and a spontaneous and complete recovery. Syncope is defined as TLOC due to cerebral hypoperfusion, and is divided into reflex syncope (synonymous with neurally mediated syncope), syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac syncope (arrhythmic or associated with structural cardiac disease). The other major groups of TLOC are generalized epileptic seizures, functional TLOC (psychogenic TLOC mimicking either epilepsy or syncope), and a further group of miscellaneous disorders. The management of patients who experience TLOC requires the recognition of the defining features of each of the major groups, and cooperation between different clinical specialties.

### New insights in diagnostics and therapies in syncope: a novel approach to non-cardiac syncope [^192cb1d8]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

This article aims to give advice on how to identify and manage patients with syncope who are at risk of severe outcomes, that is, at risk of trauma, potentially life-threatening episodes or frequent recurrences reducing quality of life. The first step of syncope diagnostic assessment is to identify patients with cardiac syncope, and once established, these patients must receive the adequate mechanism-specific treatment. If cardiac syncope is unlikely, reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and orthostatic hypotension are the most frequent causes of transient loss of consciousness. For these presentations, efficacy of therapy is largely determined by the mechanism of syncope rather than its aetiology or clinical features. The identified mechanism of syncope should be carefully assessed and assigned either to hypotensive or bradycardic phenotype, which will determine the choice of therapy (counteracting hypotension or counteracting bradycardia). The results of recent trials indicate that 'mechanism-specific therapy' is highly effective in preventing recurrences. Established mechanism-specific treatment strategies include withdrawal of hypotensive drugs, applying fludrocortisone and midodrine for the hypotensive phenotype and cardiac pacing in the bradycardic phenotype.

Syncope, a form of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) followed by rapid, complete recovery, remains a consequential medical problem. Current guidelines, stress the importance of distinguishing syncope from other forms of TLOC and altered states of consciousness including head trauma, seizures, drug overdoses, and psychogenic or metabolic causes (Figure 1). Once syncope is suspected, identifying the mechanism and cause are crucial for further management. However, reliance on history, physical examination, and clinical acumen may not be enough. The history from patient recollection and observations from witnesses, if present, may be difficult to interpret.

Syncope in the Context of Transient Loss of Consciousness

Adapted from the 2018 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Syncope.TIA = transient ischemic attack; TLOC = transient loss of consciousness.

A spectrum of causal and associated conditions, ranging from benign vasovagal faints to life-threatening arrhythmias and other cardiopulmonary conditions, further complicate assessment. Up to 10% of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with syncope will have serious outcomes over the short-term; identifying that high-risk population remains a primary focus. Age is a nonspecific discriminator. Older individuals may simply be at risk from concomitant, unrelated, and life-threatening conditions even if syncope itself is benign. Occasional younger individuals are at a continued risk of life-threatening collapse.ED physicians, therefore, face substantial dilemmas in risk stratification and triage, particularly for those at "intermediate risk".,

Syncope risk scores were developed to help provide a uniform methodology to help risk stratify patients with syncope. The syncope risk calculators that have been developed (Supplemental Appendix) are not clearly better than good clinical assessment. These tools have not definitively improved guidance in predicting short- and intermediate-term risk (Figure 2) of serious outcomes. Further, these risk scores are not designed to determine diagnosis, risk of recurrence, or benefit of hospitalization. Indeed, these decision rules predict outcomes based on comorbidities rather than syncope itself. American and European guidelines give Class IIb recommendations for these tools.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Syncope — core definitions and classification terms are provided as follows: Syncope is a symptom with an abrupt, transient, complete loss of consciousness associated with inability to maintain postural tone and with rapid and spontaneous recovery; the presumed mechanism is cerebral hypoperfusion and there should not be clinical features of other nonsyncope causes of loss of consciousness. Loss of consciousness is a cognitive state in which one lacks awareness of oneself and one's situation, with an inability to respond to stimuli. Transient loss of consciousness can be divided into syncope and nonsyncope conditions, with syncope presumed due to cerebral hypoperfusion and nonsyncope conditions attributed to different mechanisms. Presyncope (near-syncope) includes symptoms before syncope such as lightheadedness; visual sensations like "tunnel vision" or "graying out"; and variable degrees of altered consciousness without complete loss of consciousness, and presyncope could progress to syncope or abort without syncope. Unexplained syncope is syncope for which a cause is undetermined after an initial evaluation deemed appropriate by the experienced healthcare provider and includes but is not limited to a thorough history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG).

### Cough syncope [^a1dee150]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Loss of consciousness following cough was first described in 1876 as "laryngeal vertigo" Since then, several hundred cases of what is now most commonly termed cough syncope have been reported, often in association with various medical conditions. Some early authors assumed this entity to be a form of epilepsy, but by the mid-20th century, general consensus reflected that post-tussive syncope was a consequence of markedly elevated intrathoracic pressures induced by coughing. A typical profile of the cough syncope patient emerging from the literature is that of a middle-aged, large-framed or overweight male with obstructive airways disease. Presumably, such an individual would be more likely to generate the extremely high intrathoracic pressures associated with cough-induced fainting. The precise mechanism of cough syncope remains a matter of debate. Theories proposed include various consequences of the marked elevation of intrathoracic pressures induced by coughing: diminished cardiac output causing decreased systemic blood pressure and, consequently, cerebral hypoperfusion; increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure causing increased extravascular pressure around cranial vessels, resulting in diminished brain perfusion; or, a cerebral concussion-like effect from a rapid rise in CSF pressure. More recent mechanistic studies suggest a neurally mediated reflex vasodepressor-bradycardia response to cough. Since loss of consciousness is a direct and immediate result of cough, elimination of cough will eliminate the resultant syncopal episodes. Thus, the approach to the patient with cough syncope requires thorough evaluation and treatment of potential underlying causes of cough, as summarized in several recently published cough management guidelines.

### Autonomic function testing: an important diagnostic test for patients with syncope [^109b15bd]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common problem with a large differential diagnosis. The initial history and physical examination often provide initial clues; however, some cases warrant further testing to determine the underlying cause. Autonomic function testing is a safe way to evaluate patients with syncope further, and to assess their parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Autonomic testing can help to diagnose several conditions, including orthostatic hypotension, delayed orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome and neutrally mediated syncope. Thus, when the cause of syncope is unclear, autonomic testing can help to assess the autonomic nervous system, stratify the risk of future episodes and to guide treatment decisions.

### Syncope risk assessment in the emergency department and clinic [^00d8966a]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of patients who present with presumed syncope is challenging. Syncope has many possible causes ranging from relatively benign to potentially life-threatening, and sorting through the possibilities may not be feasible given time limitations in an urgent care setting. Therefore, the physician almost always must determine whether the affected individual needs in-hospital evaluation or can be safely referred to an outpatient syncope evaluation clinic. In instances when the etiology of syncope has been diagnosed with confidence at the initial clinical evaluation, the hospitalization question is readily addressed and the appropriateness of hospitalization versus timely outpatient evaluation (preferably in a dedicated syncope management clinic) is clear. In those cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, risk stratification schemes such as those summarized in this communication become more essential. However, at present no single risk assessment protocol appears to be satisfactory for universal application. The development of a consensus recommendation is an essential next step.

### ACC / AHA / HRS versus ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Syncope: JACC guideline comparison [^3d47bb61]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Syncope is a commonly encountered and challenging problem in medical practice. Presentations are variable, and the causal mechanism often remains elusive even after extensive (and often expensive) evaluation. Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to help guide the multidisciplinary approach necessary to diagnose and manage the broad spectrum of patients presenting with syncope. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society, published its first syncope guidelines in 2017. The European Society of Cardiology released the fourth iteration of its syncope guidelines in 2018. This review highlights the differences and congruencies between the 2 sets of recommendations, their implications for clinical practice, the remaining gaps in understanding, and areas of future research.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) clinical manifestations — The first clinical episode often manifests in the first or second decade of life and is usually prompted by physical activity or emotional stress.

### Syncope diagnostic scores [^be260cca]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of syncope poses unique challenges. Syncope has multiple etiologies, with most carrying benign prognoses, and a few less common causes carrying a risk of serious morbidity or death. The history at first glance carries few clues. Faced with this many patients are heavily investigated with tests known to be both useless and expensive. For these reasons considerable emphasis has been placed on developing evidence-based and quantitative histories that might distinguish among the main causes of syncope. Quantitative histories were first developed in populations of several hundred patients with definite diagnoses of various losses of consciousness. Their derivation and use mirror those of experienced clinicians. The first score - the Calgary Syncope Seizures Score - discriminates between epileptic convulsions and syncope with a sensitivity and specificity of about 94%. The second score, the Calgary Syncope Score for normal hearts, discriminates between vasovagal syncope and other causes of syncope with a sensitivity and specificity of about 90%. The third score, the Calgary Syncope Score for Structural Heart Disease, diagnoses ventricular tachycardia with 98% sensitivity and 71% specificity. It also accurately predicts serious arrhythmic outcomes and all cause death. Gaps in the accuracy of the second score have been identified and are being addressed. These scores are proving useful in the clinic, and as entry criteria for observation studies, genetic studies, and randomized clinical trials. A very simple score predicts vasovagal syncope recurrences, based on the number of faints in the preceding year. Work from several centres indicates that scores will distinguish among competing causes of syncope in select populations, such as those with bifascicular heart block, Brugada syndrome, and Long QT syndrome.

### Orthostatic hypotension: epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment [^a5723d75]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cardiovascular disorder, with or without signs of underlying neurodegenerative disease. OH is diagnosed on the basis of an orthostatic challenge and implies a persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20/10 mm Hg upon standing. Its prevalence is age dependent, ranging from 5% in patients < 50 years of age to 30% in those > 70 years of age. OH may complicate treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease; cause disabling symptoms, faints, and traumatic injuries; and substantially reduce quality of life. Despite being largely asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, the presence of OH independently increases mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. In this review, we outline the etiology and prevalence of OH in the general population, summarize its relationship with morbidity and mortality, propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, and delineate current challenges and future perspectives.

### Falls, faints, fits and funny turns [^50b1ddd5]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

In this practically oriented review, we will outline the clinical approach of patients with falls due to an impairment or loss of consciousness. Following a set of definitions, we describe the salient clinical features of disorders leading to such falls. Among falls caused by true loss of consciousness, we separate the clinical characteristics of syncopal falls (due to reflex syncope, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension or cardiac syncope) from falls due to other causes of transient unconsciousness, such as seizures. With respect to falls caused by an apparent loss of consciousness, we discuss the presentation of cataplexy, drop attacks, and psychogenic falls. Particular emphasis will be laid upon crucial features obtained by history taking for distinguishing between the various conditions that cause or mimic a transient loss of consciousness.

### Fainting Fanconi syndrome clarified by proxy: a case report [^1e1b1d1a]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rare diseases may elude diagnosis due to unfamiliarity of the treating physicians with the specific disorder. Yet, advances in genetics have tremendously enhanced our ability to establish specific and sometimes surprising diagnoses.

Case Presentation

We report a case of renal Fanconi syndrome associated with intermittent hypoglycemic episodes, the specific cause for which remained elusive for over 30 years, despite numerous investigations, including three kidney and one liver biopsy. The most recent kidney biopsy showed dysmorphic mitochondria, suggesting a mitochondrial disorder. When her son presented with hypoglycemia in the neonatal period, he underwent routine genetic testing for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, which revealed a specific mutation in HNF4A. Subsequent testing of the mother confirmed the diagnosis also in her.

Conclusion

Modern sequencing technologies that test multiple genes simultaneously enable specific diagnoses, even if the underlying disorder was not clinically suspected. The finding of mitochondrial dysmorphology provides a potential clue for the mechanism, by which the identified mutation causes renal Fanconi syndrome.

Vasovagal syncope — epidemiology and outcomes — emergency department cohorts generally feature older patients with mean ages around 60–65 years, and approximately 35% of patients with syncope remain undiagnosed. Approximately 30%–50% of patients with syncope are diagnosed with an autonomically mediated form, most of which are vasovagal. The overall 1-year recurrence rate is approximately 25%–35%, and this rate can be predicted by the number of syncopes in the year prior to assessment. Most patients stop fainting after assessment and in the absence of specific therapy.

Syncope in the elderly — causes and assessment: The most common causes of syncope in the elderly are orthostatic hypotension (OH), reflex syncope, especially carotid sinus syndrome (CSS), and cardiac arrhythmias, and different forms may co-exist in one patient, complicating diagnosis. Polypharmacy is frequent and relevant to evaluation: "One-third of individuals over 65 years are taking three or more prescribed medications, which may cause or contribute to syncope", and "Medication history should include the time relationship with onset of syncope". Cognitive issues and witness availability affect history quality: "Cognitive impairment is present in 5% of 65 year olds and 20% of 80 year olds", and "it is important to pursue a witness account of episodes, although this is not available in up to 60% of cases". Examination priorities are specified: "Evaluation of neurological and locomotor systems, including observation of gait and balance, is useful. If cognitive impairment is suspected, the Mini–Mental State Examination should be performed". Etiologic frequencies include: "Cardioinhibitory CSS is the recognized cause of symptoms in up to 20% of elderly patients with syncope. CSH of predominantly vasodepressor form is equally prevalent, but its potential role in syncope is much less clear".

### Diagnosis and evaluation of syncope in the emergency department [^48c3b0d2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

With a careful history, physical examination, and directed investigation, physicians can determine the likely cause of syncope in more than 50% and perhaps up to 80% of patients. Understanding the cause of syncope allows clinicians to determine the disposition of high- and low-risk patients. Patients with a potential malignant cause, such as a cardiac or neurologic condition, should be treated and admitted. Those with benign causes can be safely discharged. This article reviews the diagnosis and ED work-up of syncope, the different classifications of syncope, and prognosis. The use of specific decision rules in risk stratification and syncope in the pediatric population are discussed in another article.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) overview — pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment context are summarized as follows: VVS is the most common cause of syncope and a frequent reason for emergency department (ED) visits; it results from a reflex causing hypotension and bradycardia, is typically associated with a prodrome, and is generally benign with frequent remissions. Medical treatment is usually not required unless conservative measures are unsatisfactory, although effective treatment may be needed because events may cause injury and impaired quality of life; evidence-based therapeutic options are limited, and preliminary data for cardiac ganglia plexi ablation are encouraging but insufficient for recommendations, with an algorithm referenced for treatment of VVS.

### Improvements in orthostatic tolerance with exercise are augmented by heat acclimation: a randomized controlled trial [^a69ccf1d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

No prior study has, to our knowledge, attempted a randomized controlled trial to investigate mechanisms underlying improved orthostatism by HA, nor has a benefit to OT been quantified or mechanistically explored. This study confirms and builds on historical studies performed in the 1970s by Shvartz et al. The initial study demonstrated reduced fainting during a 20-min TT at 24°C and 40°C in 11 subjects during summer compared with winter. This nonrandomized, nonblinded protocol is susceptible to confounding factors that could explain decreased fainting in summer than winter e.g. performing more exercise in summer months or increasing salt intake. Relative humidity was not controlled for during TT and varied seasonally. Mechanistic interpretations were limited and while a 10-min bicycle ergometer was performed after each test this did not reveal significant differences between seasons in HR measured in only in the final minute of the test. A further study was performed by Shvartz et al. to determine the relationship of heat orthostatism and HA in 18 Bantu males randomly split into three groups of six participants. The complex 10-d experimental protocol involved two TT performed either side of an exposure. Group A worked in the heat with the first TT in 21°C and second TT performed "in heat". Group B worked at room temperature and were tilted at room temperature. Group C rested in the heat but were tilted as per group A. Only one fainting episode occurred in group B with no fainting episodes in group C. Group A showed a reduction (without significance testing) in fainting over the 9 d. On day 10, groups B and C underwent the same protocol as group A. Here there were five fainting episodes in group C and one fainting episode in group B. This was despite group C demonstrating decreases in rectal temperature. This would somewhat suggest that it was exercise rather than heat acclimatization that was the most causative factor in improving OT. Group A may have seen a reduction in TT-induced syncope by tilt-training. A further study by Shvartz et al. assessed OT, this time using an active stand test, 20 min before exercise, after 60 min of exercise with a 40-W load, after 15 min of exercise at an 80 W load, and after 3 h of exercise with a 40 W load in 39.4°C, in 12 trained and 16 untrained young males. Eight of the untrained subjects were retested in the five orthostatic tests after 8 d of HA. The number of fainting participants in the orthostatic tests administered before exercise, after exercise at 40 W and 80 W, and after exercise in heat, were 3, 4, 6, and 13, respectively. The trained subjects were less likely to faint than untrained (10% vs 25% respectively) in pooled analysis. HA improved tolerance to fainting in the untrained but it is again difficult to ascertain whether there was a training effect. Furthermore, in many of these studies the orthostatic testing was performed post exercise. In the postexercise phase, the widespread vasodilation and consequent reduced TPR in conjunction with loss of the muscle pump can result in postexercise hypotension and collapse. However, numerous other factors such as heat, dehydration and potentially participant muscle mass also play a role. Indeed, there is data to indicate that exercise in the heat, regardless of acclimation status, causes profound postexercise hypotensive responses despite orthostatic responses improving with HA.

Prognosis — risk of death and life‑threatening events states that structural heart disease and primary electrical disease are major risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and overall mortality in patients with syncope; orthostatic hypotension (OH) is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of death compared with the general population; young patients in whom structural or electrical heart disease have been excluded and who are affected by reflex syncope have an excellent prognosis; most deaths and many poor outcomes seem related to the severity of the underlying disease rather than to syncope per se; and several clinical factors able to predict outcome have been identified in some prospective population studies involving a validation cohort.

Syncope — management of specific conditions highlights that VVS is the most common cause of syncope in the general population and that treatment remains challenging in patients who have recurrences despite conservative therapy. Studies are needed to differentiate "arrhythmic syncope" versus "nonarrhythmic syncope" versus "aborted SCD" in patients with inheritable arrhythmic conditions, prospectively designed multicenter or national registries are needed to gather clinical information from patients with reflex syncope to better our understanding on other associated conditions, plausible mechanisms, effectiveness of therapeutic interventions, and natural history of these uncommon conditions, and RCTs are needed to continue the identification of effective treatment approaches to patients with recurrent reflex syncope.

### Early and late-onset syncope: insight into mechanisms [^b8d8ddd0]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Syncope is a common clinical problem, with ∼40% of the population experiencing at least one episode in their lifetime. The most common cause is vasovagal syncope (VVS), followed by orthostatic hypotension (OH) and cardiac syncope. The head-up tilt (HUT) test is used in clinical practice for diagnosing hypotensive susceptibility to vasovagal reflex and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction as syncope aetiology.

Epidemiological studies indicate that syncope has a bimodal incidence through life with peaks at 15–20 and > 70 years. The incidence of syncope rises steeply after 70 years. Syncope aetiology differs with age. In the young, most cases are due to VVS, while cardiac syncope, OH, and effects of medications become more common in old age. Syncope in older patients is a diagnostic challenge as they tend to have short or absent prodromes and may present with falls where amnesia for the event conceals loss of consciousness. Data point to increased mortality and cardiovascular morbidity following unexplained syncope.

To establish effective diagnostic approaches for syncope, the causes in different age groups and factors associated with the final diagnosis need elucidation. One such factor is the age at which patients experience syncope for the first time. Only a few studies, focused on young adults or patients with an established VVS diagnosis, report the age at first syncope. It is unclear whether the age at first syncope impacts the results of syncope investigation.

The aim of the present study was to ascertain if the bimodal epidemiological pattern pertains to a large sample of unexplained syncope patients investigated in a specialized syncope unit and to study the influence of early-onset vs. late-onset syncope on clinical characteristics and final HUT diagnosis in this population.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — athletes with syncope: Syncope occurring in the athlete is predominantly of vasovagal origin, but underlying cardiac conditions may place athletes at undue risk for adverse events, and syncope during exercise is associated with increased probability of cardiac causes; a thorough history distinguishing during-exercise from post-exercise events with features of dehydration or VVS is critically important. The definition of an athlete is imprecise, but may be someone who engages in routine vigorous training (eg, > 150 minutes per week) and is skilled in activities requiring strength, agility, or stamina. The current evidence base is insufficient to support general screening with electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiography at baseline. Performance-enhancing agents, such as somatotropic compounds and amphetamine-like stimulants, are associated with precipitous collapse; a careful history is required to rule out exposure, and before drugs are prescribed to highly competitive athletes, it is prudent to determine whether the drug or its metabolites are on lists of banned substances.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope / collapse [^6a8cfa38]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence. The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander, since this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing. All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate. In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after initial evaluation and no further investigation is required. In the remaining, targeted use of additional investigations in the form of cardiac imaging, provocative testing and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield but also ensures efficient usage of limited health care resources.

### Syncope management unit: evolution of the concept and practice implementation [^417be60f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Syncope, a clinical syndrome, has many potential causes. The prognosis of a patient experiencing syncope varies from benign outcome to increased risk of mortality or sudden death, determined by the etiology of syncope and the presence of underlying disease. Because a definitive diagnosis often cannot be established immediately, hospital admission is frequently recommended as the "default" approach to ensure patient's safety and an expedited evaluation. Hospital care is costly while no studies have shown that clinical outcomes are improved by the in-patient practice approach. The syncope unit is an evolving practice model based on the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary team of physicians and allied staff with expertise in syncope management, working together and equipped with standard clinical tools could improve clinical outcomes. Preliminary data have demonstrated that a specialized syncope unit can improve diagnosis in a timely manner, reduce hospital admission and decrease the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests. In this review, models of syncope units in the emergency department, hospital and outpatient clinics from different practices in different countries are discussed. Similarities and differences of these syncope units are compared. Outcomes and endpoints from these studies are summarized. Developing a syncope unit with a standardized protocol applicable to most practice settings would be an ultimate goal for clinicians and investigators who have interest, expertise, and commitment to improve care for this large patient population.

### New concepts in the assessment of syncope [^a68c15da]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Significant progress has been made in the past 3 decades in our understanding of the various causes of loss of consciousness thanks to the publication of several important studies and guidelines. In particular, the recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide a reference standard for optimal quality service delivery. This paper gives the reader brief guidance on how to manage a patient with syncope, with reference to the above guidelines. Despite the progress made, the management of patients with syncope remains largely unsatisfactory because of the presence of a significant gap between knowledge and its application. Two new concepts aimed at filling that gap are currently under evaluation: syncope facilities with specialist backup and interactive decision-making software. Preliminary data have shown that a standardized syncope assessment, especially when coupled with interactive decision-making software, decreases admission rate and unnecessary testing and improves diagnostic yield, thus reducing cost per diagnosis. The long-term effects of such a new health care model on the rate of diagnosis and survival await future studies.

Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope definitions — syncope is defined as "a symptom that presents with an abrupt, transient, complete loss of consciousness, associated with inability to maintain postural tone, with rapid and spontaneous recovery" and "The presumed mechanism is cerebral hypoperfusion", with the caveat that "There should not be clinical features of other nonsyncope causes of loss of consciousness, such as seizure, antecedent head trauma, or apparent loss of consciousness (ie, pseudosyncope)". Loss of consciousness is "A cognitive state in which one lacks awareness of oneself and one's situation, with an inability to respond to stimuli". Transient loss of consciousness is "Self-limited loss of consciousness" that "can be divided into syncope and nonsyncope conditions", and nonsyncope examples include "seizures, hypoglycemia, metabolic conditions, drug or alcohol intoxication, and concussion due to head trauma", with mechanisms "attributed to different mechanisms". Presyncope (near-syncope) comprises "symptoms before syncope", including "extreme lightheadedness; visual sensations, such as 'tunnel vision' or 'graying out'; and variable degrees of altered consciousness without complete loss of consciousness", which "could progress to syncope, or it could abort without syncope". Unexplained syncope is "Syncope for which a cause is undetermined after an initial evaluation", where "The initial evaluation includes but is not limited to a thorough history, physical examination, and ECG". Orthostatic intolerance is "A syndrome consisting of a constellation of symptoms" on standing that "can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, OH, or syncope", and individuals "have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture".

### Trauma and syncope: looking beyond the injury [^d53ff2de]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Syncope is a common cause of trauma. There is insufficient published guidance and few validated tools for trauma teams to use in standardizing the investigation and management of syncope in the trauma setting. This review article seeks to provide a clear summary of the current syncope guidance relating to the trauma patient by exploring the harmful causes of syncopal falls that may be overlooked and discussing the optimal evaluation and safe management of these cases.

Falls are currently the leading mechanism of injury to major trauma patients, accounting for 39% of the major trauma in the UK with an estimated annual cost burden of £2.3 billion. Despite 29% to 36% of hospital attendees with syncope suffering concomitant physical injury, syncope is a neglected cause of trauma. Among elderly patients, 42% to 95% have no recollection of their loss of consciousness and can mistakenly attribute their syncope to an accidental or 'mechanical fall'. These incorrectly labeled mechanical falls can be mistakenly characterized as benign. This inappropriately obviates further investigation into potentially serious underlying health conditions. As such, there is growing evidence that all falls and near syncope should be investigated as for syncope.

### Mechanism of syncope: role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular autonomic function assessment [^7e5743a9]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Different types of transient loss of consciousness events are defined based on their pathophysiological features. The qualifying criterion for syncope is cerebral hypoperfusion that differentiates syncope from non-syncopal forms such as epileptic seizure or psychogenic pseudo syncope. In patients with a diagnosis of syncope, once a cardiac cause (such as primary intrinsic cardiac arrhythmias or structural flow obstruction) can be ruled out, autonomic neural mechanisms are involved in the genesis of non-cardiac forms. Autonomic (non-cardiac) syncope encompasses both reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and syncope due to orthostatic hypotension as described in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. Identifying the haemodynamic mechanism of autonomic syncope is the essential pre-requisite for a personalized treatment approach aiming at effectively preventing recurrences. The possible haemodynamic mechanisms underlying autonomic syncope include primary hypotension and asystole/bradycardia of extrinsic cause, corresponding to two different haemodynamic phenotypes, i.e. the hypotensive and bradycardic phenotypes. The choice of therapy — aiming at counteracting hypotension or bradycardia — depends on the detected syncope phenotype identified during the diagnostic work-up.

Autonomic syncope is a common event in the general population and a frequent reason for seeking medical attention, with a consequent impact on high healthcare costs. Moreover, in a significant proportion of patients, syncope might be disabling due to recurrent episodes and/or severe injuries, which may determine activity restriction and poor quality of life. In clinical practice, the diagnostic approach to syncope is very heterogeneous, with highly variable adherence to international guideline recommendations. The absence of a systematic approach incurs higher health and social care costs, unnecessary hospitalizations, and diagnostic procedures, while achieving low diagnostic rates and high rates of symptom recurrence. One of the barriers to widespread adherence to guideline protocols is the availability of many diagnostic tests, some of which are time-consuming, expensive, and not fully covered by public healthcare plans.

The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic efficacy of a two-step assessment that consisted of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and tilt-table short cardiovascular autonomic function assessment (SCAFA), a set of tests performed in a tilt test laboratory under beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring. The study hypothesis was that these two investigations, performed in sequence after the initial evaluation, offer a brief, easy-to-perform, and low-cost diagnostic work-up allowing for the identification of the haemodynamic mechanism of loss of consciousness in most of the patients with autonomic syncope.

Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and risk stratification — syncope: The initial evaluation of a patient presenting with T-LOC consists of "careful history, physical examination, including orthostatic BP measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG)". Based on these findings, additional examinations "may be performed", including "CSM in patients > 40 years", echocardiogram "when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause", "Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope", and "Orthostatic challenge (lying-to-standing orthostatic test and/or head-up tilt testing) when syncope is related to the standing position or there is a suspicion of a reflex mechanism"; "Other less specific tests such as neurological evaluation or blood tests are only indicated when there is suspicion of non-syncopal T-LOC". The initial evaluation "should answer three key questions" about whether the event is a syncopal episode, whether "the aetiological diagnosis" is determined, and whether "there are data suggestive of a high risk of cardiovascular events or death". For diagnosis of syncope, the following "should be answered": "Was LOC complete? Was LOC transient with rapid onset and short duration? Did the patient recover spontaneously, completely and without sequelae? Did the patient lose postural tone?" If all are positive there is a "high likelihood of being syncope"; if any are negative, "exclude other forms of LOC before proceeding with syncope evaluation". Initial evaluation "is able to define the cause of syncope in 23–50% of patients".

Pediatric syncope — epidemiology and distinguishing entities: By 18 years of age, it is estimated that 30% to 50% of children experience at least 1 fainting episode, and syncope accounts for 3% of all pediatric ED visits; the incidence is higher in females and peaks between 15 to 19 years of age. Neurally mediated syncope accounts for 75% of pediatric syncope, followed by psychogenic or unexplained syncope in 8% to 15% of cases. Breath‑holding spells are unique to pediatrics: cyanotic breath‑holding spells typically occur from age 6 months to age 5 years, whereas pallid breath‑holding spells are seen in the first 1 to 2 years of age, may be an early form of VVS, and the latter episodes are associated with significant bradycardia and prolonged asystole. Pediatric cardiac syncope may result from obstruction to blood flow, myocardial dysfunction, congenital coronary anomaly, post–Kawasaki disease, or primary arrhythmic etiologies including LQTS, CPVT, Brugada syndrome, ARVC, or Wolff‑Parkinson‑White syndrome; a detailed history and physical examination can guide practitioners in differentiating life‑threatening from more benign neurally mediated syncope, and a detailed family history focused on premature SCD in first‑ and second‑degree relatives is helpful. Interventions recommended for adults with similar conditions presenting with syncope can be applied in children.

Management of syncope in general practice emphasizes prevalence, bedside diagnosis, alarm features, and referral. "Syncope is a common phenomenon in general practice (figure 6)", and "Recurrent typical VVS is the most common diagnosis in this setting". Diagnosis "is based upon a carefully taken medical history and the context of the event", and "Most of these typical common faint can be diagnosed by the patient's general practitioner and need only reassurance". "An active search for alarming symptoms is recommended", namely "syncope during exertion, syncope in the lying position, absence of external factors, family history of SCD, or slow recovery from syncope (Tables 9 and 10)". If uncertainty and risk persist, "the patient should be referred to cardiologist, internist, neurologist, psychologist/psychiatrist as appropriate or to a specialized syncope facility if available".

### Pediatric syncope: a systematic review [^1be6588e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

As with any systematic review, there are limitations to this study. For example, many of the studies chosen did not provide information regarding patient follow-up. This could have not only been helpful but could have also potentially led to a difference in the number of cases attributed to unknown origin. In addition, this review chose studies that defined syncope as a "transient loss of consciousness (and postural tone)" or whose definitions were very similar to that. However, it is difficult to get a sense of what each study would have considered "transient", as many of the studies did not give an exact time constraint. Therefore, future studies should aim to provide a more robust follow-up of patients who have experienced syncope, especially when the cause is unknown, to determine whether the patient has repeat episodes, which could help clinicians determine the etiology. In addition, a more precise definition of syncope, giving an expected range of time, would be helpful in ensuring uniformity of future studies.

### Evaluation of syncope [^791f7f37]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Syncope is a transient and abrupt loss of consciousness with complete return to preexisting neurologic function. It is classified as neurally mediated (i.e., carotid sinus hypersensitivity, situational, or vasovagal), cardiac, orthostatic, or neurogenic. Older adults are more likely to have orthostatic, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or cardiac syncope, whereas younger adults are more likely to have vasovagal syncope. Common nonsyncopal syndromes with similar presentations include seizures, metabolic and psychogenic disorders, and acute intoxication. Patients presenting with syncope (other than neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope) are at increased risk of death from any cause. Useful clinical rules to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for immediate hospitalization include the San Francisco Syncope Rule and the Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department rule. Guidelines suggest an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of syncope that begins with the history and physical examination. All patients presenting with syncope require electrocardiography, orthostatic vital signs, and QT interval monitoring. Patients with cardiovascular disease, abnormal electrocardiography, or family history of sudden death, and those presenting with unexplained syncope should be hospitalized for further diagnostic evaluation. Patients with neurally mediated or orthostatic syncope usually require no additional testing. In cases of unexplained syncope, further testing such as echocardiography, grade exercise testing, electrocardiographic monitoring, and electrophysiologic studies may be required. Although a subset of patients will have unexplained syncope despite undergoing a comprehensive evaluation, those with multiple episodes compared with an isolated event are more likely to have a serious underlying disorder.

### Bromocriptine mesylate [^8713262e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

During clinical trials, dizziness, drowsiness, faintness, fainting, and syncope have been reported early in the course of bromocriptine mesylate therapy. In postmarketing reports, bromocriptine mesylate has been associated with somnolence, and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. All patients receiving bromocriptine mesylate should be cautioned with regard to engaging in activities requiring rapid and precise responses, such as driving an automobile or operating machinery.

Patients being treated with bromocriptine mesylate and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be advised not to drive or engage in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g., operating machines).

Patients receiving bromocriptine mesylate for hyperprolactinemic states associated with macroadenoma or those who have had previous transsphenoidal surgery should be told to report any persistent watery nasal discharge to their physician. Patients receiving bromocriptine mesylate for treatment of a macroadenoma should be told that discontinuation of drug may be associated with rapid regrowth of the tumor and recurrence of their original symptoms.

Patients and their caregivers should be alerted to the possibility that patients may experience intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges and other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking bromocriptine mesylate. Advise patients and their caregivers to inform their healthcare provider if they develop new or increased uncontrolled spending, gambling urges, sexual urges, or other urges while being treated with bromocriptine mesylate [see PRECAUTIONS].

Especially during the first days of treatment, hypotensive reactions may occasionally occur and result in reduced alertness, particular care should be exercised when driving a vehicle or operating machinery.

Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they wish to discontinue bromocriptine mesylate or decrease the dose of bromocriptine mesylate. Advise patients who have been prescribed a lower dose or who have been withdrawn from the drug to notify their healthcare provider if they have withdrawal symptoms such as fever, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, sweating, or pain (see Precautions).

Syncope terminology — core definitions for syncope, loss of consciousness (LOC), transient LOC, presyncope, and unexplained syncope — are defined consistently as follows: Syncope is "a symptom that presents with an abrupt, transient, complete loss of consciousness, associated with inability to maintain postural tone, with rapid and spontaneous recovery" and "the presumed mechanism is cerebral hypoperfusion", while features of other causes such as seizure or apparent loss of consciousness (pseudosyncope) should be absent; LOC is "a cognitive state in which one lacks awareness of oneself and one's situation, with an inability to respond to stimuli"; transient LOC "can be divided into syncope and nonsyncope conditions" with examples including seizures, hypoglycemia, metabolic conditions, drug or alcohol intoxication, and concussion, and mechanisms differ; presyncope refers to prodromal symptoms (for example, extreme lightheadedness, "tunnel vision", "graying out") that may progress to syncope or abort; unexplained syncope is syncope "for which a cause is undetermined after an initial evaluation" including "a thorough history, physical examination, and ECG".

### Clinical classification of syncope [^64683caa]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Syncope is a presenting symptom, and in itself is not a diagnosis. An etiology or a mechanism must be sought in all cases. Currently, most clinicians classify syncope on clinical grounds by attempting to ascertain its etiology. They then use this classification to guide further management. Using this approach, reflex syncope is the most common form of syncope, occurring in approximately 60% of syncope presentations. Orthostatic hypotension presents in around 15% with arrhythmic syncope in 10% and structural heart disease as the cause of syncope in 5%; in 10% of patients no diagnosis is made. An alternative classification system uses the mechanism of syncope derived from an implanted ECG loop recorder (ILR). While this approach may be of value for optimizing therapy, it cannot be considered as the primary classification since ILRs are not typically implanted early in the evaluation process of most patients. ILRs are usually placed after "risk stratification" in those deemed not to be at high risk but remain in the uncertain etiology category. Furthermore, there exists, in current ILR technology, lack of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring capability. Thus, vasodilation leading to hypotension, the main trigger of cerebral hypoperfusion other than bradycardia, cannot be detected and is currently unavailable for use in a mechanistic-based classification. Thus, the etiological classification remains the basis for both risk stratification and subsequent clinical management.

### Risk-stratification tools for emergency department patients with syncope: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct evidence for SAEM GRACE [^fe4a0958]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Syncope accounts for about 1% of all emergency department (ED) visits. While the etiology is often benign, approximately 10% of patients have serious or life‐threatening causes that may not be apparent during the initial ED assessment. Identifying ED syncope patients with serious or life‐threatening causes and requiring further diagnostic evaluation and monitoring has been a significant challenge for emergency physicians. Frequently, expensive, unnecessary, and potentially harmful investigations are undertaken for fear of missing life‐threatening or otherwise serious underlying causes, particularly cardiogenic causes. Such overtesting often leads to prolonged hospitalization, and excessive resource utilization.

Investigators have developed clinical decision rules (CDRs) to try and predict adverse outcomes and risk stratify ED syncope patients to minimize unnecessary resource utilization.CDRs are tools designed to assist clinicians in making decisions at the bedside. They are derived from original research and incorporate important predictors of outcome from history, physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests.

The first‐ever systematic review and meta‐analysis (SRMA) to evaluate the methodological quality and prognostic accuracy of CDRs for ED patients with syncope reported limitations at outcome and study levels. A key limitation of the SR at the outcome level was the diversity of clinical and methodological aspects across studies. The SR study‐level limitations included the absence of an appropriate syncope reference test or criterion standard and differing syncope definitions across studies.

In the context of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM)'s Guidelines for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE) initiative, because syncope is a relatively common ED presentation with life‐threatening causes that may not be apparent in the ED, the current SR evaluates the direct evidence on the efficacy of CDRs to risk stratify ED syncope patients and predict adverse outcomes. Specifically, this SRMA aims to address the following question: in patients 16 years of age or older who present in the ED with syncope for whom no underlying serious or life‐threatening condition is found during the index ED visit, are risk stratification tools better than unstructured clinical judgment for providing accurate prognosis and aiding disposition decision for outcomes within 30 days?

### Drop attacks: a practical guide [^25c68b16]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

'Drop attacks' encompass both falls and transient loss of consciousness, but the term is not clearly defined. We offer our definition and explore the differential diagnoses. The most common causes are cardiovascular. We discuss clinical and electrographic criteria that suggest underlying arrhythmia or other serious cardiac disorders that require further investigation, and the potential diagnoses that may underlie these 'worrying syncopes'. Vestibular dysfunction also commonly causes collapses, sometimes without typical vertigo. These two common conditions may coexist especially in the elderly. Falls in elderly people often require assessment through a lens of frailty and multifactorial risk factors, rather than seeking a unitary diagnosis. Some drop attacks may be due to longstanding epilepsy and we discuss how to approach these cases. Functional neurological disorder is a common cause in younger people, for which there may also be clinical clues. We review the rarer causes of collapse that may be described as drop attacks, including cataplexy and hydrocephalic attacks.

### Did this patient have cardiac syncope? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^1a587b08]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Syncope can result from a reduction in cardiac output from serious cardiac conditions, such as arrhythmias or structural heart disease (cardiac syncope), or other causes, such as vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of studies of the accuracy of the clinical examination for identifying patients with cardiac syncope.

Study Selection

Studies of adults presenting to primary care, emergency departments, or referred to specialty clinics.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Relevant data were abstracted from articles in databases through April 9, 2019, and methodologic quality was assessed. Included studies had an independent comparison to a reference standard.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Eleven studies of cardiac syncope (N = 4317) were included. Age at first syncope of at least 35 years was associated with greater likelihood of cardiac syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 91% [95% CI, 85%-97%]; specificity, 72% [95% CI, 66%-78%]; LR, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.6–4.1]), while age younger than 35 years was associated with a lower likelihood (LR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.06–0.25]). A history of atrial fibrillation or flutter (n = 323; sensitivity, 13% [95% CI, 6%-20%]; specificity, 98% [95% CI, 96%-100%]; LR, 7.3 [95% CI, 2.4–22]), or known severe structural heart disease (n = 222; range of sensitivity, 35%-51%, range of specificity, 84%-93%; range of LR, 3.3–4.8; 2 studies) were associated with greater likelihood of cardiac syncope. Symptoms prior to syncope that were associated with lower likelihood of cardiac syncope were mood change or prodromal preoccupation with details (n = 323; sensitivity, 2% [95% CI, 0%-5%]; specificity, 76% [95% CI, 71%-81%]; LR, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.02–0.38]), feeling cold (n = 412; sensitivity, 2% [95% CI, 0%-5%]; specificity, 89% [95% CI, 85%-93%]; LR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.06–0.64]), or headache (n = 323; sensitivity, 3% [95% CI, 0%-7%]; specificity, 80% [95% CI, 75%-85%]; LR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.06–0.55]). Cyanosis witnessed during the episode was associated with higher likelihood of cardiac syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 8% [95% CI, 2%-14%]; specificity, 99% [95% CI, 98%-100%]; LR, 6.2 [95% CI, 1.6–24]). Mood changes after syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 3% [95% CI, 0%-7%]; specificity, 83% [95% CI, 78%-88%]; LR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06–0.65]) and inability to remember behavior prior to syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 5% [95% CI, 0%-9%]; specificity, 82% [95% CI, 77%-87%]; LR, 0.25, [95% CI, 0.09–0.69]) were associated with lower likelihood of cardiac syncope. Two studies prospectively validated the accuracy of the multivariable Evaluation of Guidelines in Syncope Study (EGSYS) score, which is based on 6 clinical variables. An EGSYS score of less than 3 was associated with lower likelihood of cardiac syncope (n = 456; range of sensitivity, 89%-91%, range of specificity, 69%-73%; range of LR, 0.12–0.17; 2 studies). Cardiac biomarkers show promising diagnostic accuracy for cardiac syncope, but diagnostic thresholds require validation.

Conclusions and Relevance

The clinical examination, including the electrocardiogram as part of multivariable scores, can accurately identify patients with and without cardiac syncope.

Syncope in paediatric patients — diagnosis, risk features, and management note that reflex syncope represents the vast majority of the aetiology, and in patients with a typical history of reflex syncope, normal physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) are usually sufficient to cease investigation. Tilt testing seems to have high false-negative and false-positive rates and should be used with caution for primary identification of patients with reflex syncope; a remarkably high incidence of near-fainting (40%) was reported during tilt testing after placement of a simple intravenous line in healthy children and teenagers, and in one study a shorter tilt test duration of 10 min at 60 or 70° showed a specificity > 85%. History features that should prompt cardiac evaluation include family history of premature SCD < 30 years or familial heart disease, known or suspected heart disease, syncope during exercise, syncope without prodrome, and syncope with chest pain or palpitations. For therapy, the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and tilt training for recurrent syncope is undetermined in the absence of well-designed paediatric trials, pacemakers should be avoided even in VVS with prolonged asystole due to the relatively transient and benign nature of the syndrome, and the cornerstone of therapy for young patients with reflex syncope includes education and reassurance.

### Early and late-onset syncope: insight into mechanisms [^c3a5be8c]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The first-ever syncope incidence in patients with unexplained syncope has a bimodal lifetime pattern with peaks at 15 and 70 years. The majority of older patients experience their first syncope when older and orthostatic hypotension and carotid sinus syndrome are more common in this group. In older patients with early-onset syncope, prodromes, vasovagal and complex syncope are more common. A detailed syncope history remains essential in elderly patients evaluated for syncope and impacts the final diagnosis.

### Will artificial intelligence be "Better" Than humans in the Management of syncope? [^3231de9e]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Variability in syncope symptom presentation, origin, end points, and risk factors, combined with absence of a specific diagnostic test and limited array of effective treatment options, complicates clinical decision-making and increases potential for physician errors. A correct etiological syncope diagnosis is crucial to determine accurate diagnostic and appropriate therapeutic pathways. It is essential during the diagnostic phase to explore only relevant secondary investigations, ensuring resources are used efficiently to minimize patient risks related to unnecessary hospitalizations and over-testing that may create harm. Moreover, clinicians should choose the most suitable treatment based on the etiology of the syncope. If syncope remains undiagnosed after the initial evaluation (ie, history, physical examination, ECG), it is imperative to undertake thorough risk assessment to promptly identify patients at high risk who might benefit from urgent treatment.

While several risk stratification tools and score systems have been developed, they have only partially achieved effective risk stratification. Notably, no studies compare different syncope prognostic tools (SPTs) directly, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the best recommendations. Few SPTs have undergone external validation. Since syncope-related morbidity and mortality is uncommon, limited size derivation studies are unlikely to include such patients, impacting SPT sensitivity when attempting validation. Furthermore, different SPTs focus on varying outcomes, for example, short- versus long-term adverse events. Existing syncope decision rules have not consistently demonstrated increased diagnostic accuracyor cost savings. Finally, performance of SPTs was not found superior to clinical judgment in syncope risk stratification. Therefore, there is need to properly address syncope's complex and interrelated features. ML, DL, and NLP might accomplish these aims by revealing hidden associations or unexplored patterns, thus improving diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, interpretation of laboratory or radiological tests, and personalized treatment compared to physicians.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

Syncope classification (Table 4) organizes causes into three principal groups: reflex (neurally-mediated) syncope including vasovagal forms mediated by emotional distress or by orthostatic stress, situational triggers such as cough, sneeze, gastrointestinal stimulation (swallow, defecation, visceral pain), micturition (post-micturition), post-exercise, post-prandial, others (e.g., laugh, brass instrument playing, weightlifting), plus carotid sinus syncope and atypical forms; syncope due to orthostatic hypotension from primary autonomic failure, secondary autonomic failure, drug-induced orthostatic hypotension, or volume depletion; and cardiac syncope (cardiovascular) due to arrhythmias — bradycardia from sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular conduction disease or implanted device malfunction, tachycardia that is supraventricular or ventricular — drug induced bradycardia and tachyarrhythmias, and structural disease including cardiac valvular disease and other causes such as pulmonary embolus, acute aortic dissection, and pulmonary hypertension.

### Fainting… [^c50e74cd]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Fainting, also known by the medical term syncope, is the temporary loss of consciousness, often accompanied by falling down or a strong urge to lie down, followed by spontaneous recovery. The most common reason for fainting is a temporary decrease in blood. flow to the brain. Except for the risk of physical injury from falling, fainting itself is often not a serious health problem. However, sometimes fainting can be a sign of a serious underlying disorder, so determining the cause is important. The September 8, 2004, issue of JAMA includes. an article about fainting after exercise. Causes of syncope Emotional stress Drop in blood pressure due to change in position or blood loss Heat or dehydration Arrhythmias Heart abnormalities An oversensitive region in an artery in the neck called the carotid artery Blood clots in the lung.

Common symptoms just before syncope Warmth Nausea Field of vision either whites out or blacks out Dizziness, lightheadedness Sweaty palms Diagnosing causes of syncope A physical examination and a careful history of what happens just before and during fainting are very important in determining the cause. Individuals. who faint often should be tested for abnormal heart rhythms using an electrocardiogram, a machine that records the electrical impulses of the heart. They generally should also be evaluated with an echocardiogram to see if there are abnormalities in the heart muscle or valves. In some cases, other tests. may be performed, such as a Holter monitor or a tilt test, in which blood pressure and heart rate are measured while the person is lying down on a table and again after the patient stands up or the table is tilted upright. Treatment Treatment for fainting depends on its underlying cause.

If no serious cause is found, the only interventions that may be necessary are avoiding situations that lead to fainting and protection from injury from falling. If a more serious cause is found, treatment is directed at the responsible condition. For more information.

### High remission rates in vasovagal syncope: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and randomized studies [^c75c2419]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to quantify the degree of improvement in vasovagal syncope after assessment and to identify predictive factors.

Background

No treatments for vasovagal syncope have been proved effective, but patients in all prospective studies appear to show a reduction in the likelihood of fainting.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of studies published from 1993 through 2013. Inclusion criteria were: 1) vasovagal syncope frequency in the preceding 1 to 2 years; and 2) the proportion of subjects with syncope in at least the first follow-up year. Random-effects methods were used.

Results

Of 338 screened studies, 17 were analyzed, with a mean of 112 subjects (range 9 to 511 subjects). In the preceding epoch, 97% of subjects fainted, with 2.6 ± 1.0 syncopal spells per year. In the follow-up year, the proportion of patients with ≥ 1 syncope recurrence was 677 of 1,912 (35.4%), and in the meta-analysis, the proportion of subjects fainting was only 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.46; p < 0.001). Subjects in larger studies were less likely to faint than those in randomized trials (relative risk: 0.35 vs. 0.55; p = 0.004). The probabilities of ≥ 1 syncope recurrence in the observational versus randomized studies were 0.30 (95% confidence interval: 0.24 to 0.37) and 0.54 (95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 0.62), respectively (p < 0.001). None of the degree of blinding, type of intervention, age, sex, and number of recent faints predicted the probability of syncope recurrence. Heterogeneity was very high in all analyses (I 2 = 60% to 96%).

Conclusions

The spontaneous remission rate in highly symptomatic syncope patients is high, and remission occurs in all types of studies. Improvement was more likely in larger and observational studies.

Reflex and other etiologies of syncope — definitions and key features — are outlined as: Reflex (neurally mediated) syncope is "syncope due to a reflex that causes vasodilation, bradycardia, or both"; vasovagal syncope (VVS) is "the most common form of reflex syncope" and "may occur with upright posture… or with exposure to emotional stress, pain, or medical settings", is "characterized by diaphoresis, warmth, nausea, and pallor", is "associated with vasodepressor hypotension and/or inappropriate bradycardia", and is "often followed by fatigue", with diagnosis primarily by history, exam, and eyewitness observation; carotid sinus syndrome is "reflex syncope associated with carotid sinus hypersensitivity", with hypersensitivity present when "a pause ≥ 3 s and/or a decrease of systolic pressure ≥ 50 mm Hg occurs upon stimulation of the carotid sinus"; situational syncope is "reflex syncope associated with a specific action, such as coughing, laughing, swallowing, micturition, or defecation"; cardiac (cardiovascular) syncope is "caused by bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypotension due to low cardiac index, blood flow obstruction, vasodilation, or acute vascular dissection"; noncardiac syncope is "due to noncardiac causes, which include reflex syncope, OH, volume depletion, dehydration, and blood loss".

### Research progress on situational syncope [^9a19623e]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Situational syncope refers to syncope that occurs in specific situations and is a special type of neurally mediated syncope. The etiologic composition of situational syncope varies between adults and children. In adults, it is more common during micturition and defecation, whereas in children, it is more frequently seen during flag-raising, micturition, and defecation. The clinical features and underlying mechanisms of various types of situational syncope also differ in terms of age and sex. The treatment of situational syncope mainly includes nonpharmacologic treatment, pharmacologic treatment, and surgical treatment. Adverse events related to situational syncope are rare, and the prognosis is generally good if there are no other systemic diseases. However, in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases, situational syncope can lead to serious cardiovascular adverse events.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® syncope [^fb4c15b4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Syncope and presyncope lead to well over one million emergency room visits in the United States each year. Elucidating the cause of syncope or presyncope, which are grouped together given similar etiologies and outcomes, can be exceedingly difficult given the diverse etiologies. This becomes more challenging as some causes, such as vasovagal syncope, are relatively innocuous while others, such as cardiac-related syncope, carry a significant increased risk of death. While the mainstay of syncope and presyncope assessment is a detailed history and physical examination, imaging can play a role in certain situations. In patients where a cardiovascular etiology is suspected based on the appropriate history, physical examination, and ECG findings, resting transthoracic echocardiography is usually considered appropriate for the initial imaging. While no imaging studies are considered usually appropriate when there is a low probability of cardiac or neurologic pathology, chest radiography may be appropriate in certain clinical situations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Syncope: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^7396cc1d]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Syncope is an abrupt and transient loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. It accounts for 1% to 1.5% of emergency department visits, resulting in high hospital admission rates and significant medical costs. Syncope is classified as neurally mediated, cardiac, and orthostatic hypotension. Neurally mediated syncope is the most common type and has a benign course, whereas cardiac syncope is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with presyncope have similar prognoses to those with syncope and should undergo a similar evaluation. A standardized approach to syncope evaluation reduces hospital admissions and medical costs, and increases diagnostic accuracy. The initial assessment for all patients presenting with syncope includes a detailed history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. The initial evaluation may diagnose up to 50% of patients and allows immediate short-term risk stratification. Laboratory testing and neuroimaging have a low diagnostic yield and should be ordered only if clinically indicated. Several comparable clinical decision rules can be used to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for hospital admission. Low-risk patients with a single episode of syncope can often be reassured with no further investigation. High-risk patients with cardiovascular or structural heart disease, history concerning for arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiographic findings, or severe comorbidities should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. In cases of unexplained syncope, provocative testing and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring strategies can be diagnostic. The treatment of neurally mediated and orthostatic hypotension syncope is largely supportive, although severe cases may require pharmacotherapy. Cardiac syncope may require cardiac device placement or ablation.

### Risk stratification… [^9c66a926]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Syncope is a sudden, brief, and transient loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. 1 Other nontraumatic loss of consciousness syndromes include seizures, cataplexy, metabolic disorders, acute intoxications, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, and psychogenic pseudosyncope. 2, 3. 4, 5 Approximately 40% of the U. S. population will experience a syncopal episode in their lifetimes, and 30% to 50% will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. 6, 7 The etiology is unexplained in up to one-third of cases.
8. Although syncope is associated with serious risks, short-term mortality is low. At one year, the mortality rate is 8. 4%; one-third of these are attributed to cardiovascular causes. Approximately 25% of patients with syncope will experience another event within two years.

8, 9 Historically, neurally mediated and orthostatic hypotension syncope have not conferred an increased risk of death 10; however, in a recent study, healthy adults with a diagnosis of syncope had higher rates of all-cause mortality, recurrent syncope, cardiovascular events, and pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement compared with matched controls.

### Key challenges in the current management of syncope [^2a685e0e]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Patients commonly present with syncope at emergency departments and other facilities for urgent care. Syncope is understood by physicians to be a transient, self-terminating period of cerebral hypoperfusion that usually results from systemic hypotension, and clinical guidelines for the care of patients with presumed syncope are available. However, the diagnosis and management of such patients continue to pose important diagnostic, therapeutic, and economic challenges, which are the focus of this Review. First, we discuss how to improve symptom characterization to distinguish syncope from other forms of transient loss of consciousness and syncope mimics. Second, we compare methods of risk stratification in patients with suspected syncope, and recommend the introduction of syncope clinics with enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration to optimize patient care at reduced expense. Third, we highlight the importance of the appropriate selection of diagnostic tools and treatment strategies in these syncope clinics. Finally, we address the difficulties associated with therapy for the most-common form of syncope — vasovagal or reflex syncope.

### AHA / ACCF statement on the evaluation of syncope… [^a3d98716]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

; however, 40 percent of syncopal episodes are unexplained even after a careful evaluation. Overall, the most common causes of syncope are neurocardiogenic, followed by primary arrhythmias. Causes of syncope also are highly associated with age: children and young adults are most likely to have neurocardiogenic syncope, psychiatric causes, or primary arrhythmic causes; middle-aged patients are most likely to have neurocardiogenic syncope; and older patients are more likely than younger patients to have syncope caused by obstructions to cardiac output. The thorough history of the patient with syncope should begin with the observations of onlookers. Tonicclonic, seizure-like activity is associated with neurologic and cardiac causes of syncope. Neurocardiogenic syncope often is associated with postepisode fatigue or weakness.

Prodromal symptoms are common with neurocardiogenic syncope, whereas the absence of a prodrome is associated with cardiac arrhythmia or a central neurodegenerative disorder. Auras, premonitions, postepisode confusion, or focal neurologic signs suggest a neurologic cause of syncope; however, syncope with focal neurologic signs also can be associated with basilar artery or severe carotid artery disease. In children, syncope with a normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram may be caused by breath-holding spells resulting from emotional upset. BRADYCARDIA AND TACHYCARDIA In children, transient but profound sinus pauses or sustained bradycardia may cause syncope as a result of a neurocardiogenic reflex; however, syncope caused by isolated bradycardia is uncommon. Tachycardia may cause syncope in a seemingly healthy child, and the syncope usually is caused by palpitations; other symptoms may be present. Syncope that occurs in the supine position and is preceded by an aura or followed by confusion or amnesia is possibly caused by a neurologic disorder. Neurologic disorders that cause syncope often result in orthostatic hypotension from dysautonomia. These disorders can be suspected by history, neurologic examination, and bedside testing of orthostatic vital signs.

### Bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel) [^15a81c09]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

During clinical trials, dizziness, drowsiness, faintness, fainting, and syncope have been reported early in the course of Parlodel therapy. In postmarketing reports, Parlodel has been associated with somnolence, and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. All patients receiving Parlodel should be cautioned with regard to engaging in activities requiring rapid and precise responses, such as driving an automobile or operating machinery. Patients being treated with Parlodel and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be advised not to drive or engage in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g., operating machines).

Patients receiving Parlodel for hyperprolactinemic states associated with macroadenoma or those who have had previous transsphenoidal surgery should be told to report any persistent watery nasal discharge to their physician. Patients receiving Parlodel for treatment of a macroadenoma should be told that discontinuation of drug may be associated with rapid regrowth of the tumor and recurrence of their original symptoms.

Patients and their caregivers should be alerted to the possibility that patients may experience intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges and other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking Parlodel. Advise patients and their caregivers to inform their healthcare provider if they develop new or increased uncontrolled spending, gambling urges, sexual urges, or other urges while being treated with Parlodel [see PRECAUTIONS].

Especially during the first days of treatment, hypotensive reactions may occasionally occur and result in reduced alertness, particular care should be exercised when driving a vehicle or operating machinery.

Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they wish to discontinue Parlodel or decrease the dose of Parlodel. Advise patients who have been prescribed a lower dose or who have been withdrawn from the drug to notify their healthcare provider if they have withdrawal symptoms such as fever, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, sweating, or pain (see Precautions).

### Do orthostatic vital signs have utility in the evaluation of syncope? [^4c1880fc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Syncope is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis is long and includes benign conditions as well as acute life threats, such as dysrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.

Objective

The specific goals of this review are twofold: 1) to define the diagnostic utility of orthostatic vital signs (OVS) as a test for orthostatic syncope, and 2) to determine whether OVS help diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of syncope in ED patients.

Methods

Three prospective cohort studies plus 2017 national guidelines for syncope management were identified, reviewed, and critically appraised.

Results

This literature review found that orthostatic hypotension is common among ED patients with syncope and is often diagnosed as the cause of syncope.

Conclusions

OVS measurements do not, in isolation, reliably diagnose or exclude orthostatic syncope, nor do they appear to have value in ruling out life-threatening causes of syncope.

### Adenosine test in the diagnosis of unexplained syncope: marker of conducting tissue disease or neurally mediated syncope? [^d76ac0bc]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Adenosine test (supine administration of a 20 mg intravenous bolus with electrocardiographic and blood pressure monitoring) has been endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on syncope management as an 'experimental' test in the diagnosis of unexplained syncope. The test is quick and cheap, but there is no consensus as to what condition, if any, the adenosine test is exposing, with conducting tissue disease and neurally mediated syncope proposed by various authors. In this article, we review the possible mechanisms underlying a positive adenosine test, its safety, and a comprehensive examination of the literature supporting each of the putative causal diagnoses.

### Near-syncope after exercise [^1eae7498]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Syncope and near-syncope are great diagnostic challenges in medicine. On the one hand, the symptom may result from a benign condition and pose little or no threat to health other than that related to falling. On the other hand, syncope or near-syncope can be the manifestation of a serious underlying condition that poses an imminent threat to life. Patients with a cardiac cause of syncope are at far greater risk of dying in the first year after an episode of syncope or near-syncope than individuals with a noncardiac cause. A cardiac cause of syncope should be considered in every patient with syncope or near-syncope, but it is particularly common in older patients or in patients with known structural heart disease, arrhythmia, or certain electrocardiographic abnormalities. Although many diagnostic tests may be helpful in the evaluation of syncope and near-syncope, the history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram pinpoint the cause in many circumstances. Syncope after exercise may be due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction from aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy but can also suggest the diagnosis of postexercise hypotension in which an abnormality in autonomic regulation of vascular tone or heart rate results in vasodilation or bradycardia after moderate-intensity aerobic activity. The patient discussed in this case highlights the importance of the clinical history in the evaluation of this condition, since the diagnosis was revealed as the patient's story was described and eventually acted out.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^4e931ceb]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Vasovagal and situational syncope — non-pharmacologic measures: All patients should be taught physical isometric counterpressure manoeuvres (PCM), which now form the cornerstone of therapy together with education and reassurance. In patients who continue to faint despite adequate lifestyle measures and PCMs, tilt training may be considered, particularly in the younger, very symptomatic, well-motivated patients, despite lack of proven efficacy, because it can act by reassuring the patient without side effects. For situational syncope, treatment strategies are similar to VVS and rely heavily on avoiding or ameliorating the triggering event, with attenuation by maintenance of central volume, protected posture, and slower changes in posture.

### Fainting induces an acute increase in the concentration of plasma factor VIII and von Willebrand factor [^a91974c7]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

von Willebrand factor (VWF) is stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and may be released in response to different secretion stimuli such as stress, physical exercise, adrenaline, DDAVP and thrombin.

Design and Methods

We found that fainting can also induce an acute increase in plasma VWF and factor FVIII (FVIII) concentrations, following observations in two patients with von Willebrand's disease (VWD) who experienced a fainting episode during venipuncture for blood collection.

Results

One patient was classified as having type Vicenza VWD, the other as type 1 VWD; both had normal platelet VWF content. After the fainting episode, FVIII and VWF levels were significantly higher than the levels in blood samples collected without stress; mean increases were 4.35-fold for FVIII, 4-fold for VWF:Ag and 5.3-fold for VWF:RCo, with values overshooting the upper limit of the normal range. Moreover, the post-fainting plasma VWF multimer pattern was characterized by a significant increase in all oligomers with the appearance of unusually large VWF multimers, similar to those observed following DDAVP infusion.

Interpretation and Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that fainting acts as a stimulus capable of inducing the release of VWF from endothelial cells, and further highlight the role of stress in determining hemostatic states potentially favorable to the development of thrombotic complications.

### Reply to bennett and levine [^e39b55cc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

The point of view of Bennett and Levine highlights two crucial aspects about tilt table testing (TTT): the first is the test's inaccuracy in detecting the etiology of syncope; the second is the potential danger of inadvertently misclassifying a syncope that is actually due to a malignant cause such as cardiac arrhythmias, as a neurally mediated syncope (NMS) (likely benign). In adults under the age of 60, these concerns about TTT may be justifiable, but if applied to older adults they could hinder the utility of TTT in diagnosis of syncope, orthostatic hypotension (OH), and falls.

Certainly, the role of TTT in the diagnosis of NMS can be debated. Patient characteristics (age, comorbidity), test setting (ambulatory, hospital ward, emergency room, or syncope unit), and testing procedure (with/without pharmacological stress, degree of tilt, and duration of the test) influence the TTT sensitivity/specificity and outcomes. Nevertheless, the diagnostic accuracy can increase if additional patient medical history is taken by an expert in syncope. As confirmed by the literature and in agreement with Bennett et al. TTT should not be performed when a diagnosis of NMS is clear after analyzing the patient's history and clinical circumstances of syncope. In contrast, as is extensively recommended, TTT should be considered in the case of suspected but not certain diagnosis of NMS. This is often the case in older "fainters" for whom history may be absent or misleading because of retrograde amnesia. Nonetheless, the risk of misclassifying the cause of syncope as benign through the use of TTT is real (e.g. vasodepressor response to TTT in patients with undiagnosed malignant arrhythmia). In older individuals, more than in young people and adults < 60 years, multiple factors can contribute along with the primary cause to the episode of syncope. Hence, no one test alone may avoid a misdiagnosis of the cause of syncope, and so a multidisciplinary approach, including TTT, should be planned to detect these contributing factors.

### Trauma and syncope: looking beyond the injury [^949fca16]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

The cardiac causes of syncope must be identified as priority as they carry the greatest risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), defined as death from a cardiac cause within 1 hour from the onset of symptoms. Cardiac causes of syncope include arrhythmia, structural heart disease and conditions affecting the cardiopulmonary and great vessels. In general, these relate to the obstruction of cardiac output limiting blood supply to the brain. OH describes a drop in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 10 mm Hg on assuming the upright position and can be associated with intravascular volume depletion, medication side effects, and primary and secondary autonomic failures.

### Vascular causes of syncope: an emergency medicine review [^9472200b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Syncope is a common emergency department (ED) complaint, accounting for 2% of visits annually. A wide variety of etiologies can result in syncope, and vascular causes may be deadly.

Objective

This review evaluates vascular causes of syncope and their evaluation and management in the ED.

Discussion

Syncope is defined by a brief loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone and complete, spontaneous recovery without medical intervention. Causes include cardiac, vasovagal, orthostatic, neurologic, medication-related, and idiopathic, and most cases of syncope will not receive a specific diagnosis pertaining to the cause. Emergency physicians are most concerned with life-threatening causes such as dysrhythmia and obstruction, and electrocardiogram is a primary means of evaluation. However, vascular etiologies can result in patient morbidity and mortality. These conditions include pulmonary embolism, subclavian steal, aortic dissection, cerebrovascular disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, carotid/vertebral dissection, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. A focused history and physical examination can assist emergency physicians in determining the need for further testing and management.

Conclusions

Syncope is common and may be the result of a deadly condition. The emergency physician, through history and physical examination, can determine the need for further evaluation and resuscitation of these patients, with consideration of vascular etiologies of syncope.

### Common syndromes of orthostatic intolerance [^8b76c680]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system, adequate blood volume, and intact skeletal and respiratory muscle pumps are essential components for rapid cardiovascular adjustments to upright posture (orthostasis). Patients lacking sufficient blood volume or having defective sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction develop orthostatic hypotension (OH), prohibiting effective upright activities. OH is one form of orthostatic intolerance (OI) defined by signs, such as hypotension, and symptoms, such as lightheadedness, that occur when upright and are relieved by recumbence. Mild OI is commonly experienced during intercurrent illnesses and when standing up rapidly. The latter is denoted "initial OH" and represents a normal cardiovascular adjustment to the blood volume shifts during standing. Some people experience episodic acute OI, such as postural vasovagal syncope (fainting), or chronic OI, such as postural tachycardia syndrome, which can significantly reduce quality of life. The lifetime incidence of ≥ 1 fainting episodes is ∼40%. For the most part, these episodes are benign and self-limited, although frequent syncope episodes can be debilitating, and injury may occur from sudden falls. In this article, mechanisms for OI having components of adrenergic hypofunction, adrenergic hyperfunction, hyperpnea, and regional blood volume redistribution are discussed. Therapeutic strategies to cope with OI are proposed.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^75a8fc90]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

ESC Guidelines — syncope secondary to structural cardiac or cardiovascular disease — In patients with syncope secondary to structural cardiac disease, the goal of treatment is not only to prevent syncopal recurrence, but also to treat the underlying disease and to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and the mere presence of heart disease does not imply that syncope is related to the underlying cardiac disorder. In patients with syncope secondary to severe aortic stenosis or to atrial myxoma, surgical treatment of the underlying disease is indicated, whereas in patients with syncope secondary to acute cardiovascular disease, such as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, or pericardial tamponade, treatment should be directed to the underlying process. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (with or without left ventricle outflow tract obstruction), specific treatment of the arrhythmia is usually warranted; in most of these patients, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) should be implanted to prevent SCD, and there are no data on the effect of reducing the outflow gradient on relief of syncope. In syncope associated with myocardial ischaemia, pharmacological therapy and/or revascularization is clearly the appropriate strategy in most cases, but when syncope is caused by primary pulmonary hypertension or restrictive cardiomyopathy, it is often impossible adequately to ameliorate the underlying problem; other less common causes include left ventricular inflow tract obstruction in patients with mitral stenosis, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and right to left shunting secondary to pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary hypertension.

### Supine syncope induced by needle insertion [^bdc23edc]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injection-induced syncope is a form of situational syncope, a category of reflex syncope. This type of syncope has a specific trigger resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion induced by sudden peripheral vasodilation due to sympathetic withdrawal with or without vagally mediated bradycardia. Although the fact that a needle insertion can induce fainting was described in the 19th and early 20th centuries, notably by Lewis, the understanding of underlying mechanisms remains limited. Observational studies suggest that syncope occurring after placing an intravenous catheter is rare, affecting 0.2% of people. There is a closely related entity to injection-induced syncope called reflex anoxic seizures (RAS) or convulsive syncope that may share similar mechanisms including precipitation by noxious stimuli.RAS mainly affects children; eight in 1000 preschoolers may be affected, but it has also been reported in younger adults.

Although situational syncope is benign, accurate diagnosis of the underlying mechanisms is important because the therapy for situational syncope depends entirely on the pathophysiology. Misdiagnosis including epilepsyand psychogenic pseudosyncopecould result in unnecessary interventions.

Historically, studies on situational syncope have largely focused on its cardiovascular correlates. Since no study captured a continuous profile of cerebrovascular signals during supine syncope, we aimed to characterise cerebral haemodynamics during supine syncope triggered by needle insertion using real-time continuous physiologic monitoring.

Management of syncope in the Emergency Department (ED) focuses on risk stratification with clear disposition goals. "The evaluation of syncope in the setting of ED has changed from attempts to make a diagnosis of the cause of syncope to risk stratification (Table 8) in order to:" "(i) recognize patients with life-threatening conditions and admit them to the hospital; (ii) recognize patients with non serious conditions to be discharged and referred later to local syncope facilities; (iii) recognize those who do not need any further evaluation and treatment; and (iv) choose a timing and setting where further diagnostic tests should be performed in patients with inconclusive initial evaluation".

Clinical endpoints for ML

Training supervised ML programs require large datasets containing accurate features (ie, inputs) and labels (ie, outputs), so that correct learning can occur. In health care, ML programs may receive patient-specific features (eg, symptoms, vital signs, and test results) and associate these with certain labels (eg, diagnoses, treatments, and adverse events). These features and their associated labels can be compiled into database format, which can then be divided and used in training, validation, and testing stages. For syncope, it is paramount to identify which clinical questions ML can answer. These could be diagnostic (what caused syncope?), prognostic (what subsequent adverse event occurred?), or management related (did triage, testing, or treatment affect outcome?). Table 1 lists proposed clinical endpoints (eg, event definition, diagnosis, risk assessment, and ED disposition) that, if better predicted by a ML model, could improve patient care.

A ML model that predicts which TLOC patients had syncope could be helpful. The ambiguous nature of their presentations (especially in elderly patients) and uncertainty of their diagnoses make it difficult to gather the correct labels required for ML. The absence of any universal gold standard test means the diagnosis may never be known with certainty. Even when the cause is known, confusion may exist regarding the mechanism. Transient asystole can be a manifestation of sinus node disease or simply be a vagal response. Further, a vagal response can be a singular event (eg, sight of blood) or a repetitive problem (eg, temporal lobe seizures or idiopathic). These diagnostic uncertainties illustrate the complexities of TLOC and syncope, which can lead to incorrect labels and affect the clinical application of ML.

The importance of risk stratification in syncope patients cannot be overstated. The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline committees compiled short- (< 30 days) and long-term (> 30 days) adverse events associated with syncope, (Figure 2). As opposed to diagnostic outcomes, these adverse events are definitive, reportable, and already recognized in risk stratification studies (Supplemental Appendix), and therefore, more suitable endpoints for supervised ML algorithms. Table 4 summarizes endpoints derived from previous risk stratification studies. However, it is critical to ensure that outcomes are syncope specific. For example, short-term adverse outcomescould overlap with nonsyncopal causes of TLOC (eg, stroke).
