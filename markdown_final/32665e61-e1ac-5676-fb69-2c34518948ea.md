## Question

Does omeprazole cause peripheral edema?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether omeprazole causes peripheral edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and whether peripheral edema is listed as an adverse reaction. Then, I should verify whether there are plausible mechanistic pathways that could link omeprazole to edema. Next, I will check for clinical evidence beyond labels, including randomized trials and observational data. After that, I need to consider confounders and alternative explanations, especially sodium load in combination products. Finally, I will synthesize a risk assessment and provide practical clinical guidance with appropriate caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. Multiple FDA labels for omeprazole and fixed-dose combinations consistently list peripheral edema under postmarketing cardiovascular adverse reactions, which establishes a recognized association even if causality cannot be quantified from spontaneous reports alone [^ad814cbd] [^7e6a3e1a] [^3d623cdc] [^dcf546df] [^7db92fa7] [^d46f80bc].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before inferring causality. I initially thought omeprazole might directly cause sodium retention or vasodilation, but I should double-check that. On reconsideration, there is no well-established direct mechanism whereby omeprazole itself increases intravascular volume or causes peripheral vasodilation; instead, the most plausible contributor in some products is the sodium bicarbonate buffer, which delivers a meaningful sodium load that can promote fluid retention, particularly in patients with heart failure, renal impairment, or sodium-sensitive hypertension [^3672c9ff] [^49721186] [^f0d78a2d] [^f7c81a0b] [^554821ee].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency. I need to check whether any randomized trials quantify edema risk with omeprazole. The NEJM trial comparing celecoxib versus diclofenac plus omeprazole reported renal adverse events including peripheral edema in 30.8% with diclofenac plus omeprazole versus 24.3% with celecoxib, but this mixed signal cannot isolate omeprazole's contribution because NSAIDs themselves cause edema and the combination includes two potential offenders; thus, this is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for omeprazole-specific edema risk [^f6e5ecdc].

> I should confirm whether other PPIs show a similar signal to gauge class plausibility. Pantoprazole labels and trials also list peripheral edema, albeit uncommonly, which supports a class signal but again does not establish causality or a precise incidence attributable to the PPI alone versus patient factors or concomitant drugs [^22150f07] [^6b4a5aaa] [^1a0da17e] [^f6229e79].

> Next, I should review confounders and patient-level risks. Many patients on PPIs have comorbidities and co-medications that independently cause edema, such as calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, thiazolidinediones, gabapentin, and heart failure itself; this makes it challenging to attribute edema to omeprazole in real-world settings without careful temporal correlation and dechallenge-rechallenge, which are rarely available in spontaneous reports [^c6ab717e] [^a4e0a652] [^d963b883] [^253d8e76] [^722993b1] [^b3ef6797].

> Let me synthesize the risk. The balance of evidence indicates that peripheral edema is a rare, postmarketing adverse reaction associated with omeprazole exposure, with no robust estimate of incidence from controlled studies; the signal is stronger and more mechanistically coherent for sodium bicarbonate–containing omeprazole products due to sodium load, whereas a direct causal link for omeprazole alone remains biologically plausible but unproven and likely infrequent [^ad814cbd] [^3672c9ff] [^49721186].

> I should now translate this into practical guidance. If a patient develops new or worsening peripheral edema after starting omeprazole, I need to check the formulation first; if it is a sodium bicarbonate combination, the sodium load is a credible contributor and switching to a standard delayed-release omeprazole or an alternative PPI without sodium bicarbonate is reasonable, especially in patients with heart failure, CKD, or hypertension. If edema persists after stopping the buffered product, I should evaluate common non–PPI causes such as CCBs, NSAIDs, endocrine or hepatic disease, and venous insufficiency before attributing causality to omeprazole itself [^3672c9ff] [^49721186] [^f0d78a2d] [^f7c81a0b] [^554821ee] [^b3ef6797].

> But wait, what if the patient truly needs ongoing acid suppression and cannot switch formulations? I need to ensure the indication is valid and consider dose minimization, periodic reassessment, and monitoring for volume status, particularly in those at risk of fluid overload; if edema remains problematic and no better explanation is found, a cautious trial of discontinuation may be justified, documenting baseline and follow-up edema scores to support inference, while balancing the GI risk of stopping therapy [^ec9867d9] [^e8dc9502].

> In summary, I should confirm that omeprazole can be associated with peripheral edema, but the risk appears low and is most clearly explained by sodium load in buffered formulations; a direct causal effect of omeprazole alone is possible but not firmly established, so clinical judgment should prioritize formulation choice, comorbidity review, and alternative etiologies before concluding the PPI is the culprit [^ad814cbd] [^3672c9ff] [^49721186] [^f6e5ecdc].

Omeprazole can cause **peripheral edema** [^ad814cbd], but this is a **rare adverse effect** [^notfound] reported in postmarketing experience. The risk is higher in patients with heart failure, renal impairment, or those on sodium-restricted diets, especially with sodium bicarbonate–containing formulations [^3672c9ff] [^49721186]. If edema occurs, consider switching to a non–sodium bicarbonate PPI or an H2 blocker, and manage with dose adjustment or discontinuation if needed [^notfound].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies and postmarketing reports

Multiple FDA labels list **peripheral edema** as a postmarketing adverse reaction for omeprazole, including delayed-release capsules [^dcf546df] and sodium bicarbonate formulations [^ad814cbd] [^7e6a3e1a] [^3d623cdc]. The NEJM trial comparing celecoxib versus diclofenac plus omeprazole reported renal adverse events — including peripheral edema — in 30.8% with diclofenac plus omeprazole versus 24.3% with celecoxib, though this reflects the combination rather than omeprazole alone [^f6e5ecdc].

---

## Mechanisms underlying omeprazole-induced peripheral edema

Several plausible mechanisms may explain **peripheral edema** with omeprazole:

- **Sodium retention**: Sodium bicarbonate–containing formulations deliver substantial sodium (304–460 mg per dose), which can worsen fluid retention, particularly in heart failure or renal impairment [^3672c9ff] [^49721186].

- **Renal effects**: PPIs can cause acute interstitial nephritis, impairing sodium and water handling and promoting edema [^3672c9ff] [^49721186].

- **Hypomagnesemia**: Long-term PPI use can cause hypomagnesemia, which may contribute to fluid retention and edema [^2e9eeb68].

---

## Risk factors and patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **higher risk** of omeprazole-associated edema:

| **Risk factor** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| Heart failure | Sodium load from bicarbonate formulations can exacerbate fluid overload [^3672c9ff] [^49721186] |
| Renal impairment | Reduced sodium excretion increases risk of fluid retention [^notfound] |
| Sodium-restricted diets | Excess sodium intake promotes edema [^3672c9ff] [^49721186] |
| Elderly patients | Higher susceptibility to fluid retention and renal effects [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical management strategies

When **peripheral edema** occurs during omeprazole therapy:

- **Assess causality**: Confirm temporal relationship and exclude other causes (e.g. CCBs, NSAIDs, heart failure) [^b3ef6797].

- **Switch formulation**: Use non–sodium bicarbonate omeprazole or an H2 blocker [^notfound].

- **Dose adjustment**: Consider dose reduction or discontinuation if edema persists [^notfound].

- **Monitor**: Watch for recurrence if omeprazole is reintroduced [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other proton pump inhibitors

Peripheral edema is a **class effect** [^notfound] reported with other PPIs (e.g. pantoprazole) [^22150f07], though incidence varies and is generally low. The risk appears higher with sodium bicarbonate–containing formulations [^3672c9ff] [^49721186].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **indication-driven PPI use** [^ec9867d9] at the lowest effective dose, with periodic reassessment of need [^e8dc9502]. They do not specifically address edema, but advise vigilance for adverse effects, including fluid retention, in at-risk patients [^notfound].

---

Omeprazole can cause **peripheral edema**, albeit rarely, with the highest risk in patients with heart failure, renal impairment, or on sodium-restricted diets, particularly with sodium bicarbonate–containing formulations. Management includes switching formulations, adjusting the dose, or discontinuing therapy, and the overall risk remains low with appropriate patient selection and monitoring.

### Celecoxib versus diclofenac and omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding in patients with arthritis [^f6e5ecdc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that patients at risk for ulcer disease who require treatment for arthritis receive nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are selective for cyclooxygenase-2 or the combination of a nonselective NSAID with a proton-pump inhibitor. We assessed whether celecoxib would be similar to diclofenac plus omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding in patients at high risk for bleeding.

Methods

We studied patients who used NSAIDs for arthritis and who presented with ulcer bleeding. After their ulcers had healed, we randomly assigned patients who were negative for Helicobacter pylori to receive either 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily plus daily placebo or 75 mg of diclofenac twice daily plus 20 mg of omeprazole daily for six months. The end point was recurrent ulcer bleeding.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, which included 287 patients (144 receiving celecoxib and 143 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole), recurrent ulcer bleeding occurred in 7 patients receiving celecoxib and 9 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. The probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 4.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 6.7) for patients who received celecoxib and 6.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.3 to 8.4) for patients who received diclofenac plus omeprazole (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -6.8 to 3.8). Renal adverse events, including hypertension, peripheral edema, and renal failure, occurred in 24.3 percent of the patients receiving celecoxib and 30.8 percent of those receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole.

Conclusions

Among patients with a recent history of ulcer bleeding, treatment with celecoxib was as effective as treatment with diclofenac plus omeprazole, with respect to the prevention of recurrent bleeding. Renal toxic effects are common in high-risk patients receiving celecoxib or diclofenac plus omeprazole.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^c1247951]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor hypersensitivity — PPIs are generally well tolerated, with a 1% to 2% risk of minor adverse reactions, and hypersensitivity is also rarely described; three cross-reactivity patterns are reported: hypersensitivity to omeprazole showed cross-reactivity with all other PPIs; hypersensitivity to omeprazole showed cross-reactivity with pantoprazole, or with pantoprazole and esomeprazole or rabeprazole, but not with lansoprazole; and hypersensitivity to lansoprazole showed cross-reactivity with 1 of omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, or esomeprazole but not with any of the other PPIs. Among the PPIs, lansoprazole, followed by omeprazole, is most frequently implicated as the cause of immediate hypersensitivity. Immediate reactions are most commonly reported, accounting for 86% of all hypersensitivity reactions in a recent review of 118 cases, with reported manifestations including urticaria, generalized itching or pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, skin rash other than urticaria, erythema, and dyspnea or shortness of breath.

Case presentation

Basic information

A 68-year-old woman was brought to our hospital with repeated right upper abdominal pain lasting for 3 month and aggravation for 9 h. From February 2019 to May 2019, the patient experienced multiple episodes of dull epigastric pain and discomfort, which was often aggravated in the morning with paroxysmal colic. The patient had visited many hospitals without symptom control, but had improved after orally taking omeprazole and anti-inflammatory agents. She did not have black stools or similar symptoms before the symptoms appeared 3 months earlier.

Routine examination and treatment

Physical examination showed obvious tenderness in the lower right epigastric region of the xiphoid process, and there was no rebound pain or muscle tension. Blood examination only indicated slightly elevated levels of C-reactive protein, while other tests including routine blood tests were normal. Chest X-ray and B-ultrasound indicated no obvious abnormalities, as shown in Fig. 1. Gastroscopy revealed obvious hyperemia and edema in the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, with superficial white pus coating on the surface, and semicircular swelling of the mucous membrane into the cavity, as shown in Fig. 2.

Gastroscopy examination showed obvious hyperemia and edema in the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, superficial white pus coating on the surface, and semicircular swelling of the mucous membrane in the cavity

A duodenal bulbous bulge with bulbous inflammation (possibly due to external pressure on the gall bladder abscess) and/or duodenal bulb ulcer were first considered to be responsible for the discomfort. Cefazoxime sodium was intravenously administered at 2 g and Q12h. Omeprazole was orally administered at 40 mg and Q12h. However, the effect of the anti-ulcer therapy was unremarkable as the symptoms were not significantly relieved and epigastric pain was still present. Additionally, the paroxysmal spasmolysis could not be controlled by intramuscular injection of anisodamine.

5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy

In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.

5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea and anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia).

Discontinue Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Sodium Bicarbonate Buffer Content

Each 20 mg and 40 mg Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsule contains 1,100 mg (13 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each capsule is 304 mg.

Each 20 mg and 40 mg packet of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate for oral suspension contains 1,680 mg (20 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each packet is 460 mg.

Chronic administration of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause milk-alkali syndrome. Chronic use of sodium bicarbonate may lead to systemic alkalosis, and increased sodium intake can produce edema and weight gain.

The sodium content of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate products should be taken into consideration when administering to patients on a sodium-restricted diet or those at risk for developing congestive heart failure.

Avoid Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance.

5.4 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

### Oral versus intravenous proton pump inhibitors in preventing re-bleeding for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic therapy [^9aecb93c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

In this randomized comparative trial, we found patients with oral and intravenous PPI have a similar clinical outcome, including recurrent bleeding, blood transfusion, surgery and mortality. Interestingly, we found that patients in the oral PPI group have a shorter hospital stay compared with the IV group (1.8 days vs. 3.9 days). This is the first study to suggest the finding of similar intragastric pH via different routes of administration may suggest for similar clinical outcomes. The low rebleeding rate of 4% in both groups is lower than our previous study of regular dose PPIs but is comparable to a multicenter study with high dose intravenous esomeprazole. This suggests that high doses rather than regular doses of PPI via the oral route may achieve comparable clinical outcomes with high dose intravenous PPI.

This is important in two ways. First, the cost associated with the pharmacotherapy can be reduced. The cost of oral PPI is one tenth the cost of the intravenous PPI in Taiwan. In addition, a patient with oral PPI can be discharged earlier in our study. Taking both together, approaches with high dose oral PPI can be more economical than high dose intravenous PPI. Second, the oral route administration of PPI is easy and dose not require frequent monitoring for the infusion site reactions (such as edema, thrombophlebitis, and so on). In addition, the use of oral disintegrating lansoprazole can be taken without water and repeated endoscopy can be performed without waiting for gastric emptying.

### Peripheral edema [^b3ef6797]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Peripheral edema often poses a dilemma for the clinician because it is a nonspecific finding common to a host of diseases ranging from the benign to the potentially life threatening. A rational and systematic approach to the patient with edema allows for prompt and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of edema formation in specific disease states, as well as the implications for treatment. Specific etiologies are reviewed to compare the diseases that manifest this common physical sign. Finally, we review the clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment strategies.

### Evaluation of omeprazole in the treatment of reflux laryngitis: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study [^21641b38]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Proton-pump inhibitors are often recommended in the treatment of laryngitis secondary to gastric reflux. Despite prospective treatment studies reporting high efficacy, only one previous report has been placebo-controlled and blinded. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of omeprazole in treating proven reflux laryngitis.

Study Design

Prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.

Methods

Fifty-three patients with one or more reflux laryngitis symptoms were recruited to undergo 24-hour dual-channel pH probe testing. Thirty patients with more than four episodes of laryngopharyngeal reflux were enrolled. By random assignment, 15 patients received 40 mg omeprazole twice a day and the other 15 received placebo for a period of 2 months. Symptoms (hoarseness, throat pain, lump in throat sensation, throat clearing, cough, excessive phlegm, dysphagia, odynophagia, and heartburn) and endoscopic laryngeal signs (erythema, edema, and mucus accumulation) were recorded initially, at 1 month, and 2 months.

Results

In general, most symptom scores improved over time for both the omeprazole and placebo groups. Hoarseness, when patients begin with low hoarseness symptom scores, and throat clearing improved significantly more in patients on omeprazole than in those on placebo during the 2-month study. Throat pain, lump in throat sensation, excessive phlegm, difficulty swallowing, pain with swallowing, and heartburn showed improvement in both treatment arms, signifying the possibility of a placebo effect. Endoscopic laryngeal signs did not change significantly over the course of the study for either treatment group.

Conclusions

A placebo effect appears to exist in the treatment of reflux laryngitis. However, hoarseness, when initially scored low, and throat clearing resulting from reflux laryngitis are effectively treated by omeprazole.

### An unusual cause of metabolic alkalosis: hiding in plain sight [^7c5f8af3]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 80-year-old woman with a past medical history of long-standing hypertension leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage G3bA1 (baseline serum creatinine 1.4–1.78 mg/dL [123.7–157.35 umol/L], eGFR 33–45 mL/min), hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and gastroesophageal reflux disease was referred to the Nephrology clinic by her primary care provider for evaluation of chronic metabolic alkalosis.

During her initial clinic visit, the patient endorsed decreased appetite and poor oral intake with resultant 5-pound weight loss over the course of 6 weeks. She denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Her home medications included metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily, pravastatin 10 mg daily, pantoprazole 40 mg daily, rivaroxaban 15 mg daily, and calcium carbonate 600 mg daily. She specifically denied taking any additional medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter. On physical examination, the patient had a BMI of 17.2 kg/m 2, blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg and heart rate of 80 beats per minute. She was clinically euvolemic on exam, particularly, there was no peripheral edema. Table 1 summarizes the patient's initial serum laboratory findings. Notably, her serum bicarbonate was elevated to 44 mmol/L, urinalysis was unremarkable, with no proteinuria or active urine sediment, and urine pH of 6.0, which was somewhat lower than expected for her degree of metabolic alkalosis. Based on the arterial blood gas result with a pH of 7,50, CO2 53 mmHg (7.06 kPa) and bicarbonate 41 mEq/L, the patient was diagnosed with a primary compensated metabolic alkalosis. Spot urine electrolytes revealed the following: urine sodium of 41 mmol/L (fractional excretion of 0.3%), potassium 13.0 mmol/L (fractional excretion 3.87%) and chloride 48 mmol/L (fractional excretion of 0.5%), with a urine creatinine of 128 mg/dL (11,317 umol/L). Her random urine chloride level greater than 20 mmol/L was indicative of a predominantly chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis. In the setting of the patient's hypertension associated with metabolic alkalosis and tendency to hypokalemia, further workup was obtained after her serum potassium level was repleted to 3.8 mEq/L, to rule out secondary causes of hypertension. Laboratory workup showed a serum renin level of 0.2 ng/mL/h (reference: 0.25–5.82 ng/mL) with normal serum aldosterone level of 3.6 ng/dL supine (Ref: if supine 3–16 ng/dl, upright less or equal to 28 ng/dl) and AM cortisol level of 13.4 mcg/dL (Ref at 7–9 am: 4.6–23.4 mcg/dL). A computed tomography scan of her abdomen was obtained and showed normal-appearing adrenal glands. Further, renal vascular ultrasound was unremarkable with no evidence of renal artery stenosis.

### Peripheral edema associated with calcium channel blockers: incidence and withdrawal rate – a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^c6ab717e]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Peripheral edema is considered to be a common and annoying adverse effect of calcium channel blockers (CCBs). It has been thought to occur secondary to arteriolar dilatation causing intracapillary hypertension and fluid extravasation. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and withdrawal rate of peripheral edema with CCBs.

Methods

A systematic search was made in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL from 1980 to January 2011 for randomized clinical trials reporting peripheral edema with CCBs in patients with hypertension. Trials enrolling at least 100 patients in the CCB arm and lasting at least 4 weeks were included in the analysis. Both the incidence and withdrawal rate due to edema were pooled by weighing each trial by the inverse of the variance. Head-to-head comparison was done to evaluate the risk of edema between newer lipophilic dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs and older DHPs.

Results

One hundred and six studies with 99 469 participants, mean age 56 ± 6 years, satisfied our inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. The weighted incidence of peripheral edema was significantly higher in the CCBs group when compared with controls/placebo (10.7 vs. 3.2%, P < 0.0001). Similarly, the withdrawal rate due to edema was higher in patients on CCBs compared with control/placebo (2.1 vs. 0.5%, P < 0.0001). Both the incidence of edema and patient withdrawal rate due to edema increased with the duration of therapy with CCBs reaching 24 and 5%, respectively, after 6 months. The risk of peripheral edema with lipophilic DHPs was 57% lower than with traditional DHPs (relative risk 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.34–0.53; P < 0.0001). Incidence of peripheral edema in patients on DHPs was 12.3% compared with 3.1% with non-DHPs (P < 0.0001). Edema with high-dose CCBs (defined as more than half the usual maximal dose) was 2.8 times higher than that with low-dose CCBs (16.1 vs. 5.7%, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The incidence of peripheral edema progressively increased with duration of CCB therapy up to 6 months. Over the long term, more than 5% of patients discontinued CCBs because of this adverse effect. Edema rates were lower with both non-DHPs and lipophilic DHPs.

### Non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases and concomitantBrain abscesses [^725c7235]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient Case

The patient was 52 years old when he presented to the hospital with a cough, vertigo, and headache. Workup eventually revealed large masses in the right upper lobe of the lung and liver. Biopsies of both revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung, primarily positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (in-frame insertion exon 20 – gain of function) and negative for other mutations and programmed death-ligand 1 tumor proportion score of 90%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with/without contrast revealed 8 peripherally enhancing brain lesions with vasogenic edema and restricted diffusion throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum (Fig. 1). The patient was started on dexamethasone 4 mg 3 times daily by mouth with the potential to decrease to 2 times daily pending clinical response. The case was discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board, where it was felt that the lesions likely represented brain metastases and did not require pathologic confirmation, with a consensus recommendation to treat them with radiation therapy. The patient subsequently underwent single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to 20 Gy or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to 30 Gy in 5 daily fractions to all brain metastases, depending on their size and location, after which a steroid taper titrated to neurologic symptom recurrence was initiated. A prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was started. Prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was started about 1 week after initiation of steroids, at which point the first course of SRS/SBRT had not been started while the diagnosis was being pathologically confirmed and the treatment of the brain metastases (ie, surgery or radiation) was being determined. Moreover, at that point, it was anticipated that the patient would require a prolonged steroid course and taper given the severity of the patient's symptoms and cerebral edema associated with the metastases, and thus prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was recommended. However, the latter was shortly after transitioned to atovaquone due to elevated liver enzymes.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) safety — randomized trial outcomes: In a large placebo-controlled trial, "17,598 patients aged 65 years or older" with vascular disease were randomized to pantoprazole "(40 mg daily, n = 8,791) or placebo (n = 8,807)", with data collected "at 6-month intervals over a period of 3 years" to assess predefined adverse events. Investigators "found no significant differences between the PPI and placebo groups" for potential side effects "except for enteric infections (1.4% vs 1.0% in the PPI and placebo groups, respectively; OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01–1.75)", and "Pantoprazole for 3 years was not associated with any adverse event other than a modestly increased risk of developing enteric infections". Caveats noted include that "the trial had a maximum follow-up of 5 years" and that it "cannot exclude the possibility that PPIs confer a modest risk of any of these adverse events (i.e., the upper limit of the 95% CIs all are > 1)".

SABRIL causes edema in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess edema, but observed incidence of edema-based pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo.

Pooled data from controlled trials demonstrated increased risk among SABRIL patients compared to placebo patients for peripheral edema (SABRIL 2%, placebo 1%), and edema (SABRIL 1%, placebo 0%). In these studies, one SABRIL and no placebo patients discontinued for an edema related AE. In adults, there was no apparent association between edema and cardiovascular adverse events such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety data described below reflect exposure to Adempas in two, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH patients (PATENT-1). The population (Adempas: n = 490; Placebo: n = 214) was between the age of 18 and 80 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].

The safety profile of Adempas in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH (PATENT-1) were similar. Therefore, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from the 12 and 16 week placebo-controlled trials for PAH and CTEPH respectively were pooled, and those occurring more frequently on Adempas than placebo (≥ 3%) are displayed in Table 1 below. Most adverse reactions in Table 1 can be ascribed to the vasodilatory mechanism of action of Adempas.

The overall rates of discontinuation due to an adverse event in the pivotal placebo-controlled trials were 2.9% for Adempas and 5.1% for placebo (pooled data).

Other events that were seen more frequently in Adempas compared to placebo and potentially related to treatment were: palpitations, nasal congestion, epistaxis, dysphagia, abdominal distension and peripheral edema. With longer observation in uncontrolled long-term extension studies the safety profile was similar to that observed in the placebo controlled phase 3 trials.

Use of PPIs

Coincident with PPI usage, the literature surrounding PPI safety and efficacy is growing exponentially, making it difficult to delineate an evidence-based guideline on their use. In the study by Scarpignato et al. committees on behalf of three Italian scientific societies collaborated with impressive panels of expert international reviewers to address 13 clinical scenarios in which uncertainty exists about how to prescribe PPIs and where drug misuse is common. They performed a systematic literature review inclusive of almost 500 papers and present a narrative review of the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy in each scenario. Table 1 summarizes the key messages regarding appropriate PPI use in the 13 scenarios, organized into those appropriate for long-term or short-term PPI use, or not at all. Examining this compendium, one is immediately struck by the fact that the table includes many usages for which there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. Apparently, the world literature provides ample evidence for the efficacy of PPIs outside of FDA indications.

Hepatic Effects

There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, three year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1,051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1,046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury.

### Inhibiting the proton pump: mechanisms, benefits, harms, and questions [^98bbd2a2]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Another harm to consider is the risk of gastric carcinoma during long-term PPI therapy. The early fears that reduced gastric acid secretion and the associated hypergastrinemia might induce this complication and limit the use of PPIs have not been allayed. When I searched the World Health Organization's VigiBase database of suspected adverse reactions, I found significant disproportionalities for three of the five currently marketed PPIs, with Information Criterion (IC) values ranging from 1.77 to 2.58. Recent systematic reviews also suggest an association, and this problem needs further study. The risk of pancreatic carcinoma, which is currently increasing in general, also requires clarification.

Other questions about harms due to PPIs remain to be answered. Do all PPIs carry the same risks of serious adverse reactions? Which individuals are most susceptible? What are the time courses of individual reactions? What monitoring strategies are best? How often do important drug–drug interactions occur, through effects on P glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and are some PPIs less likely to take part in them? Interactions with thienopyridines such as clopidogrel, antiretroviral drugs, and anticancer drugs have recently been highlighted.

Finally, we await information on the effects of newer compounds with different mechanisms of action, including potassium-competitive acid blockers, inhibitors of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, serotonergic agents/prokinetics, mucosal protectants, histamine H 3 receptor agonists, anti-gastrin agents, and esophageal pain modulators.

PPIs are not the end of the story.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice on discontinuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) states that the decision to discontinue PPIs should be based solely on the lack of an indication for PPI use, and not because of concern for PPI-associated adverse events (PAAEs). It further specifies that the presence of a PAAE or a history of a PAAE in a current PPI user is not an independent indication for PPI withdrawal, and that the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of an adverse event associated with PPI use should also not be an independent indication for PPI withdrawal. Supporting context notes that reported associations between PPIs and PAAEs are not necessarily causal and that no RCT has yet demonstrated that PPI users have an increased incidence of any of the PAAEs.

### Acid suppressants use and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in middle-aged and older adults [^ec0248a1]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Concerns regarding adverse events associated with the use of acid suppressants have increased. However, the impact of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) on the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains unknown. This study aimed to estimate the risk of ASCVD in association with the use of PPIs and H2RAs.

Methods

This prospective cohort study included participants without cardiovascular diseases or anti-hypertensive treatment at baseline (2006–2010) in the UK Biobank. The outcomes were ASCVD and each subtype (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, and ischemic stroke). The association was estimated by Cox proportional-hazards models.

Results

Among 316,730 individuals (aged 50–88 years), during a median of 12.5 years of follow-up, we documented 13,503 (4.3%) incident ASCVD. Regular PPIs use was associated with a higher risk of ASCVD (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.09–1.23) and every subtype of ASCVD. Among each type of PPIs, omeprazole (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11–1.28), lansoprazole (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02–1.22), and pantoprazole (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.00–1.97) were associated with a higher risk of ASCVD. Stratification analysis showed that PPIs use was associated with a higher risk of ASCVD among individuals without indications of medications for PPIs. In addition, use of H2RAs was not related to the risk of ASCVD (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.85–1.11).

Conclusions

PPIs were associated with increased risk of ASCVD, particularly amongst participants without indications for medication. Our findings are of important practical significance and suggest that clinicians should be cautious in prophylactic use of PPIs.

### Nifedipine (nifediac CC) [^b7d9855f]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

General - Hypotension:

Because nifedipine decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nifedipine extended-release tablets is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure (see WARNINGS).

Peripheral Edema:

Mild to moderate peripheral edema occurs in a dose-dependent manner with nifedipine extended-release tablets. The placebo subtracted rate is approximately 8% at 30 mg, 12% at 60 mg, and 19% at 90 mg daily. This edema is a localized phenomenon, thought to be associated with vasodilation of dependent arterioles and small blood vessels and not due to left ventricular dysfunction or generalized fluid retention. With patients whose hypertension is complicated by congestive heart failure, care should be taken to differentiate this peripheral edema from the effects of increasing left ventricular dysfunction.

Information for Patients:

Nifediac®CC Extended-release tablets are an extended-release tablet and should be swallowed whole and taken on an empty stomach. It should not be administered with food. Do not chew, divide or crush tablets.

### Inhibiting the proton pump: mechanisms, benefits, harms, and questions [^cb8c3f08]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the H + /K + -adenosine triphosphatase (the proton pump) is the final common mechanistic pathway in reducing gastric acid secretion pharmacologically. Proton pump inhibitors are widely used in upper gastrointestinal diseases, including gastric and duodenal ulcers, eradication of Helicobacter pylori in combination with antibiotics, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced peptic ulceration. Reviewing their benefits and harms in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato et al. report effectiveness in these conditions, and harms that are generally mild and uncommon (1–3%). Serious adverse reactions, such as tubulointerstitial nephritis, are rare. However, the risks of gastric and pancreatic cancer are unclear. Drug–drug interactions can occur through effects on P glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. Several questions remain. Do all proton pump inhibitors carry the same risks of serious adverse reactions? Which individuals are most susceptible? What are the time courses of individual reactions? What monitoring strategies are best? New drugs for the same indications continue to emerge, including potassium-competitive acid blockers, inhibitors of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, serotonergic agents/prokinetics, mucosal protectants, histamine H 3 receptor agonists, anti-gastrin agents, and esophageal pain modulators. Their benefit to harm balance remains to be discovered.

### Mitigation and management of adverse events associated with amivantamab therapy [^8132c700]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Incidence and management of MET -associated amivantamab AEs

Common AEs

Peripheral edema

Peripheral edema is commonly reported with MET inhibitors in 21%-50% of patients treated with capmatinib, 51% with crizotinib, 26%-63% with tepotinib, 21%-54% with savolitinib, and 18% with amivantamab.

Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia, reported in 16% of patients treated with tepotinib, 23% with savolitinib, and 27% with amivantamab monotherapy, is a class effect of MET inhibition. It is also a marker of inflammation and an important prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC, as declining albumin levels can occur in the setting of increased active disease burden.

Other MET-related AEs

Of note, some MET -related AEs, such as pleural effusion and increased creatinine, have not been reported with amivantamab. Pleural effusion is reported in 8% of patients treated with tepotinib, and increased creatinine is reported in 19% of patients treated with capmatinib and 18% of patients treated with tepotinib. Although the cause of MET -associated AEs is not clearly identified, some may occur due to the role of MET in regulating vascular endothelial permeability; thus, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors are currently being investigated.

In the absence of formal guidelines, Table 1 summarizes the management techniques recommended by previous review articles for the most common MET -related AEs associated with amivantamab and other MET-targeting agents.

Prevention and management of peripheral edema

In addition to the strategies listed in Table 1, it is important to identify any other medical conditions (cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease) or medications (including chemotherapies, antihypertensives, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories) that may contribute to peripheral edema. If peripheral edema occurs, thorough examination and history taking are essential to elucidate underlying causes. Interventions other than dose interruption or modification are rarely effective.

Prevention and management of hypoalbuminemia

Prevention strategies are not commonly used for hypoalbuminemia. HCPs may refer patients to a nutritionist, and any underlying inflammatory cause should be treated (Table 1).

### Maintenance oral pantoprazole therapy is effective for patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion [^9ec84368]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Maintenance proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is effective for gastric acid hypersecretory states, although data with pantoprazole are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long term p.o. pantoprazole in individuals with hypersecretion.

Methods

All subjects had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or idiopathic hypersecretion. Baseline acid output was measured in the presence of prior maintenance antisecretory therapy before pantoprazole exposure. The starting dose was 40 mg b.i.d. in most cases, and the dose was adjusted to document control within the first 2 wk of therapy. The maximal allowable dose was 240 mg daily. Acid output was measured on day 28 and then quarterly from month 3. The primary efficacy endpoint was documented control of acid secretion at 6 months, i.e., acid output in the last 1 h before the next dose of therapy of < 10 mEq/h (< 5 mEq/h in subjects with prior acid-reducing surgery).

Results

A total of 26 subjects had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (six with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1) and nine had idiopathic hypersecretion. Pre-enrollment therapy included omeprazole in 27 subjects and lansoprazole in eight, and 82.4% of subjects were controlled on their prior regimens. With upward dose titration, acid output was controlled in all subjects by day 10 and in all but two (6%) at the 6-month time point. Median acid secretion on therapy at 6 months was < 2 mEq/h (mean 2.2 mEq/h; range 0–10.5 mEq/h) at a dose of 40 mg b.i.d. for 24 subjects, 80 mg b.i.d. for seven subjects, and 120 mg b.i.d. for two subjects. During the course of the study, five subjects required doses of 240 mg daily. Pantoprazole was generally well tolerated. No cases of anterior optic ischemic neuropathy occurred. Five subjects died during follow-up, all because of events unrelated to the study drug.

Conclusions

Maintenance p.o. pantoprazole therapy at a dose of 80–240 mg/day in divided doses was both effective and generally well tolerated for patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^c3f21980]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Digestive System

Table 2
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Extra-digestive effects

Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly modify their pharmacokinetics. PPIs also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) or with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance. A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) carries a considerable potential for DDIs, since it has a high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. DDIs therefore represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class-effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics, etc.). In addition, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects (extensive metabolizers), so that their half-life ranges from only 0.5 to 2.1 hours. Indeed, the prevalence of poor metabolizers, potentially at increased risk of drug interactions, is as low as 1.2–3.8% in Europe as compared to 23% in Asia. This could explain why only few of the reported DDIs involving PPIs have been shown to be of clinical significance.

Recent studies have raised concerns about a possible adverse interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs (currently prescribed to patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent upper GI bleeding) that could reduce the antithrombotic effect of the former and, therefore, lessen protection against CV events in high-risk patients. However, current evidence shows that, while concomitant use of some PPIs with clopidogrel does attenuate the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, this effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Conversely, denying PPIs to patients at GI risk would result in increased life-threatening GI bleeding.

Hepatic Effects

There has been no evidence of induced hepatotoxicity with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury.

### Proton pump inhibitors: placing putative adverse effects in proper perspective [^57fe8de3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Recent Findings

PPIs are amongst the most widely prescribed and over-prescribed medications worldwide. Although generally considered well tolerated, epidemiologic studies that mine large databases have reported a panoply of putative adverse effects associated with PPIs. It should be emphasized that the quality of the evidence underlying most of these associations is very low and the studies, by design, cannot ascribe cause and effect. These associations continue to be sensationalized in the media and misinterpreted by providers and patients. The unintended consequences are that patients who require PPIs, such as those taking dual antiplatelet agents, are not being prescribed or taking these necessary medications. In addition, physicians are spending an inordinate amount of additional time placing these findings into proper perspective for their patients and reassuring them upon initiating PPI treatment as well as at every follow-up visit.

Summary

Most of the recent publicized putative serious adverse effects attributed to PPIs rely on observational data and have not been confirmed in prospective randomized trials. Nevertheless, PPIs should be prescribed for valid indications and when prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose and the need for their use periodically reassessed.

### Safety of proton pump inhibitor exposure [^cded0131]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Proton pump (H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase) inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to treat patients with acid-related disorders because they are generally perceived to be safe and effective. However, as with any pharmacologic agent, they have the potential for side effects. Many studies have examined the side effects of long-term or short-term PPI exposure. We review the mechanism of action of PPIs, focusing on recently released products that might have greater risks of adverse effects than older products because of increased potency and/or duration of action. We summarize the data available on the putative adverse effects of PPI therapy and propose guidelines for clinicians who prescribe these agents to limit the potential for adverse outcomes in users of these effective therapeutic agents.

Regarding the use of omeprazole magnesium DR PO (also known as Prilosec) in patients with chronic liver disease, any severity:

- Use with caution. Reduce dose.
- Consider dose reduction, particularly for maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis to 10 mg daily, and 20 mg daily maximum for other indications.

### Pioglitazone [^253d8e76]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9.

CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; PCI = percutaneous intervention

Weight Gain

Dose-related weight gain occurs when pioglitazone is used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications. The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation.

Tables 10 and 11 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

Note: Median exposure for both pioglitazone and Placebo was 2.7 years.

Edema

Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone is provided in Table 12.

### PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia cannot be distinguished from eosinophilic esophagitis by endoscopic signs [^770dad4a]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic antigen-mediated disease histologically characterized by eosinophil-predominant inflammation. One-third of patients respond to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment; this group is identified as having PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE). If we could predict the response to PPIs on the basis of endoscopic signs, futile treatment efforts and additional endoscopies to assess treatment response can be prevented.

Objective

To determine whether endoscopic signs can distinguish PPI-REE from EoE.

Methods

Endoscopic images of 30 EoE and 30 PPI-REE patients were included. Baseline characteristics were compared between groups. Complete clinical remission after a PPI trial for at least 8 weeks was classified as PPI-REE. Per patient, at least three depersonalized images were incorporated into a slideshow. These images were scored by two experienced endoscopists according to a validated classification system.

Results

Characteristics were highly comparable between EoE and PPI-REE patients. Endoscopic signs were similar and did not enable differentiation between EoE and PPI-REE [presence of: rings (P = 0.893), white exudates (P = 0.209), furrows (P = 0.371), edema (P = 0.554), crepe paper esophagus (P = 1.000), and strictures (P = 0.071)].

Conclusion

Endoscopic signs at baseline endoscopy cannot distinguish EoE from PPI-REE before a PPI trial; the demographic and clinical characteristics in both groups are similar. Endoscopic features do not enable differentiation between PPI-REE and EoE.

### Proton pump inhibitor-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^907622d9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

We think that a diagnosis of DI-SCLE can be suspected on the clinical features combined with a relevant drug history, and it can be supported by histopathology and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, while antihistone antibodies have no value in this regard. The diagnostic process is challenged by the variation in delay from prescription of the culprit drug to the appearance of DI-SCLE. This aspect is known from other kinds of adverse drug reactions, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angio-oedema, which may also tend to be overlooked. Physicians should not avoid prescribing PPIs when clear indications for treatment are present, but we hope that this paper will lead to a more thoughtful prescription in patients with current or previous CLE, as well as SLE. In daily clinic it is important to screen the medication list in patients with de novo or exacerbated SCLE and to suspect SCLE in patients with a skin eruption developing after the introduction of PPIs. The clinical advantage of identifying DI-SCLE is obvious due to the reversible nature of this condition. This is beneficial in socioeconomic terms, and especially for the individual patient, who could otherwise risk treatment with potentially harmful systemic immunosuppressive drugs for a presumed idiopathic CLE, or a flare in already known CLE. When the triggering drugs are stopped, spontaneous resolution will be achieved within a few months in most cases, with no or minimal symptomatic therapy such as topical corticosteroids or additional antimalarials.

### Proton-pump inhibitors: understanding the complications and risks [^aac282cd]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective therapy for the full spectrum of gastric-acid-related diseases. However, in the past decade, a steadily increasing list of complications following long-term use of PPIs has been reported. Their potent acid-suppressive action induces several structural and functional changes within the gastric mucosa, including fundic gland polyps, enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and hypergastrinaemia, which can be exaggerated in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. As discussed in this Review, most associations of PPIs with severe adverse events are not based on sufficient evidence because of confounding factors and a lack of plausible mechanisms. Thus, a causal relationship remains unproven in most associations, and further studies are needed. Awareness of PPI-associated risks should not lead to anxiety in patients but rather should induce the physician to consider the appropriate dosing and duration of PPI therapy, including long-term monitoring strategies in selected groups of patients because of their individual comorbidities and risk factors.

Nevertheless, 4 months later, when he was still on oral corticosteroids at 8 mg/day, he reported fatigue. He denied any recent fever, gross hematuria, dysuria, or decreased urine output. Initial workup showed an acute increase in serum creatinine level (from 63 μmol/L progressively elevated to 230 μmol/L (n.r. 44–115 μmol/L)) over a 2-week period. His renal and ureter ultrasound was also unremarkable. Urine analysis showed no casts or eosinophils but slight hematuria and proteinuria (0.4 g/24 hours). Blood urine nitrogen was normal. Eosinophil count was normal, but IgE was still high (2075 IU/mL). A test for antinuclear antibodies was borderline positive (1:100). Serum protein electrophoresis was negative for monoclonal spike, and flow cytometry for leukemia/lymphoma was negative. Due to the absence of a clear explanation for the acute progressive renal failure, renal biopsy was performed. Histopathological analysis revealed diffuse interstitial edema with an intense, patchy lymphocytic plasma cells and neutrophils infiltration. Ten per cent of renal tubules displayed atrophy (figure 4A). Immunofluorescence showed IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, C1q, kappa, lambda, and fibrin (FIB) were all negative. Severe acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATN) was diagnosed. Nivolumab was postulated as the most likely culprit drug, while omeprazole could not be fully ruled out for suspicion. The reasons were as follows: (1) ICIs can induce Acute kidney injury (AKI); in a combined analysis of 3695 patients treated with ICIs, the overall incidence of AKI was 2.2%; (2) renal involvement was a common component of DRESS; and (3) accumulating evidence concerned AKI after the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) application, and he was also on omeprazole together with steroids for 4 months. It is difficult to discern the postulated causative drugs from the aspect of symptoms and pathology because the symptoms were both unspecific and ATN was the most commonly reported pathology for both renal irAEsand PPI-associated AKI. We were more inclined to consider his AKI as a continuum of nivolumab-induced DRESS. Moreover, because we prescribed him high-dose glucocorticoids (intravenous methylprednisolone 240 mg/day) immediately after renal biopsy, omeprazole was withheld to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. Creatinine rapidly normalized (about 95 μmol/L) in 1-week period, supporting the speculation it was nivolumab rather than omeprazole that was the most probable causative drug inducing ATN. Renal function has remained stable since then. Steroids were tapered over regularly. He developed a sequential herpes zoster virus activation in his left leg 5 weeks later and recovered after support care.

### Pembrolizumab-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome-like reaction: an atypical clinical presentation [^f23be879]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case

A 61-year-old woman with metastatic rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma presented with a 7-day history of nausea, vomiting, and intractable epigastric pain. She had received her second dose of pembrolizumab 8 days before admission. The first dose had been given 28 days prior, with no suspected side effects after the initial cycle. Her other medical history included type 2 diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease, treated with insulin and omeprazole, respectively.

Initial laboratory workup and abdominal computed tomography were unrevealing.

Physical examination was significant for white plaques on the superior aspect of the tongue concerning for thrush, which prompted oral fluconazole treatment. Two days after admission, the patient experienced periorbital swelling, a facial eruption of erythematous patches, and wheezing, which improved with diphenhydramine, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Fluconazole was discontinued amid concerns of an adverse drug reaction.

On the fifth day of admission, the patient's periorbital edema worsened, and her cutaneous eruption expanded. She experienced pruritic, erythematous to dusky patches and plaques, studded with scattered vesicles and bullae over her abdomen, chest, back, neck, arms, and legs (Fig 1, A). Notably, she did not have skin tenderness or significant mucosal involvement.

Gross dermatologic findings. A, Erythematous patches and plaques with scattered vesicles and bullae on chest. B, Scattered erosions overlying the chest that evolved to desquamating lesions with positive Nikolsky sign. C, Macerated erosions on bilateral oral commissures and buccal mucosa.

Initial histologic sections of a punch biopsy from the abdomen showed a detached fragment of epidermis secondary to subepidermal bulla formation (Fig 2, A) and denuded underlying dermis (Fig 2, B). Higher power evaluation revealed prominent interface dermatitis with marked dyskeratosis and mixed acute and chronic inflammation (Fig 2, C, D). Cumulatively, the findings consistent with an adverse cutaneous drug reaction but not necessarily specific for SJS/TEN. Anti-BP180 antibodies and anti-BP230 antibodies were not present, and IgE levels were normal.

### Effect of renin-angiotensin system blockade on calcium channel blocker-associated peripheral edema [^9b7f116f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral edema is a common adverse effect of calcium channel blockers. The addition of a renin-angiotensin system blocker, either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an ARB, has been shown to reduce peripheral edema in a dose-dependent way.

Methods

We performed a MEDLINE/COCHRANE search for all prospective randomized controlled trials in patients with hypertension, comparing calcium channel blocker monotherapy with calcium channel blocker/renin-angiotensin system blocker combination from 1980 to the present. Trials reporting the incidence of peripheral edema or withdrawal of patients because of edema and total sample size more than 100 were included in this analysis.

Results

We analyzed 25 randomized controlled trials with 17,206 patients (mean age 56 years, 55% were men) and a mean duration of 9.2 weeks. The incidence of peripheral edema with calcium channel blocker/renin-angiotensin system blocker combination was 38% lower than that with calcium channel blocker monotherapy (P < .00001) (relative risk [RR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53–0.74). Similarly, the risk of withdrawal due to peripheral edema was 62% lower with calcium channel blocker/renin-angiotensin system blocker combination compared with calcium channel blocker monotherapy (P = 0.002) (RR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.66). ACE inhibitors were significantly more efficacious than ARBs in reducing the incidence of peripheral edema (P < .0001) (ratio of RR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64–0.84) (indirect comparison).

Conclusion

In patients with hypertension, the calcium channel blocker/renin-angiotensin system blocker combination reduces the risk of calcium channel blocker-associated peripheral edema when compared with calcium channel blocker monotherapy. ACE inhibitor seems to be more efficacious than ARB in reducing calcium channel blocker-associated peripheral edema, but head-to-head comparison studies are needed to prove this.

### Effects of serelaxin on the outcome of patients with or without substantial peripheral edema: a subgroup analysis from the RELAX-AHF trial [^3a9abdb8]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a heterogeneous disorder, with most of the patients presenting with breathlessness along with varying degrees of peripheral edema. The presence of peripheral edema suggests that volume overload is the cause of decompensation leading to AHF, whereas breathlessness in the absence of edema may reflect a "vascular phenotype". This analysis investigated the characteristics, therapeutic response, and outcome of patients with AHF, with and without overt peripheral edema in the RELAX-AHF trial.

Methods

Physician-assessed edema scores at baseline were used to categorize the population into those with no/mild edema (score 0 or 1+) and moderate/severe edema (score 2+ or 3+). The effect of serelaxin vs placebo was assessed within each subgroup.

Results

Patients with moderate/severe edema (n = 583; 50.5%) were more likely to have severe dyspnea, orthopnea (> 30°), rales (≥ 1/3), and elevated jugular venous pressure (> 6 cm) than the patients with little or no peripheral edema (n = 571; 49.5%). The relative benefits of serelaxin in terms of reduction in breathlessness, lower diuretic requirements, decreased length of initial hospital stay and days in intensive care unit/cardiac care unit, and improved prognosis (180-day cardiovascular and all-cause mortality) were generally similar for patients with or without peripheral edema. However, because patients with moderate/severe peripheral edema had worse outcomes, the absolute benefit was generally greater than in patients with no/mild edema.

Conclusions

Overall, patients with AHF and moderate/severe peripheral edema have a worse prognosis but appear to receive similar relative benefit and perhaps greater absolute benefit from serelaxin administration.

Limitations

Several important limitations of our study should be taken into account to place its findings in the proper context. First, the observation time of the clinical trials included in our meta‐analysis was inconsistent, from 4 to 96 weeks, which might influence our results. Second, the evaluation criteria of different research centers for adverse events was variable. Third, publication and reporting biases may affect the results; therefore, further design of randomized controlled trials on evaluation of ERA safety and a long‐term observation study based on real‐world experience are necessary.

In conclusion, our meta‐analysis showed that hepatic transaminitis, peripheral edema, and anemia are the main adverse effects among those reported for ERAs. Ambrisentan was associated with higher risk of peripheral edema; macitentan conferred a higher risk of anemia; and bosentan increased a patient's risk of liver transaminitis, peripheral edema, and anemia. The latter results indicate that different monitoring parameters should be considered for different ERAs.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^c5b42115]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

AP is characterized by pancreatic and peripancreatic fat injury in part mediated by autodigestive enzymes. Excessive stimulation of the exocrine pancreas was long thought to worsen AP and this represented the rationale for using inhibitors of exocrine pancreatic secretion (e.g. somatostatin and its analogs) as potential therapies for AP. Along the same lines, antisecretory agents might be able – via inhibition of acid secretion and secretin release, due to duodenal acidification – to contribute to the inhibition of pancreatic secretion.

Despite omeprazole being unable to inhibit amylase release from isolated pancreatic acini, pantoprazole appears capable of reducing tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells and acinar cell necrosis in rats with experimentally-induced pancreatitis, an action likely mediated by a reduced expression of inflammatory and adhesive proteins, key mediators in the pathogenesis of AP. The only clinical trial to date found that treatment with pantoprazole does not affect the clinical course of AP such as the length of hospitalization, time to starting oral intake or pain relief. In addition, two retrospective studies found that PPI use does not affect clinical outcomes of patients with severe AP or prevent post- endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis. As a consequence, most international guidelines on the management of AP do not even mention PPIs. The only exception is the Italian guideline, which clearly states that the routine use of PPIs is not recommended in patients with acute AP. This guideline and a former Japanese one suggest that these drugs might be considered on a case-to-case basis, provided that specific indications, such as NSAID use, PU disease or bleeding, occur.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive, irreversible, fibro-inflammatory disease of the pancreas, in which the pancreatic secretory parenchyma is damaged and replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in morphologic changes of the ducts and parenchyma. This process eventually culminates in permanent impairment of exocrine and endocrine function of the pancreas. The clinical manifestations of CP include abdominal pain as well as steatorrhea, weight loss, and malnutrition, all resulting from the loss of adequate enzyme and bicarbonate secretion, and the so-called pancreatogenic diabetes, arising from loss of β-cell function.

Chronic disabling pain, which poses a major detriment to the quality of life, is present in nearly 80–90% of patients with CP. Although two meta-analyses found no real benefit of ERT, the role of pancreatic enzymes in mitigating abdominal pain still remains unclear and some experts recommend a 6-week trial of non-enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes.

Peripheral edema, an important indicator of fluid retention in patients, is a known side effect of ERAs and a clinical consequence of PAH and its worsening. 47 In the present study, there was a significantly higher risk of peripheral edema in the ERA group compared with the placebo group.

Further comparison of the 3 ERAs with placebo showed that bosentan and ambrisentan had significantly higher incidence of peripheral edema, but no significant difference was found in the macitentan group. Peripheral edema was a reported adverse effect of bosentan in 9 RCTs. 6, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 25, 27, 28 In our further analysis, however, bosentan‐mediated peripheral edema did not appear to be a dose‐related effect. In the 3 trials conducted on ambrisentan, the incidence of peripheral edema was significantly higher in the treatment groups than in the placebo groups and was usually mild to moderate in severity. Further analysis showed that patients receiving ambrisentan at 10 mg once daily had a significantly higher risk of peripheral edema compared with those receiving placebo. The postmarketing reports in PAH patients showed that peripheral edema commonly occurred within weeks after starting ambrisentan. In addition, a previous study indicated that ambrisentan‐induced peripheral edema occurred with greater frequency and severity in elderly patients; 29% of patients aged > 65 years developed peripheral edema in the treatment group compared with 4% in the placebo group. 48 Consequently, as the most frequently reported adverse effect of ambrisentan, peripheral edema warrants attention at the clinic. Macitentan, unlike ambrisentan, showed a relatively low risk of peripheral edema. 32, 33, 34 The SERAPHIN trial reported that the incidence of peripheral edema was 16% in the macitentan 3 mg group, 18.2% in the macitentan 10 mg group, and 18.1% in the placebo group. 33

### Hydrochlorothiazide-induced noncardiogenic pulmonary edema: BAL fluid analysis [^cddc0429]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-induced pulmonary disease has been described as either an allergic interstitial pneumonitis or a cause of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The mechanism of this rare life-threatening side effect is largely unknown. Many patients show peripheral leukopenia and extensive immunologic studies reveal decreased levels of serum immunoglobulins. However, evaluation of the peripheral blood may not reflect local lung changes. Literature reports of bronchoalveolar differentials on such patients are scarce. Bronchoscopy was performed on our patient, and the lavage revealed a significant percentage of neutrophils (70%) and no eosinophils.

### Dexlansoprazole (Dexilant) [^2e9eeb68]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of dexlansoprazole DR PO (also known as Dexilant):
- **Acute interstitial nephritis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of acute interstitial nephritis.
- **Bone fracture**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis-related fractures, especially with high-dose (multiple daily doses) or long-term (≥ 1 year) treatment.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients.
- **Cutaneous lupus erythematosus, SLE**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of systemic and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
- **Decreased serum calcium**: use caution in patients at risk of hypocalcemia, such as with hypoparathyroidism.
- **Decreased serum magnesium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term (≥ 3 months) treatment with PPIs has been associated with an increased risk of hypomagnesemia, leading to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and exacerbation of underlying hypocalcemia. Consider monitoring magnesium levels before initiating PPIs and periodically during treatment in patients expected to receive prolonged treatment or taking concomitant drugs (such as digoxin) or agents causing hypomagnesemia (such as diuretics).
- **Fundic gland polyps**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term treatment with PPIs has been associated with an increased risk of funds gland polyps.
- **Gastric cancer**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term treatment with PPIs has been associated with an increased risk of rare types of gastrointestinal tumors in animal studies.
- **Increased serum chromogranin A**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as serum chromogranin A levels may be increased secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity and lead to false-positive results in diagnostic evaluation for neuroendocrine tumors.
- **Increased serum methotrexate levels**: use caution in patients receiving high-dose methotrexate. Consider withdrawing proton pump inibitors temporarily.
- **Mask symptoms of gastric cancer**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as symptomatic response to PPIs does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider obtaining diagnostic testing in adult patients with a suboptimal response or early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment.
- **Positive urine THC test**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been reported to cause false-positive urine screening results for THC.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as dexlansoprazole has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.
- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term (≥ 3 years) treatment with PPIs has been associated with an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Levoketoconazole improves clinical signs and symptoms and patient-reported outcomes in patients with Cushing's syndrome [^88e051cb]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome

Significant mean improvements from baseline to Month 6 were observed in the acne global score, hirsutism total score (females only), and peripheral edema total score. Mean improvement was statistically significant beginning on Day 1 of maintenance (i.e. after the end of dose-titration) for hirsutism (females only; mean change − 1.9; P < 0.0001), by the end of Month 1 of maintenance for acne (mean change − 1.2; P = 0.0481), and by Month 4 of maintenance for peripheral edema (mean change − 0.5; P = 0.0052; Fig. 2). Mean changes from baseline to Month 6 were − 1.8 for acne global score (P = 0.0063), − 2.6 for hirsutism total score (females only; P = 0.0008), and − 0.4 for peripheral edema total score (P = 0.0295). No significant linear relationships between mUFC value or change from baseline at Month 6 and changes from baseline in acne, hirsutism, or peripheral edema scores at Month 6 were observed.
