## Question

What is the treatment for preeclampsia/eclampsia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for preeclampsia and eclampsia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying severity. Then, I should stabilize the patient with magnesium sulfate and antihypertensives. Next, I will determine timing and mode of delivery, including expectant management when appropriate. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like HELLP, postpartum disease, and anesthesia. Finally, I will integrate prevention strategies and summarize a practical algorithm, making sure I verify each step against high-quality guidelines and trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classify severity, because management hinges on this. Preeclampsia is new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks with proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction, and eclampsia is the occurrence of seizures without other causes; severe features include blood pressure ≥ 160/110 mmHg, thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or neurologic symptoms, and I should double-check that ACOG no longer requires proteinuria for the diagnosis, which is correct [^c58f1d1f] [^5f733e58].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate stabilization priorities. For any patient with severe features or eclampsia, I should start magnesium sulfate promptly for seizure prophylaxis or treatment, and treat severe hypertension within 30–60 minutes to reduce the risk of stroke, placental abruption, and other complications; I initially thought to target < 140/90 mmHg, but hold on, I should correct that — the acute target is to lower to < 160/110 mmHg rapidly, not necessarily to < 140/90 mmHg in the acute setting, and I need to ensure I choose agents with favorable safety profiles in pregnancy [^410bf88c] [^7fe6694a] [^2d994e29].

> I will now examine magnesium sulfate dosing and monitoring. Standard regimens include a 4–6 g IV loading dose over 15–20 minutes followed by 2 g/hour infusion, or 10 g IM loading with 5 g IM every 4 hours; I should confirm that maintenance for 24 hours postpartum is typical, and yes, that is standard, with close monitoring of respiratory rate, urine output, and deep tendon reflexes to detect toxicity, and calcium gluconate available for reversal if needed [^1e42e00f] [^0715653e].

> Next, I should review antihypertensive choices and targets. First-line agents for severe hypertension include IV labetalol, IV hydralazine, or oral/SL nifedipine; I need to ensure I avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs, atenolol, nitroprusside, and direct renin inhibitors in pregnancy, and I should confirm that the acute goal is to reduce to < 160/110 mmHg within 30–60 minutes while avoiding hypotension, which is consistent with contemporary guidance [^e3afb58f] [^78126903] [^410bf88c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about delivery timing. I should stratify by gestational age and severity. At or beyond 37 weeks, delivery is recommended for any preeclampsia; between 34 and 37 weeks with severe features, delivery is generally recommended after maternal stabilization; before 34 weeks with severe features, carefully selected patients may undergo expectant management in a tertiary center to allow corticosteroids and maternal stabilization, with delivery if maternal or fetal deterioration occurs; I should double-check that this aligns with ACOG and SOGC, which it does [^13d0db69] [^cfac4487] [^400a4dea].

> Let me consider expectant management details and selection criteria. Expectant care is reasonable from 24–34 weeks in severe preeclampsia only if maternal and fetal conditions are stable, with continuous monitoring and a low threshold to deliver for worsening labs, symptoms, or fetal status; I should confirm that antenatal corticosteroids are indicated before 34 weeks, which they are, and that expectant management is not advised when neonatal survival is not anticipated, which is correct [^cfac4487] [^400a4dea].

> I need to check the mode of delivery. Vaginal delivery is preferred when feasible, with cesarean reserved for obstetric indications; regional anesthesia is generally safe unless there is coagulopathy, and I should remember that magnesium sulfate should continue through delivery and for 24 hours postpartum regardless of mode, with ongoing reflex and respiratory monitoring [^1e42e00f] [^0715653e].

> But wait, what if HELLP syndrome is present. In suspected or confirmed HELLP, expeditious delivery after maternal stabilization is recommended, and I should confirm that this applies across liver society and obstetric guidance, which it does; I also need to ensure platelet transfusion thresholds are considered if counts are very low, though that detail is beyond the scope here [^28bad67b] [^16c2adde].

> Next, I should review postpartum management. Postpartum preeclampsia or eclampsia can present up to 6 weeks after delivery, and management mirrors antepartum care: treat severe hypertension promptly, administer magnesium sulfate for seizures or severe features, and monitor closely; I should confirm that magnesium is indicated postpartum when severe features are present, which it is, and that blood pressure often peaks around day 3–6 postpartum, warranting vigilant follow-up [^5ff38b95] [^0715653e].

> I will now examine prevention, because it shapes prenatal care. Low-dose aspirin (81–150 mg) initiated between 12 and 28 weeks, ideally before 16 weeks, reduces preterm preeclampsia in moderate-to-high risk patients; I should confirm risk factors and timing, and yes, ACOG and FIGO endorse risk-based aspirin with the greatest benefit when started early, while universal aspirin is not recommended due to bleeding risk and lack of net benefit [^3b59fb81] [^7cd1a587] [^b7692ab5].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with evidence. Confirm diagnosis and severity; stabilize with magnesium sulfate and treat severe hypertension within 30–60 minutes; if at or beyond 37 weeks, deliver; if 34–37 weeks with severe features, deliver after stabilization; if before 34 weeks with severe features, consider expectant management in a tertiary center with steroids and close monitoring, delivering for deterioration; if eclampsia occurs, treat seizures with magnesium and control blood pressure urgently while preparing for delivery; continue magnesium for 24 hours postpartum and monitor reflexes and respirations throughout [^7fe6694a] [^cfac4487] [^400a4dea] [^0715653e].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and correct any lingering misstatements. Delivery of the placenta is the only cure for preeclampsia, but magnesium sulfate is the cornerstone for preventing and treating eclampsia, and prompt control of severe hypertension prevents stroke and other morbidity; expectant management is a temporizing strategy with maternal risk, and prevention with early aspirin in appropriate patients meaningfully reduces preterm disease; I initially implied a universal < 140/90 mmHg target acutely, but I should emphasize the acute target is < 160/110 mmHg, with nonsevere hypertension managed to 140–150/90–100 mmHg in many guidelines, which is more accurate [^5f733e58] [^410bf88c] [^1e42e00f].

---

The cornerstone of preeclampsia/eclampsia management is **delivery of the placenta** as the only definitive cure [^5f733e58], with timing individualized by gestational age, maternal-fetal stability, and severity [^cfac4487]. For severe hypertension (≥ 160/110 mmHg), **prompt antihypertensive therapy** (IV labetalol, hydralazine, or oral nifedipine) is essential to reduce stroke risk, targeting < 160/110 mmHg within 30–60 minutes [^410bf88c] [^7fe6694a]. Magnesium sulfate is **first-line for seizure prophylaxis and treatment** in preeclampsia with severe features or eclampsia, given its superiority to alternatives [^edf169b2] [^415ff126]. Expectant management is reserved for stable patients before 34 weeks to allow corticosteroids and maternal stabilization, with continuous maternal-fetal monitoring and a low threshold to deliver if deterioration occurs [^cfac4487] [^400a4dea]. Postpartum, continue magnesium for 24 hours and monitor blood pressure closely, as preeclampsia can persist or emerge after delivery [^0715653e] [^5ff38b95].

---

## Definitive treatment: delivery of the placenta

Delivery is the **only cure** for preeclampsia/eclampsia, with timing tailored to gestational age, maternal-fetal stability, and severity [^5f733e58] [^cfac4487].

- **≥ 37 weeks**: Deliver upon diagnosis, regardless of severity [^13d0db69].
- **34–36+6 weeks with severe features**: Deliver after maternal stabilization; do not delay for steroids in the late preterm [^7fe6694a].
- **< 34 weeks with severe features**: Consider expectant management if stable, with corticosteroids and close monitoring; deliver if deterioration [^cfac4487] [^400a4dea].

---

## Antihypertensive therapy

Antihypertensives are used to prevent cerebrovascular complications; **treat severe hypertension promptly** [^410bf88c].

| **Agent** | **Route** | **Dose** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Labetalol | IV | 20 mg bolus; repeat every 10 min to 300 mg total | First-line; avoid in asthma, heart failure |
| Hydralazine | IV | 5–10 mg every 15–20 min to 20 mg total | Second-line; risk of reflex tachycardia |
| Nifedipine | Oral/SL | 10–20 mg every 20–30 min to 50 mg total | Avoid sublingual route; monitor for hypotension |

---

Target **blood pressure** is < 160/110 mmHg within 30–60 minutes; avoid lowering below 130/80 mmHg to prevent placental hypoperfusion [^410bf88c] [^7fe6694a].

---

## Magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis and treatment

Magnesium sulfate is **first-line** for seizure prevention and treatment in preeclampsia with severe features or eclampsia [^edf169b2] [^415ff126].

- **Loading dose**: 4–6 g IV over 15–20 minutes.
- **Maintenance**: 2 g/hour IV infusion for 24 hours postpartum.
- **Recurrent seizures**: Give additional 2 g IV over 3–5 minutes.

Magnesium sulfate **reduces eclampsia by ~50%** and is superior to phenytoin, diazepam, or nimodipine [^edf169b2] [^fad30974].

---

## Expectant management

Expectant management is reserved for **stable patients < 34 weeks** to allow fetal maturation, with strict maternal-fetal monitoring and a low threshold to deliver if deterioration occurs [^cfac4487] [^400a4dea].

- **Indications**: Severe preeclampsia between 24–34 weeks, stable maternal-fetal status, and no contraindications.
- **Contraindications**: Eclampsia, HELLP, renal failure, pulmonary edema, abruption, or nonreassuring fetal status.
- **Monitoring**: Daily maternal assessment (BP, symptoms, labs) and fetal surveillance (NST, BPP, growth ultrasounds).

---

## Postpartum management

Postpartum preeclampsia/eclampsia requires **continued vigilance**, as the disease can persist or emerge after delivery [^5ff38b95].

- **Magnesium sulfate**: Continue for 24 hours postpartum.
- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Frequent checks for at least 72 hours postpartum.
- **Antihypertensives**: Continue or initiate as needed; labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa are preferred [^e482e371].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Severe preeclampsia/eclampsia at ≥ 37 weeks | Immediate delivery after stabilization |
| Severe preeclampsia/eclampsia at 34–36+6 weeks | Delivery after stabilization; do not delay for steroids |
| Severe preeclampsia/eclampsia at < 34 weeks | Expectant management if stable; deliver if deterioration |
| Severe hypertension (≥ 160/110 mmHg) | Immediate antihypertensive therapy (labetalol, hydralazine, or nifedipine) |
| Seizures or severe features | Magnesium sulfate loading and maintenance doses |
| Postpartum period | Continue magnesium sulfate for 24 hours; monitor BP closely |

---

Effective management of preeclampsia/eclampsia centers on **timely delivery**, **rapid control of severe hypertension**, and **magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis**, with expectant management reserved for carefully selected preterm cases. Postpartum monitoring is essential to detect persistent or late-onset disease.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^4c1d50ab]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia and Eclampsia

Guidelines for hypertension, recommend lowering BP to values lower than 140/90 mm Hg. Preeclampsia and eclampsia, however, are self‐evident conditions usually managed in an obstetric department and not in emergency departments. There are many randomized clinical trials comparing the effect of different drugs over BP in patients with eclampsia, but none comparing the effect of different BP targets in maternal‐fetal outcomes. The treatment of pregnant women with high BP should follow guidelines that cover BP and other conditions in patients with preeclampsia/eclampsia.

Hypertension in pregnancy is increasing in prevalence and incidence and its treatment becoming more commonplace. Associated complications of pregnancy, including end-organ damage, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and postpartum eclampsia, are leading sources of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, requiring an emergency physician to become proficient with their identification and treatment. This article reviews hypertension in pregnancy as it relates to outcomes, with special emphasis on preeclampsia, eclampsia, and postpartum eclampsia.

How this review might inform or supplement what is already known in this area

There are a range of interventions known to effectively prevent and manage pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) published guidelines for the prevention and management of pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia. Since then, the WHO has reviewed and updated specific recommendations regarding antihypertensive drug treatment for severe and non‐severe hypertension, when to use interventionist management versus expectant management (i.e. close monitoring without intervention unless the woman's condition changes), calcium supplementation during or before pregnancy, and antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre‐eclampsia. Implementation of these guidelines has proven challenging, especially in low‐resource settings.

### Screening for preeclampsia: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^0ad70228]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preeclampsia affects approximately 4% of pregnancies in the United States. It is the second leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide and may lead to serious maternal complications, including stroke, eclampsia, and organ failure. Adverse perinatal outcomes for the fetus and newborn include intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Many of the complications associated with preeclampsia lead to early induction of labor or cesarean delivery and subsequent preterm birth.

Subpopulation Considerations

Preeclampsia is more prevalent among African American women than among white women. Differences in prevalence may be, in part, due to African American women being disproportionally affected by risk factors for preeclampsia. African American women also have case fatality rates related to preeclampsia 3 times higher than rates among white women. Inequalities in access to adequate prenatal care may contribute to poor outcomes associated with preeclampsia in African American women.

Objective

To update the 1996 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for preeclampsia.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of screening and diagnostic tests for preeclampsia, the potential benefits and harms of screening for preeclampsia, the effectiveness of risk prediction tools, and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected preeclampsia.

Findings

Given the evidence that treatment can reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, and the well-established accuracy of blood pressure measurements, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for preeclampsia results in a substantial benefit for the mother and infant. In addition, there is adequate evidence to bound the harms of screening for and treatment of preeclampsia as no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of screening for preeclampsia in pregnant women.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for preeclampsia in pregnant women with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy. (B recommendation).

### Mechanisms of disease: pre-eclampsia [^c9d17866]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2005). Medium credibility.

Pre-eclampsia, a syndrome of pregnant women, is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Despite active research, the etiology of this disorder remains an enigma. Recent work has, however, provided promising explanations for the causation of the disorder and some of its phenotypes. Evidence indicates that the symptoms of hypertension and proteinuria, upon which the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is based, have several underlying causes. Nevertheless, the treatment of pre-eclampsia has not changed significantly in over 50 years. This review describes the most recent insights into the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia from both basic and clinical research, and attempts to provide a unifying hypothesis to reconcile the abnormalities at the feto-placental level and the clinical features of the maternal syndrome. The novel findings outlined in this review provide a rationale for potential future prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for pre-eclampsia.

### When to give aspirin to prevent preeclampsia: application of Bayesian decision theory [^d139b6c4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is good evidence that first-trimester assessment of the risk for preterm preeclampsia and treatment of the high-risk group with aspirin reduces the incidence of preterm preeclampsia. Furthermore, there is evidence that aspirin is associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal hemorrhagic complications. Against this background, there are ongoing debates whether aspirin should be recommended for all women or to a subpopulation of women predicted to be at increased risk of developing preeclampsia. Moreover, if a strategy of the prediction and prevention of preterm preeclampsia is to be used, what method should be used for the prediction, and what risk cutoff should be used to decide on who to treat?

Objective

This study aimed to compare the policies of universal treatment, stratified treatment, and no treatment with aspirin.

Study Design

Decisions about aspirin prophylaxis were considered from the perspective of the Bayesian decision theory. Using this approach, the treatment policies were evaluated for risks of preterm preeclampsia, effects of aspirin, and trade-offs between the harms and benefits of the treatment. Evidence on the risk of preterm preeclampsia was taken from the Screening programme for pre-eclampsia study, which was a first-trimester screening study for the prediction of preeclampsia. Evidence of the effect of aspirin was taken from the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial, which was a trial of aspirin vs placebo in the prevention of preterm preeclampsia. The trade-off between the benefits and harms of aspirin was specified by addressing the question, "What is the maximum number of women that should be treated to prevent 1 case of preterm preeclampsia?" The number can be considered as an exchange rate between the harms and benefits of using aspirin to prevent preterm PE. Given the uncertainty about the harms associated with aspirin, the treatment policies were compared across a wide range of exchange rates.

Results

For exchange rates between 10 and 1000 women treated with aspirin to prevent 1 case of preterm preeclampsia, the net benefit achieved from the risk assessment and targeted treatment of women at high risk of preterm preeclampsia was higher than that from women with no treatment or women with universal treatment with aspirin.

Conclusion

Universal treatment with aspirin should be avoided. Risk-based screening should be used, and the cutoff for taking aspirin should be determined from the consideration of the trade-off between the benefits and harms and detection, false-positive, and screen-positive rates.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy [^7b8cabd5]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to management of non-severe hypertension, indications and targets, ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate antihypertensive therapy at SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg in patients with gestational hypertension or preexisting hypertension superimposed by gestational hypertension or with hypertension and subclinical organ damage or symptoms. Initiate treatment at SBP ≥ 150 mmHg or DBP ≥ 95 mmHg in all other cases.

### Preeclampsia recurrence and prevention [^e57be27d]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Women with a previous pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia have an increased risk for recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. For severe preeclamptic women in an initial pregnancy, recurrence rates for any type of preeclampsia are very high, approaching 50% in some studies. Significant maternal and fetal complications are more common in recurrent preeclampsia compared with an initial episode. For women who have experienced a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia, a systematic evaluation for underlying risk factors may identify a specific pathway suitable for a specific intervention. Although some progress has been made in developing potential therapeutic options to prevent preeclampsia recurrence, there is a great need for better data to determine who will benefit most from any specific therapy.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^314441a4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia — including superimposed preeclampsia — clinical features and prevention/treatment: Preeclampsia, a multiorgan system inflammatory syndrome, is an HDP characterized by hypertension plus proteinuria or target organ dysfunction, and it develops in 20% to 50% of individuals with chronic hypertension (termed superimposed preeclampsia). Severe features or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome are associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Eclampsia is the occurrence of convulsive seizures, and both preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur before, during, or after delivery; magnesium sulfate in addition to antihypertensive medications are the mainstay of treatment. Low-dose aspirin is the only routinely recommended intervention shown to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae when taken from 12 weeks of gestation in pregnant people at moderate and greater risk, while pravastatin has been investigated only in small studies and larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^1c5ff01e]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The condition presents heterogeneously at varying gestational ages. Primary prevention for preeclampsia with low-dose aspirin is recommended for patients with clinical risk factors. Despite extensive research, there is no clearly defined pathophysiology for preeclampsia or treatment for preeclampsia besides delivery of the placenta. Delivery of patients with preeclampsia without severe features is indicated in the early term period at 37 weeks' gestation and sooner if the patient develops severe preeclampsia. Management of preterm preeclampsia is guided by close assessment of the status of the pregnant woman and fetus, blood pressure control, and surveillance for any clinical progression to a more severe form of preeclampsia that may require preterm delivery. In a preterm gestation affected by preeclampsia, expectant management is intended to provide neonatal benefit though it does assume some maternal risk. Future research will hopefully further delineate the pathophysiology of the condition with the ultimate goal of finding a treatment to avoid associated morbidity and preterm delivery.

### New approaches for managing preeclampsia: clues from clinical and basic research [^a592681f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

One of the most common, and most vexing, obstetric complications is preeclampsia-a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity. Hallmarked by new-onset hypertension and a myriad of other symptoms, the underlying cause of the disorder remains obscure despite intensive research into its etiology. Although the initiating events are not clear, one common finding in preeclamptic patients is failure to remodel the maternal arteries that supply the placenta, with resulting hypoxia/ischemia. Intensive research over the past 2 decades has identified several categories of molecular dysfunction resulting from placental hypoxia, which, when released into the maternal circulation, are involved in the spectrum of symptoms seen in these patients-in particular, angiogenic imbalance and the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Despite these new insights, little in the way of new treatments for the management of these patients has been advanced into clinical practice. Indeed, few therapeutic options exist for the obstetrician treating a case of preeclampsia. Pharmacologic management is typically seizure prophylaxis, and, in severe cases, antihypertensive agents for controlling worsening hypertension. Ultimately, the induction of labor is indicated, making preeclampsia a leading cause of premature birth. Here, the molecular mechanisms linking placental ischemia to the maternal symptoms of preeclampsia are reviewed, and several areas of recent research suggesting new potential therapeutic approaches to the management of preeclampsia are identified.

### Diagnosis and management of preeclampsia [^2526f8d1]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder of unknown etiology. The disorder affects approximately 5 to 7 percent of pregnancies and is a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia is defined by the new onset of elevated blood pressure and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. It is considered severe if blood pressure and proteinuria are increased substantially or symptoms of end-organ damage (including fetal growth restriction) occur. There is no single reliable, cost-effective screening test for preeclampsia, and there are no well-established measures for primary prevention. Management before the onset of labor includes close monitoring of maternal and fetal status. Management during delivery includes seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate and, if necessary, medical management of hypertension. Delivery remains the ultimate treatment. Access to prenatal care, early detection of the disorder, careful monitoring, and appropriate management are crucial elements in the prevention of preeclampsia-related deaths.

### Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy [^8c802ffa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy encompass several diagnoses including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, preeclampsia with severe features, and eclampsia. These disorders occur on a spectrum and can be difficult to predict or prevent. Accurate diagnosis with prompt maternal and fetal assessment and stabilization are a key to timely treatment and optimal disease management.

### Preeclampsia: short-term and long-term implications [^cc077e9c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder that affects 4% of pregnancies and has a high risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality, as well as long-term cardiovascular risk. Recent updates in the definition, diagnosis, and management guidelines for preeclampsia warrant review by general obstetrician-gynecologists. Screening and prevention algorithms for preeclampsia are available, but ultimately the cure remains delivery of the fetus and placenta. Close monitoring for the development and worsening of preeclampsia during pregnancy is essential to optimize both maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes.

### Alternative magnesium sulphate regimens for women with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia [^daa9c51c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Magnesium sulphate is the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of women with eclampsia. Regimens for administration of this drug have evolved over the years, but there is no clarity on the comparative benefits or harm of alternative regimens. This is an update of a review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess if one magnesium sulphate regimen is better than another when used for the care of women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, or both, to reduce the risk of severe morbidity and mortality for the woman and her baby.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (29 April 2022), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials and cluster-randomised trials comparing different regimens for administration of magnesium sulphate used in women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, or both. Comparisons included different dose regimens, intramuscular versus intravenous route for maintenance therapy, and different durations of therapy. We excluded studies with quasi-random or cross-over designs. We included abstracts of conference proceedings if compliant with the trustworthiness assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two review authors assessed trials for inclusion, performed risk of bias assessment, and extracted data. We checked data for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

For this update, a total of 16 trials (3020 women) met our inclusion criteria: four trials (409 women) compared regimens for women with eclampsia, and 12 trials (2611 women) compared regimens for women with pre-eclampsia. Most of the included trials had small sample sizes and were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Eleven trials reported adequate randomisation and allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and clinicians was not possible in most trials. The included studies were for the most part at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. Treatment of women with eclampsia (four comparisons) One trial compared a loading dose-alone regimen with a loading dose plus maintenance dose regimen (80 women). It is uncertain whether either regimen has an effect on the risk of recurrence of convulsions or maternal death (very low-certainty evidence). One trial compared a lower-dose regimen with standard-dose regimen over 24 hours (72 women). It is uncertain whether either regimen has an effect on the risk of recurrence of convulsion, severe morbidity, perinatal death, or maternal death (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (137 women) compared intravenous (IV) versus standard intramuscular (IM) maintenance regimen. It is uncertain whether either route has an effect on recurrence of convulsions, death of the baby before discharge (stillbirth and neonatal death), or maternal death (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (120 women) compared a short maintenance regimen with a standard (24 hours after birth) maintenance regimen. It is uncertain whether the duration of the maintenance regimen has an effect on recurrence of convulsions, severe morbidity, or side effects such as nausea and respiratory failure. A short maintenance regimen may reduce the risk of flushing when compared to a standard 24 hours maintenance regimen (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.93; 1 trial, 120 women; low-certainty evidence). Many of our prespecified critical outcomes were not reported in the included trials. Prevention of eclampsia for women with pre-eclampsia (five comparisons) Two trials (462 women) compared loading dose alone with loading dose plus maintenance therapy. Low-certainty evidence suggests an uncertain effect with either regimen on the risk of eclampsia (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.61 to 6.54; 2 trials, 462 women) or perinatal death (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.36; 2 trials, 462 women). One small trial (17 women) compared an IV versus IM maintenance regimen for 24 hours. It is uncertain whether IV or IM maintenance regimen has an effect on eclampsia or stillbirth (very low-certainty evidence). Four trials (1713 women) compared short postpartum maintenance regimens with continuing for 24 hours after birth. Low-certainty evidence suggests there may be a wide range of benefit or harm between groups regarding eclampsia (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.87; 4 trials, 1713 women). Low-certainty evidence suggests there may be little or no effect on severe morbidity (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.29; 2 trials, 1233 women) or side effects such as respiratory depression (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.61; 2 trials, 1424 women). Three trials (185 women) compared a higher-dose maintenance regimen versus a lower-dose maintenance regimen. It is uncertain whether either regimen has an effect on eclampsia (very low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests that a higher-dose maintenance regimen has little or no effect on side effects when compared to a lower-dose regimen (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01; 1 trial 62 women). One trial (200 women) compared a maintenance regimen by continuous infusion versus a serial IV bolus regimen. It is uncertain whether the duration of the maintenance regimen has an effect on eclampsia, side effects, perinatal death, maternal death, or other neonatal morbidity (very low-certainty evidence). Many of our prespecified critical outcomes were not reported in the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the number of trials evaluating various magnesium sulphate regimens for eclampsia prophylaxis and treatment, there is still no compelling evidence that one particular regimen is more effective than another. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to answer this question.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^57f3bab2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia — definition, frequency, and management thresholds are specified as follows: Preeclampsia is characterized by new onset hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) and proteinuria (≥ 300 mg/24h) after 20 weeks of gestation; up to 7.5% of all pregnancies are affected, but only 25% of preeclampsia cases are severe. Eclampsia is present when grand mal seizures occur. Liver tests cannot exclusively be used to gauge clinical decisions. An expectant approach is advised until after 34 weeks gestation, but delivery is the only curative treatment and after 36–37 weeks there is no advantage in continuing the pregnancy.

Introduction

Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (HDP) are a significant cause of maternal mortality worldwide, contributing to an estimated 62,000 to 77,000 deaths annually and accounting for 18% of all maternal deaths. HDP not only poses serious risks of severe morbidity and long-term disability but also result in high rates of maternal and fetal mortality. While gestational hypertension is the most prevalent HDP, preeclampsia remains the most challenging to manage. Preeclampsia, a progressive disorder affecting multiple systems, is characterized by the sudden onset of hypertension and proteinuria or hypertension with significant end-organ dysfunction, with or without proteinuria typically occurring after 20 weeks of gestation or postpartum. Eclampsia, which manifests as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or coma in patients with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, adds further complexity and risk.

Both preeclampsia and eclampsia contribute significantly to preterm birth, cesarean deliveries, long-term maternal cardiovascular complications, and perinatal mortality. Early diagnosis, along with prompt and appropriate management, including timely delivery is essential in mitigating the severe consequences of these conditions. Clinical guidelines are instrumental in improving healthcare quality by guiding the planning, delivery, and evaluation of care. Specifically, preeclampsia and eclampsia guidelines provide healthcare providers with the tools for timely diagnosis and effective management, enhancing pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, guidelines serve to direct healthcare resources toward evidence-based practices, optimizing patient care.

The adoption of clinical guidelines often requires shifts in healthcare providers' practices, a critical step toward improved care quality. Effective guideline implementation depends on several factors, including the specific content, the healthcare providers themselves, the operational environment, and individual patient needs. The likelihood of successful implementation increases when guidelines are aligned with key enabling factors. Improving guideline applications not only enhances care quality but also maximizes the returns on investments made by healthcare organizations worldwide to develop these standards.

This study, the first nationwide investigation in Iran focused on the assessment of healthcare providers' ability to apply preeclampsia and eclampsia guidelines (Supplementary File 1). Our research examines the extent of guideline use across different healthcare provider groups, aiming to provide evidence-based recommendations for better guideline implementation and to address related barriers like disbelief in guideline, non-practical content of guideline, mother's non-compliance, and lack of facilities.

### A current concept of eclampsia [^0a8ab4eb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Eclampsia is defined by the occurrence of seizures resulting from hypertensive encephalopathy on the background of preeclampsia. The development of hypertension during pregnancy, a serious and potentially fatal condition, is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and death in the United States.(1–3) It is a disease with preventable complications. The pathophysiology of hypertension during pregnancy is unclear, but there is consensus that aggressive treatment is warranted to prevent complications to both fetus and mother. A current concept of pathophysiological character, diagnosis, prevention, and management of eclampsia is discussed.

### The global impact of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia [^407edd9c]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Over half a million women die each year from pregnancy related causes, 99% in low and middle income countries. In many low income countries, complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death amongst women of reproductive years. The Millennium Development Goals have placed maternal health at the core of the struggle against poverty and inequality, as a matter of human rights. Ten percent of women have high blood pressure during pregnancy, and preeclampsia complicates 2% to 8% of pregnancies. Preeclampsia can lead to problems in the liver, kidneys, brain and the clotting system. Risks for the baby include poor growth and prematurity. Although outcome is often good, preeclampsia can be devastating and life threatening. Overall, 10% to 15% of direct maternal deaths are associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia. Where maternal mortality is high, most of deaths are attributable to eclampsia, rather than preeclampsia. Perinatal mortality is high following preeclampsia, and even higher following eclampsia. In low and middle income countries many public hospitals have limited access to neonatal intensive care, and so the mortality and morbidity is likely to be considerably higher than in settings where such facilities are available. The only interventions shown to prevent preeclampsia are antiplatelet agents, primarily low dose aspirin, and calcium supplementation. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Antihypertensive drugs are mandatory for very high blood pressure. Plasma volume expansion, corticosteroids and antioxidant agents have been suggested for severe preeclampsia, but trials to date have not shown benefit. Optimal timing for delivery of women with severe preeclampsia before 32 to 34 weeks' gestation remains a dilemma. Magnesium sulfate can prevent and control eclamptic seizures. For preeclampsia, it more than halves the risk of eclampsia (number needed to treat 100, 95% confidence interval 50 to 100) and probably reduces the risk of maternal death. A quarter of women have side effects, primarily flushing. With clinical monitoring serious adverse effects are rare. Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice for treating eclampsia; more effective than diazepam, phenytoin, or lytic cocktail. Although it is a low cost effective treatment, magnesium sulfate is not available in all low and middle income countries; scaling up its use for eclampsia and severe preeclampsia will contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

### ACOG practice bulletin on diagnosing and managing… [^20787312]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

What is the best treatment for preeclampsia. If the fetus is preterm and preeclampsia is mild, continued fetal and maternal evaluation is appropriate. The best tests for fetal evaluation have not been determined. The Working Group recommends weekly nonstress tests and/or biophysical profiles, twice-weekly testing if oligohydramnios or fetal growth restriction is suspected, and ultrasound examinations every three weeks. Daily assessment of fetal movement may be useful. Is outpatient management appropriate. The Working Group reports that hospitalization is frequently recommended for women with new-onset preeclampsia. After serial assessment, the setting for continued management can be determined. Hospitalization until delivery allows rapid intervention for complications. Ambulatory management may be an option in women with mild gestational hypertension or preeclampsia who are remote from term.

In these situations, frequent monitoring is required, and hospitalization is indicated if preeclampsia worsens. If compliance is a problem, women with disease progression or severe preeclampsia should be hospitalized. Is medical management beneficial during labor and delivery. Significant evidence supports the use of magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures in women with severe preeclampsia and eclampsia. Antihypertensive drug therapy, most commonly with hydralazine or labetalol, is generally recommended for women with a diastolic pressure of 105 to 110 mm Hg. Can anesthesia be used during labor and delivery. If required and in the absence of coagulopathy, regional or neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia is preferred. How should eclampsia be managed. Magnesium sulfate should be given intravenously or intramuscularly to control convulsions and prevent recurrence.

According to one protocol, a 4-g to 6-g loading dose diluted in 100 mL of fluid is given intravenously for 15 to 20 minutes; then a continuous intravenous infusion is administered at a rate of 2 g per hour. Can preeclampsia and eclampsia be prevented. Antioxidant therapy has shown promise, but large, randomized trials are needed. Although controversy exists, calcium supplementation has shown no benefit in large trials, and most evidence suggests little or no benefit for low-dose aspirin as prevention in women in the low-risk category.

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: a practice bulletin… [^0715653e]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Low-dose aspirin therapy should be started between 12 and 28 weeks' gestation for patients with one high risk factor or two moderate risk factors for preeclampsia.
- Any patient with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension at 37 weeks' gestation or greater should proceed to delivery. Recommendations GOOD EVIDENCE Low-dose aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia in high-risk women. Women with one high risk factor or those with at least two moderate risk factors from Table 1 should take 81 mg of aspirin daily, starting at 12 to 28 weeks' gestation, preferably by 16 weeks, until the infant is delivered. Women with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia with severe features or eclampsia should receive magnesium sulfate to help prevent and manage seizures during stabilization and until 24 hours after delivery.

However, there is debate surrounding the use of magnesium sulfate in women with nonsevere gestational hypertension or preeclampsia due to lower risk of eclampsia; decisions about its use in this patient population should be based on physician and patient preferences, as well as the associated benefits and harms. In any patient receiving magnesium sulfate, urine output, respiration, and tendon reflexes should be monitored. Despite interactions with some muscle relaxants used in general anesthesia, the magnesium sulfate infusion should be given to women with preeclampsia undergoing cesarean delivery. Delivery is recommended in women who are diagnosed with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia of any severity at 37 weeks' gestation or later. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are preferred over opioids for treating pain after delivery, with their safety supported by evidence.

Studies of postpartum women receiving magnesium prophylaxis after delivery showed no adverse effects from NSAID use. If the mother's or infant's condition worsens, expectant management should be stopped and delivery performed. If the infant is not expected to survive, expectant management is not appropriate because increased maternal risks are not offset by any benefit to the infant. When a woman presents with severe hypertension lasting at least 15 minutes, antihypertensive treatment, typically with oral nifedipine or intravenous hydralazine or labetalol, should be started as soon as possible and within 60 minutes of presentation to avoid such adverse outcomes as congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, renal failure, and stroke.

### Improving preeclampsia risk prediction by modeling pregnancy trajectories from routinely collected electronic medical record data [^746e21d0]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia (PE) remains one of the great challenges in obstetrics. It contributes substantially to maternal morbidity and maternal mortality worldwide, and within the US, accounted for 6.9% of pregnancy-related deaths from 2011 to 2016 (CDC Reproductive Health: Maternal Mortality) and is substantially higher in other regions. There are significant implications for newborns as well, with PE being responsible for a large percentage of medically indicated preterm deliveries.

PE is characterized by elevated blood pressure during pregnancy, starting after 20 gestational weeks. While moderately elevated blood pressure itself is not necessarily harmful, in the case of PE, elevated blood pressure reflects the multi-system endothelial dysfunction leading to vascular, renal, and liver impairment associated with this disease. Eclampsia, defined as convulsions during pregnancy and/or postpartum irrespective of hypertension, is an especially devastating outcome and may be associated with maternal hypoxia and death. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood but recent evidence suggests involvement of multiple factors and pathways, including maternal factors and abnormal trophoblast differentiation. This underlying complexity helps to explain the unpredictable nature of PE. PE can vary not only in severity, but also in timing of onset and impact on fetal growth. Although there are serious clinical sequela due to PE, antenatal monitoring to determine when delivery outweighs the risk of ongoing expectant management delivery is the standard clinical care plan for PE patients, given delivery is currently the only recognized treatment for PE.

### Evaluation and management of severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks' gestation [^cef2f448]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to review the risks and benefits of expectant management of severe preeclampsia remote from term, and to provide recommendations for expectant management, maternal and fetal evaluation, treatment, and indications for delivery.

Methods

Studies were identified through a search of the MEDLINE database for relevant peer-reviewed articles published in the English language from January 1980 through December 2010. Additionally, the Cochrane Library, guidelines by organizations, and studies identified through review of the above documents and review articles were utilized to identify relevant articles. Where reliable data were not available, opinions of respected authorities were used.

Results and Recommendations

Published randomized trials and observational studies regarding management of severe preeclampsia occurring < 34 weeks of gestation suggest that expectant management of selected patients can improve neonatal outcomes but that delivery is often required for worsening maternal or fetal condition. Patients who are not candidates for expectant management include women with eclampsia, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal insufficiency, abruptio placentae, abnormal fetal testing, HELLP syndrome, or persistent symptoms of severe preeclampsia. For women with severe preeclampsia before the limit of viability, expectant management has been associated with frequent maternal morbidity with minimal or no benefits to the newborn. Expectant management of a select group of women with severe preeclampsia occurring < 34 weeks' gestation may improve newborn outcomes but requires careful in-hospital maternal and fetal surveillance.

### Postpartum preeclampsia or eclampsia: defining its place and management among the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^5ff38b95]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure in the postpartum period is most commonly seen in women with antenatal hypertensive disorders, but it can develop de novo in the postpartum time frame. Whether postpartum preeclampsia or eclampsia represents a separate entity from preeclampsia or eclampsia with antepartum onset is unclear. Although definitions vary, the diagnosis of postpartum preeclampsia should be considered in women with new-onset hypertension 48 hours to 6 weeks after delivery. New-onset postpartum preeclampsia is an understudied disease entity with few evidence-based guidelines to guide diagnosis and management. We propose that new-onset hypertension with the presence of any severe features (including severely elevated blood pressure in women with no history of hypertension) be referred to as postpartum preeclampsia after exclusion of other etiologies to facilitate recognition and timely management. Older maternal age, black race, maternal obesity, and cesarean delivery are all associated with a higher risk of postpartum preeclampsia. Most women with delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia present within the first 7 to 10 days after delivery, most frequently with neurologic symptoms, typically headache. The cornerstones of treatment include the use of antihypertensive agents, magnesium, and diuresis. Postpartum preeclampsia may be associated with a higher risk of maternal morbidity than preeclampsia with antepartum onset, yet it remains an understudied disease process. Future research should focus on the pathophysiology and specific risk factors. A better understanding is imperative for patient care and counseling and anticipatory guidance before hospital discharge and is important for the reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality in the postpartum period.

### Guidelines-similarities and dissimilarities: a systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines for pregnancy hypertension [^2a878f54]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to review pregnancy hypertension clinical practice guidelines to inform international clinical practice and research priorities.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Relevant national and international clinical practice guidelines, 2009–19, published in English, French, Dutch or German.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Following published methods and prospective registration (CRD42019123787), a literature search was updated. CPGs were identified by 2 authors independently who scored quality and usefulness for practice (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument), abstracted data, and resolved any disagreement by consensus.

Results

Of note, 15 of 17 identified clinical practice guidelines (4 international) were deemed "clinically useful" and had recommendations abstracted. The highest Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II scores were from government organizations, and scores have improved over time. The following were consistently recommended: (1) automated blood pressure measurement with devices validated for pregnancy and preeclampsia, reflecting increasing recognition of the prevalence of white-coat hypertension and the potential usefulness of home blood pressure monitoring; (2) use of dipstick proteinuria testing for screening followed by quantitative testing by urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine collection; (3) key definitions and most aspects of classification, including a broad definition of preeclampsia (which includes proteinuria and maternal end-organ dysfunction, including headache and visual symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of platelets, creatinine, or liver enzymes) and a recognition that it can worsen after delivery; (4) preeclampsia prevention with aspirin; (5) treatment of severe hypertension, most commonly with intravenous labetalol, oral nifedipine, or intravenous hydralazine; (6) treatment for nonsevere hypertension when undertaken, with oral labetalol (in particular), methyldopa, or nifedipine, with recommendations against the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors; (7) magnesium sulfate for eclampsia treatment and prevention among women with "severe" preeclampsia; (8) antenatal corticosteroids for preterm birth but not hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; (9) delivery at term for preeclampsia; (10) a focus on usual labor and delivery care but avoidance of ergometrine; and (11) an appreciation that long-term health complications are increased in incidence, mandating lifestyle change and risk factor modification. Lack of uniformity was seen in the following areas: (1) the components of a broad preeclampsia definition (specifically respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, fetal manifestations, and biomarkers), what constitutes severe preeclampsia, and whether the definition has utility because at present what constitutes severe preeclampsia by some guidelines that mandate proteinuria now defines any preeclampsia for most other clinical practice guidelines; (2) how preeclampsia risk should be identified early in pregnancy, and aspirin administered for preeclampsia prevention, because multivariable models (with biomarkers and ultrasonography added to clinical risk markers) used in this way to guide aspirin therapy can substantially reduce the incidence of preterm preeclampsia; (3) the value of calcium added to aspirin for preeclampsia prevention, particularly for women with low intake and at increased risk of preeclampsia; (4) emerging recommendations to normalize blood pressure with antihypertensive agents even in the absence of comorbidities; (5) fetal neuroprotection as an indication for magnesium sulfate in the absence of "severe" preeclampsia; and (6) timing of birth for chronic and gestational hypertension and preterm preeclampsia.

Conclusion

Consistent recommendations should be implemented and audited. Inconsistencies should be the focus of research.

### Interventionist versus expectant care for severe pre-eclampsia between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation [^6a6be70e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Severe pre-eclampsia can cause significant mortality and morbidity for both mother and child, particularly when it occurs remote from term, between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation. The only known cure for this disease is delivery. Some obstetricians advocate early delivery to ensure that the development of serious maternal complications, such as eclampsia (fits) and kidney failure are prevented. Others prefer a more expectant approach, delaying delivery in an attempt to reduce the mortality and morbidity for the child that is associated with being born too early.

Objectives

To evaluate the comparative benefits and risks of a policy of early delivery by induction of labour or by caesarean section, after sufficient time has elapsed to administer corticosteroids, and allow them to take effect; with a policy of delaying delivery (expectant care) for women with severe pre-eclampsia between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 27 November 2017, and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing the two intervention strategies for women with early onset, severe pre-eclampsia. Trials reported in an abstract were eligible for inclusion, as were cluster-trial designs. We excluded quasi-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence for specified outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included six trials, with a total of 748 women in this review. All trials included women in whom there was no overriding indication for immediate delivery in the fetal or maternal interest. Half of the trials were at low risk of bias for methods of randomisation and allocation concealment; and four trials were at low risk for selective reporting. For most other domains, risk of bias was unclear. There were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on most outcomes for the mother. Two studies reported on maternal deaths; neither study reported any deaths (two studies; 320 women; low-quality evidence). It was uncertain whether interventionist care reduced eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 15.58; two studies; 359 women) or pulmonary oedema (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.00; two studies; 415 women), because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was very low. Evidence from two studies suggested little or no clear difference between the interventionist and expectant care groups for HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.91; two studies; 359 women; low-quality evidence). No study reported on stroke. With the addition of data from two studies for this update, there was now evidence to suggest that interventionist care probably made little or no difference to the incidence of caesarean section (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; six studies; 745 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; I² = 63%). For the baby, there was insufficient evidence to draw reliable conclusions about the effects on perinatal deaths (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.99; three studies; 343 women; low-quality evidence). Babies whose mothers had been allocated to the interventionist group had more intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.29; two studies; 537 women; moderate-quality evidence), more respiratory distress caused by hyaline membrane disease (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.81; two studies; 133 women), required more ventilation (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.02; two studies; 300 women), and were more likely to have a lower gestation at birth (mean difference (MD) -9.91 days, 95% CI -16.37 to -3.45 days; four studies; 425 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 31.74; I² = 76%). However, babies whose mothers had been allocated to the interventionist group were no more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (average RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.60; three studies; 400 infants; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.05; I² = 84%). Babies born to mothers in the interventionist groups were more likely to have a longer stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (MD 7.38 days, 95% CI -0.45 to 15.20 days; three studies; 400 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 40.93, I² = 85%) and were less likely to be small-for-gestational age (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.61; three studies; 400 women). There were no clear differences between the two strategies for any other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggested that an expectant approach to the management of women with severe early onset pre-eclampsia may be associated with decreased morbidity for the baby. However, this evidence was based on data from only six trials. Further large, high-quality trials are needed to confirm or refute these findings, and establish if this approach is safe for the mother.

### Care plan for individuals at risk for preeclampsia: shared approach to education, strategies for prevention, surveillance, and follow-up [^7c15bf94]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a multisystemic disorder of pregnancy that affects 250,000 pregnant individuals in the United States and approximately 10 million worldwide per annum. Preeclampsia is associated with substantial immediate morbidity and mortality but also long-term morbidity for both mother and offspring. It is now clearly established that a low dose of aspirin given daily, beginning early in pregnancy modestly reduces the occurrence of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin seems safe, but because there is a paucity of information about long-term effects on the infant, it is not recommended for all pregnant individuals. Thus, several expert groups have identified clinical factors that indicate sufficient risk to recommend low-dose aspirin preventive therapy. These risk factors may be complemented by biochemical and/or biophysical tests that either indicate increased probability of preeclampsia in individuals with clinical risk factors, or more importantly, identify increased likelihood in those without other evident risk. In addition, the opportunity exists to provide this population with additional care that may prevent or mitigate the short- and long-term effects of preeclampsia. Patient and provider education, increased surveillance, behavioral modification, and other approaches to improve outcomes in these individuals can improve the chance of a healthy outcome. We assembled a group with diverse, relevant expertise (clinicians, investigators, advocates, and public and private stakeholders) to develop a care plan in which providers and pregnant individuals at risk can work together to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and associated morbidities. The plan is for care of individuals at moderate to high risk for developing preeclampsia, sufficient to receive low-dose aspirin therapy, as identified by clinical and/or laboratory findings. The recommendations are presented using the GRADE methodology with the quality of evidence upon which each is based. In addition, printable appendices with concise summaries of the care plan's recommendations for patients and healthcare providers are provided. We believe that this shared approach to care will facilitate prevention of preeclampsia and its attendant short- and long-term morbidity in patients identified as at risk for development of this disorder.

11 CONSIDERATIONS FOR UNIVERSAL ASPIRIN IN PRE‐ECLAMPSIA PREVENTION

Considering the clear benefit of aspirin in reducing the risk of preterm pre‐eclampsia, its low cost, and safety profile, some investigators advocate for universal aspirin prophylaxis for pre‐eclampsia prevention. It has been suggested that this would be a more cost‐effective strategy compared to using aspirin prophylaxis in women determined to be at high risk through a process of screening, which has been considered rather complex for implementation. Nevertheless, possible benefits of a preventive strategy need to be balanced with potential harm due to hemorrhagic and other adverse events. Benefits of universal aspirin and long‐term safety of this strategy have not been adequately studied in randomized trials. Additionally, good adherence to treatment is paramount to successful prevention. Compliance is likely to be lower when aspirin is given to the whole population than when recommended to a selected high‐risk group of women counselled based on individual risk. Earlier trials in which pregnant women received aspirin on the sole basis of being pregnant or nulliparous demonstrated an increased frequency of bleeding episodes, low compliance with aspirin at only about 50%, and no reduction in the incidence of pre‐eclampsia. Analogously, universal aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in healthy older adults resulted in a significantly higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and management of eclampsia [^a3684024]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of eclamptic convulsions remains unknown. Cerebral imaging suggests that cerebral abnormalities in eclampsia (mostly vasogenic edema) are similar to those found in hypertensive encephalopathy. However, cerebral imaging is not necessary for the diagnosis or management of most women with eclampsia. The onset of eclamptic convulsions can be antepartum (38–53%), intrapartum (18–36%), or postpartum (11–44%). Recent data reveal an increase in the proportion of women who develop eclampsia beyond 48 hours after delivery. Other than early detection of preeclampsia, there are no reliable tests or symptoms for predicting the development of eclampsia. In developed countries, the majority of cases reported in recent series are considered unpreventable. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice for reducing the rate of eclampsia developing intrapartum and immediately postpartum. There are 4 large randomized trials comparing magnesium sulfate with no treatment or placebo in patients with severe preeclampsia. The rate of eclampsia was significantly lower in those assigned to magnesium sulfate (0.6% versus 2.0%, relative risk 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.28–0.55). Thus, the number of women needed to treat to prevent one case of eclampsia is 71. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice to prevent recurrent convulsions in eclampsia. The development of eclampsia is associated with increased risk of adverse outcome for both mother and fetus, particularly in the developing nations. Pregnancies complicated by eclampsia require a well-formulated management plan. Women with a history of eclampsia are at increased risk of eclampsia (1–2%) and preeclampsia (22–35%) in subsequent pregnancies. Recommendations for diagnosis, prevention, management, and counseling of these women are provided based on results of recent studies and my own clinical experience.

Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia — seizure prophylaxis scope and indications: No consensus exists on prophylactic magnesium sulfate for women with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features, and two small randomized trials (total n = 357) reported no cases of eclampsia in placebo groups and no significant differences in progression to severe preeclampsia; however, given the small sample size, these results cannot guide care. The rate of seizures in preeclampsia with severe features without magnesium sulfate prophylaxis is four times higher than in those without severe features (4 in 200 versus 1 in 200), and the number needed to treat to prevent one case of eclampsia is 129 in asymptomatic cases versus 36 in symptomatic cases. The evidence for routine prophylaxis is less supportive in preeclampsia without severe features and the decision should be determined by the physician or institution, but it is recommended that magnesium sulfate should be used for the prevention and treatment of seizures in women with gestational hypertension with severe features and preeclampsia with severe features or eclampsia.

### Diagnosis and management of atypical preeclampsia-eclampsia [^93a2f0a3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome are major obstetric disorders that are associated with substantial maternal and perinatal morbidities. As a result, it is important that clinicians make timely and accurate diagnoses to prevent adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with these syndromes. In general, most women will have a classic presentation of preeclampsia (hypertension and proteinuria) at > 20 weeks of gestation and/or < 48 hours after delivery. However, recent studies have suggested that some women will experience preeclampsia without ≥ 1 of these classic findings and/or outside of these time periods. Atypical cases are those that develop at < 20 weeks of gestation and > 48 hours after delivery and that have some of the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia without the usual hypertension or proteinuria. The purpose of this review was to increase awareness of the nonclassic and atypical features of preeclampsia-eclampsia. In addition, a stepwise approach toward diagnosis and treatment of patients with these atypical features is described.

### Screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: US preventive services task force final recommendation statement [^f70271a8]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertensive disorders of pregnancy — treatment, management, and prevention: There is no other currently available treatment for preeclampsia except delivery, with timing depending on gestational age and whether severe features are present. Management strategies for diagnosed hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include close fetal and maternal monitoring, antihypertensive medications, and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis when indicated, and postpartum blood pressure measurement and clinical monitoring are important since the preeclampsia mortality risks continue after delivery. To address inequities, one possible approach is to focus screening and monitoring on populations at high risk, and the USPSTF has recommended that all pregnant persons should be considered for low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia, with aspirin use recommended for those with at least 1 additional moderate risk factor. Clinicians should be aware that Black and Hispanic/Latina persons have 2 times higher risk of stroke with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy compared with White persons, race and ethnicity may influence the likelihood of patients receiving recommended treatments, and standardized clinical bundles could help ensure that all pregnant persons receive appropriate, equitable care.

International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Current wider‐scale antenatal care is based on healthcare models developed in the early 20th century. In 1929 the UK Ministry of Health issued a Memorandum on Antenatal Clinics, recommending that women should first be seen at the 16th week of pregnancy and then at 24 and 28 weeks, fortnightly until 36 weeks, and then weekly until delivery. No explicit rationale was offered for the timing or clinical content of visits, yet these guidelines established the pattern of antenatal care that has been followed throughout the world to the present day.

A common assumption has prevailed that antenatal care should be concentrated around the third trimester of pregnancy, where most complications clinically materialize and adverse outcomes can be diagnosed. The current method of monitoring for pre‐eclampsia is based on this 90‐year‐old care pathway that requires that at every clinical visit, women are assessed for hypertension and proteinuria. However, even in the case of early‐onset disease, this approach detects hypertension and pre‐eclampsia only at a late stage of presentation, which does not necessarily allow optimization of care for both the mother and the fetus, namely stabilization of blood pressure, prophylactic corticosteroid for fetal lung maturation, and transferal to a tertiary referral unit prior to the need for immediate delivery, which is the only definitive treatment for this disorder.

In the past decade, major efforts have been made to develop tools for risk stratification and prediction of pre‐eclampsia in high‐risk women, as well as short‐term prediction in women presenting with signs and symptoms of pre‐eclampsia and those with confirmed pre‐eclampsia. FIGO brought together international experts to discuss and evaluate current knowledge on the topic and develop a document to frame the issues and suggest key actions to address the health burden posed by pre‐eclampsia.

FIGO's objective, as outlined in this document, is: (1) to raise awareness of the links between pre‐eclampsia and poor maternal and perinatal outcomes as well as of the future health risks to mother and offspring, and demand a clearly defined agenda to tackle this issue globally; and (2) to create a consensus document, which provides guidance on prediction, risk stratification, monitoring, and management of pre‐eclampsia in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, and to disseminate and encourage its use.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia, including preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension — preeclampsia is a multiorgan system inflammatory syndrome characterized by hypertension with proteinuria or target organ dysfunction, and develops in 20% to 50% of individuals with chronic hypertension (superimposed preeclampsia). In preeclampsia, severe features or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) are associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Eclampsia, the occurrence of convulsive seizures, is one of the most severe forms, and both preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur before, during, or after delivery; magnesium sulfate in addition to antihypertensive medications are the mainstay of treatment. Low-dose aspirin is the only routinely recommended intervention that has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae when taken from 12 weeks of gestation in pregnant people at moderate and greater risk; pravastatin has been investigated in small studies but larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy.

### Hypertension in pregnancy in the US-one step closer to better ascertainment and management [^1e100b8a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Eclampsia is well accepted as both an indicator of severe maternal morbidity and a preventable condition. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, diagnosis of pregnancy-associated hypertension usually occurs after 20 weeks of gestation, with hypertension in the obstetric population defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater. Pregnancy-associated hypertension includes gestational hypertension (hypertension alone), preeclampsia (hypertension plus proteinuria or multiorgan dysfunction), and eclampsia (seizures). It may be debatable whether gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia are a continuum of 1 disease. Clinical progression from gestational hypertension to preeclampsia or preeclampsia to eclampsia can happen in a short time, sometimes in minutes, and each may develop without symptoms of the other conditions. The standard intervention for eclampsia prevention is the prompt administration of intravenous blood pressure medication and magnesium sulfate for persistent severe hypertension. As highlighted in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin, "Gestational Hypertension and Preeclampsia", treatment with magnesium sulfate for prevention and treatment of seizures should be initiated for severe hypertension regardless of the hypertension diagnosis, ie, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia. Prompt, evidence-based management of severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg) is essential for the prevention of congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke among women with any hypertensive disorders. Several countries have nationwide registries of severe maternal morbidities, including eclampsia, that allow examination of the effects of clinical practice on prevalence. For instance, the results from national registration studies of preeclampsia and eclampsia in the Netherlands (2004–2006) and the UK (2005–2006) showed a higher incidence of eclampsia in the Netherlands (5.4 per 10 000 deliveries) compared with the UK (2.7 per 10 000 deliveries). While the prevalence of preeclampsia with use of magnesium sulfate prophylaxis was similar between the countries, the Netherlands reported significantly lower use of antihypertensive medication (16% vs 71%) and higher thresholds for treatment of hypertension compared with the UK. After a decade of efforts to decrease the incidence of eclampsia through mandatory professional training promoting the use of antihypertensive medications for prevention of eclampsia, the incidence of eclampsia declined to 1.8 per 10 000 births in 2013–2016 in the Netherlands.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^7cd1a587]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — Low-dose aspirin timing in pregnancy — most trials initiated treatment between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation, with some reporting optimal results when started before 16 weeks. A meta-analysis of aggregate data from 45 randomized trials reported a modest reduction in preeclampsia when started after 16 weeks (RR, 0.81; CI, 0.66–0.99), but significant reductions in severe preeclampsia (RR, 0.47; CI, 0.26–0.83) and fetal growth restriction (RR, 0.56; CI, 0.44–0.70) when started before 16 weeks. Another meta-analysis reported reduced preterm preeclampsia only when aspirin was initiated before 16 weeks at a daily dose of 100 mg or more (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19–0.57), whereas pooled individual data from 31 high-quality randomized trials found benefits whether started before or after 16 weeks. There is no apparent benefit to stopping low-dose aspirin before delivery; protocols vary from discontinuation at 36 weeks of gestation to continuation until delivery. Discontinuation timing has not been related to excessive maternal or fetal bleeding, and use in the absence of other anticoagulants is not a contraindication to neuraxial blockade. For first-trimester exposure, whether effects on adverse fetal outcomes or maternal benefit are present is not known.

### Subtypes of preeclampsia: recognition and determining clinical usefulness [^966d7a89]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The concept that preeclampsia is a multisystemic syndrome is appreciated in both research and clinical care. Our understanding of pathophysiology recognizes the role of inflammation, oxidative and endoplasm reticulum stress, and angiogenic dysfunction. Yet, we have not progressed greatly toward clinically useful prediction nor had substantial success in prevention or treatment. One possibility is that the maternal syndrome may be reached through different pathophysiological pathways, that is, subtypes of preeclampsia, that in their specificity yield more clinical utility. For example, early and late onset preeclampsia are increasingly acknowledged as different pathophysiological processes leading to a common presentation. Other subtypes of preeclampsia are supported by disparate clinical outcomes, long-range prognosis, organ systems involved, and risk factors. These insights have been supplemented by discovery-driven methods, which cluster preeclampsia cases into groups indicating different pathophysiologies. In this presentation, we review likely subtypes based on current knowledge and suggest others. We present a consideration of the requirements for a clinically meaningful preeclampsia subtype. A useful subtype should (1) identify a specific pathophysiological pathway or (2) specifically indicate maternal or fetal outcome, (3) be recognizable in a clinically useful time frame, and (4) these results should be reproducible and generalizable (but at varying frequency) including in low resource settings. We recommend that the default consideration be that preeclampsia includes several subtypes rather than trying to force all cases into a single pathophysiological pathway. The recognition of subtypes and deciphering their different pathophysiologies will provide specific targets for prevention, prediction, and treatment directing personalized care.

### Pre-eclampsia [^5f733e58]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Pre-eclampsia is a life-threatening disease of pregnancy unique to humans and a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women who survive pre-eclampsia have reduced life expectancy, with increased risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while babies from a pre-eclamptic pregnancy have increased risks of preterm birth, perinatal death and neurodevelopmental disability and cardiovascular and metabolic disease later in life. Pre-eclampsia is a complex multisystem disease, diagnosed by sudden-onset hypertension (> 20 weeks of gestation) and at least one other associated complication, including proteinuria, maternal organ dysfunction or uteroplacental dysfunction. Pre-eclampsia is found only when a placenta is or was recently present and is classified as preterm (delivery < 37 weeks of gestation), term (delivery ≥ 37 weeks of gestation) and postpartum pre-eclampsia. The maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is driven by a dysfunctional placenta, which releases factors into maternal blood causing systemic inflammation and widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. Available treatments target maternal hypertension and seizures, but the only 'cure' for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the dysfunctional placenta and baby, often prematurely. Despite decades of research, the aetiology of pre-eclampsia, particularly of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, remains poorly defined. Significant advances have been made in the prediction and prevention of preterm pre-eclampsia, which is predicted in early pregnancy through combined screening and is prevented with daily low-dose aspirin, starting before 16 weeks of gestation. By contrast, the prediction of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia is limited and there are no preventive treatments. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, in particular of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, and evaluate new prognostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.

### Establishment of a nomogram model for predicting adverse outcomes in advanced-age pregnant women with preterm preeclampsia [^d0968bd5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia (PE) is the main cause of maternal and perinatal death, accounting for 14% of total maternal deaths. In China, the incidence of PE is between 2 and 7%. Among pregnant women, PE damages the liver, kidney and blood coagulation system. If disease progression is not detected in time, eclampsia, pulmonary oedema, cerebrovascular accident and even death will occur with high probability. For foetuses, PE increases the probability of stillbirth, premature birth, and very low birth weight. Moreover, the risk of long-term complications, such as neurodevelopmental disorders, insulin resistance, diabetes, coronary heart disease and hypertension, is elevated.

At present, there is no effective treatment for preeclampsia. Expecting treatment and timely delivery according to the specific patient remains the best course of action. For pregnant women with early-onset preeclampsia (gestational age of onset less than 34 weeks), timely delivery or termination of pregnancy is protective for both the mother and infant. However, they may also both experience various adverse outcomes, such as eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity, and neonatal thrombocytopenia. There are many reasons for a poor outcome, among which greater age is an important factor. With increasing age, a pregnant woman with preeclampsia is more likely to have adverse outcomes.

### Biomarkers and point of care screening approaches for the management of preeclampsia [^65fceac7]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current methods for detecting and treating preeclampsia

Based on the guidelines from various global organizations, preeclampsia is generally defined as a condition that occurs in pregnancy or the postpartum period, characterized primarily by new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension accompanied by evidence of end-organ injury. Specifically, the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP)defines preeclampsia as gestational hypertension accompanied by proteinuria or other maternal end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation. This includes neurological complications, pulmonary edema, hematological complications, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver involvement, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)identifies preeclampsia as new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with either proteinuria or other maternal organ dysfunction. This includes renal insufficiency, liver involvement, neurological complications, hematological complications, and uteroplacental dysfunction. In contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)no longer considers proteinuria a necessary sign for diagnosing preeclampsia. ACOG's guidelines focus on elevated blood pressure with either proteinuria or other complications such as thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral/visual symptoms.

While definitions of preeclampsia historically focused primarily on the combination of high blood pressure and proteinuria, modern guidelines recognize a broader spectrum of symptoms and complications. These include, but are not limited to, organ dysfunction (such as renal, liver, or neurological complications), hematological issues such as HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets) syndrome, and uteroplacental dysfunction. This evolution in the definition allows for a more comprehensive and sensitive approach to diagnosing and managing preeclampsia, with the ultimate aim of improving outcomes for both pregnant people and their neonates.

Most interventions for PE primarily address advanced presentations, incorporating the use of antihypertensive drugs to control severe hypertension and prevent maternal morbidity, corticosteroids to prevent neonatal morbidity, and preterm delivery if evidence of HELLP syndrome or other end-organ dysfunction arises –. Several preventive strategies with mixed efficacy, among them the administration of aspirin prior to 16-weeks' gestation, have been suggested to potentially mitigate PE risk. However, the effectiveness of these strategies hinges on the availability of screening technologies capable of detecting PE biomarkers at the earliest gestational stages, thereby enabling timely intervention.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^dfe0ed06]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia/eclampsia

Preeclampsia is defined by the presence of hypertension and proteinuria after the 20 th week of gestation; it affects 2–8% of all pregnancies. Eclampsia is considered when pregnant women with preeclampsia develop seizures without any other explanation. Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystemic disorder characterized by an abnormal vascular response to placenta growth associated with vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, metabolic changes and increased inflammatory responses. Hepatic involvement may be explained by hepatic arterial vasospasm and precipitation of fibrin within the portal and periportal areas of the liver lobule, which may result in lobular ischemia and hepatocyte necrosis.

The diagnosis is based on hypertension with blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg in two consecutive measures (interval 6 h) and proteinuria: urine proteins ≥ 0.3 g in a 24-h urine specimen, a protein (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL) ratio of 0.3 or higher, or a urine dipstick protein of 1. Women complain of persistent and severe headache with vomiting, peripheral edema, diplopia and blurred vision. Abnormal live enzymes are present in 20% to 30% of cases, with mild to moderate elevation (1.5–5 times normal). Conjugated bilirubin, albumin and PT tend to remain normal. Preeclampsia is considered as severe if the following features are present: pulmonary edema, seizures, oliguria, thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/μL), abnormal liver enzymes associated with persistent epigastric or right upper-quadrant pain and central nervous system symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, blindness or altered mental status. Preterm delivery (15–65%) and fetal growth restriction (10–25%) are the most common adverse consequences to the fetus.

The liver condition associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia does not need specific treatment and the medical approach is based on blood pressure control, relief of associated symptoms and prompt treatment of seizures. After 37 weeks, women with preeclampsia should be delivered. In preeclampsia cases with severity criteria, delivery should be considered at week 34 or even before (24–34 weeks), if there is fetal or maternal worsening.

Seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia — timely delivery is the empirical basis for preventing eclampsia once preeclampsia has been diagnosed, and magnesium sulfate prevents seizures in women with preeclampsia with severe features and eclampsia; in the Magpie randomized placebo-controlled trial with 10,110 participants the seizure rate was reduced overall by more than one half, but in high-resource countries the reduction in eclampsia was not statistically significant (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.19–2.37). A subsequent systematic review found that compared with placebo, magnesium sulfate more than halved the risk of eclampsia (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.29–0.58), reduced placental abruption (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50–0.83), and reduced maternal mortality albeit nonsignificantly (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.26–1.10), with no differences in perinatal morbidity or perinatal mortality; adverse effects were reported by a quarter of women and the rate of cesarean delivery increased by 5% when magnesium sulfate was used.

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: ACOG practice bulletin, number 222 [^3b59fb81]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia — risk-based indication, timing, dose, and evidence are as follows: Women with any high-risk factors or with more than one moderate-risk factor "should receive low-dose (81 mg/day) aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks of gestation) and continuing until delivery". When started after 16 weeks, a meta-analysis showed a modest reduction in preeclampsia (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66–0.99), whereas starting before 16 weeks was associated with greater reductions in severe preeclampsia (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.26–0.83) and fetal growth restriction (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.44–0.70). In a multicenter randomized trial of high-risk women, aspirin 150 mg/day from 11–14 to 36 weeks reduced preterm preeclampsia to 1.6% versus 4.3% (odds ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.20–0.74; P = 0.004).

### Early standardized treatment of critical blood pressure elevations is associated with a reduction in eclampsia and severe maternal morbidity [^c1cf994b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. State and national guidelines have been proposed to increase treatment of patients with hypertensive emergencies or critically elevated blood pressures. There are limited data available to assess the impact of these recommendations on maternal morbidity.

Objective

The purpose of this prospective quality improvement project was to determine if maternal morbidity would be improved using a standardized approach for treatment of critically elevated blood pressures.

Study Design

In all, 23 hospitals participated in this project. Treatment recommendations included the use of an intravenous blood pressure medication and magnesium sulfate when there was a sustained blood pressure of ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic and/or ≥ 110 mm Hg diastolic. Compliance with the metric recommendations was monitored based on the number of patients treated with an intravenous blood pressure medication, use of magnesium sulfate, and if they received a timely postpartum follow-up appointment. The metric was scored as all or none; missing any of the 3 metric components was considered noncompliant. From January through June 2015 baseline data were collected and hospitals were made aware that ongoing monitoring of compliance would begin in July 2015 through June 2016. The primary outcomes were composite metric compliance, the incidence of eclampsia per 1000 births, and severe maternal morbidity.

Results

During the 18 months of this study there were 69,449 births. Within this population, 2034 met criteria for a critically elevated blood pressure, preeclampsia, or superimposed preeclampsia with severe features. Of this group, 1520 had a sustained critical blood elevation. Initial compliance with treatment recommendations was low (50.5%) and increased to > 90% after April 2016 (P < .001). Compliance with utilization of intravenous blood pressure medication increased by 33.2%, from a baseline of 57.1–90.3% (P < .01) during the last 6 months of monitoring. Compliance with utilization of magnesium sulfate increased by 10.8%, from a baseline of 85.4–96.2% (P < .01). The incidence of eclampsia declined by 42.6% (1.15 ± 0.15/1000 to 0.62 ± 0.09/1000 births). Severe maternal morbidity decreased by 16.7% from 2.4 ± 0.10% to 2.0 ± 0.15% (P < .01).

Conclusion

We noted 3 important findings: (1) compliance with state and national treatment guidelines is low without monitoring; (2) high levels of compliance can be achieved in a relatively short period of time; and (3) early intervention with intravenous blood pressure medication and magnesium sulfate for verified sustained critical maternal blood pressures resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of eclampsia and severe maternal morbidity. The reduction in the rate of eclampsia could only partially be attributed to the increase in the use of magnesium sulfate, suggesting an additive or synergistic effect of the combined treatment of an antihypertensive medication and magnesium sulfate on the rate of eclampsia and severe maternal morbidity.

### Alternative magnesium sulphate regimens for women with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia [^56e279ee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium sulphate remains the drug of choice for both prevention and treatment of women with eclampsia. Regimens for administration of this drug have evolved over the years, but have not yet been formally evaluated.

Objectives

To assess the comparative effects of alternative regimens for the administration of magnesium sulphate when used for the care of women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, or both.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing different regimens for administration of magnesium sulphate used for the care of women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

All four review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.

Main Results

We identified 17 studies of which six (866 women) met the inclusion criteria: two trials (451 women) compared regimens for women with eclampsia and four (415 women) for women with pre-eclampsia. Treatment of eclampsia: one trial compared loading dose alone with loading dose plus maintenance therapy for 24 hours (401 women). There was no clear difference between the groups in the risk ratio (RR) of recurrence of convulsions (RR 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 3.05) or stillbirth (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.92), and the CIs are wide. One trial compared a low dose regimen with a standard dose regimen over 24 hours (50 women). This study was too small for any reliable conclusions about the comparative effects. Prevention of eclampsia: one trial compared intravenous with intramuscular maintenance regimen for 24 hours (17 women). This trial was too small for any reliable conclusions. Three trials compared short maintenance regimens postpartum with continuing for 24 hours after the birth (398 women), even taken together these trials were too small for any reliable conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Although strong evidence supports the use of magnesium sulphate for prevention and treatment of eclampsia, trials comparing alternative treatment regimens are too small for reliable conclusions.

Our understanding of hypertension during pregnancy and, in particular, preeclampsia has changed dramatically over the last decade. During the last year (2014–2015), several articles published in Hypertension have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and its related complications.1–38 In addition, Hypertension also published some key research communications that translated important basic science observations into the clinic. Some of these articles are briefly discussed, highlighting their significance to our understanding of the mechanism of the disease, to predict the disease and to treat or prevent hypertension during pregnancy and other preeclampsia-related complications.

### Magnesium sulfate and other anticonvulsants for women… [^7eb51e12]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should magnesium sulfate or a different anticonvulsant be given to prevent eclamptic seizures during labor. Evidence-Based Answer Magnesium sulfate should be considered first-line treatment to prevent eclamptic seizures during labor. Although severe preeclampsia can adversely affect multiple maternal systems, predicting who will have a seizure is difficult. Because the treatment of choice for eclamptic seizures is magnesium sulfate, it seems reasonable to also consider using it for prevention. 2 However, a number of other medications are available for seizure prevention, including phenytoin and nimodipine.

3 However, this Cochrane review found a statistically significant reduction in eclampsia for women with severe preeclampsia, as well as for women with "not severe" preeclampsia.
2. Compared with no treatment or another form of seizure prevention, magnesium sulfate increases the risk of cesarean delivery and adverse effects ranging from flushing and nausea to respiratory and cardiac suppression and death. However, there was no increased risk of negative long-term outcomes to the child at 18 months of age. Although cost-effectiveness is higher if treatment is limited to women with severe preeclampsia, magnesium sulfate remains a low-cost, widely available therapy. 4 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends the use of magnesium sulfate as first-line therapy to prevent seizures in women with preeclampsia.

### Magnesium sulphate and other anticonvulsants for women with pre-eclampsia [^edf169b2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Eclampsia, the occurrence of a seizure (fit) in association with pre-eclampsia, is rare but potentially life-threatening. Magnesium sulphate is the drug of choice for treating eclampsia. This review assesses its use for preventing eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium sulphate, and other anticonvulsants, for prevention of eclampsia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (4 June 2010), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing anticonvulsants with placebo or no anticonvulsant, or comparisons of different drugs, for pre-eclampsia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.

Main Results

We included 15 trials. Six (11,444 women) compared magnesium sulphate with placebo or no anticonvulsant: magnesium sulphate more than a halved the risk of eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.58; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 100, 95% CI 50 to 100), with a non-significant reduction in maternal death (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.10) but no clear difference in serious maternal morbidity (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32). It reduced the risk of placental abruption (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83; NNTB 100, 95% CI 50 to 1000), and increased caesarean section (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10). There was no clear difference in stillbirth or neonatal death (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.15). Side effects, primarily flushing, were more common with magnesium sulphate (24% versus 5%; RR 5.26, 95% CI 4.59 to 6.03; number need to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 6, 95% CI 5 to 6). Follow-up was reported by one trial comparing magnesium sulphate with placebo: for 3375 women there was no clear difference in death (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.53) or morbidity potentially related to pre-eclampsia (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.26) (median follow-up 26 months); for 3283 children exposed in utero there was no clear difference in death (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.84) or neurosensory disability (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.58) at age 18 months. Magnesium sulphate reduced eclampsia compared to phenytoin (three trials, 2291 women; RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.60) and nimodipine (one trial, 1650 women; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.77).

Authors' Conclusions

Magnesium sulphate more than halves the risk of eclampsia, and probably reduces maternal death. There is no clear effect on outcome after discharge from hospital. A quarter of women report side effects with magnesium sulphate.

Eclampsia — definition, timing, and clinical patterns are outlined: it is defined by "new-onset tonic–clonic, focal, or multifocal seizures" without alternative causes; such causes are more likely if seizures occur "after 48–72 hours postpartum" or during magnesium sulfate administration. Eclampsia is a "significant cause of maternal death", and although it is often preceded by premonitory signs (78–83% of cases), it "can occur in the absence of warning signs or symptoms" and can occur "before, during, or after labor". A considerable fraction (20–38%) lack classic preeclampsia signs before the seizure. In placebo arms of two randomized trials, seizures occurred in only "(1.9%)" of preeclampsia and "(3.2%)" of severe preeclampsia patients. In a United Kingdom analysis, "38% of eclamptic cases" had seizures without prior documentation of hypertension or proteinuria, and the notion of a natural linear progression to eclamptic convulsions "is inaccurate".

Severe Hypertension Bundles

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy — including preeclampsia and eclampsia — accounted for 7% of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States during 2011–2016 and also represented a significant disparity (69.8% Black, 43.3% White, and 46.8% Hispanic women). Preeclampsia/eclampsia was the second-leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in California during a 6-year period (2002–2007). On review of maternal deaths from preeclampsia/eclampsia, the California Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review found that the chance to alter outcomes was classified as good or strong in 62% of deaths (n = 33 of 53). The greatest QI opportunities were missed diagnosis and ineffective treatment of preeclampsia and related diseases, which occurred in 65% of the cases where women died of preeclampsia/eclampsia sequelae.

### A literature review and best practice advice for second and third trimester risk stratification, monitoring, and management of pre-eclampsia: compiled by the pregnancy and non-communicable diseases committee of FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) [^b7692ab5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pre‐eclampsia can be subclassified into:
Early‐onset pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at < 34 +0 weeks of gestation).
Preterm pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at < 37 +0 weeks of gestation).
Late‐onset pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at ≥ 34 +0 weeks of gestation).
Term pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at ≥ 37 +0 weeks of gestation).

These subclassifications are not mutually exclusive. Early‐onset pre‐eclampsia is associated with a much higher risk of short‐ and long‐term maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. High‐quality evidence has demonstrated that early‐onset and preterm pre‐eclampsia can be effectively predicted by a Bayes‐based method‐derived model that incorporates maternal factors and a series of biological parameters measured at 11–13 +6 weeks of gestation. When these high‐risk women (with estimated risk ≥ 1:100) are treated with 150 mg aspirin per night, from 11–14 +6 weeks of gestation at a dose of approximately 150 mg to be taken every night until 36 +0 weeks of gestation, the rates of early‐onset and preterm pre‐eclampsia can be reduced by 80% and 60%, respectively. FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) endorsed this first‐trimester "screen and prevent" strategy for pre‐eclampsia and its pragmatic guidance was published in 2019.

### Do women with pre-eclampsia, and their babies, benefit from magnesium sulphate? The magpie trial: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^fad30974]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

The study MAGPIE was published by Altman D and colleagues in 2002 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Preeclampsia and Eclampsia. In the MAGPIE study, the trial question was: what is the role of magnesium sulfate in patients with preeclampsia, and their babies? In the MAGPIE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MAGPIE study, the population was: 10141 female patients. The inclusion criteria were female patients who had not given birth or were ≤ 24 hours postpartum with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria ≥ 1+. The key exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to magnesium, hepatic coma with a risk of renal failure, or myasthenia gravis. In the MAGPIE study, the interventions were: n = 5071 magnesium sulfate (5 g IV) n = 5070 placebo (10 mL normal saline). In the MAGPIE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in eclampsia (0.8% vs. 1.9%; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.6). In the MAGPIE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in maternal death (0.2% vs. 0.4%; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14) No significant difference in neonatal death (12.7% vs. 12.4%; RR 1.02, 99% CI 0.92 to 1.14). In the MAGPIE study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in side effects (24% vs. 5%). In the MAGPIE study, the conclusion was: in female patients who had not given birth or were ≤ 24 hours postpartum with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria ≥ 1+, magnesium sulfate was superior to placebo with respect to eclampsia.

### Expectant management of severe preeclampsia remote from term: patient selection, treatment, and delivery indications [^421eb26f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Severe preeclampsia that develops at < 34 weeks of gestation is associated with high perinatal mortality and morbidity rates. Management with immediate delivery leads to high neonatal mortality and morbidity rates and prolonged hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit because of prematurity. Conversely, attempts to prolong pregnancy with expectant management may result in fetal death or asphyxial damage in utero and increased maternal morbidity. Since 1990, 2 randomized trials and several observational studies have evaluated the benefits vs risks of expectant management of severe preeclampsia at < 34 weeks of gestation. These studies included 1677 women with gestational age between 24 and 34 weeks and 115 women with gestational age of < 25 weeks (overlap in some studies). The results of these studies suggest that expectant treatment in a select group of women with severe preeclampsia between 24 0/7 and 32 6/7 weeks of gestation in a suitable hospital is safe and improves neonatal outcome. For gestational age of < 24 0/7 weeks, expectant treatment was associated with high maternal morbidity with limited perinatal benefit. Based on the review of these studies and our own experience, recommendations are made for the selection of the appropriate candidates for expectant treatment, criteria for maternal-fetal monitoring, and targets for delivery. Finally, we provide information regarding maternal counseling based on maternal condition and fetal gestational age at time of diagnosis.

### Magnesium sulfate for the prevention of seizures in preeclampsia: origin, experimental basis, clinical studies, and the evolution in obstetrical practice [^8a0b7fad]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

For centuries, convulsions unique to pregnancy have been described. In this time, varying therapies-from phlebotomy to narcotics-have been suggested as the treatment of choice for eclampsia. Building upon the discovery of magnesium salts to control convulsions due to tetanus, magnesium sulfate became a suggested treatment for eclampsia. Throughout the 20 th century, several large, clinical trials verified magnesium sulfate as the treatment of choice for eclampsia. In this report, the history of eclampsia management and the study of magnesium sulfate are described. The intent of the report is to highlight the key clinical features with use of magnesium sulfate, the present understanding of the mechanism of action, and the rigor of the studies by which it was established as the current definitive prophylaxis and therapy for eclampsia. Because of the unique pharmacologic properties, it is critical that obstetric providers understand the foundational studies to establish dosing and identified risks with magnesium sulfate application. Additionally, alleged putative effects of magnesium sulfate administration, such as prolongation of labor, are also addressed. Lastly, the challenges with use of magnesium sulfate in the prevention of eclampsia is summarized given the varying definitions of preeclampsia. This report serves as a chronicle to summarize the story of how one of the most commonly utilized agents in obstetrics became the standard of present-day care.

### The incidence of preeclampsia and eclampsia and associated maternal mortality in Australia from population-linked datasets: 2000–2008 [^4c3b62b5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incidence of preeclampsia and eclampsia and associated mortality in Australia between 2000 and 2008.

Study Design

Analysis of statutorily collected datasets of singleton births in New South Wales using International Classification of Disease coding. Analyzed using cross tabulation, logistic regression, and means testing, where appropriate.

Results

The overall incidence of preeclampsia was 3.3% with a decrease from 4.6% to 2.3%. The overall rate of eclampsia was 8.6/10,000 births or 2.6% of preeclampsia cases, with an increase from 2.3% to 4.2%. The relative risk of eclampsia in preeclamptic women in 2008 was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.92) when compared with the year 2000. The relative risk of a woman with preeclampsia/eclampsia dying in the first 12 months following birth compared with normotensive women is 5.1 (95% confidence interval, 3.07–8.60).

Conclusion

Falling rates of preeclampsia have not equated to a decline in the incidence of eclampsia. An accurate rate of both preeclampsia and eclampsia is vital considering the considerable contribution that these diseases make to maternal mortality. The identification and treatment of eclampsia should remain a priority in the clinical setting.

### An integrative review of the side effects related to the use of magnesium sulfate for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia management [^37c1d7a5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is strong, evidence-based, global support for early identification and prompt treatment of women who develop pre-eclampsia, in order to promote maternal and newborn survival. Management approaches have been widely tested, and magnesium sulfate has emerged as the drug of choice. The concerns that are expressed about the safety of use of this drug, should be mitigated by findings from this integrative review that indicate a low incidence of the most severe side effects, documented in studies that used a wide variety of standard and modified drug regimens. The findings demonstrate that across all the included studies the adverse effects that are often of concern to providers occur infrequently, and that when adverse effects occurred, delay of repeat administration was generally sufficient to mitigate the effect.

While every maternal death is regrettable, maternal mortality directly attributable to the use of magnesium sulfate reported in these studies was extremely rare. Early screening and diagnosis of the disease, appropriate treatment with proven drugs, and reasonable vigilance for women under treatment should be adopted as global policy and practice.

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: ACOG practice bulletin, number 222 [^cfac4487]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 222 — preeclampsia with severe features: Delivery is recommended when gestational hypertension or preeclampsia with severe features is diagnosed at or beyond 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, after maternal stabilization or with labor or prelabor rupture of membranes, and delivery should not be delayed for the administration of steroids in the late preterm period. In women at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation with stable maternal and fetal condition, expectant management may be considered, but the expectant management of preeclampsia with severe features before 34 0/7 weeks of gestation is based on strict selection criteria and is best accomplished in a setting with resources appropriate for maternal and neonatal care; because expectant management is intended to provide neonatal benefit at the expense of maternal risk, expectant management is not advised when neonatal survival is not anticipated, and during expectant management, delivery is recommended at any time in the case of deterioration of maternal or fetal condition. If delivery is indicated at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation is recommended; however, delaying delivery for optimal corticosteroid exposure may not always be advisable, maternal or fetal deterioration may preclude completion of the course of steroid treatment, and in the setting of normal fetal parameters continuation of expectant management may be reasonable in the absence of other criteria.

### A literature review and best practice advice for second and third trimester risk stratification, monitoring, and management of pre-eclampsia: compiled by the pregnancy and non-communicable diseases committee of FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) [^98e27655]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on high‐quality evidence, the document outlines current global standards for the risk stratification, monitoring, and management of pre‐eclampsia in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.

It provides the most pragmatic advice for different resource settings — keeping in mind the feasibility, acceptability, and ease of implementation of the advice — to significantly lessen the health and economic burden caused by pre‐eclampsia. Suggestions are provided for a variety of different regional and resource settings based on their financial, human, and infrastructure resources, as well as for research priorities to bridge the current knowledge and evidence gap.

To address pre‐eclampsia, FIGO recommends the following:

Public health focus: there should be greater international attention focused on pre‐eclampsia and to the links between maternal health and noncommunicable diseases on the Sustainable Developmental Goals agenda. Public health measures to increase awareness, access, affordability, and acceptance of preconception counselling and antenatal and postnatal services for women of reproductive age should be prioritized. Greater efforts are required to raise awareness of the benefits of early antenatal visits targeted at women of reproductive age, particularly in low‐resource countries.

Regarding medical management for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to management of non-severe hypertension, choice of agent, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating any of the following antihypertensive agents as second-line therapy:

- clonidine

- hydralazine

- thiazide diuretics.

Treatment Delivery remains the ultimate treatment for preeclampsia. 4, 5 Although maternal and fetal risks must be weighed in determining the timing of delivery, clear indications for delivery exist. 15 When possible, vaginal delivery is preferable to avoid the added physiologic stressors of cesarean delivery. 5 If cesarean delivery must be used, regional anesthesia is preferred because it carries less maternal risk. 5 In the presence of coagulopathy, use of regional anesthesia generally is contraindicated.
5. 4 During labor, the management goals are to prevent seizures and control hypertension. 4 Magnesium sulfate is the medication of choice for the prevention of eclamptic seizures in women with severe preeclampsia and for the treatment of women with eclamptic seizures. 1, 21 One commonly used regimen is a 6-g loading dose of magnesium sulfate followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour.

1 Magnesium sulfate has been shown to be superior to phenytoin and diazepam for the treatment of eclamptic seizures. 1 Although magnesium sulfate commonly is used in women with preeclampsia, studies to date have been inadequate to show that it prevents progression of the disorder. 22, 23. Antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended for pregnant women with systolic blood pressures of 160 to 180 mm Hg or higher 24 and diastolic blood pressures of 105 to 110 mm Hg or higher 4, 5, 25 The treatment goal is to lower systolic pressure to 140 to 155 mm Hg and diastolic pressure to 90 to 105 mm Hg. To avoid hypotension, blood pressure should be lowered gradually.
5. 7 Hydralazine and labetalol are the antihypertensive drugs most commonly used in women with severe preeclampsia. 15 Nifedipine and sodium nitroprusside are potential alternatives, but significant risks are associated with their use.

5 Note that labetalol therapy should not be used in women with asthma or congestive heart failure. 5 Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is contraindicated in pregnant women.
