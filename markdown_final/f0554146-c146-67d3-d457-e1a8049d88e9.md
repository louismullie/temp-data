## Question

Super computer get all super computers involved in the Cordell Reed a.i incident that was located in the highland hospital area… problems out/major problems out…

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the "Cordell Reed AI incident" at Highland Hospital, including which supercomputers were involved, what the major problems were, and how to interpret the incident. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any of the provided sources mention a "Cordell Reed" or a named AI incident at Highland Hospital. Then, I should verify if there are any analogous large-scale IT outages or AI-related disruptions that could be conflated with this request. Next, I will consider what "supercomputers" in healthcare typically refers to and whether any of those are referenced here. Finally, I will synthesize what can be inferred from the available evidence and outline the major problems and implications, while being explicit about what cannot be confirmed from the supplied references.

> Let me first confirm the named entity and location. I need to check whether "Cordell Reed" appears anywhere in the provided sources, and I should confirm whether "Highland Hospital" is mentioned in a way that ties to an AI incident. Wait, let me verify the documents: I do not find any mention of "Cordell Reed", and I do not see a specific "Highland Hospital" AI incident described in the references, which makes me cautious about assuming this is a documented event in the supplied corpus [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider whether the user might be conflating this with a well-documented large-scale IT outage. The CrowdStrike incident on July 19, 2024, caused widespread system crashes and downtime across hospitals, disrupting EHRs, PACS, LIS, and patient portals, and required manual patching that took hours to days to resolve; this matches the kind of "major problems out" language in the query, even though it is not an AI-specific event and does not name "Cordell Reed" or a specific Highland Hospital [^73c62c6e] [^1e0a9d32].

> I need to check whether any of the sources discuss "supercomputers" in healthcare. Let me think about this carefully: the documents repeatedly emphasize computational infrastructure, cloud, and high-performance needs for AI in medicine, but they do not name specific supercomputers or tie them to a discrete incident. The closest relevant discussion is around the computational demands of AI development and deployment, which are typically met by cloud or data-center scale resources rather than named supercomputers in the clinical literature provided [^f527b470] [^bad14c3e].

> Next, I should review what major problems are consistently described in large-scale healthcare IT failures, because that will help me frame the likely issues even if the named incident cannot be verified here. The CrowdStrike analyses detail loss of EHR access, inability to order or view results, PACS and LIS outages, and disruption of patient portals and monitoring systems; these translate into direct patient safety risks, delays in care, and operational chaos, which aligns with the "major problems out" phrasing in the query [^73c62c6e] [^1e0a9d32].

> Let me consider AI-specific failure modes that could be conflated with this request. The literature highlights brittleness, dataset shift, and lack of robust post-deployment surveillance for AI systems; while these are not tied to a single named incident in the provided sources, they represent the kinds of "major problems" that can emerge when AI is broadly deployed without adequate validation or monitoring, which could reasonably be what the user is referencing conceptually [^f10ff60a] [^423d98d4] [^574e3104].

> I should double-check whether any hospital or geography named "Highland" appears in a way that could be misremembered. There is a "Highland" context in the Scottish Highlands regarding drug-related harm and remote access challenges, but that pertains to public health and geography rather than an AI or supercomputer incident, so it does not map to the query's technical framing [^b151d168].

> Putting this together, I need to be precise. Based on the provided references, I cannot confirm a "Cordell Reed AI incident" at a "Highland Hospital", nor can I identify specific supercomputers involved. However, the documents do describe large-scale IT outages with major patient safety and operational impacts, and they detail systemic AI challenges that could be misconstrued as a single incident; if the user meant the CrowdStrike outage, the major problems included EHR downtime, loss of clinical decision support, PACS/LIS disruptions, and monitoring system failures, requiring manual remediation and causing widespread delays in care [^73c62c6e] [^1e0a9d32].

> If the user is indeed asking about the CrowdStrike event, I should confirm the scope and timeline. The faulty update on July 19, 2024, affected thousands of organizations, with 759 hospitals showing network disruptions; 239 services had direct patient care implications, and many hospitals lost EHR, PACS, LIS, and patient portal functionality for hours to days, necessitating manual patching and causing cascading delays in treatment and communication [^73c62c6e] [^1e0a9d32].

> If the user truly meant an AI-specific incident, I should clarify that the provided sources do not name a "Cordell Reed" event, but they do catalog recurring AI risks such as dataset shift, bias, lack of interpretability, and insufficient post-deployment surveillance; these are the canonical "major problems" for AI in healthcare that could manifest as incidents if unaddressed, even if no single named event is documented in this packet [^f10ff60a] [^423d98d4] [^574e3104].

> In summary, I cannot verify the named incident or supercomputer involvement from the supplied references. The most plausible match is the CrowdStrike outage, which explains "major problems out" across clinical systems, while the literature also details AI-specific vulnerabilities that could be the intended topic. Please confirm whether you meant the CrowdStrike outage, a different named event with a citation, or an AI-specific failure mode you would like me to elaborate on with evidence-based mitigation strategies [^73c62c6e] [^1e0a9d32] [^f10ff60a].

I can't find a verified "Cordell Reed AI incident" or any supercomputer involvement at Highland Hospital in the provided sources. Please confirm:

- **Exact location**: Which Highland Hospital (city/state/country)?
- **Incident details**: Date, nature of the AI/supercomputer failure, and any official reports or news links?
- **Cordell Reed**: Who/what this refers to (person, system, vendor)?

If you meant a **different event**, please specify. Otherwise, I can summarize the **major problems** typically seen with AI/IT failures in hospitals — such as EHR downtime, loss of clinical decision support, imaging/PACS outages, and patient safety risks — using the best-available evidence [^73c62c6e] [^1e0a9d32].

### New AI laboratory for the NHS [^678f0ea8]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Data scientists, technology incubators

Many of the major innovations in data analytics from the past two decades have happened only with close NHS involvement. The AI lab will therefore need to support data science in the public sector as well as the private sector. The NHS has not invested sufficiently in its 10 000 or so data analysts, but they are critical to solving healthcare problems and can also act as valuable bridges between clinicians, managers, and data scientists in industry.

We may also need to invest in more "technology incubators" — environments that bring together multidisciplinary teams (including patients) to develop AI solutions to healthcare problems. Developments such as DRIVE, a unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital to develop technologies for better care, have made a start, but more such units at greater scale will be needed to match the government's ambitious innovation agenda.

AI is powered by data. Although the NHS potentially has the best health data in the world, local systems rarely communicate with each other, and the process of accessing and organising data for research is slow and costly. Harmonisation is a priority, but strategic questions remain — for example, how much health data should be stored in national databases and how much held locally and processed according to national standards.

### Bending the patient safety curve: how much can AI help? [^ee9b365a]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

These challenges with the use of AI in healthcare were explored by a conference in October 2021 on patient safety and AI sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) where 110 patient safety and Health IT leaders invited from hospital and health systems, health insurers, vendors, researchers, regulators and other stakeholders shared their extensive experiences and approaches to AI and began to build an agenda for patient safety and AI. The attendees described broad adoption of AI in their organizations — despite few published scientific studies of its effectiveness or inherent safety by their organizations. This multistakeholder conference using Delphi like techniques developed a top list of areas that need focused evaluation in AI and Patient Safety, (Table 1) as well as use cases for specific clinical problems in patient safety that are already being used and need further evaluation (Table 2).

Table 1
Areas of focus for AI and patient safety per RWJF conference.

Table 2
Top use cases for the application of AI to specific clinical problems in patient safety.

AI has significant potential to improve patient safety. However, given the lack of rigorous evaluation of AI in actual current practice, coupled with its surprisingly broad use, we believe the time has come to create a national agenda for a critical evaluation of AI and patient safety. This critical evaluation needs to determine among other things whether the broad current adoption of AI in health systems has actually improved patient safety. This agenda must of course include significant new federal research funding for this rigorous AI evaluation, especially in the area of patient safety, if we are to learn from the already wide deployment of AI in healthcare. The Robert Wood Johnson Conference cited above is just the beginning off that process, which should involve major stakeholders such as hospitals and health systems, public and private payors, outcomes researchers, vendors, regulators, and patient advocates and be convened by a trusted entity such as the National Academy of Medicine.

### Surge capacity principles: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^27eb1b8b]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Situational awareness and information sharing — We suggest facilities, coalitions, and other components of the emergency response system, including those related to government entities, study how information about patients, events, and epidemiology are shared on a routine basis and during a major incident, and Information technology should be leveraged to provide better indicators, more rapid alerting, and better patient data to facilitate decision-making. We suggest the ability to provide dynamic forecasting of the functioning and sustainability of the supply chain be supported by hospitals, with timely and ongoing provision of incident updates to hospitals allowing the facility to tailor its response to the demands of the incident and awareness of other critical care resources in the area allowing the facility to balance demand by either providing or requesting assets, depending on the impact at their facility and other facilities; decisions regarding the implementation of mass critical care and the levels and types of care anticipated will rely on the timely exchange of information that facilitates situational awareness and the specific needs for critical care services as the event unfolds.

### Patient care technology disruptions associated with the crowdStrike outage… [^73c62c6e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In this cross-sectional study of 2232 hospitals with available data, network disruptions coinciding with a faulty cyber security software update on July 19, 2024, were measured at 759 US hospitals. Of the nearly 1100 internet-based services examined, 239 were characterized as corresponding with direct patient care functionality. Exposure A widely distributed faulty software update for enterprise cybersecurity software distributed on July 19, 2024, which, when installed on computers, resulted in a system crash. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was loss of response to internet scanning techniques indicating computer system downtime. A secondary analysis was performed on unresponsive domains attempting to identify the function of the network services provided. The update contained a programming error that caused computers that installed the update to reboot and crash.

Installing the repair or patch for this update required direct manual access to each affected computer and could not be accomplished remotely through the internet — a time-intensive and laborious process resulting in downtimes of hours or even days for many organizations. 18, 19. We also observed that a set of 52 unique HDOs failed to respond to our FHIR scans immediately following the July 19 update. The change in FHIR outage detection occurring during the CrowdStrike event is presented in Figure 2, which displays unresponsive HDO Epic FHIR end points resulting from scans conducted 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the CrowdStrike outage. Finally, we characterized 239 services whose outages may have had direct patient safety implications.

A substantial number of hospitals lost important services involving their EHR, likely preventing physicians from accessing critical patient information, using automated ordering or clinical decision support, or easily viewing laboratory or radiology results. Similarly, externally facing patient health portals were disrupted, threatening to deprive patients access to their medical records, including new results or diagnoses, obstructing the ability to easily communicate with their clinicians or to be reminded about upcoming appointments and potentially even delaying care by obfuscating critical paperwork or authorizations. Foundational critical software platforms, including Picture Archiving and Communications Systems and Laboratory Information System, were disrupted at some hospitals, potentially impacting critical clinical workflows dependent on the rapid results of imaging and laboratory studies.

A number of patient monitoring systems, including fetal monitors, cardiac telemetry systems, and behavioral health applications, experienced outages, which may have had regional effects on some clinical applications, like prehospital reporting and telemedicine systems used to deliver care across distance, during the disruptions.

### Current status of medical device malfunction reporting: using end user experience to identify current problems [^d620e359]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study has taken a bottom-up approach to identify factors that lead to poor reporting of MD malfunctions and failures. The issues are numerous and complex contributing to the difficulties faced by clinical staff. This has an impact on the level of intelligent information transfer to clinicians and manufacturers and raises patient safety concerns. The focus on incidents has created many limitations in learning and development and performance data for evidence-based decisions. Having an appropriate performance reporting system that allows interaction with end users and management for data interrogation, can lead to informed decision making and assist in preventing patient related incidents.

Significant changes and thinking outside the box are required to overcome the discussed problems. The rich end user experience should be used appropriately with their involvement at all stages.

Challenges related to machine learning science

AI algorithms have the potential to suffer from a host of shortcomings, including inapplicability outside of the training domain, bias and brittleness (tendency to be easily fooled). Important factors for consideration include dataset shift, accidentally fitting confounders rather than true signal, propagating unintentional biases in clinical practice, providing algorithms with interpretability, developing reliable measures of model confidence, and the challenge of generalisation to different populations.

Dataset shift

Particularly important for EHR algorithms, it is easy to ignore the fact that all input data are generated within a non-stationary environment with shifting patient populations, where clinical and operational practices evolve over time. The introduction of a new predictive algorithm may cause changes in practice, resulting in a new distribution compared to that used to train the algorithm. Therefore, methods to identify drift and update models in response to deteriorating performance are critical. Mitigations to manage this effect include careful quantification of performance over time to proactively identify problems, alongside the likely requirement for periodical retraining. Data-driven testing procedures have been suggested to recommend the most appropriate updating method, from simple recalibration to full model retraining, in order to maintain performance over time.

### Committee opinion no. 621: patient safety and health information technology [^c3b58597]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Patient safety and health information technology — recognized risks and system design needs include that improvement is needed with all health IT, especially regarding design, implementation, and integration between platforms within the work environment, and robust interoperability is critical for safe care but has proved elusive. Significant patient safety concerns already have been recognized, and in the 2013 list of hazards by ECRI Institute, four of the top ten hazards were directly related to health IT. Technology-related adverse events can be associated with all components of a comprehensive technology system and may involve errors of either commission or omission, and these unintended adverse events typically stem from human-machine interfaces or organization/system design. The use of alerts to warn health care providers of potential problems is a powerful tool.

### Guidelines for clinical trial protocols for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the SPIRIT-AI extension [^f7fe66ba]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

One topic which was raised in the Delphi survey responses and consensus meeting, which is not included in the final guidelines, is "continuously evolving" AI systems (also known as "continuously adapting" or "continuously learning"). These are AI systems with the ability to continuously train on new data, which may cause changes in performance over time. The group noted that, while of interest, this field is relatively early in its development without tangible examples in healthcare applications, and that it would not be appropriate for it to be addressed by SPIRIT-AI at this stage. This topic will be monitored and revisited in future iterations of SPIRIT-AI. It is worth noting that incremental software changes, whether continuous or iterative, intentional or unintentional, could have serious consequences on safety performance after deployment. It is therefore of vital importance that such changes are documented and identified by software version and a robust post-deployment surveillance plan is in place.

This study is set in the current context of AI in health; therefore, several limitations should be noted. First, at the time of SPIRIT-AI development there were only seven published trials and no published trial protocols in the field of AI for healthcare. Thus, the discussion and decisions made during the development of SPIRIT-AI are not always supported by existing real-world examples. This arises from our stated aim to address the issues of poor protocol development in this field as early as possible, recognising the strong drivers in the field and the specific challenges of study design and reporting for AI. As the science and study of AI evolves, we welcome collaboration with investigators to co-evolve these reporting standards to ensure their continued relevance. Second, the literature search of AI RCTs used terminology such as "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", and "deep learning" but not terms such as "clinical decision support systems" and "expert systems", which were more commonly used in the 1990s for technologies underpinned by AI systems and share similar risks with recent examples. It is likely that such systems, if published today, would be indexed under "AI" or "machine learning"; however, clinical decision support systems were not actively discussed during this consensus process. Third, the initial candidate items list was generated by a relatively small group of experts consisting of steering group members and additional international experts. However, additional items from the wider Delphi group were taken forward for consideration by the consensus group, and no new items were suggested during the consensus meeting or post-meeting evaluation.

The topic of "continuously evolving" AI systems (also known as "continuously adapting" or "continuously learning") was discussed at length during the consensus meeting, but was agreed to be excluded from CONSORT-AI.

### Addressing the challenges of implementing artificial intelligence tools in clinical practice: principles from experience [^a66d7f39]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The multitude of artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, vendors, and platforms poses a challenging proposition to an already complex clinical radiology practice. Apart from assessing and ensuring acceptable local performance and workflow fit to improve imaging services, AI tools require multiple stakeholders, including clinical, technical, and financial, who collaborate to move potential deployable applications to full clinical deployment in a structured and efficient manner. Postdeployment monitoring and surveillance of such tools require an infrastructure that ensures proper and safe use. Herein, the authors describe their experience and framework for implementing and supporting the use of AI applications in radiology workflow.

### Improving incident reporting among physicians at south health campus hospital [^65c78246]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Lessons and limitations

We achieved a significant increase in the proportion of physician-submitted reports at SHC since 2017, when we introduced a multifaceted intervention involving direct responses from physician leadership to each physician-submitted RLS report, multimedia demonstrations of efficient RLS submission to physician groups and medical learners, and linkage to materials on safe disclosures. The increased proportion of physician-submitted reports at our hospital has been sustained for several years and integrated into our hospital's Safety Culture.

One challenge for the Patient Safety team has been ensuring resources to manage the higher volume of cases reported. Fortunately, we have a very dedicated Patient Safety team that has been very committed to prioritising this RLS initiative. While there was straight-forward resolution in the majority of RLS cases, some complex and serious cases have required considerable time to thoroughly address. A number of cases required escalation to a formal organisational Quality Assurance Review or Patient Safety Review using AHS Systems Analysis Methodology, to evaluate the root causes of some of the problems uncovered. Those cases often required a collaborative problem-solving approach, and our site was able to engage some front-line physician RLS report submitters to become part of the review team, helping to first identify root causes and, subsequently, solutions for the same safety problems they had reported via the RLS system. Although the initial aim of this project was to improve our hospital's safety culture by increasing front-line physicians' use of the RLS system, inadvertently, some of these physicians have gained in-depth exposure to patient safety concepts and incident analysis skills, beyond what we had anticipated. The benefits of our quality improvement initiative in enhancing Safety Culture at our hospital have transcended the increase in the number of RLS submissions themselves.

### Implementing artificial intelligence in critical care medicine: a consensus of 22 [^f527b470]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Main barriers and challenges for AI integration in critical care

The main barriers to AI implementation in critical care determined by the expert consensus are presented in this section. These unresolved and evolving challenges have prompted us to develop a series of recommendations to physicians and other healthcare workers, patients, and societal stakeholders, emphasizing the principles we believe should guide the advancement of AI in healthcare. Challenges and principles are divided into four main areas, 1) human-centric AI; 2) Recommendation for clinician training on AI use; 3) standardization of data models and networks and 4) AI governance. These are summarized in Fig. 2 and discussed in more detail in the next paragraphs.

Fig. 2
Recommendations, according to development of standards for networking, data sharing and research, ethical challenges, regulations and societal challenges, and clinical practice

The development and maintenance of AI applications in medicine require enormous computational power, infrastructure, funding and technical expertise. Consequently, AI development is led by major technology companies whose goals may not always align with those of patients or healthcare systems. The rapid diffusion of new AI models contrasts sharply with the evidence-based culture of medicine. This raises concerns about the deployment of insufficiently validated clinical models.

Moreover, many models are developed using datasets that underrepresent vulnerable populations, leading to algorithmic bias. AI models may lack both temporal validity (when applied to new data in a different time) and geographic validity (when applied across different institutions or regions). Variability in temporal or geographical disease patterns including demographics, healthcare infrastructure, and the design of Electronic Health Records (EHR) further complicates generalizability.

Finally, the use of AI raises ethical concerns, including trust in algorithmic recommendations and the risk of weakening the human connection at the core of medical practice, which is the millenary relation between physicians and patients.

Recommendations

Here we report recommendations, divided in four domains. Figure 3 reports a summary of five representative AI use cases in critical care — ranging from waveform analysis to personalized clinician training — mapped across these four domains.

### Report of the consensus conference on diagnostic criteria of ALI / ARDS at high altitudes in Western China [^5a1ed917]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

China is a mountainous country. The Qing-Zang plateau, Yun-Gui plateau, and Yellow Land plateau, which are known as the world's ridge, are located in the west of China. The highland area over 3,000 m in height occupies one-sixth of the land area of China and half the highland area of the world. About 60–80 million people live in the regions where the elevation ranges from 1,500 m to 4,000 m. In the latter half of the last century, the influence of complex environmental factors on the human body, such as low oxygen pressure, cold climate, strong radiation, high wind speed, and super-evaporation, were studied in an extensive and profound way and formed an important field of altitude medicine. For a long time, many researchers have carried out investigations related to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and its pathophysiological mechanism initiated by cytokines and mediators, regarding which many problems are still unclear. However, systematic research into the mechanism from SIRS to ARDS to MODS in the highlands remains blank. The diagnostic criteria of ALI/ARDS in the highlands are quite different from that in the plain, and thus was a central topic for discussion at this meeting.

### Outbreak response and incident management: SHEA guidance and resources for healthcare epidemiologists in United States acute-care hospitals [^c483a71b]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Medium credibility.

SHEA expert guidance on outbreak response and incident management — developed as a resource for healthcare epidemiologists in acute-care hospitals — provides a high-level overview of incident management and preparation to work within an emergency response framework. It addresses how the healthcare epidemiologist's skills and expertise apply to scenarios requiring enhanced preparedness and response efforts, including healthcare personnel education, enhanced infection prevention and control measures, added staffing, supplies, and resources, adjustments to clinical and support activities, and external communications. Its recommendations are not pathogen-specific and are meant to apply to a range of potential infectious disease outbreaks. Guidance development involved multidisciplinary experts in public health, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, community medicine, microbiology, pediatrics, and long-term care, with additional expertise in infectious diseases including Ebola virus disease (EVD), pandemic influenza, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Zika virus.

### Resource-poor settings: infrastructure and capacity building: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^eb4b03f9]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Resource-poor settings — protracted critical care events: We suggest feasibility planning for long-duration surges in critical care, stating, "We suggest feasibility plans of a protracted event requiring long-term use of critical care resources be developed, whereby the health-care system will require a coordination between less resource-intense but large numbers of primary care patients in concert with resource-intense but fewer critical care patients". The page further emphasizes system-level preparation: "Health-care systems need to study the implications of protracted health-care events in which the care of additional, resource-intense critical care patients will have to be delivered in concert with the routine healthcare needs of the general population and other competing hospital operations".

### Summary from the 2025 international society for magnetic resonance in medicine workshop on body MRI: unsolved problems and unmet needs [^f1344f36]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2026). Medium credibility.

Despite major methodological advances in body MRI, Victoria Chernyak, MD, MS (United States), noted that there is still a significant delay in bringing these advances into clinical practice. Factors include the lack of hands‐on experience and dedicated time for staff to learn new techniques. These issues are compounded by the competing demand of increasing clinical volume and the pressure to increase patient throughput. Additionally, many sites use multiple vendors and/or have scanners of varying capabilities depending on the software and systems version, so protocols within and across institutions can be quite variable. Some sequences also remain quite vulnerable to artifacts such as MR cholangiopancreatography and DWI, and results in clinical practice can be inconsistent, even at sites with a high level of MR expertise. She challenged attendees to consider developing a standardized method for reporting of MRI artifacts and other image quality concerns, such that within an institution and across collaborative sites, issues can be tracked and systematically addressed. Additionally, a mechanism to measure the clinical impact of these issues should be developed. Automation of such tools, perhaps with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) to assist technologists, physicists, and radiologists in optimizing image quality and mitigating artifacts, could lead to improved consistency over time.

### Clinical review: communication and logistics in the response to the 1998 terrorist bombing in omagh, Northern Ireland [^bcee5c8f]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

The Omagh bombing in August 1998 produced many of the problems documented in other major incidents. An initial imbalance between the demand and supply of clinical resources at the local hospital, poor information due to telecommunication problems, the need to triage victims and the need to transport the most severely injured significant distances were the most serious issues. The Royal Group Hospitals Trust (RGHT) received 30 severely injured secondary transfers over a 5-hour period, which stressed the hospital's systems even with the presence of extra staff that arrived voluntarily before the hospital's major incident plan was activated. Many patients were transferred to the RGHT by helicopter, but much of the time the gained advantage was lost due to lack of a helipad within the RGHT site. Identifying patients and tracking them through the hospital system was problematic. While the major incident plan ensured that communication with the relatives and the media was effective and timely, communication between the key clinical and managerial staff was hampered by the need to be mobile and by the limitations of the internal telephone system. The use of mobile anaesthetic teams helped maintain the flow of patients between the Emergency Department and radiology, operating theatres or the intensive care unit (ICU). The mobile anaesthetic teams were also responsible for efficient and timely resupply of the Emergency Department, which worked well. In the days that followed many victims required further surgical procedures. Coordination of the multidisciplinary teams required for many of these procedures was difficult. Although only seven patients required admission to adult general intensive care, no ICU beds were available for other admissions over the following 5 days. A total of 165 days of adult ICU treatment were required for the victims of the bombing.

### The barrow-in-furness legionnaires' outbreak: qualitative study of the hospital response and the role of the major incident plan [^c820c9c3]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To document the organisational response of Furness General Hospital to the large outbreak of legionnaire's disease in April 2002 and assess the contribution made by the hospital's major incident plan.

Method

Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts and written comments from some staff involved in the management of the incident. Documentary analysis of major incident plan and other written materials.

Results

The incident posed considerable managerial and clinical problems and this paper describes how they were overcome. In particular, strategies for dealing with supply (of staff, beds, and resources) and managing demand (by liaising with primary care and the public) seem to have been successful. Many functions necessary for managing the incident were poorly dealt with in the plan, especially procedures for handling the news media and liaison with agencies outside the hospital. Lack of explicit guidance appeared not to hinder the organisational response. There may have been an unspoken high level decision to allow staff to draw on their skills and experience in improvising a response to the initial challenge and learning adaptively as the incident unfolded. There was also evidence that staff disregarded existing job and role boundaries and focused instead on tasks, working flexibly to ensure that these tasks were completed.

Conclusions

Protracted major incidents pose particular management challenges and may benefit from an approach different from that set out in typical major incident plans. Staff must be able to act flexibly and responsively. Some form of checklist or toolkit may be preferable to a detailed plan for some types of incident.

### Accessing acute care hospitals in the San Francisco bay area after a major hayward earthquake [^5f06d186]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Network model: acute care accessibility modeling

We denote G = (v, e) a graph, where v is the set of ∣ v ∣ vertices and e the set of ∣ e ∣ edges. This graph will represent the infrastructure system of hospitals and roads supporting healthcare access in the Bay Area. Let p ∈ p be a vertex representing the location of a patient needing acute care and p be the set of all patient vertices. Also, let h ∈ h be a vertex representing the location of an acute care hospital and h be the set of all hospital nodes. In this case, p ⊆ v, and h ⊆ v. e = {(u, v)∣ u, v ∈ v } is the set of ∣ v ∣ edges representing different roads connecting different locations (vertices) in the region. We denotethe travel time between vertices u and v.

To analyze healthcare access, we evaluate the shortest travel times for a patient in node p to reach any hospital vertex in the set h. We modeled hospital h as a source vertex and found the shortest paths to all vertices p ∈ p simultaneously, resulting in a shortest-path tree problem. This approach is faster than computing multiple shortest for each pair h and p, separately. Thus, for each vertex h, we find the shortest time to reach the patient:

This optimization problem seeks to find the minimum travel time from vertex h to all vertices in p simultaneously. This optimization problem can also be interpreted as a special network flow problem where we seek to find a directed path with minimum cost from a source node h to multiple destinations. τ (u, v) can be interpreted as edge flow cost, and the shortest path problem can be seen as sending a flow unit to each destination p ∈ p. We solve Eq. 10 to find the shortest travel time t * (h) from each node p ∈ p to each (hospital) vertex h (Fig. 6). We can use multiple algorithms to solve Eq. 10, including Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford. For reference, the computational complexity of the classical Dijkstra's algorithm isand Bellman-Ford is. Note that these algorithms will find the shortest paths to all vertices in v, and not just on p, at once.

### Clinical epidemiology of malaria in the highlands of Western Kenya [^d021d393]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The temperate highlands of western Kenya were regarded by colonial settlers as safe havens from the surrounding malarious areas of Uganda and Kenya. After World War I, malaria encroached into these highland communities as a result of wide-scale population settlement linked to transport and agricultural development, and malaria epidemics were frequently reported by the early 1930s. These epidemics in the highlands caused concern to those in the colonial administration because of the economic importance of agricultural exports. During the 1950s and 1960s, control efforts such as indoor residual house-spraying, mass drug administration, or chemoprophylaxis effectively contained or prevented epidemics in some of these high-altitude areas.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a series of malaria "epidemics" were reported in Kenya and other communities located at high altitudes in the subregion (,–). Some authors have labeled these resurgences as a new typology variant, "highland malaria", demanding special attention in the new global commitment to Roll Back Malaria. A generally accepted view has been that the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in high-altitude communities is limited by low ambient temperature. Small changes in climate may therefore provide transiently suitable conditions for unstable transmission in populations that have acquired little functional immunity.

The highlands of Kenya constitute a densely populated, politically significant area, which serves as a major source of revenue and foreign exchange from agricultural exports. The Kenyan government has recently defined 15 districts in the highlands as being prone to epidemics, meriting close inspection, preparation, and intervention. We examine a time series of age-structured clinical malaria data derived from three hospitals with inpatient admission facilities in the highlands of western Kenya. These data provide an empirical basis for understanding the epidemiology of malaria and consequent strategic approaches to disease management and prevention in this area. A companion paper investigates the epidemiologic and statistical problems associated with defining true epidemics in these high-altitude locations and tests a variety of epidemic surveillance algorithms on the monthly malaria admissions series abstracted from these facilities.

### How does COVID-19 kill at home and what should we do about it? [^f5bcc2bb]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

This study is consistent with a similar study conducted simultaneously by Marijon and co-workers in Paris. Marijon found that OHCA incidence doubled over the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, and patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 constituted ∼33% of excess OHCA cases. The same key determinants of survival were less favourable during the pandemic (rise in median EMS response time from 9.4 to 10.4 min, larger proportion of OHCA incidences at home, lower proportions of witnessed OHCA and shockable rhythm), resulting in reduced survival rates to hospital admission (23% to 13%) and hospital discharge (5.4% to 3.1%).

The strength of both studies is that they derive from large registries dedicated to study OHCA in the general population, thereby limiting inclusion bias. One important limitation is, however, that both registries only enrol OHCA patients with EMS involvement. This may have caused an underestimation of the problem, because EMS would be uninvolved in cases where OHCA occurred unwitnessed and the patients were found after they had already died. These patients (who mostly die at home) may contribute to the gap, reported in several countries, between observed excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and death tolls attributed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (typically patients dying in hospital).

Still, both studies together provide compelling evidence for an association between COVID-19 and OHCA. Moreover, they indicate that the problem of OHCA, already a major general health problem causing 20% of total mortality and 50% of mortality in patients with known heart disease in industrialized societies in the pre-COVID-19 era, has only worsened during the COVID-19 era.

How can we solve this problem? First, we must understand the mechanisms linking COVID-19 to increased OHCA risk (Take home figure). We must look beyond medical–biological reasons alone, as patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection constitute only 33%to 74%of excess OHCA cases.

### Bridging the gap between scientists and clinicians: addressing collaboration challenges in clinical AI integration [^7e299077]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ethical AI

One of the noteworthy limitations of AI systems, are the data they are trained on. Unfortunately, many datasets used in healthcare AI are biased, underrepresenting certain populations based on factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. These biases can lead to disparities in care, as AI tools may perform poorly for underrepresented groups. For example, an AI model trained primarily on data from younger, healthier patients may not accurately predict complications in older or more complex patients.

Addressing these biases is crucial to ensuring that AI-driven decision-making adheres to fairness, transparency, and accountability principles. Bias mitigation techniques, such as re-sampling, re-weighting, or adversarial debiasing, should be employed to ensure equitable performance across patient populations. Additionally, without a robust ethical framework, the potential for these technologies to exacerbate existing disparities remains a significant concern in their implementation. Recently, official organizations within the USA and Europe elicited recommendations for fairness in AI and algorithmic bias management. The underlying assumption is that most problems in complex modern healthcare require more than one perspective to find viable, sustainable, and cost-effective solutions.

Diversity within development teams is also critical for creating inclusive AI tools. Teams should include professionals from a range of backgrounds, including physicians, nurses, IT staff, and patient advocates. By incorporating diverse perspectives from key stakeholders, development teams can better anticipate and address potential biases or usability issues, resulting in more equitable and effective solutions.

### AI in health and medicine [^9808d055]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to broadly reshape medicine, potentially improving the experiences of both clinicians and patients. We discuss key findings from a 2-year weekly effort to track and share key developments in medical AI. We cover prospective studies and advances in medical image analysis, which have reduced the gap between research and deployment. We also address several promising avenues for novel medical AI research, including non-image data sources, unconventional problem formulations and human-AI collaboration. Finally, we consider serious technical and ethical challenges in issues spanning from data scarcity to racial bias. As these challenges are addressed, AI's potential may be realized, making healthcare more accurate, efficient and accessible for patients worldwide.

### The pursuit of better diagnostic performance: a human factors perspective [^a1054fcb]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite the relatively slow start in treating diagnostic error as an amenable research topic at the beginning of the patient safety movement, interest has steadily increased over the past few years in the form of solicitations for research, regularly scheduled conferences, an expanding literature and even a new professional society. Yet improving diagnostic performance increasingly is recognised as a multifaceted challenge. With the aid of a human factors perspective, this paper addresses a few of these challenges, including questions that focus on who owns the problem, treating cognitive and system shortcomings as separate issues, why knowledge in the head is not enough, and what we are learning from health information technology (IT) and the use of checklists. To encourage empirical testing of interventions that aim to improve diagnostic performance, a systems engineering approach making use of rapid-cycle prototyping and simulation is proposed. To gain a fuller understanding of the complexity of the sociotechnical space where diagnostic work is performed, a final note calls for the formation of substantive partnerships with those in disciplines beyond the clinical domain.

### Current status of medical device malfunction reporting: using end user experience to identify current problems [^0541b5eb]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Study limitations

This is a medium size study. Being qualitative in nature, it brought large amount of data for analysis. Surgical devices have a large impact on the care of surgical patient and the outcomes of surgery with findings thought to be transferable to other high-risk areas of healthcare. Further work should be carried out involving different groups of clinicians and devices. A small number of manufacturers completed the survey while saturation was reached during the semi-structured interviews. Further feedback from manufacturers is an area that could be developed further in future research.

### Emergence of "Big data" and its potential and current limitations in medical imaging [^bad14c3e]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Although electronic imaging was performed in the early 1950s in nuclear medicine, it was the introduction of computed tomography in 1972 that caused a revolution in medical imaging in that it marked the beginning of the inevitable transformation to digital imaging. This transformation is now more or less complete. While initially these CT images were relatively small, comprised of only about 6400 pixels per slice, the steady move toward higher spatial resolution, multislice imaging, digital radiography, and fluoroscopy rapidly increased the size of images and the amount of data required to be stored, processed, displayed, and moved about in a medical imaging department. The more recent introduction of digital pathology with submicron-sized pixels and the need for color further increases these demands. Rising work volumes in hospital, a push for cost containment, and a move toward greater precision in diagnosis and treatment of disease all work together to motivate the development of automated image analysis algorithms and techniques to improve efficiencies in in vivo imaging and pathology. This may require bringing together information from different imaging and nonimaging sources within the institution. While technological development has provided practical means for storage of the burgeoning data load and the use of multiple processors and high-speed networks has enabled more sophisticated analysis locally or in the cloud, challenges remain in terms of the ability to integrate data from different systems, the development of appropriately annotated image bases for training and testing of algorithms, and issues around privacy and ownership in obtaining access to patient-related data.

### Resource-poor settings: infrastructure and capacity building: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^6e2342fd]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

External alliances — disaster-prone, resource poor regions — We suggest local authorities establish formal relationships with coalitions of academic medical centers, professional societies, NGO's, and governmental organizations prior to an actual event in disaster-prone, resource poor regions, and we suggest these partnerships have objectives to develop and maintain effective communication, to help implement relief efforts with schedule rotations for teams, and to develop planning and preparation for potential disaster events including resolving licensure and liability issues. Academic medical centers in the developed world may be able to provide disaster support for an extended time to underserved areas with little significant impact on their own operations, and this support can be accomplished by using their own clinical departments and by partnering with similar like-minded institutions; a long on-site presence allows integration into the local community, continuity of care, coordination of replacement teams, and transition of responsibility, while humanitarian efforts in unfamiliar territory can result in misappropriation of resources due to poor communication and misunderstanding of resources and needs.

### Risk, society and system failure [^eda88dc8]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Modern societies are risk societies. Together with the formidable development of complex technologies (chemical industry, energy production, mass transportation, etc), new hazards have emerged. Sharing danger is the hallmark of modernity, as large industrial accidents can now have countrywide, or even, worldwide consequences. The Chernobyl explosion for example, has smeared large European surfaces with radioactive materials, across borders and nations, without any regard for who was responsible and who was the victim. Complex technologies should therefore be managed with great foresightness, particularly focusing on preventive management. A sound understanding of the (minor) role of human errors of operators and the (major) role of process design is a pre-requisite for appropriate management. This also applies to the complex business of radiotherapy, as the same organisational principles apply than in the heavy industry: restrict the role of operators, expect their mistakes, design in a mistake-proof way, accept the burden of preventive maintenances, supervise maintenance carefully and, above all, invest in safety.

### Integrating artificial intelligence into the clinical practice of radiology: challenges and recommendations [^5edcaeb9]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly disrupt the way radiology will be practiced in the near future, but several issues need to be resolved before AI can be widely implemented in daily practice. These include the role of the different stakeholders in the development of AI for imaging, the ethical development and use of AI in healthcare, the appropriate validation of each developed AI algorithm, the development of effective data sharing mechanisms, regulatory hurdles for the clearance of AI algorithms, and the development of AI educational resources for both practicing radiologists and radiology trainees. This paper details these issues and presents possible solutions based on discussions held at the 2019 meeting of the International Society for Strategic Studies in Radiology. KEY POINTS:
- Radiologists should be aware of the different types of bias commonly encountered in AI studies, and understand their possible effects.
- Methods for effective data sharing to train, validate, and test AI algorithms need to be developed.
- It is essential for all radiologists to gain an understanding of the basic principles, potentials, and limits of AI.

### Key challenges for delivering clinical impact with artificial intelligence [^423d98d4]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.

Main Body

Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.

Conclusion

The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.

### Let us talk about mistakes [^4fb59052]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Strategies within the hospital

Interdisciplinary case discussions within hospital settings, involving all relevant clinical specialties, are a valuable tool for the acquisition of knowledge and the fostering of professional development. Furthermore, the implementation of an anonymous "Critical Incident Reporting System (CIRS)" has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy. The results from CIRS implementation in 22 regional, Austrian hospitals and a tertiary hospital have been reported by Sendlhofer et al. It is important to note that the majority of reported cases were associated with non-compliance with established guidelines.

In the event that a report is to be amended as a result of a second opinion or the introduction of new information (for example, a pathological report), it is imperative to retain the original report. A new report has to be created, incorporating the original one. At the end, a comment is made stating the rationale for the adaptions necessary. This is signed with the author's name and date and followed by the new interpretation. Typically, hospital information systems incorporate a version control system for reports, with the most recent version always displayed on top. This allows the reader to trace the evolution of the report and understand the rationale behind the discrepancies between versions.

The hospital's legal department should be involved in cases where a report has resulted in a treatment error of a patient or when forensic or legal implications are likely. In addition to any necessary action, the communication with the patient or provider should be discussed. Anecdotally, we find an offensive strategy in communicating with patients is a superior approach in contrast to remaining silent or attempting to downplay the problem.

### Priorities for healthcare systems emergency preparedness in inpatient settings informed by COVID-19: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^119deef3]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — introduction and COVID-19 impact — notes the pandemic's global toll and system strain: "As of 2022, global confirmed cases continue to accumulate and now total more than 528 million, including almost 6 million deaths (1)", and "A study of 169 U.S. hospitals demonstrated considerable variation in how hospitals responded to the increased demand for critical care services during the COVID-19 pandemic; there was no single dominant strategy used by hospitals", with further challenges as "the evolving consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to staffing shortages among healthcare professionals worldwide, while healthcare systems struggle to maintain patient safety" and with future risk underscored by "Projections indicate that the next pandemic could happen soon (4)".

### Implementing artificial intelligence in critical care medicine: a consensus of 22 [^d916b908]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly entering critical care, where it holds the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and prognostication, streamline intensive care unit (ICU) workflows, and enable personalized care. Without a structured approach to implementation, evaluation, and control, this transformation may be hindered or possibly lead to patient harm and unintended consequences.

Despite the need to support overwhelmed ICUs facing staff shortages, increasing case complexity, and rising costs, most AI tools remain poorly validated and untested in real settings.

To address this gap, we issue a call to action for the critical care community: the integration of AI into the ICU must follow a pragmatic, clinically informed, and risk-aware framework. As a result of a multidisciplinary consensus process with a panel of intensivists, AI researchers, data scientists and experts, this paper offers concrete recommendations to guide the safe, effective, and meaningful adoption of AI into critical care.

Methods

The consensus presented in this manuscript emerged through expert discussions, rather than formal grading or voting on evidence, in recognition that AI in critical care is a rapidly evolving field where many critical questions remain unanswered. Participants were selected by the consensus chairs (MC, AB, FT, and JLV) based on their recognized contributions to AI in critical care to ensure representation from both clinical end-users and AI developers. Discussions were iterative with deliberate engagement across domains, refining recommendations through critical examination of real-world challenges, current research, and regulatory landscapes.

While not purely based on traditional evidence grading, this manuscript reflects a rigorous, expert-driven synthesis of key barriers and opportunities for AI in critical care, aiming to bridge existing knowledge gaps and provide actionable guidance in a rapidly evolving field. To guide physicians in this complex and rapidly evolving arena, some of the current taxonomy and classifications are reported in Fig. 1.

### Planning for major burns incidents in the UK using an accelerated Delphi technique [^a1695c15]. Burns (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Major incidents require careful planning if they are to be managed well. Although a generic plan to deal with all major incidents is essential, a number of "special incidents" deserve special consideration because of their potential to impact on specialist services. This paper examines the problems of managing a major incident involving large numbers of burns casualties.

Method

A three-round Delphi study was conducted using a multidisciplinary panel of experts from prehospital care, emergency medicine, burns surgery, intensive care and emergency planning.

Results

A series of consensus statements on the management of burns incidents are presented. An accompanying paper describes the practical implementation of this guidance.

Conclusion

Specific consideration should be given to the problems of managing a major incident involving burns casualties.

### Substandard medicines: a greater problem than counterfeit medicines? [^b5c207c5]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

High-income countries

Although the prevalence of substandard medicines in high-income countries is unknown, studies in both the UK and Canada show it is a significant issue. Contamination and stability issues were the major problems in Canada, whereas contamination is the major problem in the UK. There were 74 cases of contamination of medicinal products within the UK over an 11-year periodand 139 incidents in Canada over a 9-year period. Counterfeit medicines were a minor problem, both in Canada and the UK. An increasing number of substandard medicines have been identified in both Canada and the UK over time, although this may be due to improved detection by regulatory agencies. It is important to note that substandard medicines were not restricted to the manufacturers for generic medicines, but involved all the major pharmaceutical companies in both Canada and the UK.

The clinical impact of substandard medicines is unknown. Contaminated drugs were however responsible for more than 120 deaths at a single hospital in Pakistan. Additionally, more than 700 individuals developed a fungal infection following the use of contaminated methylprednisolone in the USA, associated with at least 61 deaths. These events suggest that for high-income countries, substandard medicines may be a greater problem clinically than counterfeit medicines. This may also be the situation in lower-income and lower–middle-income countries as illustrated by a study of the Medicines Quality Database (MQDB).MQDB is an online database that documents medicines tested for quality in selected countries in Africa, Asia and South America. A recent study of over 15 000 samples identified 848 samples (5.6%) as being of poor quality. The majority of the failed samples were substandard (767, 90.4%). The remaining 81 (9.6%) were counterfeit. Additional evidence suggesting that substandard medicines are a greater problem than counterfeit medicines is provided by the problems associated with diethylene glycol.

### Do no harm: a roadmap for responsible machine learning for health care [^574e3104]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Interest in machine-learning applications within medicine has been growing, but few studies have progressed to deployment in patient care. We present a framework, context and ultimately guidelines for accelerating the translation of machine-learning-based interventions in health care. To be successful, translation will require a team of engaged stakeholders and a systematic process from beginning (problem formulation) to end (widespread deployment).

### The integration of clinical trials with the practice of medicine: repairing a house divided [^87df88e4]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Optimal health care delivery, both now and in the future, requires a continuous loop of knowledge generation, dissemination, and uptake on how best to provide care, not just determining what interventions work but also how best to ensure they are provided to those who need them. The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is the most rigorous instrument to determine what works in health care. However, major issues with both the clinical trials enterprise and the lack of integration of clinical trials with health care delivery compromise medicine's ability to best serve society.

Observations

In most resource-rich countries, the clinical trials and health care delivery enterprises function as separate entities, with siloed goals, infrastructure, and incentives. Consequently, RCTs are often poorly relevant and responsive to the needs of patients and those responsible for care delivery. At the same time, health care delivery systems are often disengaged from clinical trials and fail to rapidly incorporate knowledge generated from RCTs into practice. Though longstanding, these issues are more pressing given the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of poor access to optimal care on vulnerable populations, and the unprecedented opportunity for improvement offered by the digital revolution in health care. Four major areas must be improved. First, especially in the US, greater clarity is required to ensure appropriate regulation and oversight of implementation science, quality improvement, embedded clinical trials, and learning health systems. Second, greater adoption is required of study designs that improve statistical and logistical efficiency and lower the burden on participants and clinicians, allowing trials to be smarter, safer, and faster. Third, RCTs could be considerably more responsive and efficient if they were better integrated with electronic health records. However, this advance first requires greater adoption of standards and processes designed to ensure health data are adequately reliable and accurate and capable of being transferred responsibly and efficiently across platforms and organizations. Fourth, tackling the problems described above requires alignment of stakeholders in the clinical trials and health care delivery enterprises through financial and nonfinancial incentives, which could be enabled by new legislation. Solutions exist for each of these problems, and there are examples of success for each, but there is a failure to implement at adequate scale.

Conclusions and Relevance

The gulf between current care and that which could be delivered has arguably never been wider. A key contributor is that the 2 limbs of knowledge generation and implementation-the clinical trials and health care delivery enterprises-operate as a house divided. Better integration of these 2 worlds is key to accelerated improvement in health care delivery.

### Medical error: a 60-year-old man with delayed care for a renal mass [^d1cfc0e0]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Mr B, a 60-year-old man with back pain, was not informed of an incidental finding of a renal mass suggestive of cancer on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Failure and delays in test follow-up are a frequent problem in medicine, occurring in more than 5% of significantly abnormal ambulatory test results. Rather than simply blaming involved clinicians, systems for managing tests need to be reengineered using methods from reliability sciences. These begin with investigations into the systemic causes of the failures, then application of approaches such as heightened situational awareness, closed-loop systems, improved handoffs, just-in-time work, culture and practices of stopping to fix problems, forcing functions and simplification, enhanced visual cues, and cautious use of information technology and redundancy, all while avoiding suboptimization. Emerging test management systems and critical test follow-up recommendations illustrate how applying these principles can enhance this important aspect of patient safety.

### Artificial intelligence in nuclear medicine: opportunities, challenges, and responsibilities toward a trustworthy ecosystem [^a1d21562]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Predetermined Change Control Plan

AI tools can be highly iterative and adaptive, which may lead to rapid continual product improvement. The plan should include types of anticipated modifications (software-as-a-medical-device prespecifications). There must be a clear and well-documented methodology (algorithm change protocol) to evaluate the robustness and safety of the updated AI system. The algorithm change protocol should include guidelines for data management, retraining, performance evaluation, and update procedures. Vendors should maintain a culture of quality and organizational excellence.

Diversity, Bias Awareness, Nondiscrimination, and Fairness

AI systems can be affected by input data maladies (incomplete data, inadvertent historically biased data), algorithm design insufficiencies, or suboptimal performance assessment or monitoring strategies. These issues may result in biases leading to unintended prejudice and cause harm to patients. Discriminatory bias should be removed from AI systems in the development phase when possible.

AI system performance should be evaluated in a wide spectrum of diseases and in patients with a particular condition regardless of extraneous personal characteristics. No particular group of patients should be systematically excluded from AI device development. Patients who are underrepresented or have rare diseases should not be excluded from AI system development or evaluation — though such datasets will be sparse and most likely could be used in the evaluation of AI methods developed only in larger populations (for generalizability). Appropriate validation testing on standardized sets that incorporate patient diversity, including rare or unusual presentations of disease, are critical to evaluate the presence of bias in results regardless of the training data used.

AI systems should be user-centric and developed with an awareness of the practical limitations of the physician work environment. Accessibility features should be provided to those individuals with disabilities to the extent necessary according to universal design principles.

Stakeholder Participation

Throughout the life cycle of an AI system, all stakeholders who may directly or indirectly be affected should actively participate to help, advise, and oversee the developers and industry. Participation of patients, physicians, and all relevant providers, health-care systems, payors, regulatory agencies, and professional societies is imperative. This inclusive and transparent engagement is essential for a trustworthy AI ecosystem. Regular clinical feedback is needed to establish longer-term mechanisms for active engagement.

### Outbreak response and incident management: SHEA guidance and resources for healthcare epidemiologists in United States acute-care hospitals [^97f11412]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Outbreak response frameworks and Hospital incident command system (HICS) structure — The National Incident Management System (NIMS) provides the template for incident management and the US National Response Framework (NRF) describes the structures by which the federal government responds to crises, and together they integrate incident management capabilities from the federal to local level. The NRF is comprised of 20 emergency support functions (ESFs), which create a structure for federal interagency response to states, and from the federal to facility levels a common operating picture (COP) ensures consistency in incident information, decision making, and status updates. The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR)'s Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) focuses on preparedness strategies for situations when healthcare capacity is stretched; under the HPP, Health Care Coalitions (HCCs) are comprised of healthcare organizations within a geographic area and integrate with Emergency Support Function (ESF)-8 (Public Health and Medical) activities and incident command system (ICS) responsibilities. In addition, each state develops guidance for crisis standards of care (CSC), and state public health will enact CSC operations emergency declarations to protect the public and healthcare personnel (HCP) in situations when resources are limited or overwhelmed. There are 5 major sections within the HICS: Command, Operations, Planning, Logistics, and Administration/Finance.

### Planning for major burns incidents by implementing an accelerated Delphi technique [^e7b84c8a]. Burns (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This paper presents a series of practical guides for use in planning and responding to a major incident involving large numbers of burns casualties.

Method

The guidance is based on the findings of an expert Delphi study published as an accompanying paper.

Results

The guidance covers preparation and all aspects of the response from prehospital care and hospital care to resolution recovery. Emphasis is placed on the management of the secondary/tertiary care interface as this is the point at which significant difficulties may arise. The importance of local interpretation of guidelines is emphasised.

Conclusion

This practical guide for emergency planners will improve the preparation and response to a major incident involving burns.

### Current status of medical device malfunction reporting: using end user experience to identify current problems [^2a02e84c]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Patient safety aspects

Acceptable level of device error

The concept of 'acceptable level of error' is well known to high-risk industries. In healthcare, however, this level of error is not standardised. This (among other reasons) has led to development of workarounds. Hence, the use of these devices is at times considered expensive (due to need for multiple devices used for the same procedure) rather than unsafe.

To reduce the device related risk, clinicians ask for standardised training on device use for the surgical team. The level of training received is generally poor and inconsistent. Majority of training is manufacturer lead (60.6%) for specific devices with only 12% always receiving training and only 9% being trust lead. Clinicians are often faced with unfamiliar devices during a procedure creating new challenges.

Device malfunction as a patient safety concern

Clinicians stated the need to discuss major device events in clinical governance. The aim of this was to improve learning, staff education and patient safety. This was resonated in the questionnaire by 91% of participants.

Despite the low likelihood of reporting, 88% of clinicians stated that MD events should be considered as incidents or near misses due to potential for harm. However, it is accepted that this does not always happen. Often only serious events are reported.

If no patient harm observed may not be treated as urgent

Theoretically yes, they are incidents/near misses, practically depends on the problem

I think all potential equipment failure or inadequate equipment performance can lead to patient harm for example an energy device not working and intraoperatively you have a bleed or a scope failing in the middle of a difficult procedure so every equipment failure has the potential to cause harm and should be treated as such

For a small group of clinicians, device events were considered simply as a malfunctioning technology with no relation to patient outcome (unless a patient incident was observed).

### Reducing drug-related harm by triggering proactive outreach [^b151d168]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Problem

Drug use is estimated to cause half a million deaths globally each year, with more than 70% involving an opioid. Opioid overdoses are rising worldwide, with many European countries being among those with the highest incidences. Scotland's drug death rate of 327 per million population annually is the highest recorded in Europe, with Norway being the next largest at 85 per million. Scotland reports the second-highest recorded drug deaths annually per million population, with America recording the highest. Despite some improvement in the numbers of drug-related deaths (DRDs) within Scotland in recent years, some areas of the Scottish Highlands have observed a continued rise.

The rural community for this project has an adult population of 21 291 and the estimated prevalence of drug use in Scotland is 1.62%. The average annual referral rate into the local recovery service is 173 people; approximately half of whom are referred due to a drug problem. As 1.62% of 21 291 would equate to 345 people, this suggests that three in four people who use drugs in this rural community are not accessing drug treatment services. The nearest acute hospital is over 100 miles away. Drug use is linked to levels of deprivation, and this rural community has areas of high deprivation. Furthermore, the project locality demonstrates the highest rate, per head of population, of drug-related hospital admissions in the Highland board area. Thus, supporting the claim that the recovery service is not reaching most people who use drugs.

NHS Highland is well versed in quality improvement (QI) methods and works closely with the Highland Alcohol and Drugs Partnership (HADP), a multiagency strategic partnership with a mission to reduce drug and alcohol related harm in Highland. The local drug and alcohol recovery service consists of a team lead (a nurse and project lead), three registered nurses and four support workers. This project aimed to test and implement a Trigger Checklist (TC) to identify those at high risk of drug-related harm and provide assertive outreach within 48 hours of referral for those living in a remote area of the Scottish Highlands by September 2023. The project commenced in January 2023.

### Machine learning for medical imaging: methodological failures and recommendations for the future [^eff32de1]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Research in computer analysis of medical images bears many promises to improve patients' health. However, a number of systematic challenges are slowing down the progress of the field, from limitations of the data, such as biases, to research incentives, such as optimizing for publication. In this paper we review roadblocks to developing and assessing methods. Building our analysis on evidence from the literature and data challenges, we show that at every step, potential biases can creep in. On a positive note, we also discuss on-going efforts to counteract these problems. Finally we provide recommendations on how to further address these problems in the future.

### Emergency preparedness in the 21st century: training and preparation modules in virtual environments [^122abf35]. Resuscitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the feasibility of evidence-based design and use of low-cost virtual world environments for preparation and training in multi-agency, multi-site, major incident response.

Methods

A prospective cohort feasibility study was carried out. One pre-hospital, and two in-hospital major incident scenarios, were created in an accessible virtual world environment. 23 pre-hospital and hospital-based clinicians each took part in one of three linked major incident scenarios: a pre-hospital bomb blast site, focusing on the roles of the team leader and triage person; a blast casualty in a resuscitation room, focusing on the role of the trauma team leader; a hospital command and control scenario focusing on the role of the clinical major incident co-ordinator/silver commander. Participants supplied both quantitative and qualitative feedback.

Results

Using a systematic, evidence-based approach, three scenarios were successfully developed and tested using low-cost virtual worlds (Second Life and OpenSimulator). All scenarios were run to completion. 95% of participants expressed a desire to use virtual environments for future training and preparation. Pre-hospital responders felt that the immersive virtual environment enabled training in surroundings that would be inaccessible in real-life.

Conclusions

The feasibility and face/content validity of using low-cost virtual worlds for multi-agency major incident simulation has been established. Major incident planners and trainers should explore utilising this technology as an adjunct to existing methodologies. Future work will involve development of robust assessment metrics.

### Identifying systems failures in the pathway to a catastrophic event: an analysis of national incident report data relating to vinca alkaloids [^22f340c8]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Catastrophic errors in healthcare are rare, yet the consequences are so serious that where possible, special procedures are put in place to prevent them. As systems become safer, it becomes progressively more difficult to detect the remaining vulnerabilities. Using inadvertent intrathecal administration of vinca alkaloids as an example, we investigated whether analysis of incident report data describing low-harm events could bridge this gap.

Methods

We studied nine million patient safety incidents reported from England and Wales between November 2003 and May 2013. We searched for reports relating to administration of vinca alkaloids in patients also receiving intrathecal medication, and classified the failures identified against steps in the relevant national protocol.

Results

Of 38 reports that met our inclusion criteria, none resulted in actual harm. The stage of the medication process most commonly involved was 'supply, transport and storage' (15 cases). Seven cases related to dispensing, six to documentation, and four each to prescribing and administration. Defences most commonly breached related to separation of intravenous vinca alkaloids and intrathecal medication in timing (n = 16) and location (n = 8); potential for confusion due to inadequate separation of these drugs therefore remains. Problems involved in six cases did not align with the procedural defences in place, some of which represented major hazards.

Conclusions

We identified areas of concern even within the context of a highly controlled standardised national process. If incident reporting systems include and encourage reports of no-harm incidents in addition to actual patient harm, they can facilitate monitoring the resilience of healthcare processes. Patient safety incidents that produce the most serious harm are often rare, and it is difficult to know whether patients are adequately protected. Our approach provides a potential solution.

### Enterprise-wide CR implementation: the shands healthcare system experience [^905ecef0]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

Major healthcare systems are comprised of hospitals and clinics of different sizes and locations. Many such enterprises are already using picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and computed radiography (CR) in their main hospitals. The integration of other hospitals and clinics into PACS is a more complex problem. The introduction of CR in remote facilities presents problems, as patient populations, department sizes, and work flow patterns may differ among facilities, and inadequate implementation programs may lead to disruption of patient care services. Although the University of Florida has had an operating PACS for years, facilities affiliated with the Shands Healthcare System (SHS) had not been incorporated into PACS until recently. This article presents the 5-year process to convert all film-screen radiological services to CR in the main hospital, five affiliated community hospitals, and four clinics. The article shows the importance of leadership by the medical physicist from inception of the project through installation and clinical implementation.

### ICU admission, discharge, and triage guidelines: a framework to enhance clinical operations, development of institutional policies, and further research [^37d52e9b]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ICU epidemic and disaster planning — We suggest that all ICUs have designated additional equivalent beds, equipment, and staff necessary to support the critically ill during a mass casualty incident emergency response. We suggest that all hospitals and regional areas develop a coordinated triage plan for epidemics, with hospital plans that include both triage and dissemination of patients throughout the hospital, and we suggest that during epidemics, nontraditional settings be considered and utilized for the care of critically ill patients. We suggest not using routine laboratory studies alone in determining the nature of illness during an epidemic. We suggest that activation of the hospital disaster plan and a coordinated response of the entire healthcare team follow the announcement of a mass casualty incident, ensuring that critical areas are ready for rapid and efficient transition from normal to emergency operations and can increase capacity to accommodate a larger volume of critically ill patients. We suggest that disaster response teams identify all patients in need of ICU care and those already hospitalized who could be discharged, then triage and transfer incoming patients to the most appropriate setting as soon as possible. We suggest that in areas at risk, ICUs be prepared to deal with victims of external and internal disasters, including collapse of surrounding services in large-scale disasters such as an earthquake, tsunami, or major tornado, and that every ICU have general disaster and evacuation plans such as those required by the Joint Commission Standards in the United States.

### Enhanced care team response to incidents involving major trauma at night: are helicopters the answer? [^72d2d07c]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Challenges exist in how to deliver enhanced care to patients suffering severe injury in geographically remote areas within regionalised trauma networks at night. The physician led Enhanced Care Teams (ECTs) in the West Midlands region of England do not currently utilise helicopters to respond to incidents at night. This study describes this remote trauma workload at night within the regional network in terms of incident location; injury profile and patient care needs and discusses various solutions to the delivery of ECTs to such incidents, including the need for helicopter based platforms.

Methods

We present a retrospective analysis of incidents involving Major Trauma occurring in the West Midlands Regional Trauma Network in England over a one year period (1st April 2012 until the 31st March 2013). Anonymised patient records from the Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) for patients that had been conveyed to hospital by ambulance/air ambulance were cross-referenced with the West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (WMAS) Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD) archive for the same period. Data were abstracted from the combined dataset relating to injury severity (ISS/ICU admission/death at scene or as inpatient); ECT resource activations/scene attendances; incident location and the need for enhanced level care.

Results

A total of 603 incidents involving Major Trauma were identified during night time hours. Enhanced Care Team resources attended scene in 167 cases (27.7%). Of the incidents not attended by an ECT 179 (41.1%) were due to falls and 91 (20.9%) involved a 'Road Traffic Collision'. A total of 36 incidents (6.0% of total at night) occurred in locations identified as being greater than 45min by road from the nearest major trauma centre. In these cases 13 patients had enhanced care needs that could not be addressed at scene by the attending ambulance service personnel.

Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support the need for night HEMS operations in the West Midlands regional trauma network. The potential role of night HEMS in other regional trauma networks in England requires further evaluation with specific reference to the incidence of Major Trauma and efficiency of existing road based systems.

### Navigating the complexities of mobile medical app development from idea to launch, a guide for clinicians and biomedical researchers [^739633a4]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Managing investigator expectations

We often encounter requests that are in essence to "just build an app" from clinical PIs. It is important to diagnose this way of thinking early as it could reveal the propensity of a PI to disengage from the project prematurely, as it becomes clear the amount of effort and collaboration it takes to foster a successful partnership. PIs must be engaged often and richly with the team. The cadence of meetings will be project dependent, but we have found a weekly update, whether a meeting or email, maintain project members active and engaged.

Having a disengaged PI can lead to multiple points where the project can fail: (1) the problem is not defined appropriately, (2) the appropriate user research is not conducted (which can lead to the app not addressing all relevant user needs thus impacting adoption and use), and (3) usability/feasibility testing is not conducted in a robust and iterative fashion (which can lead to usability issues that will prevent users from adopting the app, even if the app has a strong value proposition that could significantly improve the life of the user). In addition, it taxes the rest of the team who must make clinical research decisions and navigate an unfamiliar research structure.

Understanding the users

It can be challenging to identify and access users to solicit feedback from. Clinician investigators typically have frequent interactions with the target user population. They have familiarity and a relationship built already (which is how the ideas for projects usually originate). However, they usually lack the time to conduct thorough user research that goes beyond the problem discovery. On the other hand, developers and designers do have the time and knowledge to conduct user research, albeit they lack access to patients. Bridging this gap, often by facilitating access to clinics and hospitals for the design team, can drastically improve a project's chance of success. In one of our projects with Grady Memorial Hospital, we established a cadence of going to the hospital twice a week to enroll new subjects and check in on existing subjects. Furthermore, fostering a relationship with the clinical care teams of the subjects facilitates subject enrollment, a process that is much slower when only investigators are involved in subject recruitment. Additionally, by fostering that relationship with the clinical care of the subjects, it is possible to conduct user research with stakeholders through observation sessions and contextual inquiry. Which can help mitigate some of the overreliance on user input.

### Factors associated with reintubation in intensive care: an analysis of causes and outcomes [^341f685c]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reports on reintubation have focused on patients in whom planned extubation has been unsuccessful or those who have been accidentally extubated. However, reintubation is often required in events not related to accidental extubation. These cases have not been well described previously.

Objectives

To examine the causes, outcomes, and contributing factors associated with patients who required reintubation for events not including accidental extubation.

Methods

Appropriate reintubation incidents were extracted from the Australian Incident Monitoring Study in Intensive Care database and analyzed using descriptive methodology.

Results

One hundred forty-three incidents were identified with prominent precipitating events, including tube malposition (17%), securing/taping problems (17%), pilot tube/cuff problem (16%), blocked/kinked airway (14%), failed extubation (14%), and poor planning for extubation (6%). Narrative description of morbidity included hypoxia in 25% of reports, hypercarbic respiratory failure in 12%, aspiration in 7%, sputum retention in 7%, and cardiac arrhythmias in 6%. The reporter selected "major physiologic complications" and "prolonged hospital stay" as prominent adverse outcomes in 52% and 16% of patients, respectively. Major factors contributing to reintubation involved "error of judgement/problem recognition" (identified in 62% of reports), "high unit activity" (20%), "difficult patient habitus" (26%), and "lack of patient cooperation" (14%). Rechecking patient and equipment, and skilled assistance were prominent factors in limiting the adverse consequences of the incident.

Conclusion

This study indicated that reintubation not related to accidental extubation resulted in major physiologic complications and potentially contributed to increased length of stay. Its findings suggest that the adequate provision of highly qualified, intensive-care-trained staff is essential for the avoidance or minimization of these incidents.

### Wireless local area networking for linking a PC reporting system and PACS: clinical feasibility in emergency reporting [^98767625]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Although local area networks (LANs) are commonplace in hospital-based radiology departments today, wireless LANs are still relatively unknown and untried. A linked wireless reporting system was developed to improve work throughput and efficiency. It allows radiologists, physicians, and technologists to review current radiology reports and images and instantly compare them with reports and images from previous examinations. This reporting system also facilitates creation of teaching files quickly, easily, and accurately. It consists of a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine 3.0-based picture archiving and communication system (PACS), a diagnostic report server, and portable laptop computers. The PACS interfaces with magnetic resonance imagers, computed tomographic scanners, and computed radiography equipment. The same kind of functionality is achievable with a wireless LAN as with a wired LAN, with comparable bandwidth but with less cabling infrastructure required. This wireless system is presently incorporated into the operations of the emergency and radiology departments, with future plans calling for applications in operating rooms, outpatient departments, all hospital wards, and intensive care units. No major problems have been encountered with the system, which is in constant use and appears to be quite successful.

### Are we training junior doctors to respond to major incidents? A survey of doctors in the wessex region [^9e8a6ca9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the current status of awareness and training of junior medical staff in the Wessex region in the event of a "conventional" major incident.

Methods

A telephone questionnaire of specialist registrars (SpRs) (or equivalent, for example, staff grade) in six core specialties was performed in all the 11 acute hospitals in the Wessex region on the same evening. This group was selected to represent a sample of the most senior medical staff "on site" at each hospital.

Results

56 of 64 (87.5%) SpRs participated. Nine of the 56 (16%) SpRs questioned had previously been involved in a major incident, and 18 (32%) had experienced some form of major incident training exercise. Subgroup analysis of the specialties showed that although there were no significant differences in numbers of training experiences between specialties, only one of nine (11%) orthopaedic SpRs had ever been involved in a training exercise. Twenty five of the 56 (45%) SpRs felt that they were confident of their role in the event of an incident.

Conclusion

Most middle grade staff in Wessex were not confident of their role in the event of a major incident. Most SpRs questioned had never attended a major incident training exercise.

### Temporal prediction of in-hospital falls using tensor factorisation [^ea99d06c]. BMJ Innovations (2018). Medium credibility.

Data and methodologies

Data

In this research, we used the fall incidents data from seven public hospitals in Hong Kong from 1 January 2014 to 30 September 2014. The data contains occurrence date and time, department and specific location (eg, bedside and toilet) of each fall incident. The identity-related information of patients was excluded from the dataset. Figure 1 presents a hypothetical example of one incident in the dataset. In the table, 'Case_No' is the identifier of the incident. 'Occ_Dt' and 'Occ_Time' represent the date and time when the incident occurred. 'Location' represents the specific location in the hospital where the incident occurred. 'Rep_Dept' represents the hospital department of the patient.

Figure 1
One incident in the dataset (hypothetical data).

Methodologies

Tensor factorisation

Tensors are multidimensional arrays describing the linear relations between objects. Tensors provide a natural mathematical framework for representing and solving problems in a wide range of areas. Tensor factorisation is the higher order extension of matrix factorisation, which is able to capture the latent patterns in multiway datasets. Tensor factorisation (or tensor decomposition) has been successfully applied to a rich set of data mining problems including computer vision, link prediction, recommender systems, precision medicine and so on. The most widely used decomposition methods are CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and Tucker decomposition. The Tucker decomposition, also referred as higher order singular value decomposition (SVD), or M-model SVD, decomposes a tensor into a core tensor multiplied by a matrix along each mode. CP decomposition decomposes the tensor into the sum of rank one tensors. CP decomposition is a special case of Tucker decomposition, whose core is superdiagonal.

### Patient care technology disruptions associated with the… [^1e0a9d32]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Exposure A widely distributed faulty software update for enterprise cybersecurity software distributed on July 19, 2024, which, when installed on computers, resulted in a system crash. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was loss of response to internet scanning techniques indicating computer system downtime. A secondary analysis was performed on unresponsive domains attempting to identify the function of the network services provided. We also observed that a set of 52 unique HDOs failed to respond to our FHIR scans immediately following the July 19 update. The change in FHIR outage detection occurring during the CrowdStrike event is presented in Figure 2, which displays unresponsive HDO Epic FHIR end points resulting from scans conducted 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the CrowdStrike outage. Among services with outages, 5% corresponded to clinical research enterprises.

Specific tools, like REDCap software used to create research databases, were inaccessible at some hospitals, and services belonging to identifiable, specific research laboratories studying immunology, oncology, epigenetics, environmental toxicology, and microbiomics experienced outages. Most concerning, clinical trial websites directly serving patients, as well as public health and regional registries used for tracking trauma, stroke, cardiac, and burn patients, suffered downtime. Finally, we characterized 239 services whose outages may have had direct patient safety implications. A substantial number of hospitals lost important services involving their EHR, likely preventing physicians from accessing critical patient information, using automated ordering or clinical decision support, or easily viewing laboratory or radiology results.

Similarly, externally facing patient health portals were disrupted, threatening to deprive patients access to their medical records, including new results or diagnoses, obstructing the ability to easily communicate with their clinicians or to be reminded about upcoming appointments and potentially even delaying care by obfuscating critical paperwork or authorizations. Foundational critical software platforms, including Picture Archiving and Communications Systems and Laboratory Information System, were disrupted at some hospitals, potentially impacting critical clinical workflows dependent on the rapid results of imaging and laboratory studies. A number of patient monitoring systems, including fetal monitors, cardiac telemetry systems, and behavioral health applications, experienced outages, which may have had regional effects on some clinical applications, like prehospital reporting and telemedicine systems used to deliver care across distance, during the disruptions.

Problem

Life as a doctor involves managing acutely unwell patients. A major stressor for new doctors is becoming the first point of contact for an unwell patient. Despite initiatives to ease this transition, many newly qualified doctors feel uneasy with this dramatic switch.

Individual Trusts can make different recommendations regarding preferred treatment regimens. E-guidance is frequently used but research suggests that there are often difficulties in accessing guidance. These barriers include the availability of computers, internet-access and "signposting" of the required piece of guidance on online systems.

Error in medicine has been well-documented for many years. Despite safety strategies, episodes of sub-optimal care and adverse incidents occur. Difficulties in accessing guidance create scope for error and treatment delays. Some support for this is found in paediatric practiceand is likely to apply equally to adult medicine. Safety data suggests that variability in methodology exacerbates errors, both in primary and secondary care. Uniformity in practice is well-documented to reduce potential for errors (9). Ready access to guidance should help reduce variability and inappropriate prescribing, enhancing patient safety and reducing hospital spending.

Gloucestershire NHS Trust consists of two busy district general hospitals, which together manage over 40,000 admissions per year. As part of the wider Severn deanery, it has a large number of incoming Foundation year (FY) doctors. The majority of these have not worked in the Severn area previously. This includes many Foundation Year 2 doctors who change Trust between Foundation Years. As such, it is perfectly placed for assessing this problem and instituting change.

The overall aim of the project was to improve the safety and efficacy of prescribing for acutely unwell patients to improve patient outcome. It also aimed to boost doctors' confidence with managing patients. A secondary aim was to improve doctors' ease of access to and use of hospital guidelines for acutely unwell patients.

### Effectiveness of the medical emergency team: the importance of dose [^c6e8c7c9]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Up to 17% of hospital admissions are complicated by serious adverse events unrelated to the patients presenting medical condition. Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) review patients during early phase of deterioration to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. However, reports of the efficacy of these teams are varied. The aims of this article were to explore the concept of RRT dose, to assess whether RRT dose improves patient outcomes, and to assess whether there is evidence that inclusion of a physician in the team impacts on the effectiveness of the team. A review of available literature suggested that the method of reporting RRT utilization rate, (RRT dose) is calls per 1,000 admissions. Hospitals with mature RRTs that report improved patient outcome following RRT introduction have a RRT dose between 25.8 and 56.4 calls per 1,000 admissions. Four studies report an association between increasing RRT dose and reduced in-hospital cardiac arrest rates. Another reported that increasing RRT dose reduced in-hospital mortality for surgical but not medical patients. The MERIT study investigators reported a negative relationship between MET-like activity and the incidence of serious adverse events. Fourteen studies reported improved patient outcome in association with the introduction of a RRT, and 13/14 involved a Physician-led MET. These findings suggest that if the RRT is the major method for reviewing serious adverse events, the dose of RRT activation must be sufficient for the frequency and severity of the problem it is intended to treat. If the RRT dose is too low then it is unlikely to improve patient outcomes. Increasing RRT dose appears to be associated with reduction in cardiac arrests. The majority of studies reporting improved patient outcome in association with the introduction of an RRT involve a MET, suggesting that inclusion of a physician in the team is an important determinant of its effectiveness.

Figure 1
Existing pathways and bottlenecks for information flow and proposed enhanced systems following mHealth platform implementation for acute and critical care.

While there is much in the literature to recommend what data should be collected, there is limited practical advice or examples on how day-to-day clinical information can be successfully captured, especially in overstretched and under-resourced LMIC settings. It is noticeable in HIC settings that healthcare providers and researchers have increasingly turned towards technology and digital surveillance in order to achieve the breadth and saturation of continuous information needed to improve care. The worldwide digital boom in accessible mobile technology and internet connectivity over the last 5 years has been most pronounced in South Asia and regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Digital (mHealth) tools to connect remote communities, most notably in health promotion and primary disease prevention, have been shown to have an impact on patients' self-education and adherence to treatment. In contrast to these community settings, application of similar systems in acute and tertiary care in LMIC have been less well explored. Instead, disparate, paper-based systems persist, with patient records remaining ununified as patients move through the healthcare system, not only delaying the delivery of clinical care but also hindering efforts by clinicians seeking to prognosticate, benchmark and improve care. Complex routes to admission, heterogeneous populations, diverse patient journeys and the need to synthesise often high volumes of clinical and laboratory information from multiple sources further hinder efforts to apply technology in the acute setting, especially in LMICs.

To be effectively adopted within health systems, such innovations must harmonise with existing workflows, empower users, minimise user risk, optimise use of existing resources and augment evidence-based clinical management. The ability to integrate with existing or scaled national health information programmes is also essential if technologies are to be transferable with future traction beyond the existing infrastructure. These onerous requirements -often underestimated even in HIC- can seem insurmountable in resource-limited settings, where existing barriers to the adoption of such systems include cost, variable technology infrastructure and a perceived lack of value among busy clinicians. In addition, overburdened frontline staff are often unable to engage with such systems, perhaps due in part to the perceived enormity of behavioural change, task shift and burden of data capture that is potentially required. Furthermore, frontline clinicians also highlight the limited opportunities available to develop the necessary skills to heuristically evaluate care improvements in their healthcare facility.

### Building capacity for cancer research in the era of COVID-19: implementation and results from an international virtual clinical research training program in Zambia [^0376ec23]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The burden of cancer is quickly growing in Africa and presents a significant public health challenge to the continent today and in the coming decades if the status quo remains. Although cancer has historically received less attention and resources because of the competing risk of communicable diseases in Africa, the present-day risk of mortality from cancer among African women is already similar to that of North American women, demonstrating the immediacy of the problem. Furthermore, countries located in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to have the greatest relative increase in global cancer incidence between 2020 and 2040 by a significant margin, which will exacerbate existing limitations in cancer care. Clinical research is essential to develop effective, evidence-based interventions to the unique cancer care challenges that occur in Africa and should be prioritized. Rather than being regarded as a luxury because of a shortage of resources, it is counterintuitively more important to appropriately allocate scarce resources and develop cost-effective and culturally aligned solutions.

African countries, however, are significantly under-represented in cancer research because of historical and persistent inequalities. Barriers to clinical research in Africa include lack of adequate funding to build research infrastructure, procure equipment, implement high-quality training programs, maintain research personnel and collaborations, and consistently collect health data. Among these, training physicians in clinical research has been identified as a sustainable method to strengthen clinical research capacity as local physicians are best equipped to define and investigate important research issues within their own country. There have been numerous successful partnerships between developed countries and countries in Africa for the training of doctoral fellows, epidemiology and operational researchers, and health care workers. - However, there are few published experiences of clinical research training programs for African oncologists, and even fewer delivered through a virtual platform.

The MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA) in Houston, TX, and the Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) in Lusaka, Zambia, have an established academic partnership that includes telehealth mentoring through Project ECHOand an annual high-yield course in radiation biology and physics. The CDH Specialized Training Program in Clinical and Radiation Oncology enrolled its first fellows in 2018 and will graduate the country's first cohort of locally trained oncologists in 2022. A significant area of need was jointly identified as a structured clinical research training program. Here, we describe the implementation and results from the initial yearlong virtual clinical research training program for Zambian clinical oncology fellows created as a collaboration between MDA and CDH.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular science: anticipating problems and potential solutions: a presidential advisory from the American Heart Association [^4989686c]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had worldwide repercussions for health care and research. In spring 2020, most non-COVID-19 research was halted, hindering research across the spectrum from laboratory-based experimental science to clinical research. Through the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021, biomedical research, including cardiovascular science, only gradually restarted, with many restrictions on onsite activities, limited clinical research participation, and the challenges associated with working from home and caregiver responsibilities. Compounding these impediments, much of the global biomedical research infrastructure was redirected toward vaccine testing and deployment. This redirection of supply chains, personnel, and equipment has additionally hampered restoration of normal research activity. Transition to virtual interactions offset some of these limitations but did not adequately replace the need for scientific exchange and collaboration. Here, we outline key steps to reinvigorate biomedical research, including a call for increased support from the National Institutes of Health. We also call on academic institutions, publishers, reviewers, and supervisors to consider the impact of COVID-19 when assessing productivity, recognizing that the pandemic did not affect all equally. We identify trainees and junior investigators, especially those with caregiving roles, as most at risk of being lost from the biomedical workforce and identify steps to reduce the loss of these key investigators. Although the global pandemic highlighted the power of biomedical science to define, treat, and protect against threats to human health, significant investment in the biomedical workforce is required to maintain and promote well-being.

### Addressing challenges in low-income and middle-income countries through novel radiotherapy research opportunities [^a3035566]. The Lancet: Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Although radiotherapy continues to evolve as a mainstay of the oncological armamentarium, research and innovation in radiotherapy in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) faces challenges. This third Series paper examines the current state of LMIC radiotherapy research and provides new data from a 2022 survey undertaken by the International Atomic Energy Agency and new data on funding. In the context of LMIC-related challenges and impediments, we explore several developments and advances-such as deep phenotyping, real-time targeting, and artificial intelligence-to flag specific opportunities with applicability and relevance for resource-constrained settings. Given the pressing nature of cancer in LMICs, we also highlight some best practices and address the broader need to develop the research workforce of the future. This Series paper thereby serves as a resource for radiation professionals.

### Infrastructural challenges lead to delay of curative radiotherapy in Nigeria [^e3bff84d]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Machine breakdown was a major contributor to treatment delay. The low number of functioning machines reflects a lack of routine maintenance in radiotherapy facilities and leads to measurable delays in patient care. The costs and logistics of maintenance are not factored into the establishment of radiotherapy centers in Nigeria. Although engineers are present to troubleshoot equipment issues, lack of machine parts and funds for repair hinder their progress. The overwhelming demand for the few functioning treatment machines in existing facilities increases the likelihood of machine breakdowns. Combined with the lack of backup parts and manufacturer maintenance centers in Africa, months may pass before a facility becomes operational again. In fact, patient-reported delays caused by machine breakdown averaged 8.5 weeks in this study.

Health care worker strikes are a common occurrence in the Nigerian health care system. In the period between 2013 to 2015, there were > 8 documented strikes by doctors, nurses, and other allied health care workers. In radiotherapy, strikes contributed to patient delays averaging 5.8 weeks. The causes for worker strikes in Nigeria are complex, and they include dissatisfaction with salary, management, infrastructure, and hospital funding. These issues should be addressed in context to prevent delays in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients with potentially curable cancers.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^7d774bbb]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Table 3 — The Role of the ASP in Incident Management — details ASP participation across preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. In preparedness, a healthcare organization's Emergency Management Program (EMP) analyzes how the organization will maintain its core mission, develops the emergency operations plan (EOP), and the EOP details response and recovery plans, the structure of the hospital response, and the execution of the hospital incident command structure (HICS); the EMP engages ASP leadership to obtain input into policies, guidance, and resources, with functions of the ASP during crises contained in the organization's EOP. In mitigation, the phase is characterized by efforts aimed to prevent escalation of a crisis and reduce damage, and the healthcare organization may activate HICS; during this phase the organization involves the ASP Director, or similar role, in the HICS Healthcare Incident Management Team (HIMT) as a medical-technical specialist to provide input into considerations including emerging information about the infectious threat and mode of transmission, assessment of supplies of potential therapies and equipment, access to data, and need for education for HCP. In response, the phase encompasses activities that an organization undertakes to manage an emergency or crisis, and the healthcare organization continues to engage the ASP Director in HICS in identifying and drafting guidance and care protocols related to antimicrobial use during the emergency. In recovery, the organization assesses how to "return to normal", coordinates among EMP and organizational leaders to conduct incident debriefings and after-action reports, identify risks and vulnerabilities, assess how to improve protocols for future emergencies, evaluate responsibilities absorbed during a crisis, and consider revisions to the EOP; the EMP seeks input from ASP leadership on immediate needs, when and how to scale back activities, and how procedures and policies may be revised, and in the context of COVID-19, recovery may involve considering how additional activities should be incorporated into the ASP's scope of work, stepped down and/or included in the EOP, and resourced to adequately support them.

### A flood-related outbreak of carbon monoxide poisoning – grand forks, North Dakota [^b7a3f1af]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Post-disaster carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a growing problem in the United States. This study describes a documented outbreak of CO poisoning associated with flooding. Health department staff investigated cases of CO poisoning following the severe flood of 1997 in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Thirty-three laboratory-confirmed cases were identified, involving 18 separate incidents. Patients ranged in age from 7 to 67 years, and most were men. One patient lost consciousness and was admitted to the hospital; all others were released after receiving supplemental oxygen. Every incident involved gasoline-powered pressure washers being used in basements. Five incidents among professional cleaners accounted for 16 cases; the remaining incidents involved noncommercial use. Thirty patients, from 15 incidents, reported the basement was ventilated while the pressure washer was in use. CO poisoning must be considered a potential hazard after major floods.

### Current status of medical device malfunction reporting: using end user experience to identify current problems [^1604e733]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

The importance of the information received is dependent on the type of device under investigation. For low-risk devices (class I) with low risk of patient injury, the lack of information is overcome by their high volume and trend analysis. Higher risk devices often are used in lower volumes and the same is not possible. Box 2 shows the challenges reported by manufacturers in information gathering process. Below are some of the comments made by the manufacturers.

Box 2
Challenges faced by manufacturers on information gathering

The problem is true of lacking clinical data in general, we also produce implants for the dental market which is a "black box". We have no idea what is happening in that. We wished there is some ways of covering other markets. We have no idea how the implants are performing.

I think the lack of information is widespread and not many people have the time or interested in reporting. Sometimes the theatre manager would find a device on their desk with no other information then tries to tell us.

Biomedical Engineering teams don't tend to say whether it was used on a procedure, on the patient, they just tell us — needs repairing or replacement and nothing more. Usually, the information is very short.

Methods for improvement

Clinicians want greater transparency on the submitted information and effective feedback on the actions taken by the manufacturer and the healthcare trust. They want to know if the problems they are facing are recurrent and faced by others. This would affect safe practice. While at present, it may not be possible to detect the cause of the error, most appreciate that malfunctions may relate to both device design and associated human factors. They stated that an effective reporting system would be an online, dedicated to MDs that takes minimal amount of time to complete. A standardised training is required for clinical staff on safe use of devices. Manufacturers would like better communication methods with healthcare and useful clinical feedback on device performance.

Need to have something to be able to see what other trusts are facing problems with and to see whether problems are linked to a particular device or just to a specific batch.

For me personally, I would be interested to know if other trusts are facing the same problems with the devices I am having problems with as it would make me decide whether it is just the devices I am using or whether this is a more wider problem. It would certainly make me more cautious about using the device if I know its causing problems elsewhere.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome outbreak in Peru 2019 associated withInfection [^ca1d1895]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated disorder frequently triggered by infections, characterized by an acute flaccid paralysis, accompanied by sensory symptoms and cranial nerve deficits. In recent years, several outbreaks of GBS have been observed globally, including the large outbreaks in Latin America during the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, and the possibility of an association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and GBS has been raised. As the ZIKV epidemic transitioned to an endemic phase in the Americas in 2017, 2 major outbreaks of GBS occurred in Peru in 2018 and 2019. The number of reported GBS cases increased from 59 in 2017 (incidence: 0.19/100,000) to 262 in 2018 (incidence: 0.81/100,000) and 1,120 in 2019 (incidence: 3.44/100,000). During these outbreaks, the increases in GBS cases were also reported in areas where there is no potential arboviral transmission, such as the highlands of Peru. The outbreaks had a seasonal pattern with the major peaks occurring between April and July in both years (figure 1A). We investigated the causality of these outbreaks, by performing an observational clinical cohort study of adult patients with GBS evaluated at a tertiary university hospital in Lima during the 2019 outbreak.

### Potential pitfalls of computer aided orthopedic surgery [^bfd24b66]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

Computer aided orthopedic surgery (CAOS) systems are becoming more and more frequently used in operating rooms all over the world. While their clinical benefit is no longer doubted, there is considerable potential for using these devices incorrectly At best, mishandling of a CAOS system may lead to prolonged operating times. In the worst case scenario, incorrect navigational feedback is provided, which carries the potential risk of endangering the patient or resulting in an unacceptable surgical outcome. From an economical point of view only the optimal performance of a navigation system will probably justify its significant investment costs. This article summarizes some of the major pitfalls that may occur during surgical navigation. It is structured to reflect different types of CAOS systems, and it presents guidelines on how to avoid most of the problems. In general, a surgeon who wants to apply this technology needs to be very familiar with the system that is used. It is essential to know the basics and the limitations of the underlying technical principles. Otherwise, the large potential that modern CAOS systems make available cannot be exploited effectively for the benefit of the patient.

Impact of the Pandemic on Cancer Research

Clinical and basic cancer research is likely to be severely affected by a pandemic. There will most likely be a decrease in trial initiations and accruals, and the pace of progress will slowed 70. However, the impact will be magnified, perhaps exponentially, by protocol deviations and violations for missed and delayed visits, leading to countless queries and estimated dates of confinement. The burden on research teams will increase markedly, and precious time and resources will be devoted to these tasks rather than accelerating clinical investigation to make up for lost time. During the pandemic, there is a need to carefully reconsider the clinical cancer research processes and procedures that contribute to data integrity and patient safety versus tasks that might ultimately detract from cancer research goals. Further research is needed in this area to address these issues 71. On March 18, 2020, the FDA published guidance for industry, investigators, and institutional review boards on conduct of clinical trials of medical products during the COVID‐19 pandemic 72.
