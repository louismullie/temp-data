## Question

What are the most common chromosomal abnormalities detected during second trimester screening?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which chromosomal abnormalities are most commonly detected during second-trimester screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "second-trimester screening" typically includes in current practice. Then, I should verify the most authoritative sources that quantify the relative frequencies of specific chromosomal abnormalities. Next, I will extract and compare the incidence data by maternal age, since prevalence drives what is "most common". Finally, I will synthesize a ranked list and note any nuances about detection versus prevalence and the impact of first-trimester screening on second-trimester yields.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes "second-trimester screening" in contemporary guidelines. Traditionally, this includes the quadruple maternal serum screen and the detailed anatomic ultrasound at 18–22 weeks, with the ultrasound assessing both structural anomalies and soft markers that modify aneuploidy risk; importantly, many patients today arrive in the second trimester having already completed first-trimester combined screening or cell-free DNA, which changes the residual prevalence of detectable abnormalities in the second trimester [^117Ft8zF] [^112SCzP3] [^115Fzd1L].

> I need to check the most authoritative data on frequencies. ACOG's Practice Bulletin 226 provides age-specific risks at term for chromosomal abnormalities in second-trimester pregnancies, which directly answers the question about relative frequencies; I will extract the per-10,000 rates for maternal age 35 and 40 years because these illustrate the rank order and magnitude across common aneuploidies and other chromosomal abnormalities [^114UMvb5] [^116kw17Q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the exact figures. For maternal age 35 at term, ACOG reports trisomy 21 at 34 per 10,000, sex chromosome aneuploidy at 35 per 10,000, trisomy 18 at 9 per 10,000, trisomy 13 at 4 per 10,000, and microarray-detected or other rare chromosomal abnormalities at 37 per 10,000, totaling 119 per 10,000; for maternal age 40 at term, trisomy 21 rises to 116 per 10,000, sex chromosome aneuploidy to 51 per 10,000, trisomy 18 to 30 per 10,000, trisomy 13 to 14 per 10,000, and other rare abnormalities remain around 37 per 10,000, totaling 248 per 10,000 [^114UMvb5] [^116kw17Q].

> Wait, let me verify the implication for "most common". Across both ages, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is consistently the most frequent chromosomal abnormality, followed by sex chromosome aneuploidies, then trisomy 18, then trisomy 13, with rare chromosomal abnormalities (often detected by microarray) also contributing meaningfully; this rank order holds even as absolute risks increase with maternal age, so the relative frequency pattern is stable [^114UMvb5] [^116kw17Q].

> I should double-check whether these figures reflect detection during second-trimester screening versus background prevalence. These ACOG tables present age-specific risks at term, which align with what is detectable in the second trimester by serum screening and ultrasound, and they are the standard reference for counseling on expected frequencies; moreover, sequential and integrated strategies detect a broader range of aneuploidies beyond trisomies 21 and 18, reinforcing that the spectrum includes sex chromosome aneuploidies and other rare abnormalities captured on diagnostic testing when indicated [^114UMvb5] [^113zEXg8].

> But wait, what if first-trimester screening has already removed many cases from the second-trimester pool? Let me consider that nuance. Because first-trimester combined screening and cfDNA identify many affected pregnancies earlier, the absolute yield of second-trimester screening is lower than in historical cohorts; nonetheless, the relative ranking of abnormalities detected in those who screen positive or who present in the second trimester remains similar, with trisomy 21 most common, followed by sex chromosome aneuploidies, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13, consistent with epidemiology and programmatic data [^116kw17Q] [^116J382h].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final ranking. The most common chromosomal abnormalities detected during second-trimester screening are: 1) trisomy 21, 2) sex chromosome aneuploidies (45, X and 47, XXY/47, XXX/47, XYY), 3) trisomy 18, and 4) trisomy 13, with rare chromosomal abnormalities (copy number variants and other structural changes) also represented, particularly when diagnostic testing is pursued after abnormal screens or anomalies are identified [^114UMvb5] [^116kw17Q].

---

The most common chromosomal abnormalities detected during second-trimester screening are **trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)**, **trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)**, and **trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)** [^114UMvb5], with trisomy 21 being the most frequent [^117J1v7z]. Sex chromosome aneuploidies (such as Turner and Klinefelter syndromes) are also commonly identified, particularly with cell-free DNA screening [^11681kwd] [^112d2hBh]. Detection rates vary by method: quadruple serum screening detects about 81% of trisomy 21 cases [^111uasCq], while cell-free DNA has higher sensitivity (> 99% for trisomy 21) [^112d2hBh] but is not diagnostic and requires confirmation [^114CrwjL]. Second-trimester ultrasound can reveal structural anomalies and soft markers that raise suspicion for aneuploidy, prompting diagnostic testing [^115Fzd1L] [^115MXYpH].

## Most common chromosomal abnormalities detected

| **Chromosomal abnormality** | **Description** | **Incidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) | Extra copy of chromosome 21 | 1 in 700 live births [^notfound] |
| Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) | Extra copy of chromosome 18 | 1 in 5,000 live births [^notfound] |
| Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) | Extra copy of chromosome 13 | 1 in 16,000 live births [^notfound] |
| Sex chromosome aneuploidies (e.g. Turner, Klinefelter) | Abnormal number of sex chromosomes | 1 in 500 live births [^notfound] |

---

Trisomy 21 is the **most common** chromosomal abnormality detected, followed by trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 [^114UMvb5]. Sex chromosome aneuploidies are also frequently identified, particularly with advanced screening methods [^11681kwd].

---

## Detection methods and their effectiveness

Several methods are used for **second-trimester screening**, each with varying levels of effectiveness:

| **Detection method** | **Description** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Quadruple serum screening | Measures AFP, hCG, unconjugated estriol, and inhibin-A | 81% detection rate for trisomy 21 [^111uasCq] |
| Cell-free DNA screening | Analyzes fetal DNA in maternal blood | > 99% detection rate for trisomy 21 [^112d2hBh] |
| Second-trimester ultrasound | Identifies structural anomalies and soft markers | Detection rate varies; useful for identifying anomalies suggestive of aneuploidy [^115Fzd1L] |

---

Quadruple serum screening is a **traditional method** with moderate effectiveness [^117Ft8zF], while cell-free DNA screening offers high sensitivity and specificity but requires confirmatory diagnostic testing [^112d2hBh] [^114CrwjL]. Second-trimester ultrasound is essential for detecting structural anomalies and soft markers that may indicate chromosomal abnormalities [^115Fzd1L].

---

## Role of maternal age

Maternal age **significantly influences** the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, particularly trisomy 21 [^116kw17Q]. The risk increases with advancing maternal age, especially after 35 years [^1167emtq]. This age-related risk is a key factor in counseling and determining the need for further diagnostic testing [^114SPVfD].

---

## Clinical implications and follow-up

When chromosomal abnormalities are detected, **genetic counseling and diagnostic testing** (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) are recommended to confirm the diagnosis [^113GaYH6]. Comprehensive ultrasound evaluation is also advised to assess for structural anomalies [^115MXYpH]. Management plans are individualized based on the specific abnormality, severity, and patient preferences [^113oRGGJ].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite advances in screening, **limitations remain**:

- **False positives and false negatives**: Both quadruple serum screening and cell-free DNA screening can yield false results, necessitating confirmatory diagnostic testing [^112d2hBh] [^114CrwjL].
- **Ethical considerations**: Decisions regarding pregnancy management after detection of chromosomal abnormalities are complex and require careful counseling [^113oRGGJ].
- **Access and cost**: Cell-free DNA screening, while highly effective, may not be accessible or affordable for all patients [^113bDETo].

---

The most common chromosomal abnormalities detected during second-trimester screening are **trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and sex chromosome aneuploidies** [^114UMvb5]. Detection methods include quadruple serum screening, cell-free DNA screening, and second-trimester ultrasound, each with varying effectiveness [^117Ft8zF] [^112d2hBh] [^115Fzd1L]. Maternal age significantly influences risk, and detected abnormalities require confirmatory diagnostic testing and genetic counseling [^116kw17Q] [^113GaYH6].

Screening for the risk of fetal aneuploidy can be effectively performed in either the first or second trimester. When obtained independently, the interpretation of those data is straightforward. However, the effectiveness of screening can be enhanced by combining studies performed in each trimester in a variety of ways. In this commentary we will define and discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of using integrated, stepwise, sequential or contingency screening for risk assessment of fetal aneuploidy.

### Aneuploidy screening in pregnancy [^115mPKJi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Prenatal aneuploidy screening has changed dramatically in recent years with increases in the types of chromosomal abnormalities reliably identified and in the proportion of aneuploid fetuses detected. Initially, screening was available only for trisomies 21 and 18 and was offered only to low-risk pregnancies. Improved detection with the quadruple- and first-trimester multiple marker screens led to the option of aneuploidy screening for women 35 years of age and older. Cell-free DNA tests now screen for common autosomal trisomies and sex chromosome aneuploidies. Cell-free DNA screening is particularly effective in older women because of higher positive predictive values and lower false-positive rates. Integrated first- and second-trimester multiple marker tests provide specific risks for trisomies 21, 18, and possibly 13, and may detect an even wider range of aneuploidies. Given current precision in risk assessment, based on maternal age and preferences for screening or diagnostic tests, counseling has become more complex. This review addresses the benefits and limitations of available aneuploidy screening methods along with counseling considerations when offering them.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, more specifically with respect to choice of screening test, maternal serum screening, NSGC 2013 guidelines recommend to do not obtain a separate second-trimester maternal serum screening for chromosome aneuploidy if a patient completes combined first-trimester screening. Obtain screening for chromosome aneuploidy in the second trimester in patients presenting before 14 weeks only as a part of integrated, serum-integrated, stepwise-sequential, or contingency screening. Recognize that independent screening in the first and second trimesters increases the false positive rate of screening.

### Pearls and pitfalls of first-trimester US screening and prenatal testing: a pictorial review [^112LYnpu]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

First-trimester US is imperative in evaluation of early pregnancy to confirm pregnancy location and number and gestational age. The 2024 Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound consensus conference established a first-trimester lexicon to highlight the importance of clear and concise language, which is incorporated and featured by the authors. With improved technologies and understanding of fetal development, first-trimester anatomic studies, between 11 weeks and 13 weeks 6 days gestation, are becoming more frequently used. While not a replacement for the second-trimester anatomic study, systematic evaluation of fetal anatomy at this early gestational age allows detection of 40%-70% of anomalies, whether structural or related to aneuploidy. All patients, regardless of age or baseline risk, should be offered screening and diagnostic testing for chromosomal abnormalities. A variety of prenatal screening approaches are available, each with strengths and limitations. Noninvasive prenatal testing with detection of fetal cell-free DNA can be performed in the first trimester and is the most sensitive and specific screening for the common fetal aneuploidies, but is not equivalent to diagnostic testing. Alternatively, serum analytes for maternal biomarkers in conjunction with nuchal translucency (NT) measurement can be used to calculate a risk estimate for common trisomies. Increased NT is the most common abnormality seen in the first trimester. Positive screening results, increased NT, or other anomaly at US should prompt genetic counseling and be confirmed with diagnostic testing (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis). Early detection of aneuploidy and structural anomalies allows counseling and informs decisions for pregnancy management. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, more specifically with respect to choice of screening test (amniocentesis, general population), NSGC 2013 guidelines recommend to obtain stepwise sequential screening or combined first-trimester screening in patients opting for chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis because:

- both are tailored to fit the needs of patients desiring early detection of chromosome aneuploidy but wishing to employ a screening method before making a decision about diagnostic testing

- both allow for the option of chorionic villus sampling in higher-risk pregnancies while deferring testing of lower-risk pregnancies to the second trimester without causing increased anxiety

- of the screening options providing risk information in the first trimester, stepwise sequential screening has the highest detection rates for Down syndrome and trisomy 18.

Recent advances in Down syndrome screening are providing women with additional options in how they are assessed for this condition. First trimester screening tests are at least as accurate as traditional second trimester testing and provide results earlier in a woman's pregnancy. Combining first and second trimester results increases the sensitivity and specificity of screening and reduce the number of women requiring invasive testing. This review summarizes and critiques the available data on Down syndrome screening and compares different testing algorithms. Meta-analyses of first trimester screening techniques are presented. Nuchal lucency measurements and other first trimester ultrasound markers, first trimester serum markers, and methods for combining these screens are addressed.

### Imaging clues in the prenatal diagnosis of syndromes and aneuploidy [^113Ns14u]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Advances in fetal sonography and MRI have increased both the range and diagnostic accuracy of detectable fetal anomalies, with many anomalies detectable earlier in pregnancy. The presence of structural anomalies greatly raises the risk that the fetus has a syndrome or abnormal karyotype. In addition, new techniques in maternal serum screening have greatly increased the ability to identify pregnant patients at risk for anomalies and syndromes. This paper reviews maternal first- and second-trimester serum screening and imaging and covers many of the most common fetal karyotypic and structural anomalies.

### Prenatal screening and diagnosis: time for a paradigm shift [^1137HwiZ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in genetics and imaging have ushered substantial breakthroughs in screening and diagnosis for chromosomal and structural abnormalities. Thus, it is imperative that health care providers caring for pregnant individuals should reexamine established practices in prenatal screening and diagnosis. In the past, screening for chromosomal abnormalities was based almost entirely on Down syndrome. Pregnant individuals aged > 35 years were considered at "high risk" or of "advanced maternal age" based on age alone; however, the advent of tests with high sensitivity for prenatal detection of chromosomal abnormalities should lead to abandoning that concept, at least from the perspective of chromosomal abnormalities. Given that first-trimester and second-trimester screenings will fail to detect between 5 and 20% of Down syndrome, in most situations, noninvasive testing with cell-free DNA should be the first-line screen for Down syndrome. The fact that over 99% of fetuses with Down syndrome will be detected prenatally with cell-free DNA gives other fetal chromosomal and structural abnormalities increasing prominence. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) permits prenatal detection of several clinically important chromosomal aberrations that cannot be detected by karyotype and may exist in structurally normal fetuses with low-risk cell-free DNA screening. As such, CMA should be more readily conducted when invasive testing is performed, regardless of the presence of a structural abnormality. Isolated sonographic "soft markers" have no clinical significance in patients who have normal cell-free DNA screening, can cause unwarranted anxiety and a negative impact on pregnancy, and perhaps it is time to stop discussing them. Detailed first-trimester ultrasound allows early detection of several severe fetal anomalies and, therefore, in settings with adequately trained personnel and resources, should be used more frequently. This opinion traces the evolution of prenatal screening and diagnosis and advocates for a paradigm shift that aligns with recent developments in prenatal screening and diagnostic capabilities. KEY POINTS: · Noninvasive prenatal testing with cell-free DNA should be available to all pregnant individuals. · Chromosomal microarray should be available to all pregnant individuals undergoing amniocentesis. · Patients > 35 years with low-risk screening are not at "high risk" for chromosomal abnormalities.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^113oRGGJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 226 Level A recommendations — screening options and approach: The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A). Prenatal genetic screening (serum screening with or without nuchal translucency (NT) ultrasound or cell-free DNA screening) and diagnostic testing (chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis) options should be discussed and offered to all pregnant women regardless of maternal age or risk of chromosomal abnormality, and after review and discussion, every patient has the right to pursue or decline prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing. If screening is accepted, patients should have one prenatal screening approach, and should not have multiple screening tests performed simultaneously. Cell-free DNA is the most sensitive and specific screening test for the common fetal aneuploidies; nevertheless, it has the potential for false-positive and false-negative results, and cell-free DNA testing is not equivalent to diagnostic testing.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^115Fzd1L]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Second-trimester ultrasound — structural survey and soft markers: Independent of screening or diagnostic testing, all patients should be offered a second-trimester sonogram to assess for structural abnormalities. Fetuses with trisomy 18 and 13 are likely to have major structural anomalies, whereas only about 27% of fetuses with trisomy 21 have a recognizable major structural abnormality by second-trimester ultrasound. Soft sonographic markers have varying associations with trisomy 21 and cannot be used in isolation; the risk associated with each marker should be considered individually within the complete clinical context. When particular or multiple soft markers are present, this may warrant detailed fetal anatomic ultrasound and a review or offering of initial or additional screening and diagnostic testing. For an isolated soft marker when prior screening has not been performed, the patient should be counseled regarding aneuploidy risk and cell-free DNA, quad screen testing, or amniocentesis should be offered; if testing is low risk, no further risk assessment is needed. If more than one marker is identified, then genetic counseling, maternal–fetal medicine consultation, or both are recommended.

### First-trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities [^111Q86zA]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

There is extensive evidence that effective screening for major chromosomal abnormalities can be provided in the first trimester of pregnancy. Randomized studies have established that the risk of miscarriage from chorionic villus sampling in the first trimester is the same as for amniocentesis in the second trimester. Prospective studies have demonstrated that screening by a combination of fetal nuchal translucency (NT) and maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) can identify 90% of fetuses with trisomy 21 and other major chromosomal abnormalities for a false-positive rate of 5%. This is superior to the 30% detection rate achieved by maternal age and 65% by second-trimester maternal serum biochemistry. A further improvement in the effectiveness of first-trimester screening is likely to be achieved by a risk-orientated two-stage approach. In this, the patients are subdivided into a high-risk group, requiring invasive testing, a low-risk group, which can be reassured that an abnormality is unlikely, and an intermediate-risk group (risk of 1 in 101 to 1 in 1000), in which further assessment is performed by first-trimester ultrasound examination (for presence/absence of the nasal bone or presence/absence of tricuspid regurgitation or normal/abnormal Doppler velocity waveform in the ductus venosus), and chorionic villus sampling is performed if their adjusted risk becomes 1 in 100 or more. As with all aspects of good clinical practice, those performing first-trimester scans should be appropriately trained and their results subjected to external quality assurance. This process was well established by the Fetal Medical Foundation several years ago and is widely accepted internationally.

Down syndrome clinical description, etiology, and incidence — scope and mechanisms are summarized as follows: DS is the most common genomic disorder associated with intellectual disability and results from an extra copy of chromosome 21, most commonly from the free chromosome and less frequently from a translocation or other structural chromosome abnormality. DS is identified in approximately 1 in 500 live births, with 95% of cases resulting from sporadic nondisjunction during parental meiosis (most often maternal [95%]) and occurring during meiosis I (75%). The risk of having a child with DS increases with advancing maternal age.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^113bnQt5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 226 — ultrasonographic screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: Nuchal translucency (NT) alone to modify age-related trisomy 21 risk has a detection rate that is approximately 70%, and a NT measurement alone does not add benefit in detecting aneuploidy when cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening has been performed in a singleton gestation. As isolated markers, the absence of the nasal bone shows 49% sensitivity with a 1% false-positive rate and an abnormal ductus venosus waveform shows 67% sensitivity with a 5% false-positive rate for trisomy 21. For structural anomalies, all patients should be offered a second-trimester ultrasound for fetal structural defects, ideally performed between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation (with or without second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein). If a soft marker is identified on the anatomic survey, the patient's medical record should be reviewed to determine if aneuploidy screening has been performed previously; if not, it should be offered, and if screening has been performed, the finding should be placed in context with those results. Soft ultrasonographic markers are nonspecific findings that are generally not pathologic but are more common among fetuses with trisomy 21 or trisomy 18.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^113zEXg8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 226 — serum analyte screening versus cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening and counseling — states that a patient's baseline risk should not limit testing options and that these options "should be discussed and offered to all patients regardless of maternal age or risk for chromosomal abnormality". Cell-free DNA is characterized as "the most sensitive and specific screening test" for trisomies 21, 13, and 18 and "can be performed any time after 9–10 weeks of gestation". Counseling "should include the possibility of incidental findings" such as maternal aneuploidy, mosaicism, or malignancy, and if fetal sex determination is elected, the risk of maternal and fetal sex chromosome aneuploidy should be discussed. Serum analyte screening also screens for fetal anomalies in the first and second trimesters, indirectly identifies other chromosomal abnormalities, and second-trimester screening provides a risk for open fetal defects. In a general-population series of 15,841 patients (mean maternal age 30.7 years), cfDNA had a lower false-positive rate (0.06% vs 5.4%) and a higher PPV (80.9% vs 3.4%) than first-trimester screening. A randomized trial of 1,366 patients with normal ultrasound at 11 to 13 weeks found first-trimester screening had a 2.5% false-positive rate, while cfDNA had a 1.5% no-call rate. A retrospective study of 66,166 patients reported first-trimester screening sensitivity of 89.6% with a 2.9% screen positive rate versus cfDNA sensitivity of 100% with a 2.4% screen positive rate when no-calls were counted as positive. Sequential screening identified more chromosomal abnormalities including other aneuploidies, mosaicism, or large deletions or duplications than cfDNA; diagnosis of these aneuploidies requires diagnostic testing, and if cfDNA is used as follow-up screening these abnormalities would not be detected. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of any major chromosomal abnormality detected on prenatal or postnatal diagnostic testing after a low risk screening result.

Chromosomal abnormalities in second-trimester pregnancies by maternal age — At age 35 years, risks per 10,000 at term are: trisomy 21 34 per 10,000 (1 in 294), trisomy 18 9 per 10,000 (1 in 1,111), trisomy 13 4 per 10,000 (1 in 2,500), sex chromosome aneuploidy 35 per 10,000 (1 in 285), microarray or rare chromosomal abnormality 37 per 10,000 (1 in 270), and all chromosomal abnormalities 119 per 10,000 (1 in 84). At age 40 years, values are: trisomy 21 116 per 10,000 (1 in 86), trisomy 18 30 per 10,000 (1 in 333), trisomy 13 14 per 10,000 (1 in 714), sex chromosome aneuploidy 51 per 10,000 (1 in 196), microarray or rare chromosomal abnormality 37 per 10,000 (1 in 270), and all chromosomal abnormalities 248 per 10,000 (1 in 40). Not all chromosomal abnormalities increase as maternal age increases, and copy number variants are independent of maternal age at pregnancy.

### Fetal chromosomal abnormalities: antenatal screening and diagnosis [^116NSBUT]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Pregnant women of all ages should be offered screening and invasive diagnostic testing for chromosomal abnormalities before 20 weeks' gestation. New developments in screening methods have increased the number of options for patients. Diagnostic options include chorionic villus sampling in the first trimester and amniocentesis in the second trimester. Screening options in the first trimester include nuchal translucency testing in combination with measurement of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and human chorionic gonadotropin. Nuchal translucency testing alone is not as effective. Screening options in the second trimester include serum screening using triple or quadruple screening, and ultrasonography. Patients may also choose a combination of first- and second-trimester screening in an integrated, stepwise sequential, or contingent sequential fashion. These options include an analysis of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, with or without nuchal translucency testing, in combination with quadruple screening. An integrated test with nuchal translucency testing is the most effective method for women who present in the first trimester. If nuchal translucency testing is unavailable, the maternal serum-integrated test is safest and most effective. For women who do not present until the second trimester, the quadruple screen is recommended. Comprehensive counseling should be available to all pregnant women. Specific screening tests will depend on availability of the procedure and patient preference.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 77: screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities [^1173Luif]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

In the last decade, numerous markers and strategies for Down syndrome screening have been developed. Algorithms that combine ultrasound and serum markers in the first and second trimesters have been evaluated. Furthermore, the practice of using age cutoffs to determine whether women should be offered screening or invasive diagnostic testing has been challenged. The purpose of this document is to 1) present and evaluate the best available evidence for the use of ultrasonographic and serum markers for selected aneuploidy screening in pregnancy and 2) offer practical recommendations for implementing Down syndrome screening in practice.

### Second trimester ultrasound screening for chromosomal abnormalities [^115BYVv9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2002). Low credibility.

The use of prenatal ultrasound has proven efficacious for the prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities. The first sonographic sign of Down syndrome, the thickened nuchal fold, was first described in 1985. Since that time, multiple sonographically-identified markers have been described as associated with Down syndrome. The genetic sonogram, involving a detailed search for sonographic signs of aneuploidy, can be used to both identify fetuses at high risk for aneuploidy and, when normal, can be used to decrease the risk for aneuploidy for a pregnancy when no sonographic markers are identified. Combining the genetic sonogram with maternal serum screening may be the best method of assessing aneuploidy risk for women who desire such an assessment in the second trimester. Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13, and triploidy are typically associated with sonographically identified abnormalities and have a high prenatal detection rate. The use of the described sonographic signs in low-risk women requires further investigation, however, patients at increased risk for aneuploidy due to advanced maternal age or abnormal serum screening can benefit from a genetic sonogram screening for sonographic signs of aneuploidy to adjust their baseline risk of an affected fetus.

### Evaluation of down syndrome screening strategies [^115SAZ6p]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Women contemplating pregnancy today have many different Down syndrome screening protocols from which to choose. Sensitive and specific first and second trimester screening protocols are now widely available, and strategies that combine first and second trimester markers are moving from investigational use into the clinical arena. Modeling indicates that a high detection rate (85%) associated with a very low screen positive rate (1.3%) can be achieved with contingent screening, in which all women undergo first trimester screening and only a portion (25%) go on to second trimester screening.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^111h5fiN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Sequential and contingent screening — Sequential screening provides a risk estimate after first-trimester analytes and NT; if the first-trimester risk is greater than the laboratory's positive screening cutoff, additional testing is offered, whereas lower-risk patients receive a negative result and proceed to second-trimester analyte screening to obtain a final combined numerical risk, leveraging higher detection with only a marginal increase in the false-positive rate. In the contingent model, risk is classified as high, intermediate, or low based on first-trimester results; high-risk patients are offered additional testing (diagnostic testing or cell-free DNA), those below a defined low risk threshold are reassured with no further screening or testing, and intermediate-risk patients have first- and second-trimester results combined to calculate a final risk; theoretically, this approach maintains high detection rates with low false-positive rates and reduces the number of second-trimester tests performed.

### The history of the second-trimester sonographic markers for detecting fetal down syndrome, and their current role in obstetric practice [^116J382h]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2010). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the development, history and use of second-trimester sonographic markers for the detection of fetal Down syndrome over three decades. Starting with the nuchal fold thickening in 1985 and culminating in the genetic sonogram in the 1990 s. The combination of second-trimester serum screening with the ultrasound markers improved the detection rate of affected fetuses but also allowed patients to decrease their risk of carrying a fetus with Down syndrome if the genetic sonogram was normal. More recently the role of the genetic sonogram and its markers have changed with the wide spread use of first-trimester screening. This prior screening ultimately decreases the prevalence of fetal Down syndrome in the second trimester to less than 85% of what it was in the first-trimester as most fetuses with Down syndrome are now identified early. Current interpretation of the second-trimester Down syndrome markers must be based on the result of the first trimester and combined screening to achieve the most accurate risk estimate of an affected fetus.

### First-trimester screening [^111GVDyw]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Screening for fetal chromosome abnormalities, particularly for trisomy 21, has made dramatic advances. Better screening demonstrates that "high-risk" patients — particularly over age 35 — can have lower risk of defects than younger unscreened women. This has caused reduction of amniocentesis for older patients and made screening available for younger patients who have the universal 2% to 3% risk. This means lower procedural-related losses of normal fetuses, and better resource allocation. The trend toward first-trimester detection of structural defects continues; a normal survey is reassuring and helps exclude major defects. Based on screening results, patients can be triaged into early follow-up and possible amniocentesis as 14 to 16 weeks, or a later detailed anatomic survey at 18 to 20 weeks.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^115HMpJC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Combined first-trimester and second-trimester screening — Combined approaches (integrated, sequential, or contingent) using serum analytes, nuchal translucency (NT), or both provide a higher detection rate for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 than one-step serum analyte screening. With integrated screening, the patient undergoes first-trimester NT and serum analytes followed by a second-trimester blood draw and receives a single test result in the second trimester. Serum integrated screening, which includes only first- and second-trimester serum analytes, has a lower detection rate than integrated screening that includes an NT measurement but a similar detection rate to first-trimester screening; limitations include delayed results until the second-trimester sample and possible no result if the second blood draw is missed, with failure rates to obtain a second blood draw as high as 25% without a written reminder. The benefit of integrated screening over single time point testing is the higher detection rate and lower false positive rate.

### NSGC practice guideline: prenatal screening and diagnostic testing options for chromosome aneuploidy [^115PDMtG]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2013). Low credibility.

The BUN and FASTER studies, two prospective multicenter trials in the United States, validated the accuracy and detection rates of first and second trimester screening previously reported abroad. These studies, coupled with the 2007 release of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin that endorsed first trimester screening as an alternative to traditional second trimester multiple marker screening, led to an explosion of screening options available to pregnant women. ACOG also recommended that invasive diagnostic testing for chromosome aneuploidy be made available to all women regardless of maternal age. More recently, another option known as Non-invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) became available to screen for chromosome aneuploidy. While screening and testing options may be limited due to a variety of factors, healthcare providers need to be aware of the options in their area in order to provide their patients with accurate and reliable information. If not presented clearly, patients may feel overwhelmed at the number of choices available. The following guideline includes recommendations for healthcare providers regarding which screening or diagnostic test should be offered based on availability, insurance coverage, and timing of a patient's entry into prenatal care, as well as a triage assessment so that a general process can be adapted to unique situations.

### Outcomes of pregnancies with more than one positive prenatal screening result in the first or second trimester [^113exJ89]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe adverse outcomes and fetal abnormalities in women with a positive prenatal screening result for more than one disorder.

Study Design

Study participants were drawn from a population of 452901 women pregnant with singletons entering the California Prenatal Screening Program in their first-trimester. Risk assessment was provided for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 in the first-trimester and trisomy 21, trisomy 18, neural tube defects, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome in the second-trimester. Inclusion in this study required positive screening for more than one of the screened conditions and a completed outcome of pregnancy survey.

Results

A total of 874 women met our study inclusion criteria. Over 25% of these pregnancies had a fetus with a chromosomal abnormality. Of the euploid pregnancies, 6.9% had a fetus with a major birth defect. Of the pregnancies with a fetus with neither a chromosomal abnormality nor a major birth defect, 9.3% ended in fetal demise. Overall, more than 50% of women with multiple positive screening results had either a fetus with a birth defect or a poor pregnancy outcome.

Conclusion

Although it is rare to screen positive for more than one condition, such results indicate a very high risk for chromosomal abnormality, fetal demise, or structural abnormality.

### Determinant of prenatal diagnostic testing among women with increased risk of fetal aneuploidy and genetic disorders [^112cDJMh]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chromosomal abnormalities are present in approximately 1 in 150 live births. Congenital malformation is the leading cause of infant death and a leading cause of childhood death. The United States has one of the highest infant mortality rates among developed nations. In 2013, congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities accounted for 20.3% of the total 23,440 infant deaths in the United States with an infant mortality rate of 5.96 per 1,000 live births. Advances in the application of genomic technology and prenatal ultrasound help to identify approximately 3 to 5% of pregnancies complicated by chromosomal abnormality, genetic disorders, or birth defects. First- and second-trimester genetic screening and diagnostic testing affords patients the ability to receive a vast amount of prenatal genetic information about their unborn child. Prenatal invasive or diagnostic tests, such as the chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis, help to analyze fetal genetic information from placental tissue and amniotic fluid, respectively, to ascertain fetal karyotypes and genetic information.

The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that all pregnant women including those with abnormal maternal serum markers for fetal aneuploidy or fetal structural abnormality on ultrasound be offered prenatal diagnostic genetic testing using either CVS or amniocentesis with chromosomal microarray analysis. However, current evidence does not support performing diagnostic testing in patients with an isolated ultrasound soft marker for fetal aneuploidy, because soft markers are usually nonspecific and can be transient ultrasound findings, or in patients with prior negative screening for fetal aneuploidy on first or second trimester screening or cell-free DNA. Furthermore, the likelihood of fetal chromosomal abnormalities associated with each soft marker varies. The highest likelihood is in fetuses with thickened nuchal fold. However, the presence of two or more soft markers increases the likelihood of fetal chromosomal abnormalities, and thus warrants consideration for diagnostic testing. As a recommended clinical practice, all women with increased risk of fetal aneuploidy should be offered referral for genetic counseling. Genetic counselors educate and counsel patients about genetic disorders through integration of a patient's family and medical histories, and personalized risk assessment of disease occurrence or recurrence. The decision for patients to undergo diagnostic testing is up to the patient after undergoing genetic counseling. Determinants of the patient decisions have not been well studied.

### Practice bulletin no. 175: ultrasound in pregnancy [^116PrUWS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound in pregnancy — aneuploidy risk modification in the first and second trimesters — when nuchal translucency measurements are used to modify maternal age-related risk, the detection rate for trisomy 21 is approximately 70% in a high-risk population, and among fetuses with increased nuchal translucency approximately one third will have chromosome defects with trisomy 21 accounting for approximately 50% of these; individual second-trimester ultrasound markers have a low sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 and a meta-analysis of 48 studies confirms most isolated markers have only a small effect on modifying pretest risk; in high-risk populations, second-trimester detection rates are approximately 50–75% with false-positive rates ranging from 5% to greater than 15%; if no abnormal markers are identified after carefully performed ultrasonography the pretest risk of trisomy 21 in a patient at high risk may be reduced; at this time, risk adjustment based on second-trimester ultrasound markers should be limited to individuals with expertise in this area, and ultrasonography is most effective in detecting trisomy 21 and other aneuploidies when combined with other modalities.

### ACOG committee opinion # 296: first-trimester screening for fetal aneuploidy [^117QnWuU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

First-trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities offers potential advantages over second-trimester screening. Studies in the 1900s demonstrated an association between chromosomal abnormalities and the ultrasonographic finding of abnormally increased nuchal translucency (an echo-free area at the back of the fetal neck) between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. First-trimester screening using nuchal translucency, free beta-hCG, and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A has comparable detection rates and positive screening rates for Down syndrome as second-trimester screening using 4 serum markers (alpha-fetoprotein, beta-hCG, unconjugated estriol, and inhibin-A). Although first-trimester screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18 is an option, it should be offered only if certain criteria can be met.

### Screening for down syndrome – incidental diagnosis of other aneuploidies [^1151Z1B3]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Down syndrome screening programmes lead to the prenatal diagnosis of other chromosomal abnormalities, some of which would not be detected by the secondary use of cell-free (cf)DNA testing in screen positives. This study aims to assess the number of these incidental diagnoses.

Method

This study is a systematic review of the literature to identify large prospective screening studies that reported diagnoses other than trisomies 21 and 18.

Results

There were ten informative prospective studies in which a total of 1,500,999 women were screened, and there were 3689 aneuploidy cases detected in the screen positives. Trisomy 21 was estimated to comprise only 58% of detected aneuploidies, trisomies 21 and 18 comprised 72%, and the common trisomies - 21, 18 and 13 - comprised 76%. Common trisomies and sex chromosome abnormalities, now included in all commercial cfDNA tests, were estimated to comprise 87% of aneuploidies in the Down syndrome screen positives. All these proportions were higher for second trimester protocols compared with those carried out wholly or partly in the first trimester.

Conclusion

Secondary use of cfDNA testing will lead to about one-fifth reduction in diagnoses, taking account of both undetectable aneuploidies and false-negatives. This loss might be overcome by contingent cfDNA testing.

### Fetal aneuploidy: screening and diagnostic testing [^111uasCq]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Aneuploidy is the presence of one or more extra chromosomes or the absence of one or more chromosomes. The risk of fetal aneuploidy rises with increasing maternal age. Because fetal aneuploidy can affect any pregnancy, all pregnant women should be offered screening. First-trimester combined screening performed between 10 and 13 weeks' gestation detects 82% to 87% of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) cases. Second-trimester serum quadruple screening performed between 15 and 22 weeks' gestation detects 81% of trisomy 21 cases. Combinations of these tests include integrated or serum integrated, stepwise sequential, and contingent sequential screenings, all of which improve detection rates compared with each test alone. Fetal cell-free DNA testing (noninvasive prenatal testing) performed at or after 10 weeks' gestation detects more than 99% of trisomy 21 cases, with a lower false-positive rate than traditional first- or second-trimester screening methods. Fetal cell-free DNA testing has similar detection rates in high- and low-risk populations but has lower positive predictive values in younger women. It may be performed as primary screening or as a follow-up test to abnormal findings on first- or second-trimester screenings. Second-trimester ultrasonography has limited utility in aneuploidy screening in women who have already been screened with a first- or second-trimester serum test. Diagnostic tests following a positive screening result include chorionic villus sampling performed between 10 and 13 weeks' gestation or amniocentesis performed after 15 weeks' gestation.

### Detection rates for aneuploidy by first-trimester and sequential screening [^1169XB3v]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate detection rates for aneuploidy by first-trimester and sequential screening.

Methods

The study included women with singleton pregnancies who participated in the California Prenatal Screening Program with estimated delivery dates from August 2009 to December 2012 who had first- or first- and second-trimester (sequential) screening. Detection rates were measured for target (trisomies 21 and 18) and other aneuploidies identified from the California Chromosome Defect Registry.

Results

Of 452,901 women screened, 17,435 (3.8%) were screen-positive for Down syndrome only; 433 (0.1%) for trisomy 18 only; 1,689 (0.4%) for both Down syndrome and trisomy 18; and 2,947 (0.7%) for neural tube defects, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, or for multiple conditions. The detection rates were Down syndrome-92.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.4–94.2); trisomy 18–93.2% (95% CI 90.5–95.9); trisomy 13–80.4% (95% CI 73.9–86.9); 45, X-80.1% (95% CI 73.9–86.3), and triploidy-91.0% (95% CI 84.2–97.9). Overall, the detection rate for chromosome abnormalities was 81.6% (95% CI 80.0–83.1) at an overall false-positive rate of 4.5%.

Conclusion

First-trimester and sequential screening are sensitive and specific for the broad range of karyotype abnormalities seen in the population.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities (Level C) advises that multiple serum screening approaches performed independently, such as a first-trimester screening test followed by a quad screen as an unlinked test, are not recommended because they will result in an unacceptably high positive screening rate and could deliver contradictory risk estimates. In multifetal gestations with a fetal demise, vanishing twin, or anomaly in one fetus, there is a significant risk of an inaccurate result if serum-based aneuploidy screening or cell-free DNA is used; this should be reviewed with the patient and diagnostic testing should be offered. Patients with unusual or multiple aneuploidies detected by cell-free DNA should be referred for genetic counseling and maternal–fetal medicine consultation.

cfDNA as a primary screen — cfDNA screening for DS has a very low false-positive rate (FPR) and a very high detection rate (DR), but costs have been higher than serum screening and may not be as well covered by insurance, raising access concerns; in 2022 a systematic review resulted in evidence-based guidelines by ACMG, and the research group strongly recommended prenatal cfDNA screening for the general population over traditional methods in both singleton and twin pregnancies for trisomies 21, 18, and 13, as well as sex chromosome abnormalities; additional drivers include the ability to reveal fetal sex early, and some programs maintain first trimester ultrasound because it provides useful information including early pregnancy dating, visualization of structural anomalies, identification of multiple gestations, molar pregnancies, and fetal death.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a secondary screening test — given sensitivity and specificity for Down syndrome > 99%, it is used after a positive serum screen, and it is therefore recommended that positive cfDNA tests be verified with diagnostic testing; two validated models combine cfDNA with first-trimester screening: a contingent/recall model defining high risk (eg, > 1:150 for DS) and moderate risk (eg, 1:150 to 1:800) and a reflex model in which a second sample is used only if risk is increased (eg, > 1:250) with a single report, with approximately equal DR for trisomy 21 at similar costs but far more screened positives (100-fold) and invasive testing (20-fold) in contingent testing; both approaches can detect trisomy 18 and 13, and for both models the DR for the common trisomies can be in the range of 91% to 95%.

### Sonographic screening for fetal aneuploidy: first trimester [^111pvXmj]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Screening for fetal aneuploidy is now possible during the first trimester using sonographic and biochemical markers. The aim of this review was to summarize the efficacy and use of nuchal translucency in screening for fetal aneuploidy, especially fetal Down syndrome, and other anomalies.

Methods

We reviewed available literature regarding first-trimester screening. This includes more than 16 studies of nuchal translucency as a marker for fetal aneuploidy published since 1995.

Results

Although early studies showed wide variation in detection of fetal Down syndrome when using nuchal translucency, more recent studies showed sensitivities of approximately 70% to 80%, for a 5% false-positive rate. Increased nuchal translucency has also been found to be a marker for other aneuploidies, including trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and Turner syndrome. Maternal serum biochemical screening can be used as a test for aneuploidy during the first trimester The 2 maternal serum markers that appear to be most useful in the late first trimester are the free beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A. Together with maternal age, these markers yield a detection rate for trisomy 21 of approximately 60%, for a 5% false-positive rate. Because sonographic and biochemical markers appear to be largely independent, their combined risk results in improved detection rates compared with either method alone. As a result, the combination of nuchal translucency, biochemical markers, and maternal age has achieved a detection rate of approximately 85%, for a 5% false-positive level for detection of trisomy 21. A newly proposed "integrated" approach using a panel of first- and second-trimester markers suggests that further improvement in the screening performance is possible. A number of questions regarding first-trimester screening remain. We address some of these questions: is first-trimester screening more effective than second-trimester screening? How to account for intrauterine lethality? Is earlier diagnosis important, and will it be accepted by patients? Is first-trimester screening cost-effective? How should first-trimester screening be interpreted with second-trimester tests?

Conclusions

Despite encouraging data and general enthusiasm for first-trimester screening for fetal Down syndrome and other aneuploidies, a number of questions remain about its implementation in the United States. Multicenter studies currently under way should help answer some of these questions.

### Is ultrasound alone enough for prenatal screening of trisomy 18? A single centre experience in 69 cases over 10 years [^115WgcCC]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate ultrasound scan and other prenatal screening tests for trisomy 18 in a regional obstetric unit and to review the management approach for women with positive trisomy 18 screening results.

Methods

Prenatal diagnosis databases were accessed to identify fetuses that had confirmed trisomy 18 karyotypes or were at high risk for trisomy 18 on second-trimester biochemical screening or first-trimester combined screening tests over a period of 10 years from 1 September 1997 to 30 September 2007.

Results

Sixty-nine women were confirmed to have trisomy 18 fetuses by karyotyping either prenatally (n = 61) or postnatally/post-miscarriage (n = 8) during the study period. The detection rate of ultrasound scan ≤ 14 weeks and 18 to 21 weeks to detect trisomy 18 was 92.7 and 100%, respectively. A total of 80 and 87% of fetuses had two or more ultrasound abnormalities detected in the ≤ 14 weeks and 18 to 21 weeks anomaly scans, respectively. Forty-eight women screened positive for trisomy 18 by second-trimester biochemical screening with human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Only one was true positive (positive predictive value = 1/48 or 2%). Eleven women screened positive for trisomy 18 by first-trimester combined screening with nuchal translucency scan and maternal serum for pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and hCG between 11 and 13 + 6 weeks. Three were true positive (positive predictive value = 3/11 or 27%). All four cases with positive screening had ultrasound abnormalities.

Conclusions

Ultrasound scan for fetal anomalies is the most effective screening test for trisomy 18. A policy of conservative management for women with positive second-trimester biochemical screening or first-trimester combined screening for trisomy 18 is reasonable in the absence of ultrasound fetal abnormalities. Unnecessary invasive tests can be avoided.

### First trimester diagnosis and screening for fetal aneuploidy [^111WrFgv]. Genetics in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Maternal serum screening for neural tube defects and fetal aneuploidy in the second trimester has been incorporated into obstetrical practice over the past two decades. Now, as a result of several multicenter trials, first trimester screening between 11 and 14 weeks has been shown to be an effective and reliable screening test for Down syndrome and trisomy 18. Benefits of first trimester screening include earlier identification of the pregnancy at risk for fetal aneuploidy and anatomic defects, in particular, cardiac anomalies, and the option of earlier diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling, if available. This policy updates the American College of Medical Genetics policy statement entitled Second Trimester Maternal Serum Screening for Fetal Open Neural Tube Defects and Aneuploidy (2004) and complements the sections of American College of Medical Genetic's Standards and Guidelines for Clinical Genetics Laboratories entitled "Prenatal screening for Down syndrome that includes first trimester biochemistry and/or ultrasound measurements".

### Is the first-trimester combined screening result associated with the phenotype of down syndrome? A population-based cohort study [^116beE2e]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

We identified 2167 trisomy 21 cases (Figure 1) of which 1672 (77.2%) had a screen positive result on FTS, 242 (11.2%) had a screen negative result, and 253 (11.7%) had no screen result (Table 1). The distribution of pregnancy outcomes differed between FTS result groups with more screen positive pregnancies being terminated (89.8%) compared with screen negative pregnancies (21.9%) (Table 1). At gestational age 19 + 0, a total of 476 cases were available for second trimester anthropometry analyses. Among 362 live‐born cases (Figure 1), 83 (22.9%) were screen positive, 176 (48.6%) were screen negative, and 103 (28.5%) were not screened. Median follow up of live‐born children in the entire study population was 6.31 years (interquartile range 2.80–10.06 years).

### Prenatal screening for trisomy 21: a comparative performance and cost analysis of different screening strategies [^117B5Eah]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prenatal screening for common chromosome aneuploidies has been a part of routine prenatal care in developed countries since the early 1990's. Conventional prenatal screening tests, also known as multiple marker screening (MMS), measure maternal serum biochemical markers and, if performed in the first trimester, the nuchal translucency (NT) ultrasound marker. MMS is used to estimate the risk for trisomy 21, 18 and 13 in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy.

In recent years, cell-free fetal DNA (cfDNA) screening has been introduced into clinical use. cfDNA screening assesses the risk for aneuploidy in the fetus by measuring cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood. The most commonly used cfDNA tests use sequencing-based technologies such as whole genome or targeted sequencing. Whole genome sequencing involves whole genome assay with next generation sequencing. Targeted tests require only sequencing of specific regions of clinical relevance, and therefore have a lower cost, reduced assay variability and shorter analysis time. However, it uses complex genetic analysis platforms requiring a relatively advanced laboratory setup. Sequencing-based cfDNA analysis for trisomy 21 aims to determine the proportion of sequenced plasma DNA molecules originating from chromosome 21 relative to other chromosomes, as this proportion is expected to be elevated in maternal plasma in pregnancies with a trisomy 21 fetus. This cfDNA method has a detection rate (DR) of about 99% and a false positive rate (FPR) of about 0.1% for trisomy 21 compared to a DR of 85–87% and FPR of 3% provided by the first trimester combined screening (FTS). It also detects about 91–96% of trisomy 18 and 13 cases for a FPR of about 0.12%. cfDNA screening is however significantly more costly than MMS. Additionally, with sequencing- based cfDNA screening, about 2–3% of the women will receive a no-call result with low fraction of fetal DNA being the most common reason. cfDNA screening technologies are quickly evolving. For example, a testing platform using automated high precision Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA)/Imaging solution has been reported recently. This test uses novel molecular probe technology that specifically labels target chromosomes and digital molecular quantification without DNA amplification, microarrays or sequencing. It provides a similar DR to the sequencing-based cfDNA screening but with a lower no-call rate since the technology is less influenced by the fetal fraction. It is also fully automated, less expensive than sequencing based tests and can be implemented in a non-molecular laboratory setting.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening [^1114yjMh]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Loss of additional findings with NIPT for common autosomal aneuploidies

As long as NIPT is used to only look for Down syndrome and trisomies 18 and 13, introducing this new test will de facto lead to narrowing the range of clinically relevant conditions that the screening may bring to light. This is because, firstly, in each of the above scenarios, the follow-up rate and therefore also the rate of chromosomal abnormalities other than the targeted trisomies that may be detected at follow-up, will be (up to around 20%) lower than with the traditional approach. Some of these additional findings are serious conditions, not all of which will come to light with the second trimester fetal anomaly scan.

Although the risk of thus missing a clinically relevant chromosomal abnormality is actually quite low (estimated range between 1:1600 and 1:4000), some commentators have suggested that the benefits of NIPT may not outweigh the loss of these extra findings at the stage of invasive follow-up. However, the problem with forgoing those benefits for this reason is that it puts women at a higher miscarriage risk in order to maximize the detection of conditions outside the scope of the screening to which they have consented. There is also an equal access problem here: maximizing detection of additional findings at follow-up does not equally benefit all those initially at the same risk for the relevant conditions. A recent proposal is to make better use of cFTS markers (including NT-measurement) in order to define higher risk groups to whom invasive testing would still have to be offered. Clearly, this would require redefining the scope of the screening (also in the pretest information and consent procedures) as targeting a wider range of chromosomal abnormalities than Down syndrome and other common autosomal aneuploidies.

- the possibility of a failed ('no-call') test, false-negative or false-positive fetal aneuploidy result, or unexpected fetal or maternal result

- all positive maternal cell-free DNA screening results should be confirmed with diagnostic fetal testing

- routine cell-free DNA screening for fetal microdeletions is not currently recommended

### Second-trimester prenatal screening for trisomy 21 using biochemical markers: a 7-year experience in one cytogenetic laboratory [^115pjgsf]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Screening for trisomy 21 in the second trimester of pregnancy using biochemical markers is an established part of prenatal care in many developed countries.

Objective

The present study was aimed at determining the incidence of trisomy 21 and other chromosomal abnormalities in women undergoing prenatal chromosome analysis after a second-trimester biochemical screening.

Results

A total of 2832 karyotypes were analyzed following a positive second-trimester maternal serum screening (risk ≥ 1/250) between 1998 and 2004. Thirty-nine cases of trisomy 21 and 40 other chromosomal abnormalities were detected. The positive predictive value was 1 in 73 karyotypes for trisomy 21 and 1 in 71 for the other chromosomal abnormalities. However, a temporal decline in the detection rate of trisomy 21 was noted, from 1/63 in 1998 to 1/221 in 2004. This change was attributable to an increasing number of pregnant women having first-trimester ultrasound nuchal translucency measurement.

Conclusion

Given the fact that nuchal translucency measurement combined with first-trimester biochemical marker screening has a positive predictive value of trisomy 21 comparable to that obtained following second-trimester biochemical screening, we should question whether to move trisomy 21 screening by maternal serum markers from the second trimester to the first trimester in conjunction with nuchal translucency measurement. Furthermore, genetic counseling prior to the amniocentesis should discuss the relatively high probability that a chromosomal abnormality other than trisomy 21 may be identified.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^117Ft8zF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Second-trimester screening (quad, triple, penta) — The quadruple marker screen can be performed from approximately 15 0/7 weeks to 22 6/7 weeks of gestation and measures human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), dimeric inhibin A (DIA), and unconjugated estriol (uE3) with maternal factors to estimate risk; its detection rate for trisomy 21 is 80% with a 5% false-positive rate. A few laboratories offer a penta screen that adds hyperglycosylated hCG, but its performance has not been rigorously evaluated prospectively. The triple marker screen (hCG, AFP, uE3) has lower sensitivity for trisomy 21, with sensitivity of 69% at a 5% positive screening test result rate, and the quad screen has been shown to be more effective and less costly than the triple screen.

### Is the first-trimester combined screening result associated with the phenotype of down syndrome? A population-based cohort study [^116oADsy]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

All pregnant women in Denmark are offered first and second trimester ultrasound scans free of charge at public, tax‐financed hospitals. At the first trimester scan, FTS is offered to estimate the odds of trisomies 13, 18, and 21 at the time of screening. At the second trimester scan, fetal anatomy is assessed including anthropometric measurements and detection of potential malformations. The first and second trimester scans, performed by Fetal Medicine Foundation‐certified health care professionals, show attendance rates of approximately 90% and 95%, respectively, of all pregnant women in the country. A prior study based on Danish data from 2009 to 2012 found the sensitivity of FTS for trisomy 21 to be 94.2%. A minority of trisomy 21 cases were thus screen negative, while another minority had not undergone FTS. These two groups may be diagnosed with trisomy 21 later in pregnancy (e.g. following the detection of a malformation) or after birth. In fact, the same authors reported that FTS had been negative in 48.0% of live‐born children with trisomy 21 or had not been performed in another 30.4%. When trisomy 21 was diagnosed prenatally, 82.2% of pregnancies were terminated.

### Rapid testing versus karyotyping in Down's syndrome screening: cost-effectiveness and detection of clinically significant chromosome abnormalities [^117H3tCi]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

CA missed by RAD

Because the clinical significance (ie, preventable morbidity and mortality) of detecting CA in perinatal and live born babies depends on the type of CA, we used results from Caine et al to simulate the number and type of expected CA in our population, to evaluate CA missed by RAD and to estimate their potential level of adverse outcome. The study by Caine et al constitutes the largest published retrospective cytogenetic audit, assessing 142 605 prenatal diagnoses. In the simulations, the CA were classified as detectable, sometimes detectable or undetectable by RAD and for clinical significance, as background risk, low-to-high risk and high risk of adverse outcome (Table 4). Also, we estimated the additional costs of detecting clinically significant CA missed by RAD by calculating the ICERobtained if full karyotyping is performed.

Test performance

The distribution of SURUSS marker results in DS-affected and DS-unaffected pregnancies was used to determine the screening test performances. All false-positive rates and risk cutoffs were standardised to the same gestational age (11-week gestation) for first-trimester measurements. To compare first-trimester versus second-trimester screening procedures on a common basis, we used a fixed detection rate, which is more applicable than a fixed false-positive rate because applying the latter to the first-trimester as compared with the second-trimester results in a different detection rate, notably from the spontaneous losses of DS foetuses between the first and second trimesters. We chose the 90% detection rate as it is that used in the literature for test performances and cutoffs specified for all the screening tests (integrated, sequential and contingent screening tests) used in the first and second trimesters. Also, as of April 2010, the UK National Screening Committee targets a detection rate of more than 90%.

Costs

In Canada, in accordance with the Canadian Health Care Act, all medical necessary services are provided under the public healthcare system and are free of charge. Costs from provincial technical units were used for laboratory and imaging tests as previously detailed. Costs reported in Table 2 for screening tests do not reflect the cost of any single procedure but the mean cost for all medical necessary services provided for each screening option. Items considered for costing included screening costs as well as healthcare and medical services related to the following outcomes: birth, spontaneous miscarriage, elective abortion or procedure-related euploid miscarriages. Costs are expressed in Canadian dollars (CAD). The average exchange rate in 2007 was: 1.0748 CAD = 1.00 USD = 0.73 EUR.

Screening performance — definitions for Down syndrome screening state that clinical sensitivity, or detection rate (DR), is the proportion of affected pregnancies that test positive, whereas clinical specificity is the proportion of unaffected pregnancies that test negative, and the DR and false-positive rate (FPR) depend on analyte combinations, screening cut-off, and maternal age distribution. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) measure the test's ability to give accurate clinical information for a given population, and because the prevalence of DS in a screening population is low (eg, 1:500 at term in the general US population), the NPV is generally not computed or reported.

ACMG technical standard — risk calculation methods for Down syndrome (DS) screening: Patient-specific DS risks are generated by complex algorithms integral to prenatal screening that commonly use adjusted MoM values to calculate a likelihood ratio based on overlapping multivariate Gaussian distributions defined by the affected and unaffected population parameters; the a priori risk for DS, based on maternal age at term, is then multiplied by the patient's likelihood ratio to calculate a patient-specific risk. It is also possible to provide risks specific to the late first trimester, early second trimester, or at term using published rates of spontaneous loss, and risks can be expressed relative to DS prevalence at either the trimester at which the sample is taken (1st or 2nd) or at term; calculation of the 1st trimester risk is achieved by multiplying the term risk by 1.75 and in the 2nd trimester, multiplying by 1.3.

### Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) for fetal chromosome abnormalities in a general-risk population: an evidence-based clinical guideline of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^116W1roU]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG evidence-based guideline — noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) in general-risk pregnancy: ACMG recommends NIPS for all pregnant individuals over traditional screening for common trisomies (in singleton and twin pregnancies) and SCAs (singleton pregnancies). This recommendation is driven primarily by the overall superior screening characteristics of NIPS, and the convenience of obtaining results from a single first trimester blood draw is advantageous for patients. Introduction of NIPS into clinical practice has resulted in a dramatic reduction of invasive (diagnostic) testing, and patients view the ability to have a reliable and accurate screen that may preclude the need for such testing as a large benefit. To provide the highest level of care and meaningful recommendations, careful and thorough counseling is imperative, and further investigation of the variety of information delivery formats for this counseling is warranted. Further study is needed to address several aspects of NIPS implementation; screening for CNV merits further validation. Education and training of providers that offer NIPS should be standardized and updated as new developments are introduced, and informative education materials that are free of marketing interests and provide well-founded benefits and limitations of screening should be developed and validated. The impact of potential harms remains understudied and should be specific to the variety of conditions included in the different NIPS assays. NIPS has been a practice-changing advance in prenatal care, and its expansion into use for a general-risk population should be applied with the diligence and attentiveness it deserves.

Management states: "If isolated finding, aneuploidy testing should be offered if not previously performed. Repeat US in third trimester to assess need for postnatal imaging".

### NSGC practice guideline: prenatal screening and diagnostic testing options for chromosome aneuploidy [^1167yWae]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, more specifically with respect to choice of screening test (amniocentesis, general population), NSGC 2013 guidelines recommend to offer diagnostic testing by either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis in patients with an increased nuchal translucency (≥ 95th % or ≥ 3.0 mm). Refer for fetal echocardiography if the nuchal translucency is ≥ 3.5 mm.

Contingent screening with nuchal translucency (NT) measurements — first-trimester results are divided into 3 outcomes (screen-positive, screen-negative, and intermediate/pending risk), and only intermediate-risk patients proceed to second-trimester testing for an integrated risk; this approach allows early DS diagnosis for screen positives and early reassurance for screen negatives, achieves higher performance while simplifying the patient experience, is more complex for the laboratory to implement due to multiple risk estimates and unresolved second-trimester open neural tube defect screening, and formal pilot studies may be warranted before routine implementation.

### What is the importance of second-trimester "soft markers" for trisomy 21 after an 11-to 14-week aneuploidy screening scan? [^116bPJb5]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of second-trimester "soft markers" for trisomy 21 after an 11- to 14-week aneuploidy screening scan.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients referred for measurement of the nuchal translucency (NT) as part of a screening protocol for aneuploidy. Patients who returned for an anatomic survey between 16 and 20 weeks' gestation were evaluated. The sonographic markers and anomalies associated with the detection of trisomy 21 in the second trimester were analyzed.

Results

There were 42 fetuses (0.4%) with trisomy 21 identified in the study cohort of 9692 patients. Trisomy 21 was suspected at the NT scan in 28 fetuses (67%) and at the second-trimester anatomic survey in 14 (33%). In fetuses first suspected of having trisomy 21 in the second trimester, 9 of 14 had normal anatomic survey results, and 5 of 14 had congenital malformations. All 14 fetuses had soft markers for aneuploidy. A thickened nuchal fold was identified in 5 of 9 fetuses with trisomy 21 and normal anatomic survey results, all of whom had an NT of less than 3.0 mm at the initial screening scan.

Conclusions

Second-trimester soft markers, especially a thickened nuchal fold, remain important observations in the detection of trisomy 21 by sonography among fetuses who have had first-trimester sonographic screening for aneuploidy.

Epidemiological and long-term monitoring of screening performance indicates that screening programs must perform epidemiological monitoring by gathering data from the screened population to calculate metrics to use as extended quality control measures. Minimally, this should include periodic computation (monthly or weekly depending on sample numbers) of the median MoM for each analyte and determination of the statistical significance of any deviation from 1.00, and all corrective actions must be documented. Laboratories should periodically compute their initial positive rate and compare it with expected published rates after accounting for the specific combination of analytes and the risk cut-off level. Whenever possible, laboratories should collect pregnancy outcome data for pregnancies with initial screen-positive results, and for laboratories with sufficient resources, complete pregnancy follow-up is recommended to determine the trisomy 21 DR.

Age-associated trisomy risk and expected case counts — applied to 2018 United States liveborn births — are provided for Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21), trisomy 18 (T18), and trisomy 13 (T13) across first trimester (12 weeks), second trimester (18 weeks), and term. Totals across all maternal ages estimate DS cases of 14,134 (first trimester), 10,463 (second trimester), and 8,056 (term); T18 cases of 3,545, 2,836, and 993; and T13 cases of 1,135, 998, and 579, from 3,978,497 births. Computed overall population odds are 1 in 281, 380, and 494 for DS; 1 in 1,122, 1,403, and 4,008 for T18; and 1 in 3,505, 3,987, and 6,873 for T13, with corresponding rates per 100,000 of 355, 263, and 202 (DS); 89, 71, and 25 (T18); and 29, 25, and 15 (T13). As an example of use, for maternal age 32 years there were 233,650 births and the DS term risk was 1 in 696, with estimated DS cases of 563 at 12 weeks, 417 at 18 weeks, and 321 at term. Births to mothers under age 15 and those above age 50 are included in the first and last categories, respectively.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, more specifically with respect to choice of screening test, general principles, SOGC 2024 guidelines recommend to offer patients the choice among the following:

- no aneuploidy screening

- standard aneuploidy prenatal screening based on locally available programs, which may include various combinations of serum screening and nuchal translucency

- maternal plasma cell-free DNA screening, where available

- invasive diagnostic testing using chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.
