## Question

Is it possible for sypillis to cause median vessel vasculitid and an aneurysm?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about syphilis as a cause of medium vessel vasculitis and whether it can lead to aneurysm formation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and vessel-size classification to ensure we are speaking precisely. Then, I should verify that syphilis is indeed a proven cause of vasculitis and define the typical vessel involvement. Next, I will examine the evidence for medium-sized artery disease in syphilis, particularly in the CNS. After that, I need to check whether the vasculitic process leads to aneurysm formation in both large and medium vessels. Finally, I will synthesize the pathophysiology and conclude with clinical implications and caveats about rarity and diagnosis.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we do not drift off course. The question mentions "sypillis" and "median vessel vasculitid", which I should correct to syphilis and medium vessel vasculitis, respectively. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "median" versus "medium"; in vasculitis nosology, diseases are organized by predominant vessel caliber into large, medium, and small vessels, with medium vessels referring to the main visceral and muscular arteries rather than "median" as a typographical error. I should double-check the standard diagnostic framework and imaging perspectives that reinforce this classification so that downstream reasoning about mechanisms and complications stays anchored in accepted definitions.

> Next, I should verify that syphilis truly causes vasculitis. The histopathology of cardiovascular syphilis shows characteristic inflammation involving all layers of the aortic wall with plasma cell–rich infiltrates and focal destruction of the media, consistent with syphilitic aortitis, which is a form of infectious vasculitis. Wait, let me verify the source of that medial destruction and the infiltrate composition; the classic descriptions document adventitial fibrosis, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and endarteritis obliterans of the vasa vasorum, confirming an infectious vasculitic process due to Treponema pallidum. This firmly establishes syphilis as a cause of vasculitis, particularly of the aorta, and remains relevant despite the antibiotic era [^112L2LB1] [^115DKN3R] [^112af83H].

> I will now examine the predominant vessel size involved by syphilis to avoid overgeneralizing. The strongest and most frequent manifestation is large-vessel disease, namely syphilitic aortitis with potential for aortic regurgitation and aneurysm, especially of the ascending aorta and arch. Let me think about the imaging correlates to ensure I am not missing alternative explanations; cross-sectional imaging typically shows diffuse aortic mural thickening with possible multiple saccular aneurysms, aligning with the pathologic changes, and large clinical series and reviews consistently list aortic aneurysm among cardiovascular syphilis complications, underscoring that large-vessel involvement is the canonical pattern [^115DKN3R] [^111Fy2oy] [^112af83H].

> But wait, what if the question is probing less common patterns such as medium-sized arterial disease. I need to check for evidence beyond the aorta. Meningovascular syphilis is a recognized entity and, in cohorts of nonatherosclerotic intracranial vasculopathy, infectious etiologies, including syphilis, have been documented to affect large- and medium-sized cerebral arteries with characteristic angiographic changes. Hold on, I should verify that this refers to medium-caliber intracranial vessels rather than small perforators; magnetic resonance angiography and vessel wall imaging studies highlight involvement of medium-sized intracranial arteries and support infectious vasculitis mechanisms in syphilis as one of the identified causes in such series, particularly within the CNS vasculature [^111SyDk8] [^111XdAfV] [^114TbDj6].

> I should confirm whether this vasculitic process can progress to aneurysm formation, and not just stenosis or occlusion. For large vessels, the answer is clear: syphilitic aortitis leads to weakening and aneurysm formation via obliterative endarteritis of the vasa vasorum, with classic imaging and pathologic descriptions of multiple saccular thoracic aneurysms. Hmm, wait a minute, does this extrapolate to medium vessels as well; infectious vasculitis reviews explicitly note that intracranial infectious vasculitis, including syphilis, can result in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, and aneurysm formation, thereby supporting aneurysm risk in involved medium-sized intracranial arteries too [^115DKN3R] [^114TbDj6] [^115zgXzN].

> Let me consider the underlying pathophysiology to ensure mechanistic coherence. The sequence typically involves treponemal infection of the vasa vasorum, leading to obliterative endarteritis with ischemic injury to the arterial media, followed by inflammatory infiltrates that damage elastic tissue and smooth muscle. I should double-check that this cascade is the one tied to wall weakening and dilatation; yes, medial destruction predisposes to dilation and aneurysm formation under systemic pressure, a mechanism that explains the classic aortic changes and plausibly applies to medium-caliber arteries where vasa vasorum-based injury and transmural inflammation occur, particularly in the CNS circulation [^112L2LB1] [^115DKN3R] [^115zgXzN].

> Hold on, I should verify clinical nuances and diagnostic steps so the conclusion is actionable. In suspected cardiovascular or meningovascular syphilis, serologic confirmation plus targeted imaging are critical, and when tertiary disease is entertained, guidelines support CSF assessment in appropriate contexts and anticipate adjunctive corticosteroids around antibiotic therapy to mitigate Jarisch-Herxheimer–related complications in neurosyphilis or cardiovascular involvement. Let me reconsider whether recent case-based data still confirm these approaches; contemporary reports and guidance continue to emphasize multimodality imaging when aortitis is in the differential and recommend guideline-concordant testing and treatment pathways for late syphilis with vascular involvement [^1125sxR6] [^116nTGt2] [^112Wp2Ju] [^114PJWe8].

> In summary, I need to ensure the answer is precise. Yes, syphilis is a confirmed infectious cause of vasculitis, classically involving large vessels such as the aorta, and it can cause aneurysm formation via vasa vasorum endarteritis and medial destruction. Although less common, syphilis can involve medium-sized arteries, most convincingly documented in the CNS as meningovascular syphilis with medium-caliber intracranial vessel involvement, and infectious vasculitis in this setting can lead to aneurysm formation. Therefore, syphilis can cause medium vessel vasculitis and can lead to aneurysms, with the caveat that medium-vessel manifestations are rarer and best substantiated in intracranial circulations [^112af83H] [^111SyDk8] [^114TbDj6] [^115DKN3R].

Yes, syphilis can cause medium-vessel vasculitis and aneurysm formation, most classically as **syphilitic aortitis** with ascending aortic aneurysms [^112af83H] [^115DKN3R]. The pathogenesis is **endarteritis obliterans** of the vasa vasorum [^115DKN3R], leading to medial necrosis, fibrosis, and aneurysm formation [^111Fy2oy]. While the aorta is the primary site [^112L2LB1], syphilis can rarely involve other medium-sized arteries (e.g. coronary [^115DKN3R], innominate [^111LZgAK], carotid [^111SyDk8]) [^111Fy2oy]. Diagnosis relies on serology [^112KRZZB], imaging [^115DKN3R], and histopathology [^112L2LB1]; treatment is penicillin [^1125sxR6] with surgical or endovascular repair for large or symptomatic aneurysms [^112Whrau] [^117JncbJ].

---

## Pathophysiology of syphilitic vasculitis and aneurysm formation

- **Endarteritis obliterans**: Chronic inflammation of the vasa vasorum causes luminal narrowing/occlusion, ischemic medial necrosis, and fibrosis [^115DKN3R] [^111Fy2oy].

- **Medial necrosis and fibrosis**: Ischemic injury leads to medial necrosis, elastic fiber loss, and fibrosis, weakening the wall and promoting aneurysms [^115DKN3R] [^112L2LB1].

- **Aneurysm formation**: Wall weakening causes progressive dilation and aneurysm formation, most often in the ascending aorta [^115DKN3R] [^111Fy2oy].

---

## Clinical manifestations and anatomical distribution

Syphilitic vasculitis and aneurysms **most commonly involve the ascending aorta**, but other medium-sized arteries may also be affected:

| **Artery involved** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Ascending aorta | - Aneurysm [^115DKN3R] <br/> - Aortic regurgitation [^111Fy2oy] <br/> - Heart failure [^112af83H] <br/> - Rupture [^112L2LB1] |
| Aortic arch | - Aneurysm [^115DKN3R] <br/> - Branch occlusion [^111Fy2oy] <br/> - Stroke [^112L2LB1] |
| Coronary arteries | - Coronary ostial stenosis [^115DKN3R] [^112L2LB1] <br/> - Myocardial infarction [^111Fy2oy] |
| Innominate artery | - Aneurysm <br/> - Occlusion <br/> - Stroke [^111LZgAK] |
| Carotid arteries | - Aneurysm <br/> - Stroke [^111SyDk8] [^112L2LB1] |

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of syphilitic vasculitis and aneurysms requires **clinical evaluation, serological testing, imaging studies, and histopathological examination**:

- **Clinical evaluation**: History, risk factors, and exam findings (e.g. aneurysm, aortic regurgitation, neurologic deficits) [^111Fy2oy] [^112L2LB1].

- **Serological testing**: Nontreponemal (RPR, VDRL) and treponemal (FTA-ABS, TPPA) tests confirm syphilis [^112af83H] [^112KRZZB].

- **Imaging studies**: CT/MRI show aortic wall thickening, calcification, and aneurysms [^115DKN3R]; PET/CT may detect early inflammation [^112C2Th8] [^111Fy2oy].

- **Histopathological examination**: Endarteritis obliterans, medial necrosis, and fibrosis confirm syphilitic vasculitis [^111H3aYD] [^112L2LB1].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment of syphilitic vasculitis and aneurysms comprises **antibiotic therapy** and, when indicated, **surgical or endovascular intervention**. Antibiotic therapy with **penicillin G** is first-line; alternatives include doxycycline, amoxicillin with probenecid, or ceftriaxone [^1125sxR6] [^114bChmN]. Surgical or endovascular intervention is indicated for **large or symptomatic aneurysms** to prevent rupture or complications [^112Whrau] [^117JncbJ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Untreated syphilitic vasculitis and aneurysms are associated with **significant morbidity and mortality**:

- **Aneurysm rupture**: Life-threatening hemorrhage [^111Fy2oy] [^115DKN3R] [^112L2LB1].

- **Aortic regurgitation and heart failure**: From aortic root involvement [^111Fy2oy] [^112af83H] [^112L2LB1].

- **Coronary ostial stenosis and myocardial infarction**: From coronary involvement [^115DKN3R] [^111Fy2oy] [^112L2LB1].

- **Stroke and neurologic deficits**: From cerebral or carotid involvement [^111Fy2oy] [^111SyDk8] [^112L2LB1].

---

Syphilis can cause **medium-vessel vasculitis and aneurysm formation**, most often as syphilitic aortitis with ascending aortic aneurysms. The mechanism is endarteritis obliterans of the vasa vasorum, leading to medial necrosis, fibrosis, and aneurysm formation. Diagnosis relies on serology, imaging, and histopathology, and treatment includes penicillin with surgical or endovascular repair for large or symptomatic aneurysms.

### Syphilis as a cause of thoracic aortic aneurysm [^111Fy2oy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

In 2009, we described morphologic findings in 22 patients who underwent resection of an ascending aortic aneurysm over the previous 11 years at the Baylor University Medical Center. Histologic examination of the aneurysmal wall disclosed classic findings of syphilitic aortitis. The major purpose of that extensively illustrated report was to describe the characteristic gross features of the aneurysm, enabling the better recognition of syphilitic aortitis during surgery and the administration of appropriate antibiotics postoperatively. The aim of the present study was to emphasize that syphilis remains a major cause of ascending aortic aneurysm.

From January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, we studied an additional 23 patients who underwent resection of an ascending aortic aneurysm, again showing histological features of syphilitic aortitis. All 23 patients were found to have syphilitic aortitis both grossly and histologically. The aneurysm involved the ascending portion of the aorta in all 23 patients, the arch portion in 12, and the descending thoracic portion in 10. In conclusion, syphilis has far from disappeared; it remains a major cause of ascending aortic aneurysm.

### Identifying cardiovascular syphilis at operation [^112L2LB1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

To describe the morphologic features so the process can be easily identified during surgery, we studied 34 patients with cardiovascular syphilis, 32 of whom underwent excision and replacement of the ascending aorta or aortic valve or both. Of the 34 patients, 22 were treated at Baylor University Medical Center from 1998 to 2008 and 12 at non-Baylor University Medical Center hospitals from 1958 to 1987. In all 34 patients, the tubular portion of the aorta was diffusely thickened, and the sinus portion of the aorta was apparently uninvolved.

- **Morphologic features**: The process involved all three layers of the aorta, with thickening of the adventitia, mainly by fibrous tissue. Within the fibrous tissue were collections of plasma cells and lymphocytes, focal destruction of the media without thickening, and marked thickening of the intima by atherosclerotic-appearing lesions.

Serologic tests for syphilis were done in only 14 patients (41%) and were positive (reactive) in 6 (43%) of them. The ascending aorta, however, was similar in all 34 patients. In conclusion, cardiovascular syphilis has not disappeared. Its identification during surgery can prompt appropriate antibiotic therapy postoperatively. Although the serologic test results for syphilis might be negative, antibiotic therapy is recommended for patients with panaortitis requiring resection of the ascending aorta with or without aortic regurgitation.

### Full blown cardiovascular syphilis with aneurysm of the innominate artery [^111LZgAK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The investigators report the case of a 44-year-old man who presented acutely and was found to have a saccular aneurysm of the innominate artery, narrowed or totally occluded aortic arch arteries, and marked thickening of the thoracic aorta, except for the wall behind the sinuses of Valsalva. The abdominal aorta was entirely normal. Results of the serologic test for syphilis were strongly positive. Because cardiovascular syphilis appears to be a disease that affects the vasa vasora, and these channels are limited to the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta remains uninvolved, as demonstrated in the patient described in this case report. Most patients with cardiovascular syphilis are much older than the patient described, making it unusual to see a perfectly normal abdominal aorta, as observed in this case. In conclusion, although syphilis producing an aneurysm of the innominate artery is unusual, it is always associated with syphilitic involvement of the thoracic aorta.

### Imaging characteristics of Takayasu arteritis [^116bWZDG]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Takayasu arteritis is a rare, large-vessel vasculitis characterized by nonspecific systemic inflammatory symptoms, followed by inflammation of the aorta and its major branches. This vessel inflammation leads to progressive luminal stenosis or aneurysm formation, resulting in limb or organ ischemia. Although conventional angiography is still considered the gold standard modality, the information obtained is limited to the vessel lumen. Multidetector computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography can provide valuable insights not only regarding intraluminal pathologies but also the thickening of the vessel wall, which may be the earliest manifestation of the disease.

### Case of Behçet's disease complicated by oculomotor nerve palsy associated with internal carotid artery-posterior communicating artery aneurysm [^116xRyEL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease (BD) is a relapsing systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology involving systemic vasculitis. Vasculitis in BD results from the involvement of arteries, veins, and blood vessels of all sizes, leading to the three major manifestations of this condition: venous occlusion, arterial occlusion, and aneurysm formation. Therefore, whole-body vascular involvement should always be considered in BD patients.

Here, we describe the first appearance of an internal carotid-posterior communicating artery aneurysm, resulting in complete oculomotor nerve palsy in a BD patient. A 44-year-old Japanese man suffered from recurrent episodes of erythema nodosum that presented on the lower extremities for the past two years. His condition was diagnosed as an incomplete type of BD, based on relapsing oral and genital ulcers, skin eruptions such as erythema nodosum and folliculitis, a positive pathergy test, and systemic arthralgia.

Ten years after his initial clinical presentation, he exhibited manifestations of right-sided ptosis and cyclic dull pain in his right temporal region. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed a right internal carotid artery-posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Although oculomotor nerve palsy associated with an internal carotid artery-posterior communicating artery aneurysm in a BD patient has not been reported previously, our report highlights that this abnormal manifestation should be considered in those with vasculo-BD.

### Aortitis with aneurysm formation as a rare complication of Wegener's granulomatosis [^113rGB7u]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic vasculitis of medium-sized and small blood vessels. Aortic involvement in WG is very uncommon. We present a 43-year-old patient with an aortitis with aneurysm formation as a manifestation of WG. The patient was operated on and an aortoiliac Dacron inlay graft was inserted. Postoperatively, he recovered uneventfully. Abdominal pain occurring during a WG flare may result from vasculitis of large abdominal arteries with or without aneurysmatic changes, for which surgical treatment and immunosuppressive agents are indicated to prevent a possible rupture.

### Asymptomatic giant coronary aneurysm in an adolescent with Behcet's syndrome [^115vA33T]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The patient has given consent for the publication of her case report. A 16-year-old female from the Dominican Republic presented with a three-month history of malaise, fever, anorexia, and a ten-pound weight loss. She also reported painful oral and genital ulcerations, as well as tender erythematous nodules over her lower legs, suggestive of erythema nodosum. Her laboratory evaluation was significant for normocytic anemia and elevated acute phase reactants.

As part of her evaluation for fever, a chest CT and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including MR angiography and venography, revealed multiple arterial aneurysms of bilateral renal and splenic vessels. The largest splenic aneurysm measured 2.8 × 1.9 cm. There were also multiple intercostal and lumbar arterial aneurysms, with the largest measuring 2.9 × 2.5 cm at the level of the left psoas muscle. Additionally, extensive venous thrombosis was observed in the right jugular vein, innominate vein, and within the upper segment of the superior vena cava (SVC), although patency was noted below the level of the enlarged azygous vein with multiple prominent intercostal collaterals within the left hemithorax.

Intensive immunosuppression was initiated for the presumptive diagnosis of Behcet's syndrome, including daily oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) and three daily infusions of intravenous pulse Solu-Medrol (1,000 mg) followed by 60 mg of prednisone daily. The prednisone was tapered slowly over the next six months. Therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated with low molecular weight heparin.

### Syphilis and cardiovascular risk: a Taiwanese registry [^112bwNNj]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Studies on the impact of syphilis on the cardiovascular system in large populations are limited. This study investigated the effects of syphilis on cardiovascular outcomes using data from a Taiwanese registry.

- **Methods**: Medical records from 2010 to 2015 were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, linked to the Notifiable Infectious Diseases database from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Patients with syphilis were identified, excluding those with missing information, under 20 years of age, or with a history of human immunodeficiency virus infection, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, aortic regurgitation, replacement of the aortic valve, aneurysm and/or dissection of the aorta, atrial fibrillation, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and venous thromboembolism. Primary outcomes included new-onset acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, aortic regurgitation, aneurysm and dissection of the aorta, atrial fibrillation, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 28,796 patients with syphilis were identified from 2010 to 2015. After exclusions and frequency matching, 20,601 syphilis patients and 20,601 non-syphilis patients were analyzed. The relative rate (RR) was utilized in the analysis, as the competing risk of death was not considered. Compared with patients without syphilis, patients with syphilis had increased risks of acute myocardial infarction (RR 38%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–1.60, P < .001) and heart failure (RR 88%, 95% CI 1.64–2.14, P.

### Syphilitic aortitis: An uncommon cause of acquired aortopulmonary fistula [^116yg8Cj]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular syphilis has become a medical curiosity with the advent of widespread use of penicillin for the treatment of early syphilis. We report a case of a 37-year-old man who presented with sudden onset breathlessness that worsened insidiously for one year. Diagnosis of syphilitic aortopulmonary fistula was confirmed by aortography, contrast computed tomography, and histopathology. The patient underwent successful surgical correction. A high level of suspicion and awareness is needed for the diagnosis of this now rare disease. This entity is only amenable to surgical correction, even as existing surgical techniques need constant improvisation and individualization to each patient.

### Diagnostic approach in patients with suspected vasculitis [^1128e1Eo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Vasculitis can manifest as either a systemic or localized process, and depending on the specific disorder, it can affect large, medium, or small vessels. Vascular physicians, including interventional radiologists, may be involved early in these cases before a diagnosis is established, as patients often present with symptoms attributable to occlusive vascular syndromes.

This article discusses the presenting signs and symptoms of vasculitis, as well as the laboratory and imaging studies required to further evaluate these disorders. It also covers treatment options, which include both interventional and non-interventional approaches.

### Insights into imaging of aortitis [^112C2Th8]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Aortitis is a subtype of the more general term "vasculitis", an inflammatory condition of infectious or noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall. The term "vasculitis" refers to a broad spectrum of diseases with different etiologies, pathophysiologies, clinical presentations, and prognoses. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific, as are the laboratory findings such as pain, fever, weight loss, vascular insufficiency, elevated levels of acute phase reactants, and other systemic manifestations, which sometimes may mimic other entities. Thus, if not suspected as part of the initial differential diagnosis, aortitis can be overlooked during the workup of patients with constitutional symptoms and systemic disorders.

- **Methods**: Imaging is rarely used for the primary diagnosis, but imaging findings, although nonspecific, can help in the assessment of these patients and is often required for making the final diagnosis. Imaging can be critical in the initiation of appropriate management and therapy.

- **Results**: Noninvasive cross-sectional imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, nuclear medicine, and in particular positron emission tomography (PET) are the leading modalities in modern diagnostic imaging of aortitis for both the initial diagnosis and follow-up. This review focuses on the most common manifestations of aortitis with which radiologists should be familiar.

- **Teaching points**:
	- Aortitis is an inflammatory condition of infectious or noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall.
	- Imaging findings are crucial in the assessment and management of aortitis.

### Syphilitic aortitis with concomitant neurosyphilis in asymptomatic patient [^112Wp2Ju]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

For source identification and subsequent control, whole-body imaging is typically indicated. Although CT imaging is sufficient for most aortopathies, it cannot reliably differentiate between hematoma and aortitis because of tissue density matching. Accordingly, a magnetic resonance aortogram provided further delineation of the abnormality, which was more indicative of aortitis than a hematoma because a hematoma is usually irregularly shaped and primarily diagnosed by using density-based imaging such as CT. Although not used in this case, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT can be useful to evaluate differential causes of unexplained fever associated with vasculitis and ascertain treatment efficacy in cases of tertiary syphilis.

After ruling out more common autoimmune diseases, we chose treponemal-specific chemoluminescence immunoassay testing for suspicion of syphilitic aortitis. We selected this reverse sequence strategy because of institutional preference and high pretest probability, and a positive rapid plasma reagin titer of 1:4 confirmed active syphilis. Furthermore, diffuse syphilitic disease of the aorta necessitated CSF testing, showing negative VDRL and positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption. VDRL testing has poor sensitivity, and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption has poor specificity. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption might be influenced by trace red blood cell contamination from the CSF. Nonetheless, intravenous penicillin G was initiated because of patient preference and the risk of not treating our elderly patient.

We report a rare case of syphilitic aortitis with possible neurosyphilis in an asymptomatic 89-year-old man in Washington, DC, USA. This case highlights the need to consider emerging infectious causes of aortitis, even in patients without classic risk factors, by using multimodality imaging with confirmatory serologic and cerebrospinal fluid testing.

### Asymptomatic giant coronary aneurysm in an adolescent with Behcet's syndrome [^113q7b88]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Expanding on the initial description of Behcet's syndrome (BS) by a dermatologist who noted the triad of uveitis with oral and genital ulcerations in three patients, the International Study Group Classification criteria define BS as an idiopathic multi-system vasculitis, excluding other disease entities. Although originally described in patients along the "Silk Road", the syndrome occurs worldwide with a prevalence of 20–421 per 100,000 adults, though exact numbers are uncertain.

The typical age of onset is in the third decade of life; however, up to 20% of patients have onset before age 16. Our patient represents an atypical example of childhood-onset BS, with extensive venous thrombosis and arterial aneurysms, and progressive vascular disease despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, ultimately requiring endovascular coiling and coronary bypass surgery. Vascular involvement is reported in up to 28% of patients. Venous manifestations occur in 10–40%, including superficial thrombophlebitis as well as thrombosis of large veins such as the cerebral venous sinuses, vena cavae, and jugular venous systems, often with extensive, reactive collateralization. Arterial lesions are less common, occurring in up to 7% of patients, and manifest as aneurysm, thrombosis, or stenosis, with the most commonly affected arteries including the abdominal aorta, femoral arteries, and pulmonary arteries. Aneurysm is more frequent than arterial occlusion, although both may occur simultaneously.

### Infectious vasculopathy of intracranial large- and medium-sized vessels in neurological intensive care unit: a clinico-radiological study [^111SyDk8]. Neurocritical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Infections are a well-known cause of cerebral vasculopathy and vasculitis. We aimed to analyze the frequency of intracranial vasculopathy attributable to infection, the spectrum of causative microorganisms, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics, as well as clinical course and outcome.

- **Methods**: We used our institution's medical record system to identify all patients diagnosed with nonatherosclerotic central nervous system vasculopathy from January 1, 1999, through February 28, 2009. We reviewed their clinical charts, imaging data, and results of CSF studies.

- **Results**: Twenty-five adult patients with nonatherosclerotic cerebral vasculopathy of large- and medium-sized intracranial vessels were identified. Eight patients had vasculopathy attributable to infection (32%). The underlying pathologies were acute bacterial meningitis (n = 4), varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection (n = 2), borreliosis (n = 1), and syphilis (n = 1). In six patients, magnetic resonance angiography was performed and showed vasculopathic changes in all patients examined (100%). In both patients with VZV-associated vasculopathy, the arterial wall enhanced on magnetic resonance imaging. The CSF examination of the patients with infectious vasculopathy showed a significantly higher white blood cell count. The outcome of the infectious cohort was unfavorable with one death, two patients with locked-in syndrome, and five patients discharged from intensive care with severe neurological deficits.

Syphilitic aortitis is exceptionally rare. However, syphilis, caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, has reemerged as a global public health concern, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported over 200,000 cases in the United States in 2022. Approximately 10% of untreated persons will develop syphilitic aortitis after 10–30 years. Early recognition and treatment are imperative to avoid high mortality rates, although the broad differential of aortitis can complicate diagnosis. In this article, we describe a rare case of syphilitic aortitis in an asymptomatic, elderly patient, where the use of imaging, serology, and epidemiologic context helped guide diagnosis.

An 89-year-old man with a history of chronic lymphedema, deep vein thrombosis, and peripheral artery disease sought care at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, DC, USA, having experienced one week of right leg erythema and swelling. At admission, his laboratory results revealed leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. Computed tomography (CT) of the patient's right leg revealed soft tissue changes consistent with cellulitis that were unresponsive to antimicrobial drugs. Because of the concern for sepsis, we broadened the patient's antimicrobial regimen, and an infectious disease consultation prompted further evaluation for alternative sources.

Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest showed circumferential soft tissue enhancement of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and branching vessels, suggestive of aortitis versus intramural hematoma. Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography confirmed a diagnosis.

### HIV-associated aortitis causing rapid development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^115anBt8]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are rare manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and encompass a wide range of different pathologies, both infectious and noninfectious. We present the case of a 68-year-old female with HIV who was being treated with antiretrovirals and presented with a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aneurysm developed within one week. The patient underwent endovascular aneurysm repair, and her aneurysm completely resolved on follow-up computed tomography imaging 16 months later. We also present a review of HIV-associated vascular pathologies.

### Isolated celiac artery aneurysm with splenic artery stenosis as a rare presentation of polyarteritis nodosum: A case report and review of the literature [^111yKdfs]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Polyarteritis nodosum (PAN) is a vasculitic disease that affects small to medium arteries. It often presents as a systemic and multiorgan disease affecting the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and nervous system. Nonspecific signs and symptoms are hallmarks of PAN. Although it rarely affects single vessels, there have been case reports of PAN involving single intra-abdominal vessels.

The authors present a case of a 42-year-old white man who presented with mild epigastric pain but was otherwise asymptomatic. The workup ultimately revealed a rare case of an isolated celiac artery aneurysm with a concomitant stenosis of the splenic artery, secondary to PAN. The patient was treated with high-dose steroid therapy, leading to the resolution of the vasculitis and a decreased size of the aneurysm.

### Many different patterns under a common flag: Aortic pathology in HIV-a review of case reports in literature [^117EuH4k]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV has prolonged the life expectancy of patients but has also increased the incidence of non-AIDS comorbid conditions. Among these, cardiovascular diseases, and specifically aortic involvement, have been described in patients with HIV in the form of aortitis, aneurysms, or dissections. Our study aims to describe aortic pathology occurring in patients with HIV, focusing on clinical and surgical presentation, management, and outcomes through a review of cases published in the literature.

- **Methods**: The MEDLINE (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) database was reviewed using the terms "aortitis", "aortic aneurysm", and "aortic dissection" in combination with "HIV". Research was restricted to the English language, and only case reports were included. Data on patients' age, sex, traditional risk factors, timing from HIV diagnosis, pharmacological details, coinfection (syphilis, hepatitis C virus [HCV], and hepatitis B virus [HBV]), anatomical localization of lesions, presence of inflammatory involvement, rapid growth or rupture, and surgical treatment and outcomes were collected and summarized in tables.

- **Results**: Forty articles encompassing 51 cases were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 48.8 ± 8.3 years. Male sex was predominant (43 cases, 84.3%). Among traditional risk factors, hypertension and smoking were the most frequently reported (14 and 13 cases, respectively), followed by vasculopathy involving other arterial districts, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and drug addiction. In three cases, HIV was diagnosed concurrently with aortic pathology.

### Intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging features of infectious vasculitis [^114TbDj6]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is a complication of several infectious diseases affecting the central nervous system, which may result in ischemic and/or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, and aneurysm formation. The infectious agent may directly infect the endothelium, causing vasculitis, or indirectly affect the vessel wall through an immunological mechanism. The clinical manifestations of these complications usually overlap with those of non-infectious vascular diseases, making diagnosis challenging. Intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VWI) enables the evaluation of the vessel wall and the diseases that affect it, providing diagnostic data beyond luminal changes and enabling the identification of inflammatory changes in cerebral vasculitis. This technique demonstrates concentric vessel wall thickening and gadolinium enhancement, associated or not with adjacent brain parenchymal enhancement, in patients with vasculitis of any origin. It permits the detection of early alterations, even before a stenosis occurs. In this article, we review the intracranial vessel wall imaging features of infectious vasculitis of bacterial, viral, and fungal etiologies.

### Syphilitic aortitis with concomitant neurosyphilis in asymptomatic patient [^115bej3j]. Emerging infectious diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Because of our concern for an infectious etiology, we pursued serologic testing. Initial chemoluminescence immunoassay testing was reactive for syphilis, and subsequent rapid plasma reagin testing was positive with a 1:4 titer result. Despite no neurologic symptoms, we conducted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis that was negative by Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) testing but positive for fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption. Full CSF results revealed a slightly elevated red blood cell count, slightly low monocytes, and unremarkable leukocyte and protein counts. Findings were inconsistent across all samples.

Ultimately, we attributed the patient's underlying aortic pathology to syphilitic aortitis with concomitant neurosyphilis. The patient was treated with a 7-day course of intravenous penicillin G (3 million units every 4 h) and was prescribed the same treatment for an additional 7 days at discharge. The patient was discharged with reduced leg swelling, unremarkable vital signs, and resolved leukocytosis, but he was lost to follow-up.

This article describes the diagnosis of syphilitic aortitis with suspected neurosyphilis in an asymptomatic, elderly man with no classic symptoms or risk factors after using multimodality imaging and confirmatory testing. At 89 years of age, this patient is unusual and has a rare manifestation of syphilis, which is again rising in prevalence.

Our patient reported no cardiovascular symptoms, no prior syphilis diagnosis or treatment, no recollection of genital lesions, and no history of high-risk sexual behavior.

### Role of delayed Tc-99m HMPAO labeled leukocyte scintigraphy in the diagnosis of coronary mycotic aneurysm [^113M9SjN]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Coronary mycotic aneurysms are rare and often have a poor prognosis. Atherosclerosis frequently predisposes individuals to aneurysmal dilatation. In children, Kawasaki disease is a contributing factor, while in adults, trauma, vasculitis, syphilis, dissection, and post-coronary angioplasty are common causes of coronary mycotic aneurysms. Radiolabeled leukocytes have been utilized in diagnosing prosthetic valve endocarditis and vascular graft infections. An abnormal accumulation of radiolabeled leukocytes has also been reported in infrarenal aortic aneurysms. We present a case of a coronary mycotic aneurysm where delayed Tc-99m HMPAO labeled leukocyte imaging played a crucial role in facilitating the diagnosis.

### Operative recognition of syphilis of the aorta [^111H3aYD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Aortic syphilis has not disappeared. Few patients with aortic syphilis are diagnosed pre-operatively or after histologic examination of the resected aortas. The gross features of the wall of the syphilitic aortic aneurysm, however, are unique, allowing diagnosis of this entity on the operating table. Thirty patients, aged 33 to 84 years (mean 66), including 18 women, had a syphilitic aneurysm involving the tubular portion of the ascending aorta resected at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas from 2009 through 2017. The syphilitic cause of the aneurysm was not appreciated either preoperatively or during the operation.

Syphilis produces characteristic changes in the aorta: it is thicker than normal due to fibrous thickening of the intima and adventitia. The intimal surface is 100% abnormal, and the sinus portion of the aorta is uninvolved. The process begins at or just distal to the sinotubular junction. Histologic findings are specific. A negative serologic test for syphilis does not rule out the presence of syphilis of the aorta.

The key to identifying syphilis of the aorta during an operation is to note that its entire intimal surface is abnormal. One or more saccular aneurysms may arise from the fusiform aneurysm, the aneurysmal wall is thicker than normal, and the wall of the sinus portion of the aorta is spared. Identification of the syphilitic cause appears to be important because antibiotic therapy is recommended to prevent or retard the development of neurological syphilis, particularly in younger patients.

### Multiple aneurysms in childhood [^114aY3LM]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Arterial aneurysms in children are rare and often associated with connective tissue disorders or arteritides. Idiopathic aneurysms occurring at multiple sites throughout the arterial tree are particularly uncommon, with only ten cases reported in the literature. This report describes a case of multiple arterial aneurysms of uncertain origin, affecting the upper-extremity, extracranial cerebrovascular, aortoiliac, and renal arteries in a 14-year-old boy. The clinical presentation, vascular reconstruction, and pathologic findings are detailed, alongside a brief review of existing literature.

### Insights into imaging of aortitis [^113KjxEP]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Aortitis is a subtype of the more general term "vasculitis", an inflammatory condition of infectious or noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall. The term "vasculitis" refers to a broad spectrum of diseases with different aetiologies, pathophysiologies, clinical presentations, and prognoses. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific, as are the laboratory findings such as pain, fever, weight loss, vascular insufficiency, and elevated levels of acute phase reactants, as well as other systemic manifestations. Sometimes, these may mimic other entities. Thus, if not suspected as part of the initial differential diagnosis, aortitis can be overlooked during the workup of patients with constitutional symptoms and systemic disorders.

- **Methods**: Imaging is rarely used for the primary diagnosis, but imaging findings, although nonspecific, can help in the assessment of these patients and is often required for making the final diagnosis. Imaging can be critical in the initiation of appropriate management and therapy.

- **Results**: Noninvasive cross-sectional imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, nuclear medicine, and in particular positron emission tomography (PET) are the leading modalities in modern diagnostic imaging of aortitis for both the initial diagnosis and follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: This review focuses on the most common manifestations of aortitis with which radiologists should be familiar.

### Cross-sectional imaging of aortic infections [^115DKN3R]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Syphilitic aortitis is a condition associated with syphilis, a chronic infection caused by the sexually transmitted spirochete Treponema pallidum. Tertiary syphilis, occurring typically 15 to 30 years after the initial infection, is characterized by cardiovascular involvement, gummas, and neurological issues. The cardiovascular symptoms arise from endarteritis of the vasa vasorum, manifesting as aortitis, aortic aneurysm, aortic regurgitation, or coronary artery stenosis. The ascending thoracic aorta is most commonly affected, followed by the aortic arch.

On CT/MR imaging, the disease typically appears as diffuse aortic mural thickening, often with aneurysm formation, which can be multiple and saccular. Syphilitic thoracic aortic aneurysms may grow significantly, sometimes eroding the sternum or clavicle. The aortic wall may show a "double-ring" appearance on CT, with hyperdense outer and hypodense inner layers. Chronic aortic inflammation leads to intimal fibrosis and calcification, potentially creating a tree-bark appearance visible on chest radiographs. Aneurysm rupture, severe aortic insufficiency, and coronary artery ostial narrowing are common causes of death in syphilitic cardiovascular disease. There is evidence suggesting that 18F-FDG PET/CT can detect aortic involvement early, potentially preventing life-threatening sequelae of syphilitic aortitis.

### Staged surgical repair for extensive cardiovascular damage by syphilis [^112Whrau]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old man presented with aortic regurgitation, a syphilitic true aneurysm of the ascending to transverse arch aorta, and a descending aortic aneurysm resulting from chronic Stanford type B aortic dissection. Following antibiotic therapy, a two-staged surgical repair was performed. There has been no evidence of recurrence in the 12 months since the completion of the second stage. We describe the successful management of extensive cardiovascular syphilitic damage.

### Recurrent tamponade and aortic dissection in syphilis [^115feu6J]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Syphilitic cardiovascular disease has been described since the 19th century, mainly in autopsy series. Major clinical manifestations are aortic aneurysm, aortic insufficiency, and coronary ostial stenosis. The diagnosis of syphilitic cardiovascular disease is based mainly on positive serologic tests and overt clinical manifestations. We present here a rare and unusual clinical presentation of tertiary syphilis with recurrent tamponade and type B aortic dissection, whose positive diagnosis was made by polymerase chain reaction on pericardial fluid analysis.

### Combined cardiovascular syphilis and type A acute aortic dissection [^1145RH1y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

The occurrence of acute aortic dissection with the initiating tear in the ascending aorta superimposed on cardiovascular syphilis is an exceedingly rare occurrence. Such was the case, however, in a recently seen patient who presented with typical features of acute dissection (type A). Operative repair yielded the entire ascending aorta for examination both grossly and histologically, and classic features of both conditions were observed.

### Left ventricular giant aneurysm caused by congenital syphilis causing severe outflow tract obstruction [^115zgXzN]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

We present the exceedingly rare case of an 18-year-old boy with syncope attacks and dyspnea at rest for three weeks. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a giant aneurysm dilatation occupying the left ventricular outflow tract. The intraoperative finding was a giant thick-walled unruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva from the right coronary cusp. The roof of the aneurysm was excised and the defect was repaired, sparing the aortic valve. Histopathology analysis from the roof of the wall of the aneurysm revealed features of endarteritis obliterans of the vasa vasorum in keeping with syphilitic infection with aneurysmal dilation. A rapid plasma reagin test was reactive.

### Pulmonary medium vessel vasculitis in an 11 year old boy: Hughes Stovin syndrome as a variant of polyarteritis nodosa [^11466AWK]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We present a case of hemoptysis and pulmonary hypertension in an 11-year-old boy. The symptoms of the patient appeared to be the result of an inflammatory destructive process solely affecting the medium-sized pulmonary and bronchial vessels. However, the involvement of both pulmonary and systemic vessels makes the classification of the disease difficult.

The vasculitis of medium-sized vessels described in this report might be classified as polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) because the patient met the full diagnostic criteria of childhood PAN, which include angiographic or histologic abnormalities combined with myalgia and symptoms suggesting involvement of a major organ system.

PAN is a vasculitis typically involving medium-sized vessels, and the disease is rare in childhood with an incidence of less than 1 in 1 million. PAN most commonly involves the skin, joints, peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney, and disease manifestations are diverse. Pulmonary involvement is rare but was described to occur in approximately 11% of juvenile systemic PAN cases. In the same study, 8 out of 56 (14%) juvenile PAN patients had aneurysms in central nervous system arteries. Pulmonary involvement in PAN includes arteritis of bronchial arteries, but diffuse alveolar damage and interstitial fibrosis have also been detected in autopsy cases. The risk of venous thrombosis in PAN is higher compared to the general population, which may be attributable to the systemic inflammation. In the presented case, all prothrombotic factors examined (lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipins) were negative.

### Pulmonary medium vessel vasculitis in an 11 year old boy: Hughes Stovin syndrome as a variant of polyarteritis nodosa [^115ZGP9v]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

According to the EULAR/PRINTO/PReS consensus criteria, vasculitis of childhood is classified as small, medium-sized, or large vessel vasculitis, or 'other'. In childhood, pulmonary involvement is most frequently observed in vasculitis which preferentially affects small vessels, such as Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Pulmonary involvement is seldom observed in large and medium vessel vasculitis, such as Takayasu arteritis, Kawasaki disease, and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). An exception is Behçet's disease (BD), in which the formation of pulmonary artery aneurysms occurs in 1–8% of adult BD patients. Similar rates have been found in pediatric case series.

In this report, we describe an eleven-year-old boy suffering from pulmonary medium-sized vessel vasculitis, combined with dural venous sinus thrombosis. We highlight the difficulty in establishing a definite diagnosis in the context of diagnostic criteria and discuss Hughes-Stovin syndrome (HSS) as a potential diagnosis. HSS is characterized by the combination of multiple bilateral pulmonary artery aneurysms and venous thrombosis, and has been suggested to be an incomplete variant of BD. We will review pediatric cases of HSS from the literature and discuss the possibility that it is rather a variant of PAN with specific pulmonary involvement, based on its clinical manifestations in relation to diagnostic guidelines and its therapeutic response.

### Insights into imaging of aortitis [^115bwP6H]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

To prevent the known complications of TA, such as stenosis, aneurysm formation, or occlusion, early treatment with corticosteroids is indicated to suppress the inflammatory response. The usual regimen includes high-dose oral steroids (40–60 mg daily), usually for as long as one to two years. Unfortunately, up to 50% of patients relapse during tapering and require additional immunosuppression. Serum markers have limited value in follow-up since disease progression has been shown in the presence of normal serum marker levels.

Revascularization in cases of aortic stenosis or aneurysm is performed when there is secondary vascular organ insufficiency or risk of rupture. Usually, the intervention is done in chronic cases after the acute phase inflammation has subsided. Currently, there are no randomized trials of percutaneous or surgical intervention.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is an elastic vessel systemic granulomatous vasculitis affecting the aorta as well as its secondary and tertiary branches, which include large and medium-sized vessels, and usually involves superficial cranial arteries. Aortic involvement occurs in 15% of GCA patients. As opposed to the predominantly young patients affected by TA, GCA is usually seen in patients over 50 years old, with an incidence peaking in the 8th decade of life. Female predilection is less frequent, with a 3:2 female-to-male ratio. A higher than usual incidence of the disease is seen in Northern Europe, particularly Scandinavia, with lesser frequency in Southern Europe, indicating a genetic predisposition.

### Cutaneous lesions of secondary syphilis are highly angiogenic [^113vg8AR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The role of angiogenesis in infectious processes is poorly studied. Some viruses have been linked to angiogenesis, but the role of bacteria and protozoa in inducing angiogenesis in chronic infections is poorly understood.

- **Objectives**: We examined the role of angiogenesis in syphilis, a common and often difficult-to-treat infectious disease, especially in the setting of HIV/AIDS.

- **Method**: Microvessel counts were performed on 27 paraffin-fixed sections of secondary syphilis by staining with monoclonal antibodies against CD31. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to determine whether increased angiogenesis may be mediated, in part, through increased production of VEGF.

- **Results**: The CD31 mean microvessel count in secondary syphilis sections was significantly higher than in normal control sections. VEGF intensity appeared increased in the patients with secondary syphilis.

- **Conclusions**: Infection with Treponema pallidum results in increased angiogenesis in secondary syphilis. The mechanism for increased angiogenesis may involve elaboration of angiogenic cytokines, such as VEGF and epidermal growth factor.

### Insights into imaging of aortitis [^113TW7NH]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Vasculitis refers to a varied group of rare disorders characterized by underlying inflammation of the vasculature. This inflammation can affect blood vessels of any size, including arteries and veins, in any location within the body. It may be focal, affecting a single anatomical level within a vessel, or widespread, with areas of inflammation scattered throughout the entire vascular bed of a particular organ, or even affecting more than one organ system. Noninfectious inflammation is more common than infectious inflammation. In the thorax, noninfectious inflammatory vasculitis can impact large vessels such as the aorta and the pulmonary arteries, with diseases such as Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis (GCA), or Behçet's disease. Medium and small vessels may be involved in the context of collagen vascular disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, relapsing polychondritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Infectious involvement by tuberculosis, syphilis, or Salmonella is possible but less common, unless there is pre-existing aortic wall damage.

- **Table 1: Classification of aortitis**.

Although imaging is seldom used for the primary diagnosis of thoracic large vessel vasculitis, it plays an important role in differentiating between infectious and noninfectious vasculitis. Imaging is also crucial for monitoring disease activity or guiding biopsy. Additionally, imaging serves to exclude alternative diagnoses for the clinical presentation of patients.

### Syphilitic bi-valvular endocarditis and myocarditis: Modern tools applied to long-forgotten complications of a re-emerging disease [^111xNEH4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The incidence of syphilis has increased steadily over the past 25 years. Undiagnosed cases have presumably increased in the same proportions, and rare complications are at particularly high risk of being unrecognized. A previously healthy 60-year-old man presented with rapidly progressive heart failure and severe aortic and mitral valve insufficiency, with direct valvular destruction and preservation of the aortic valve annulus and aortic root. Treponemal serology was reactive, with a rapid plasma reagin titre of 1:128.

The patient also had classic manifestations of tertiary syphilis: a fusiform aneurysm of the aorta and meningovascular syphilis. He underwent bi-valvular and ascending aorta replacement, and the presence of Treponema pallidum was confirmed by specific immunohistochemistry and PCR in all tissues, including aortic and mitral valves, myocardium, and aorta.

This case links T. pallidum to infectious endocarditis with severe damage to both aortic and mitral valves, in addition to confirmed syphilitic myocarditis, a long-forgotten complication. It occurred 4 years after probable infection, long before what would be expected according to the understanding of its natural history. Syphilis serology should be considered in patients with culture-negative endocarditis as well as in those with heart failure or arrhythmias of unclear cause, especially in the presence of risk factors for syphilis. Syphilitic endocarditis and myocarditis are potentially lethal but treatable conditions.

### Analysis of coronary arterial aneurysm regression in patients with Kawasaki disease by aneurysm severity: Factors associated with regression [^116D8dBh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute medium vessel vasculitis of unknown cause and is the most common acquired cardiovascular disease in children in developed countries. The development of a coronary arterial aneurysm (CAA) is the most important sequela affecting the prognosis in KD, with a reported incidence of 20% to 25% before immunoglobulin use. After the preventive action of high‐dose immunoglobulin against CAA was reported, many adjunctive therapies, including prednisolone, methylprednisolone, infliximab, and cyclosporine, have been used in the treatment of KD. Patients with CAAs, especially giant ones, are exposed to the risk of coronary arterial stenosis, obstruction, and thrombosis, which may result in angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. To prevent such cardiac events, patients with CAAs are usually managed with oral antiplatelet agents and/or warfarin. On the other hand, CAAs often show regression to normal internal diameters. The incidence of regression was reported to be 55% to 65% before immunoglobulin use, and a recent report shows that 75% of CAAs regressed within two years of disease onset.

The pathological process of CAA formation and regression is thought to include the following mechanisms. Acute necrotizing arteritis in the acute phase of KD destroys the normal structure of the coronary arteries, making them vulnerable. The weakened coronary arteries dilate as a result of the internal pressure of the blood vessels, resulting in the formation of CAAs. Luminal myofibroblastic proliferation (LMP) involving smooth muscle cell–derived myofibroblasts further elucidates this process.

### Rare presentation of a syphilitic aneurysm of the infrarenal aorta with contained rupture [^117JncbJ]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

We report, to our knowledge, the first case of a rare syphilitic infrarenal aortouniiliac aneurysm with contained rupture that presented with midepigastric abdominal pain. Review of the patient's medical history revealed untreated syphilis and poorly treated congestive heart failure. Given his comorbidities, the patient was treated with an emergent endovascular aneurysm repair. His 30-day postoperative recovery period was uneventful, and follow-up imaging revealed complete resolution of the aneurysms. Syphilitic infrarenal aortic aneurysm is currently considered a rare entity in this era of antibiotics. The present article provides a brief case report and short review of literature pertaining to syphilitic aortic aneurysms.

### Behcet's disease with recurrent thoracic aortic aneurysm combined with femoral artery aneurysm: A case report and literature review [^116A2TM8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Behcet's disease (BD) is a vasculitis of unknown origin. BD is rare in Western countries and in the southern hemisphere. It is mainly seen in countries along the Silk Road, such as the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. It is also distributed in Central and East Asian countries, including Korea, Japan, and China. This disease was first described in 1937 by a Turkish dermatologist, Behcet H. BD is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that involves the mucous membranes, skin, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, joints, vessels, and neurologic system. The involvement of the vascular system in BD is called vasculo-Behcet's disease. The incidence of vascular involvement in patients with Behcet's disease is 7 to 38%. Vascular involvement can include both arteries and veins, with lesions ranging from arterial occlusions and aneurysms to superficial thrombophlebitis. The majority of patient deaths due to vasculo-Behcet's disease are related to the rupture of aneurysms.

We report a vasculo-Behcet's disease patient with a recurrent thoracic aortic aneurysm combined with a femoral artery aneurysm. The patient underwent endovascular surgery; however, the patient eventually died due to the rupture of a recurrent aneurysm.

In other studies, patients with HIV and extracranial carotid aneurysms (but without stroke) had evidence of leucocytoclastic vasculitis of the vasa vasorum and periadventitial vessels without evidence of atherosclerosis or infection on culture of the blood or aneurysm wall. Whether this form of vasculitis is an initiating or pivotal event in the development of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm formation in HIV infection or is one of several factors is not clear. Fusiform intracranial cerebral aneurysms have been described in children, usually as incidental findings, but in some, they are associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage or hemiparesis.

The term vasculitis should ideally be reserved for the histologically confirmed appearance of inflammatory cells in the blood vessel wall together with associated wall damage. In early pathological studies that did not exclude all potential causes of infective vasculitis other than HIV, cerebral vasculitis attributed to HIV was probably overestimated. However, a heterogeneous array of extracerebral vasculitis of small, medium, and large arteries has been described in patients with HIV. Although HIV antigen and particles were identified in perivascular cells in two patients, and HIV-like particles that were suggestive of a direct HIV infection (at least of perivascular tissue) have been reported in another, a direct role of HIV in the development of vasculitis is far from certain. Other postulated mechanisms for vasculitis include immune deposition and indirect damage caused by T-cell-derived growth factors and cytokines.

### Bashh UK guidelines for the management of syphilis 2024 [^114bChmN]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for syphilis, particularly with respect to antibiotic therapy in cases of neurosyphilis, ocular, and auricular syphilis in HIV-negative patients, the BASHH 2024 guidelines recommend the following alternative therapies for patients with neurosyphilis, including neurological involvement in early syphilis:

- **Ceftriaxone**: 2 g IM or IV for 10–14 days.
- **Doxycycline**: 200 mg PO BID for 28 days (2D).
- **Amoxycillin plus probenecid**: 2 g PO TID plus probenecid 500 mg PO QID for 28 days (2D).

### Total arch replacement following a failed repair for Takayasu's ascending aortitis [^113ANcgc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The constellation of Takayasu's disease most commonly includes aortitis with resultant coarctations and aneurysm formation. Surgical repair of these lesions can be compromised by the chronic inflammation of Takayasu's arteritis. We present a case of a 22-year-old female with Takayasu's disease who had undergone an ascending and aortic hemiarch replacement and subsequently developed anastomotic dehiscence and re-expansion of the previous aneurysmal sac. Complete aneurysm resection and replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch was performed during repeated surgery.

### Large vessel giant cell arteritis [^112hS23Q]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is the principal form of systemic vasculitis affecting people over 50. Large-vessel involvement, termed large vessel giant cell arteritis, mainly affects the aorta and its branches, often occurring alongside cranial giant cell arteritis. However, large vessel giant cell arteritis without cranial giant cell arteritis can also occur. Patients mostly present with constitutional symptoms, with localizing large vessel giant cell arteritis symptoms present in a minority of patients only.

Large vessel giant cell arteritis is usually overlooked until clinicians seek to exclude it with imaging, using ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET-CT. Although the role of imaging in treatment monitoring remains uncertain, imaging by MRA or CTA is crucial for identifying aortic aneurysm formation during patient follow-up.

In this series paper, we define the large vessel subset of giant cell arteritis and summarize its clinical challenges. Furthermore, we identify areas for future research regarding the management of large vessel giant cell arteritis.

### Imaging aortic wall inflammation [^116kJrnn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In contrast, inflammation in aortic aneurysms primarily affects the media and adventitia. The chief immune mediator in aortic aneurysm formation appears to be CD4+ T-lymphocytes through the production of interferon-γ. Whereas Th1 cells contribute to atherosclerosis, Th2 cells are strongly implicated in aneurysmal disease. These produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which stimulate natural killer cells to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and cause medial smooth muscle atrophy. Th17 are common to both atherosclerotic and aneurysmal disease. They promote macrophage activation by releasing tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-1. These cytokines have downstream effects that promote MMP-9 expression and smooth muscle loss.

Similar to aortic aneurysm formation, Takayasu aortitis is an adaptive immune response with infiltration, including Th1 and Th17 cell subtypes. The initial trigger is unknown, although mycobacterial-related heat shock protein is speculated. Unlike aortic aneurysm formation, inflammatory lesions in Takayasu aortitis are largely formed in the adventitia via the vasa-vasorum. Medial inflammation driven by macrophages expressing vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor contributes to neovascularization and smooth muscle proliferation and migration to the intima — the primary cause of severe intimal thickening.

- **Vascular calcification**: Vascular calcification is a healing response to inflammation and tissue degradation. Detection of the early stages of microcalcification therefore acts as a surrogate of inflamed damaged aortas.

### Inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling suppresses pathogenic immune responses in medium and large vessel vasculitis [^111eqYHP]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic cells attract CD4+ T cells and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent vessel wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling inhibitor tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting JAK3 and JAK1.

- **Methods**: Vascular inflammation was induced in human arteries engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell arteritis. Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or vehicle. Vasculitic arteries were examined for gene expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and infiltrating cell populations (flow cytometry).

- **Results**: Tofacitinib effectively suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the vessel wall. Lesional T cells responded to tofacitinib with reduced proliferation rates (< 10%) and minimal production of the effector molecules interferon-γ, interleukin-17, and interleukin-21.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for syphilis, specifically concerning CSF analysis, the BASHH 2024 guidelines recommend performing a CSF examination if there is clinical evidence of neurological involvement. Exceptions include cases of ophthalmic or otological syphilis where it is rarely useful, regardless of the disease stage.

### Etiology, diagnosis and management of aortitis [^1173ovj9]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Aortitis includes conditions with infectious or non-infectious etiology, characterized by inflammatory changes in one or more layers of the aortic wall. Age at onset, geographic predilections, and the distribution and pattern of involvement in the aorta, its branches, and pulmonary arteries, along with systemic associations, provide clues to etiology. Clinical presentations are often non-specific. An integrated approach including clinical, laboratory, and imaging assessment is essential to confirm diagnosis and plan treatment.

- **Assessment of disease activity**: This is key as it influences the timing and outcome of treatment. Markers of activity include clinical, laboratory, and imaging assessments.

- **Medical management**: This remains the first-line therapy. Revascularization is indicated in the presence of hemodynamically significant stenosis and inactive disease. In cases of flash pulmonary edema, left ventricular dysfunction, or hypertensive encephalopathy, revascularization is performed irrespective of disease activity.

- **Endovascular management vs. surgery**: Endovascular management is favored over surgery due to its high success and low restenosis rates. Symptomatic aneurysmal disease is usually managed by surgery.

### Computed tomographic findings of syphilitic aortitis [^116qZu7w]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

We describe the computerized tomographic (CT) findings of the aortic wall in a case of acute-phase syphilitic arteritis. The delayed phase of the contrast-enhanced CT shows a double-ring configuration of the thick thoracic aortic wall, which is similar to CT findings previously reported for Takayasu arteritis. We speculate that the resemblance of the CT findings for these two diseases accounts for their similar histopathological features.

### Inflammatory aneurysm of ascending aorta and left anterior descending artery [^112KjCyB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Inflammatory aortic aneurysms comprise a minor subset of aortic aneurysms. Connery et al. described the first inflammatory aneurysm of the ascending aorta in 1994. Since then, only twelve other case studies have been reported, most of which consisted of individuals over the age of 54 or with related inflammatory diseases. Other studies have described incidental findings of aortitis upon retrospective pathology reviews of aortic surgical specimens; however, the severity of inflammation in this case is incomparable. Also, most cases consisted of elderly individuals with related comorbid diseases, including giant cell arteritis and other rheumatologic diseases. A severely inflamed ascending aortic aneurysm, with the inflammation extending into the LAD in a young female with no related comorbid diseases, is a medical phenomenon that has not been previously documented to our knowledge.

The cause of inflammatory aortic aneurysms is still unclear. Inflammatory diseases of the aorta are thought to be either infectious or non-infectious. Because of the negative bacterial, fungal, and treponemal stains, the infectious forms are ruled out in our patient. The role of a viral infection involving SARS-CoV-2 was postulated but also found to be noncontributory. The differential diagnosis for a non-infectious aortitis could be due to an autoimmune response against atherosclerosis. Being that this inflammatory process occurred in the occluded LAD as well, it could be postulated that our patient had an autoimmune reaction to the atherosclerotic plaques. Further studies are needed to explore this hypothesis.

### Computed tomography angiography in the diagnosis of ANCA-associated small- and medium-vessel vasculitis [^111x97bc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that typically occurs without detectable antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. It leads to aneurysm formation by affecting muscular arteries, usually those of medium size but occasionally those of small size. Kidney involvement is common, leading to reduced glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, rupture of renal arterial aneurysms causing perinephric hematomas, and renal infarctions in those with severe vasculitis.

Similar to PAN, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) leads to aneurysm formation; however, MPA is usually associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and glomerulonephritis is a more common feature of MPA. Although kidney biopsy may show classic vascular changes in both PAN and MPA, this procedure is not without risk of significant bleeding due to aneurysm rupture.

We present two cases of renal aneurysms that were diagnosed as MPA using computed tomography angiography (CTA), allowing implementation of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy. Follow-up CTA after treatment showed resolution of all previously observed abnormalities. CTA is a useful alternative to kidney biopsy in establishing both the extent of disease in renal aneurysms and allowing for tracking of disease progression and response to therapy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, the BASHH 2024 guidelines specifically recommend laboratory follow-up with syphilis serology every 3 months for the first 6 months, then at 12 months. If indicated, such as in cases of HIV co-infection, serology should continue every 6 months or until serofast.

### HIV infection and stroke: current perspectives and future directions [^112X7iP2]. The Lancet Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

HIV-associated vasculopathy is a relatively new and evolving term used to describe several arterial changes associated with HIV infection (figure 1). Some investigators have distinguished aneurysmal arterial changes from vasculitis, while others have suggested that all arterial abnormalities thought to be associated with stroke should be regarded as part of HIV-associated vasculopathy, given the uncertainty regarding the pathogenesis of vasculitis. A working definition would be useful to both clinicians and pathologists.

Based on the scientific literature, we propose that the term HIV-associated vasculopathy should include any abnormality of the intracranial or extracranial cerebral blood vessels that results directly or indirectly from HIV infection. It should exclude vasculitis associated with opportunistic infection or neoplastic involvement of the vessels (panel 1). Aneurysmal dilatation in HIV-infected patients can be extracranial, involving the carotid, aorta, iliac, and other large arteries, or intracranial, involving branches of the circle of Willis.

In a series of patients with HIV and stroke (n = 64), seven patients exhibited extracranial non-aneurysmal vasculopathy that manifested as either stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery. Autopsy of one individual who died from stroke-related complications showed microscopic evidence of neovascularization and vessel wall inflammation with a thrombus occluding the lumen. Six patients had radiological evidence of intracranial vasculopathy.

### Imaging of intestinal vasculitis focusing on MR and CT enterography: a two-way street between radiologic findings and clinical data [^112y3qrU]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Medium-sized vessels, mainly splanchnic arteries and their branches, are predominantly involved in medium-vessel vasculitis. The onset of vasculitis in medium vessels is more acute and necrotizing than in large vessels. This group includes polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki disease. Gastrointestinal involvement is more common in polyarteritis nodosa, with up to 95% of patients presenting with abdominal pain. Radiologic findings include the discovery of microaneurysms, arterial stenosis/occlusion, signs of intestinal ischemia, bleeding or perforation, and rupture of hepatic, splenic, and/or renal (micro-) aneurysms; segmental hepatic or splenic infarction is rare. Conventional angiography is the most reliable imaging technique used to investigate splanchnic vascular abnormalities.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis affecting medium and small vessels, as seen in the kidneys without glomerulonephritis. PAN can occur in patients of any age, gender, or ethnicity; however, the peak incidence is in the 5th to 6th decade of life. It involves the kidneys, skin, musculoskeletal system, nerves, and GI system. The inflammation commonly affects all layers of vessels, resulting in stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. Consequently, tissue ischemia or hemorrhage may be observed in various organs, leading to acute life-threatening complications. Theoretically, histological confirmation of segmental fibrinoid necrosis of medium-sized vessels is required for diagnosis. Nevertheless, the diagnosis can also be established based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.

### Ocular syphilis with phlebitis and paravenous pigmentary retinopathy [^111JVU3m]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Ocular syphilis can present as a wide variety of clinical phenotypes, among them panuveitis with vasculitis. Primary retinal phlebitis with resulting paravenous atrophy and pigmentary retinal degeneration is a rare presentation.

- **Methods**: A 53-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of bilateral blurry vision. Physical examination demonstrated bilateral anterior chamber and vitreous cell with vitreous haze, hyperemic optic nerves, and atrophic-appearing retina. The left eye demonstrated a nasal area of perivenular vascular sheathing with adjacent retinal whitening. Ancillary testing demonstrated predominantly perivenular leakage involvement.

- **Results**: Uveitic workup was positive for syphilis and HIV. The patient was treated with antiretroviral therapy and intravenous penicillin G. He developed progressive paravenous pigmentary changes and atrophy.

- **Conclusions**: Syphilis can present with a wide variety of phenotypic manifestations and should also be considered in patients presenting with acute retinal phlebitis or paravenous atrophy in long-standing cases.

### Insights into imaging of aortitis [^115Jzzct]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious aortitis is a condition where the normally resistant aorta becomes susceptible to infection due to an abnormal aortic wall. Conditions such as atherosclerotic disease, preexisting aneurysm, cystic medial necrosis, diabetes, vascular malformation, and the presence of medical devices or history of surgery increase the risk of infection. The aetiologies are diverse; in the antibiotic era, the most frequent causative agents include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Pneumococcus, Escherichia coli, Treponema pallidum, and other Treponema species (10–25 years after the initial spirochetal infection), as well as Candida, Aspergillus, and Tuberculosis.

A case study involved a 67-year-old female several months post ascending aneurysm repair, presenting with low-grade fever and malaise. Axial non-contrast-enhanced and contrast-enhanced images of the chest demonstrated an ascending aortic graft with surrounding minimal aortic wall thickening. This area showed moderate 18-FDG uptake on the PET-CT image and blood cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus infection, raising concerns for infectious aortitis.

The disease typically spreads contiguously from adjacent thoracic structures, such as mediastinitis, abscess, infected lymph nodes, infectious pericarditis, empyema, and paravertebral abscess. However, septic emboli from underlying bacterial endocarditis or haematogenous dissemination of bacteria in the context of sepsis or intravenous drug use are also common.

The condition can affect the ascending thoracic aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta, including prosthetic aortic grafts.

Regarding medical management for syphilis, particularly concerning the use of corticosteroids, the BASHH 2024 guidelines recommend administering corticosteroids (40–60 mg prednisolone once daily for three days, starting 24 hours before the antibiotics) in the management of neurological (both early and tertiary) or cardiovascular syphilis. This is advised to prevent potentially serious consequences of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.

### Electrocardiographic total 12-lead QRS voltage in patients having operative resection of syphilitic aortic aneurysm [^116jSncS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic voltage has been used to determine the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy for about 70 years. Varying electrocardiographic criteria have been applied. We have found total 12-lead QRS voltage to be most useful in this regard. We measured total 12-lead QRS voltage in 24 patients in whom an ascending aortic aneurysm was resected, and a histologic study of its wall was classic of syphilitic aortitis. In these 24 patients, total 12-lead QRS voltage ranged from 57 to 161 mm, averaging 120 ± 32 in the 11 men and 106 ± 24 mm in the 13 women. If normal 12-lead QRS voltage in adults is considered to be over 175 mm, not a single one of the 24 patients had normal voltage. Indeed, most were in the low normal area. Thus, this study provides some evidence, via this indirect means, that the heart itself is infrequently involved by syphilitic aortitis, which produces an ascending aortic aneurysm of sufficient size to warrant resection.
