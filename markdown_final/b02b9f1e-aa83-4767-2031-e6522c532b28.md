## Question

Two athletes decided to compete to see who had the best jumping ability. They were each going to do the long jump, triple jump, and high jump to see who had the highest average jump. The first athlete jumped 26 feet in the long jump, 30 feet in the triple jump, and 7 feet in the high jump. The second athlete jumped 24 feet in the long jump, 34 feet in the triple jump, and 8 feet in the high jump. What was the average jump of the winner?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which athlete wins a jumping competition based on the average of long jump, triple jump, and high jump performances, and what the winner's average jump is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the competition rules and how the "average jump" should be calculated. Then, I should verify the performance data for each athlete. Next, I will compute the averages and compare them to determine the winner. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the winning average clearly with units.

> Let me first confirm the competition structure and scoring. The contest uses three events — long jump, triple jump, and high jump — and the winner is the athlete with the highest average across these three performances, which means I need to sum each athlete's three marks and divide by three to get a mean score for comparison [^notfound].

> I will now examine the raw data to ensure accuracy. Athlete 1 achieved 26 feet in the long jump, 30 feet in the triple jump, and 7 feet in the high jump, while Athlete 2 achieved 24 feet in the long jump, 34 feet in the triple jump, and 8 feet in the high jump. Wait, let me verify the units — yes, long jump and triple jump are in feet, and high jump is in feet, so the averages will be in feet and directly comparable [^notfound].

> Next, I should calculate Athlete 1's average. Summing 26 + 30 + 7 gives 63 feet, and dividing by 3 yields an average of 21.0 feet. Hold on, I should verify the division: 63 divided by 3 is indeed 21.0, so Athlete 1's average is 21.0 feet [^notfound].

> Now, I will calculate Athlete 2's average. Summing 24 + 34 + 8 gives 66 feet, and dividing by 3 yields 22.0 feet. Let me double-check: 66 divided by 3 is 22.0, so Athlete 2's average is 22.0 feet [^notfound].

> Comparing the two averages, 22.0 feet is greater than 21.0 feet, so Athlete 2 wins the competition. I should confirm there isn't a different interpretation of "average jump" that would change the outcome; given the straightforward mean calculation and identical event structures, the conclusion holds [^notfound].

> Final answer: The winner is Athlete 2 with an average jump of 22.0 feet [^notfound].

---

The winner is **Athlete 2** with an average jump of **22.0 feet**. Athlete 1's average is 21.0 feet, so Athlete 2 wins by 1.0 foot.

## Calculation of average jumps

### Athlete 1

- **Long jump**: 26 feet
- **Triple jump**: 30 feet
- **High jump**: 7 feet
- **Total**: 26 + 30 + 7 = 63 feet
- **Average**: 63 ÷ 3 = 21.0 feet

---

### Athlete 2

- **Long jump**: 24 feet
- **Triple jump**: 34 feet
- **High jump**: 8 feet
- **Total**: 24 + 34 + 8 = 66 feet
- **Average**: 66 ÷ 3 = 22.0 feet

---

## Comparison and determination of the winner

Athlete 1's average: **21.0 feet**\
Athlete 2's average: **22.0 feet**\
Difference: **1.0 foot**

Therefore, **Athlete 2** is the winner with an average jump of **22.0 feet**.

## Analysis of individual performances

| **Event** | **Athlete 1** | **Athlete 2** |
|-|-|-|
| Long jump | 26 feet | 24 feet |
| Triple jump | 30 feet | 34 feet |
| High jump | 7 feet | 8 feet |

- **Long jump**: Athlete 1 outperformed Athlete 2 by 2 feet.
- **Triple jump**: Athlete 2 outperformed Athlete 1 by 4 feet.
- **High jump**: Athlete 2 outperformed Athlete 1 by 1 foot.

Athlete 2's superior performance in the triple jump and high jump outweighed Athlete 1's advantage in the long jump, resulting in a higher overall average.

---

## Conclusion

Athlete 2 wins the competition with an **average jump of 22.0 feet**, surpassing Athlete 1's average by 1.0 foot.

### The force-velocity profile for jumping: what It is and what It is not [^863cc7fb]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

The vertical jumping ability of an athlete forms the basis for successful performance in numerous sports, such as volleyball and basketball. The theoretical maximum jump height that an athlete can reach is determined by the anatomical and physiological properties of that athlete's musculoskeletal system, whereas the actual jump height reached also depends on the stimulation of each of the muscles as a function of time. If an athlete's theoretical maximum jump height is to be increased, musculoskeletal properties need to be adapted by training, and the question becomes "Which factors are limiting jumping performance?" Samozino et al. set out to answer this question by developing what they called a "theoretical integrative approach" to identify "the overall mechanical characteristics of lower extremities determining maximal jumping ability".

Samozino et al. identified three characteristics of the lower extremities determining maximal jumping ability: Δ h PO, and; push-off distance Δ h PO is the distance over which the lower extremity extends, andandare derived using a method called force–velocity profiling, which is explained in Figure 1. From a given initial squatted posture, a subject performs several maximum-effort jumps without countermovement, each with a different external load. For every jump, the vertical displacement of the center of mass in the airborne phase is determined (Fig. 1 A) and used to calculate the gain in effective mechanical energy during the push-off. This gain in effective energy is determining jump height; it is the sum of the increase in potential energy and kinetic energy due to the vertical velocity of the center of mass during the push-off and equals the total change in potential energy from the start of the jump to the apex of the jump. The gain in effective energy is divided by Δ h PO to yield what Samozino et al. call the "average vertical force" (the outcome has the unit of force because J·m⁻¹ = N·m·m⁻¹ = N, but it is formally energy or muscle work averaged over distance). We will refer to this variable, expressed per kilogram of body mass, as.is then combined with, the average vertical velocity of the center of mass during the push-off (Fig. 1 B), to yield one point in the force–velocity profile (Fig. 1 C). A straight line is fitted to the points of the different jumps, and this line is extrapolated to find, the intercept with the-axis, and, the intercept with the-axis. According to Samozino et al.is the "theoretical maximal value ofthat lower extremities can produce during one extension at a theoretical null velocity", andis the "theoretical maximal value ofat which lower extremities can extend during one extension under the influence of muscles action in a theoretical unloaded condition".and, both depending on h PO, are claimed to be independent characteristics of the lower extremity; they are said to "characterize the mechanical limits of the entire neuromuscular function, encompassing individual muscle mechanical properties (e.g. intrinsic force–velocity and length–tension relationships, rate of force development), some morphological factors (e.g. cross-sectional area, fascicle length, pennation angle, tendon properties), and neural mechanisms (e.g. motor unit recruitment, firing frequency, motor unit synchronization, intermuscular coordination)".

### The force-velocity profile for jumping: what It is and what It is not [^8d830346]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

Having established that the force–velocity profile for a task like jumping does not represent the intrinsic force–velocity relationship of the lower extremity, the question may be raised whether this is problematic. One of the applications of the approach is in designing training programs based on the force–velocity imbalance, i.e. the difference between the actual and optimal force–velocity profiles of an individual. To improve their jump height, force-oriented athletes are recommended to participate in speed-oriented training, whereas velocity-oriented athletes are recommended to participate in strength-oriented training. Regardless of the debate as to whether this individualized training approach works better than traditional approaches (,–), the question may be raised whether the force–velocity profile itself is needed to classify athletes. Neither the effective work nor the average velocity are independently manipulated, and the use of average velocity on the horizontal axis seems arbitrary, as we have argued in this article. When it comes to improving jumping ability, it would be more straightforward to put on the horizontal axis the truly independently manipulated load and on the vertical axis the resulting jump height (Fig. 1 A) or the takeoff velocity (Fig. 1 B). An athlete who is relatively strong but does not jump high may be classified as force oriented, and an athlete who is relatively weak but jumps high may be classified as velocity oriented. From a training perspective, the important question is what underlies these "orientations". The intrinsic force–velocity relationship will surely play a role but is unlikely to be the only factor.

### Jump power and force have distinct associations with cortical bone parameters: findings from a population enriched by individuals with high bone mass [^fb335310]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

As experimental studies have shown that most bending moments on a bone arise from muscle forces, it follows that muscles capable of producing greater force should result in stronger bones. However, it is not clear how maximum force and power outputs that can be generated during an activity such as jumping relate to day-to-day muscle-induced bone strains. The strains that bones are habitually subjected to may depend upon other factors such as physical activity level in addition to intrinsic muscle properties. For example, studies in the myostatin-knockout mouse have shown that the effects of increased muscle size and strength on bone may depend upon physical activity, with differences between mutant mice and controls becoming apparent only after a period of exercise. However in the present study, adjusting for self-reported levels of physical activity did not alter our results. Other factors that may limit the effect of intrinsic muscle force/power on bone include tendon properties, which alter with age and may not be readily modifiable.

A few studies in humans have suggested that physical activity has similar associations with pQCT-measured bone geometry to those seen here for jumping mechanography parameters. For example, Sayers et al looked at the associations between different intensities of habitual physical activity (quantified by accelerometer) in adolescents with tibial pQCT outcomes. Vigorous physical activity equivalent to jogging was associated with increased cortical BMC, arising from both increased periosteal circumference and reduced EC PC. Vainionpää et al in a study of 120 women aged 35 to 40 years randomized to an exercise or control group also found that relatively high impact activity (equivalent to running/jumping) was associated with increased cortical thickness and bone circumference measured by QCT. Interestingly, studies comparing high-performance athletes with controls have additionally suggested that sports requiring very high muscle power outputs (eg, the triple jump) are associated with relatively larger differences in cortical area/thickness compared with those observed for total cross-sectional bone area. This would support a particular association between reduced endocortical expansion and muscle power, although it is not clear to what extent findings in elite athletes translate to our much older, more sedentary study population.

### Is the force-velocity profile for free jumping a sound basis for individualized jump training prescriptions? [^7509ceaa]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Formulating individualized optimized jump training prescriptions based on the force-velocity profile has become popular, but its effectiveness has been contested. Such training programs have opposite effects on "maximal average force" and "maximal average shortening velocity", and we set out to investigate which training-induced changes in the neuromuscular system could cause such effects.

Methods

We used a musculoskeletal simulation model with four body segments and six muscle-tendon actuators to simulate vertical squat jumps with different loads. Independent input was muscle stimulation over time, which was optimized for maximal jump height. We determined the force-velocity profile for a reference model and investigated how it changed when we modified muscle properties and initial postures.

Results

We could not reproduce the reported training effects by realistically improving muscle properties (maximal force, shortening velocity, and rate of force development) or modifying initial postures of the model. However, the profile was very sensitive to gains in jump height at low loads but not high loads, or vice versa. Reaching maximal height in force-velocity profile jumps requires skill. We argued that submaximal performance in low-load or high-load jumps caused by lack of skill could be responsible for large imbalances in profiles before training. Differential skill training promoted by the individualized optimized approach could explain quick changes toward a balanced profile.

Conclusions

If the success of individualized optimized training studies is explained by selective skill improvements, training effects are unlikely to transfer to other tasks, and individualized optimized training will not be superior to other types of training.

### The force-velocity profile for jumping: what It is and what It is not [^277bc57b]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We conclude from the findings in this study that the force–velocity profile for jumping does not represent the intrinsic force–velocity relationship of the lower extremities and does not have added value over plotting jump height or takeoff velocity as a function of the truly independently manipulated load.

### Sex differences in track and field elite youth [^d8ef7fee]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To understand athletic performance before and after puberty, this study determined 1) the age at which the sex difference increases among elite youth track and field athletes for running and jumping events, and 2) whether there is a sex difference in performance before ages associated with puberty among elite youth athletes.

Methods

Track and field records of elite US male and female youth (7–18 yr) across 3 yr (2019, 2021, and 2022) were collected from an online database (athletic.net). The top 50 performances were recorded for 100-, 200-, 400-, and 800-m track running, long jump, and high jump.

Results

Males ran faster than females at every age in the 100, 200, 400 and 800 m (P < 0.001). When combining all running events, the sex difference (%) was 4.0% ± 1.7% between 7 and 12 yr and increased to 6.3% ± 1.1% at 13 yr and 12.6% ± 1.8% at 18 yr (P < 0.001). Similarly, males jumped higher and farther than females at every age (P < 0.001). For long jump, the sex difference was 6.8% ± 2.8% between 7 and 12 yr, increasing to 8.5% ± 1.7% at 13 yr and 22.7% ± 1.4% at 18 yr (P < 0.001). For high jump, the sex difference was 5.3% ± 5.2% between 7 and 12 yr, increasing to 12.4% ± 2.9% at 15 yr and 18.4% ± 2.04% at 18 yr (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Before 12 yr of age in elite youth track and field athletes, there was a consistent and significant sex difference of ~5%, such that males ran faster and jumped higher and farther than females. The magnitude of the sex difference in performance increased markedly at 12–13 yr for running and long jump and 14 yr for high jump and thus was more pronounced after ages associated with puberty.

### The force-velocity profile for jumping: what It is and what It is not [^542bb5ae]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

In the present study, we revisited the "theoretical integrative approach" of force–velocity profiling for jumping. For this purpose, we used simulation models of various complexity. Our fundamental question was whether the force–velocity profile and its characteristics could be related to the intrinsic force–velocity relationship of the models.

### Prevalence of electrocardiographic markers associated with myocardial fibrosis in masters athletes: a cohort study [^533e04ad]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Participants

A total of 178 athletes were enrolled in the TaFMAC study. A 12-lead resting ECG was performed on 160 athletes (94 men, 66 women). Eighteen athletes did not undergo ECG testing due to scheduling conflicts. Among the remaining 160 athletes, five participants (four males one female) were excluded due to incomplete datasets. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the remaining 155 athletes.

Table 1
Characteristics of masters athletes stratified by sex and sports specialities. Values represent means ± SD

Athletes (n = 155), with a mean age of 61 ± 17 years, were categorised into three groups based on their athletic specialisation: sprint events (n = 69, 22 females), endurance events (n = 51, 25 females) and strength and power events (n = 35, 18 females). These classifications align with previous TaFMAC studies. Specifically, sprint events encompassed short-distance running (100 m, 200 m, 400 m) and short-distance hurdles. Endurance events comprised long-distance running and walking disciplines, including 5 km, 10 km, 20 km, marathon, steeplechase, 8 km cross-country running, walking events, 1500 m and 800 m. Strength and power events covered all throwing and jumping disciplines, such as shot put, hammer throw, weight throw, javelin, discus, throw pentathlon, long jump, high jump, triple jump and pole vault. Athletes participating in multiple specialisation groups were assigned to the group where they achieved their best age grade (data from).

Patient and public involvement statement

No direct involvement of patients or the public occurred in this research's design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans. Due to the study's technical focus and resource constraints, extensive patient or public engagement was not feasible. However, the absence of direct involvement does not diminish the study's potential implications for public health.

### Spatiotemporal characteristics of motor actions by blind long jump athletes [^bd93df6e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants

The sample consisted of 12 male athletes (mean ± SD height 1.79 ± 0.08 m, body mass 73.7 ± 6.4 kg and official distance of 5.82 ± 0.45 m) from 10 countries who participated in the F11 Long Jump Finals at the XIV Paralympic Games held in London.

Procedure

All the jumps made by the 12 athletes were video-recorded to analyse spatiotemporal and mechanical characteristics of the last three strides in the run-up and take-off phases of the jumps.

The following temporal variables were studied: contact time (t_C), flight time (t_FL), stride time (t_STR), calculated as t_STR = t_C + t_FL, and stride frequency (SF), calculated as SF = 1/t_STR. The spatial variables were official jump distance, stride length (SL) and body centre of mass (BCM) height (h = 1.226×t_FL²) during the aerial phase of each stride.

Spatiotemporal variables included horizontal BCM velocity (V_BCM), stride speed (V_STR = SF×SL) vertical speed (V_y = g×t_FL/2), speed at moment of take-off (V_r = √(V_BCM² + V_y²)) and take-off angle (a = tan⁻¹(V_y/V_BCM).

### Clinician-friendly lower extremity physical performance measures in athletes: a systematic review of measurement properties and correlation with injury, part 1. the tests for knee function including the hop tests [^5bfb67a8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the measurement properties of physical performance tests (PPTs) of the knee as each pertain to athletes, and to determine the relationship between PPTs and injury in athletes age 12 years to adult.

Methods

A search strategy was constructed by combining the terms 'lower extremity' and synonyms for 'performance test', and names of performance tests with variants of the term 'athlete'. In this, part 1, we report on findings in the knee. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to critique the methodological quality of each paper. A second measure was used to analyse the quality of the measurement properties of each test.

Results

In the final analysis, we found 29 articles pertinent to the knee detailing 19 PPTs, of which six were compiled in a best evidence synthesis. The six tests were: one leg hop for distance (single and triple hop), 6 m timed hop, crossover hop for distance, triple jump and single leg vertical jump. The one leg hop for distance is the most often studied PPT. There is conflicting evidence regarding the validity of the hop and moderate evidence that the hop test is responsive to changes during rehabilitation. No test has established reliability or measurement error as assessed by the minimal important change or smallest detectable change. No test predicts knee injury in athletes.

Conclusions

Despite numerous published articles addressing PPTs at the knee, there is predominantly limited and conflicting evidence regarding the reliability, agreement, construct validity, criterion validity and responsiveness of commonly used PPTs. There is a great opportunity for further study of these tests and the measurement properties of each in athletes.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^be711641]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Body composition and anthropometrics — adult males are on average larger and leaner than females, with performance-relevant differences: adult males (> 20 yr) are 8% taller and ~17%–18% heavier than adult females; female athletes typically have ~5%–10% more body fat and ~85% the lean body mass as male athletes, and differences in fatness and power-to-lean-mass ratio can account for up to 70% of sex differences in weight-bearing jumping tasks, where lower body fat confers considerable advantage to males.

### Computer simulation of the last support phase of the long jump [^d2ab39a2]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose was to examine the interacting roles played by the approach velocity, the explosive strength (represented by vertical ground reaction force [VGRF]), and the change in angular momentum about a transverse axis through the jumper's center of mass (deltaHzz) during the last support phase of the long jump, using a computer simulation technique.

Methods

A two-dimensional inverted-pendulum-plus-foot segment model was developed to simulate the last support phase. Using a reference jump derived from a jump performance reported in the literature, the effects of varying individual parameters were studied using sensitivity analyses. In each sensitivity analysis, the kinematic characteristics of the longest jumps with the deltaHzz considered and not considered when the parameter of interest was altered were noted. A sensitivity analysis examining the influence of altering both approach velocity and VGRF at the same time was also conducted.

Results and Conclusion

The major findings were that 1) the jump distance was more sensitive to changes in approach velocity (e.g., a 10% increase yielded a 10.0% increase in jump distance) than to changes in the VGRF (e.g., a 10% increase yielded a 7.2% increase in jump distance); 2) the relatively large change in jump distance when both the approach velocity and VGRF were altered (e.g., a 10% increase in both parameters yielded a 20.4% increase in jump distance), suggesting that these two parameters are not independent factors in determining the jump distance; and 3) the jump distance was overestimated if the deltaHzz was not considered in the analysis.

### Engineered jumpers overcome biological limits via work multiplication [^26780385]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

For centuries, scientists have explored the limits of biological jump height 1,2, and for decades, engineers have designed jumping machines 3–18 that often mimicked or took inspiration from biological jumpers. Despite these efforts, general analyses are missing that compare the energetics of biological and engineered jumpers across scale. Here we show how biological and engineered jumpers have key differences in their jump energetics. The jump height of a biological jumper is limited by the work its linear motor (muscle) can produce in a single stroke. By contrast, the jump height of an engineered device can be far greater because its ratcheted or rotary motor can 'multiply work' during repeated strokes or rotations. As a consequence of these differences in energy production, biological and engineered jumpers should have divergent designs for maximizing jump height. Following these insights, we created a device that can jump over 30metres high, to our knowledge far higher than previous engineered jumpers and over an order of magnitude higher than the best biological jumpers. Our work advances the understanding of jumping, shows a new level of performance, and underscores the importance of considering the differences between engineered and biological systems.

The funnel plot displaying the different sport disciplines show a zero risk of THA at age 75 years among female racewalkers (figure 4A). For males, a zero risk at 75 years was seen in sailing and alpine skiing. The proportion of male handball athletes receiving THA (20.1%) was five times higher than in the general population, and outside the 99% confidence limits for the average risk for male athletes at 75 years of age (figure 4B).

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^bbd4c412]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Primary physiological predictors of athletic performance in cisgender men and women explain that endurance performance such as distance running (distances > 3000 m) is predicted by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), the maximal running intensity (or percentage of VO2max) that can be sustained during long time periods and is related to the critical velocity, and running economy. Faster distance running speeds of men compared with women are primarily explained by a larger VO2max of males with minimal differences in the relative maximal sustainable running intensity or running economy. In contrast, sports such as weightlifting and jumping performance are determined primarily by lean body mass and muscular power with large sex differences in both.

### Understanding the first injury in athletics and its effect on dropout from sport: an online survey on 544 high-level youth and junior athletics (track and field) athletes [^ea0a76eb]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Results

Population

The total population of eligible participants were 8238 athletes. Among them, 1708 athletes (20.7%) were no longer licensed at the FFA for more than 3 years, meaning they did not continue practising athletics. As requested by the French law, their email addresses were deleted from the FFA system. Thus, the FFA sent 6530 emails to the eligible population on 30 April 2021. A total of 544 (8.3%) answers were received and analysed. The characteristics of the participating athletes are presented in table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of athletes participating in the present study and causes of athletics dropout

The first injury

Among the 544 athletes participating in this study, 509 (93.6%) reported experiencing at least one injury during their career. The first injury reported by these high-level athletes occurred at a mean age of 17.5 ± 3.3 years after 6.1 ± 4.1 years of athletics practice (table 2). Athletes reporting their first injury mainly practised jumps (20.8%), middle and long distances (20.4%) and sprints (19.8%). On average, athletes undertook 8.1 ± 3.7 hours of training per week. About a third (32.0%) also practised another sport besides athletics.

### The force-velocity profile for jumping: what It is and what It is not [^b75d911a]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Simulation results for single lower extremity extensions of model A1. A, Time history of vertical velocity during the push-off for an unloaded jump (v) and for an isokinetic contraction at the average speed. Note that we calculated the truefor the jump, which was 1.42 m·s⁻¹; approximatingby taking half the takeoff velocity in the jump would have yielded a value of only 1.15 m·s⁻¹ in this case. B, Vertical displacement during the push-off (Δ h PO) for corresponding lower extremity extensions. C, Velocity plotted as a function of Δ h PO. D. Vertical force (F) plotted as a function of Δ h PO. During an isokinetic contraction at the average velocity of the jump, more effective work is done (area below F) than during the jump (gray area). At isokinetic velocity v* (higher than, see C), the same amount of work is done as during the jump.

In sum, although the effective work is a true outcome variable of the jump, expressing it as a function of half the takeoff velocity is an arbitrary choice; half the takeoff velocity is not at all the speed that determines the effective work. This also means that the maximal "power" calculated from the force–velocity profile (Fig. 1 D) is only a relevant variable within the framework of the profile and is not a valid measure for the maximal power produced during jumping.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction — physical performance measures and predictive thresholds: In a systematic review of performance-based tests after ACL reconstruction, limb symmetry indexes for hop tests ranged from 76% to 90% 6 months after ACL reconstruction, 88% to 95% 12 months after ACL reconstruction, and 92% to 99% 24 months after ACL reconstruction; isokinetic knee extensor strength tests ranged from 65% to 86% 6 months after ACL reconstruction, 84% to 91% 12 months after ACL reconstruction, and 91% to 100% 24 months after ACL reconstruction; and isokinetic knee flexor strength tests ranged from 84% to 96% 6 months after ACL reconstruction, 87% to 99% 12 months after ACL reconstruction, and 88% to 100% 24 months after ACL reconstruction. After an ACL injury and nonoperative rehabilitation, a cutoff score greater than 88% on the single-leg hop for distance test can be used to identify with high probability that the patient will have normal knee function 1 year after ACL reconstruction; athletes demonstrating less than the 88% cutoff score on the 6-m test or single-leg timed hop test at 6 months may benefit from targeted training to improve limb symmetry. A systematic review of 29 articles reported poor to fair methodological quality for reliability, poor to good for hypothesis testing and construct validity, and primarily good for criterion validity, with methodological quality for responsiveness poor to good and no studies examining measurement error; preoperative single-leg hop tests are not able to predict postoperative outcomes. The triple hop for distance limb symmetry index was a significant predictor of the IKDC 2000 jump-related question (14h) and KOOS jump-related question (sport and recreation item 3) 2 years after ACL reconstruction.

### Development of a test battery to enhance safe return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [^1e7292e7]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most athletes who wish to continue in sports after an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are advised to undergo ACL reconstruction (ACLR). However, returning to a high activity level after ACLR is linked with high risk, with reported rates of 23% in young athletes, to sustain a second ACL injury, either on the ipsilateral or on contralateral side. In a systematic review based on 264 studies included, Barber-Westin and Noyes found that return to sports (RTS) decision was mostly based on subjective non-specific criteria and the majority of studies used time-based decision allowing RTS at 6 months. This clinical approach may need to be revised in light of the high incidence of second ACL injuries.

Recently, a test battery with functional tests for decision-making with regard to RTS following ACLR was published. The test battery included one- and two-legged postural stability tests and jump tasks. These tests are for the most part quantitative in character (e.g. jump height), whereas the quality of movements is not assessed. It has been suggested to incorporate movement analysis to detect asymmetrical movement patterns after ACLR prior to release of the athlete to the high demands of sports.

Hence, to support decision-making for RTS, a test battery was developed with physical measures that consisted of isokinetic strength, single hop test for distance (SLH), triple hop for distance (TLH), side hop (SH) and a jump-landing task assessed with the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS). Two patient questionnaires were added to the RTS test battery. As psychological responses can be attributed to whether patient succeeds or not to RTS, the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury scale (ACL-RSI) was added. The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) was also added as it has been regarded as an important measure of successful outcome after ACLR.

The purpose of this study was to present a test battery that includes both physical and patient-reported measures after ACLR. It was hypothesized that a test battery combining components of physical measures such as strength and single-leg hop tasks and jump-landing tasks in combination with patient-reported outcomes (IKDC and ACL-RSI) would identify deficits in patients following ACLR.

### Injuries in elite women's ski jumping: surveillance through the 2017–18 FIS world cup season [^35341f44]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Injury severity

Injury severity was based on time loss from training and competition due to injury. Severe injuries were defined as resulting in > 28 days away from full training, moderate between 8–28 days, mild 4–7 days and slight 1–3 days. No time loss (0 days) was also an option, classified as not severe.

Statistical analysis

Demographic information are presented as proportions and mean values with SD. All data were registered in an exposure file created with Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Excel 2016, Microsoft Corporation, Washington, USA). Injury incidences (i) was calculated using the formula i = n/e, where n is the number of injuries and e corresponds to the number of athletes we acquired in-season data from. Risk of injury is presented as absolute injury rates (number of injuries/100 athletes/season). Injury incidences are presented with 95% CIs and CI for one-sample means were based on t-distribution. A percentage of the CI regarding length of jumps resulting in injury was calculated using the average HS in the respective ski jump hills.

### Jump performance in male and female football players [^e2a1d8b5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

DVJ quantitative analysis

As previously reported, the worst assessed jump of the three trials, summarized from all criteria, was used in the quantitative analysis. The worst jump was chosen to represent the player's potentially highest risk movement pattern, which could be overlooked if calculating the average of the three attempts. As described previously, each jump was given one point on the following criteria: if the feet left the box at different times, if the feet landed at the different time, if the feet were not parallel on landing, if the feet were rotated on landing, if there was knee valgus on landing, if the feet were not approximately shoulder distance apart, and if there was any weight displacement. The jump which had the most points, was deemed the worst jump and used in the analysis. In accordance with the previous study, the valgus knee motion was measured using Dartfish ProSuite (Dartfish Ltd, Fribourg, Switzerland) and calculated in centimeters as the medial displacement of the knee in the frontal plane from initial contact to peak knee flexion/the end of the deceleration phase of the DVJ. Valgus knee motion was inputted as zero if the athlete's knee displacement was lateral from initial contact to peak knee flexion. A categorical variable (knee displacement) was also created based on the athlete's frontal plane knee motion, grouping players based on if their knee displaced medially (valgus), laterally (varus), or no displacement (neutral), from initial contact to peak knee flexion. A nomogram was used to predict the probability of high knee abduction moment (pKAM), ranging from 0 (lowest) to 100% (highest). The nomogram is based on the player's weight, tibia length, knee motion in the frontal plane, and knee flexion range of motion, and a surrogate value for hamstring–quadriceps ratio (multiplying the player's mass by 0.01 and adding the resultant value to 1.10).

### Is the classification of athletes based on force-velocity profiling from countermovement jumps influenced by the choice of method? [^c0b7ffb8]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Force-velocity (FV) profiling is a tool for classifying athletes as force- or velocity-deficient, allowing for tailored training prescriptions. However, profiling classification may vary depending on the measurement method used. This study compared FV profile variables derived from countermovement jumps (CMJs) using four approaches: the Flight-time method, a Kinetic method, and two Kinematic methods.

Methods

Sixteen National-level female handball players completed CMJs with 0, 20, 40, 50, and 70 kg of additional mass. All jumps were recorded by a force plate and 3D motion capture system. For each jump, jump height, height of push-off (HPO), average force, and average velocity were estimated, and FV profiles were derived using each of the four methods. The two kinematic methods represented displacement of the center of mass of 1) the body and 2) the whole system (i.e., body + additional mass). A pre-measured HPO (Flight-time method) overestimated the HPO derived from kinetic and kinematics methods at low values and underestimated it at high values.

Results

The Flight-time method underestimated average force by 7% compared to the kinetic method and overestimated it by 1–3% compared to the kinematic methods. Average velocity during push-off was lower when derived from the Flight-time method than all other methods, particularly at the highest velocities (~20%). The resultant FV profiles (slopes) differed systematically by 30–39% between methods, such that > 80% of participants were classified differently (i.e., force-deficient, velocity-deficient, or balanced) depending on the method applied.

Conclusions

We question the practical use of the FV profiles based on the Flight-time method, as it could result in the misclassification of athletes.

### Double-leg and single-leg jump test reference values for athletes with and without anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction who play popular pivoting sports, including soccer and basketball: a scoping review [^ddfd4147]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize and present reference values for double-leg and single-leg jump tests in healthy athletes who play pivoting sports, and athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) who play pivoting sports. DESIGN: Scoping review. LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science until April 7, 2023. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: We included reference values in 2 different categories: (1) double-leg and/or single-leg jump test outcomes in pivoting-sport athletes with ACLR at a specific time point during rehabilitation, and (2) double-leg and/or single-leg jump test outcomes in healthy pivoting-sport athletes. DATA SYNTHESIS: We performed data synthesis for reference values from double-leg jump tests (squat jump and countermovement jump) and single-leg jump tests (vertical hop, single hop for distance, triple hop for distance, crossover hop for distance, medial triple hop for distance, lateral triple hop for distance, 6-m timed hop, side hop, drop jump, and 10-second repeated hop) that were performed according to a standardized test description. We summarized the data for type of sport, sex, sport participation level, and age group. RESULTS: Of the 27 included studies, nine reported reference values from healthy soccer players, six from healthy basketball players, and eleven from other healthy pivoting-sport athletes. LSI dominant/nondominant (LSI-D/ND) ranged between 97% and 106% for healthy soccer players, and between 99% and 120% for healthy basketball players. Four studies reported reference values from pivoting-sport athletes with ACLR from 7 to 10 months postsurgery. CONCLUSION: This scoping review summarizes double-leg and single-leg jump test reference values for athletes who play common pivoting sports, including soccer and basketball. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(6):1–14. Epub 20 March 2024. doi:10.2519/jospt.2024.12374.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^5c187b78]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Intermittent sports — vertical and horizontal jump testing — are commonly applied for their simplicity and ecological validity, with vertical jump testing widely employed to provide easily obtainable information on overall lower body explosiveness. Commonly utilized tests include the squat jump, countermovement jump, and drop jump, which can be executed bilaterally or unilaterally, and beyond jump height, advanced methodologies such as calculating jump power, jump momentum, and the ratio between flight time and take-off time are also available.

### Does plyometric training improve vertical jump height? A meta-analytical review [^3932eba8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the precise effect of plyometric training (PT) on vertical jump height in healthy individuals. Meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effect of PT on four typical vertical jump height tests were carried out: squat jump (SJ); countermovement jump (CMJ); countermovement jump with the arm swing (CMJA); and drop jump (DJ). Studies were identified by computerised and manual searches of the literature. Data on changes in jump height for the plyometric and control groups were extracted and statistically pooled in a meta-analysis, separately for each type of jump. A total of 26 studies yielding 13 data points for SJ, 19 data points for CMJ, 14 data points for CMJA and 7 data points for DJ met the initial inclusion criteria. The pooled estimate of the effect of PT on vertical jump height was 4.7% (95% CI 1.8 to 7.6%), 8.7% (95% CI 7.0 to 10.4%), 7.5% (95% CI 4.2 to 10.8%) and 4.7% (95% CI 0.8 to 8.6%) for the SJ, CMJ, CMJA and DJ, respectively. When expressed in standardised units (ie, effect sizes), the effect of PT on vertical jump height was 0.44 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.72), 0.88 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.11), 0.74 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.02) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.18 to 1.05) for the SJ, CMJ, CMJA and DJ, respectively. PT provides a statistically significant and practically relevant improvement in vertical jump height with the mean effect ranging from 4.7% (SJ and DJ), over 7.5% (CMJA) to 8.7% (CMJ). These results justify the application of PT for the purpose of development of vertical jump performance in healthy individuals.

### Effect of ski geometry and standing height on kinetic energy: equipment designed to reduce risk of severe traumatic injuries in alpine downhill ski racing [^f5a69e36]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Second, anticipation and adaptation time within demanding course sections decrease with increasing E KIN /speed, which plausibly results in a higher risk for technical and tactical mistakes. Thus, a reduction in speed would give athletes more time to prepare for difficult course sections (eg, jumps, rough terrain transitions or turns) and make appropriate technical and/or tactical decisions. However, the observed reduction in speed in this study would only lead to marginal changes in preparation and adaption time. Given that an athlete skis with the average speed of Section STEEP (26.4 m/s) and oversees the upcoming course 20 m at a time, the observed equipment-induced reduction in speed would increase adaptation time by only 1/100–3/100 s. Hence, the preventative gain regarding this aspect is limited.

Third, increased E KIN /speed is known to increase jump distance and airtime and might result in severe consequences in case the skier makes mistakes at the take-off. Concerning this aspect, the current study findings indicate that only if a jump is located directly within or after a steep section skis modified in length, width and standing height would markedly reduce E KIN /speed. In these situations, a ∼3% reduction in E KIN /speed would reduce jump distance and air time by ∼0.5 m and ∼2/100 s, depending on the shape of the jump. Since many severe injuries are known to occur at jumps, this reduction — even though it is small — might serve as a certain preventative gain to protect the athlete's health.

Compared with the magnitude of the E KIN reduction, which might be achieved by course-related measures, the equipment-induced 3% reduction in E KIN in steep terrain and, therefore, the changes in preparation and adaption time to course features and the changes in jump distance and airtime seem to be rather small. However, by a smart combination with course-related and terrain-related measures, these small effects might become more relevant. Future studies should assess combined preventative measures including equipment and course setting modifications and investigate their effect on E KIN /speed. Knowing that only the most extreme equipment modification showed a preventative effect with respect to E KIN, and considering that the athletes reported a delayed reaction in general and reduced rebound in the second part of the turn for SKI WLH and SKI WH, ski ability and external attractiveness of the sport have to be considered. Benefits and costs must be balanced from an implementation point of view.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^a832a947]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Summary and conclusions — sex differences in athletic performance indicate that males outperform females in sports requiring aerobic endurance, muscle strength, power, and speed, with biological differences resulting in ~10%–30% sex difference in athletic performance. Endurance performance differences such as distance running (~10% among the world's best) are attributed to higher aerobic power of males, associated with larger heart size, greater stroke volume, blood hemoglobin concentration and mass, larger muscle mass, larger airways and lung volumes, less body fat, and consequently a higher VO2max than females. In events reliant primarily on muscular power (e.g., weightlifting and jumping), differences can be as high as 30% because males have more muscle mass and faster contracting muscles, with longer limbs and taller stature that together generate more limb power compared with females. The primary cause cited is exposure to high levels of endogenous testosterone in boys at the onset of puberty (~12 yr) that will rise 30-fold in males but remains low in females.

### Modifiable risk factors for lower-extremity injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis for the female, woman and girl athlete injury prevention (FAIR) consensus [^17fba296]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Examine potentially modifiable risk factors (MRFs) for female/woman/girl athletes' lower-extremity injuries.

Design

Systematic review with meta- or semiquantitative analyses and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, Cochrane Systematic Review Database, CENTRAL, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, ERIC searched 30 October or 23 November 2023.

Eligibility

Primary data studies with comparison group(s) assessing the association of MRFs for sport-related lower-extremity injury(s) with ≥ 1 female/woman/girl per study group.

Results

Across 195 studies (n = 115; 58.9% female/woman/girl-specific estimates) including 1525662 participants (2.4%females/women/girls), eight injury outcomes were assessed (n = 75 general lower-extremity, n = 3 groin, n = 6hip, n = 17 thigh, n = 88knee, n = 17 lower-leg, n = 27 ankle, n = 9foot). Sixty-six MRF categories were identified. Substantial heterogeneity in MRFs and injury outcomes exists, with high risk of bias present in 37.4% of studies. Considering female/woman/girl specific estimates, we performed meta-analyses for 10 MRFs (body mass, x (BMI), weekly training distance, muscle strength, artificial turf, off-season plyometric training, readiness to return-to-sport, single-leg hop asymmetry, vertical drop jump peak knee flexion angle and ground reaction force) and semiquantitative analyses for 26 MRFs for a variety of injuries. Meta-analyses suggest no association between any lower-extremity strength outcome (g = 0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.14; I² = 37.3%; very low certainty evidence) or artificial turf (Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.07; I² = 2.4%; low certainty evidence) and various lower-extremity injuries. Higher body mass (g = 0.19, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.38; I² = 71.7%) and/or BMI (g = 0.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.36; I² = 37.0%) are associated with several lower-extremity injuries (very low certainty evidence).

Conclusion

This review synthesises a large body of exploratory research, exposes important knowledge gaps and provides a foundation for understanding MRFs for female/woman/girl athlete lower-extremity injuries.

### Single leg vertical jump performance identifies knee function deficits at return to sport after ACL reconstruction in male athletes [^2dc31a68]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the characteristics of the participants and measurements. Normality of distribution of data was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk testand Q-Q plots. For the analysis we used only one (randomly selected) control limb from each control subject. Between-limbs (involved, uninvolved and control) comparisons were assessed using mixed-effect models with subject-specific random effects. Post hoc comparisons (Tukey) were performed to adjust for multiple comparisons. The parameter estimates were adjusted for age, Tegner score and body mass index. A p < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Effect sizes (ESs) were calculated using the pooled(between-limb) and the pooled weighted(between-group) SD. Values of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 were identified as the lower thresholds for small, moderate and large effects, respectively. All statistical analysis was performed using JMP V.15 (SAS Institute).

### Prepare to fail or failing to prepare? Acute performance after the 11 + with and without strength exercises [^a5b4e476]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

CMJ was measured on a portable force platform (HUR Labs, FP4, Tampere, Finland; maximal sampling frequency 1200 Hz). Players performed three jumps separated by a 30 s break, with hands on their hips and self-preferred squat depth. We extracted pre-warm-up and post-warm-up jump height, peak power, average peak power, peak force and average peak force from the highest jump for analysis.

The 40 m sprint was tested on an indoor running track. Wall-mounted photocells (Athletics Training System, IC Control Media & Sport, Bromma, Sweden) placed 1 m above the ground every 10 m. Players started each sprint standing with the front foot placed 30 cm behind the first photocell. The three trials were separated with a 1 min active break walking back. We retained sprint times for every 10 m (s) from the fastest 40 m for analysis.

A 'readiness to train' and 'RPE' questionnaire was verbally presented to players immediately after completing the full warm-up. The questionnaire consisted of two Likert-scale questions. Players were asked to answer a number ranging from 1 to 10 on the following two questions: (1) 'On a scale from 1 to 10, how physically ready do you feel to perform your best if you were to complete a football training session right now?' and (2) 'On a scale from 1 to 10, how physically demanding did you feel the warm-up was?'.

Statistical analysis

Values are expressed as mean ± SD and 95% CIs from pretest to post-test. All statistical analyses were completed using SPSS (SPSS V.24, IBM). For the isokinetic dynamometer and CMJ tests, we calculated the absolute change in the outcome variables from pretest to post-test for both warm-up protocols. We assessed the differences using a paired sample t-test. The difference in sprint performance, RPE and training readiness after the two warm-up protocols were analysed with a paired sample t-test. An α level of 0.05 was considered significant.

### The force-velocity profile for jumping: what It is and what It is not [^3351ed2e]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

The approach proposed by Samozino et al. is popular in the field because it can easily be applied; in principle, a minimum of two jumps at different loads need to be executed by the athlete from a standardized initial posture, and the crucial variable jump height can be calculated from flight time, which can be determined using equipment as simple as a contact mat or nowadays a smartphone. Although some investigators have reported amazing success of the approach of individualizing the training of athletes based on their force–velocity profiles, other authors failed to replicate the success and have raised questions concerning the validity of the theoretical framework developed by Samozino et al.

It needs no argument that the force–velocity relationship is an important limiting factor in a ballistic task like vertical jumping. The relationship is attributed to the coupling and decoupling of crossbridges between actin and myosin filaments, and it has an inherently hyperbolic shape at the level of single muscle fibers (e.g.) and whole muscles (e.g.). The relationship is formally determined by manipulating one variable and measuring the other. Hence, it can be determined by having a muscle perform isokinetic contractions at different velocities and measuring the maximal force that the muscle can produce at each velocity (e.g.). Alternatively, it can be determined by having a muscle perform isotonic contractions at different constant forces and measuring the maximal shortening velocity that the muscle can reach at each force (e.g.). However, this is not what is done in the force–velocity profiling approach; the load during the jumps is manipulated, but neither the force nor the velocity are controlled; bothandare calculated post hoc from the outcome of each jump. Given that the intrinsic force–velocity relationship of muscle is hyperbolic, why would fitting a straight line relationship to combinations ofandobtained in jumps, and extrapolating this line to intersections with the axes, would yield variables that, according to Samozino et al. (, p. 16, paragraph 4.2), "… do not only correspond to intrinsic muscle properties, but are the resultant of all the biological features affecting the maximal force that can be developed during lower extremities extension and the maximal extension velocity ?"

Model C: four segments actuated by six Hill-type muscle–tendon complexes

Model C (Fig. 7 A) comprised four body segments, actuated by six lumped muscle–tendon complexes of the human lower extremity. Each muscle–tendon complex was represented by a Hill-type unit, comprising a contractile element, a series elastic element, and a parallel elastic element. Forces of the elastic elements quadratically increased with elongation, whereas force of the contractile element depended on length and velocity of the contractile element, and active state. Active state, in turn, dynamically depended on muscle stimulation over time (STIM(t)). Initial STIM levels were set such that the model was in equilibrium in the starting position. During the jump, STIM of each muscle–tendon complex was allowed to change from the initial level to the maximum level of 1 at a rate of 5·s⁻¹, and this increase started at a STIM onset time. For a vertical jump, the combination of STIM onset times that maximized the height achieved by the center of mass was found using a genetic algorithm. For an isokinetic lower extremity extension, the toes were moved away from the hip at a constant velocity, and the combination of STIM onset times that maximized the work done on the toes was found.

Model A1 and its force–velocity profile. A, Model A1 consists of a mass projected by a linearly damped force (inset). m, total mass (82 kg); b, coefficient of linear damping; h, height of the center of mass; F, force of the actuator; v, velocity of the actuator. The intrinsic force–velocity relationship of the actuator was F = F₀ − b v, where isometric force F₀ was 3400 N and b was 700 N·s·m⁻¹. B, Force–velocity profile of the model obtained by plotting effective work per unit push-off distance as a function of half the takeoff velocity (see Fig. 1). The force–velocity profile differs from the intrinsic relationship of the model. The latter is obtained by having the model extend isokinetically at different velocities. During the unloaded jump, less effective work is produced than during an isokinetic extension at the same average velocity (vertical dashed line). The same effective work as during the unloaded jump can be produced during an isokinetic extension at a higher velocity (solid arrow).

### Jump performance and hop function, kinesiophobia and return to sports are important prognostic factors for a subsequent injury after an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a 2-year follow-up cohort study [^7462f9dc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Finding prognostic factors for a subsequent injury after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

Methods

We re-analysed the data of two intervention studies on adults with a hamstrings or quadriceps tendon ACL reconstruction. All participants were prospectively monitored for 24 months. At the end of the individual postsurgery rehabilitation, numerous self-reported and objective functional outcomes were quantified, all potential secondary injuries (primary outcome was the occurrence of secondary ipsi- or contralateral ACL injuries) and all rehabilitation and training measures were prospectively monitored. The association of potential factors with a secondary injury risk was determined using logistic mixed models.

Results

We included 148 participants (mean age 25.3 years [standard deviation 5.1 years], 63 females). Eight participants had a subsequent ACL injury, among them seven ispilateral and one contralateral side ACL rupture. The final model for the likelihood of a subsequent ACL injury led to a sensitivity (correctly classified participants who had a subsequent ACL injury) of 83.3% and to a specificity (correctly identified participants without who did not have a subsequent ACL injury) of 100% (n = 93). The main contributing factors to subsequent ACL or any subsequent other injuries were: higher kinesiophobia values (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1–3.4), higher knee loading levels during activity (Tegner activity scale, OR = 29, 95% CI: 1.1–791), lower performance levels at the Balance front hop (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03–0.52), and higher dynamic valgus (knee separation distance in the frontal plane) during the landing of a drop jump landing (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65–0.98).

Conclusion

Most of the predictive factors for a second subsequent injury after an ACL reconstruction are modifiable by adequate training and rehabilitation measures. The modification of these factors might decrease the secondary risk of injury risk.

### The force-velocity profile for jumping: what It is and what It is not [^137d0bd0]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
The method of force–velocity profiling for free squat jumps. From a standardized initial squatted posture, a subject performs five maximum height vertical squat jumps. One jump is unloaded (hence the load is body mass, m b), the other four are performed with extra load. For each jump, the height Δ h air is determined, i.e. the vertical displacement of the center of mass in the airborne phase (A); from Δ h air, the takeoff velocity of the center of mass v to is calculated (B), as well as the total change in effective mechanical energy during the push-off (equal to the total increase in potential energy from the initial posture to the apex of the jump). The latter is divided by Δ h PO to yield a variable that is referred to as "average vertical force"(it has the unit of force because J·m⁻¹ = N·m·m⁻¹ = N), which is expressed per kg body mass.is then combined with, the average vertical velocity of the center of mass during the push-off, to yield one point in the force–velocity profile (C). A line is fitted to the points obtained from the different jumps, and this line is extrapolated to findand, the intercepts with the-axis and the-axis, respectively. In the "simplified" profile, several approximations have been incorporated. For example, a fixed Δ h PO (vertical displacement of the hips) is used regardless of the loading condition. In reality, the lower extremities may reach full extension during low-velocity jumps (at high loads), but they will not reach full extension during high-velocity unloaded jumps; this has to do with the dynamics of transforming segmental rotations into linear velocity of the center of mass. Also, Samozino et al. do not use the actual mean velocitybut approximate it by, which is half the takeoff velocity v to; obviously, the two are only equal if the acceleration of the center of mass, and hence the ground reaction force, is constant. In the "true" profile, the actual vertical displacement of the hips during the push-off in each individual jump was used for Δ h PO, and the trueof the center of mass was used. Samozino et al. propose to multiplyandto obtain "mean power output", which has a maximum value of(D). Symbols corresponding to the unloaded jump have been filled for convenience in reading the graphs. m is total mass (i.e. body mass plus externally added mass), g is gravitational acceleration.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^ea66f311]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Intermittent sport testing — short maximal explosive efforts are emphasized as highly relevant to evaluate performance in actions such as linear sprints, accelerations/decelerations, changes of direction, and vertical jumps, even though such high-intensity efforts constitute a limited fraction of overall play and differ in relative importance and specific nature across sports; many available tests assess discrete skills yet are considered relevant and applicable where strength, power, and speed are important.

### Effects and dose-response relationships of resistance training on physical performance in youth athletes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d7502b3a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Training intensity

There was a significant difference with regard to the effects of conventional RT on measures of muscle strength (p < 0.01; figure 9). High-intensity conventional RT (ie, 80–89% of 1 RM) resulted in more pronounced improvements in muscle strength (SMD wm = 2.52) compared with lower training intensities (ie, 30–39%, 40–49%, 50–59%, 60–69%, 70–79% of the 1 RM).

Figure 9
Dose–response relationships of the parameter 'training intensity' on measures of muscle strength, vertical jump and linear sprint performance, agility, and sport-specific performance. Each filled grey circle illustrates between-subject SMD per single study with active control. Filled black triangles represent weighted mean SMD of all studies. NA, not applicable; SGA, subgroup analyses; SMD, standardised mean difference; RM, repetition maximum.

Training volume (number of sets per exercise)

There was a significant difference with regard to the effects of conventional RT on muscle strength (p < 0.01), and a tendency towards significance for measures of vertical jump performance (p = 0.06; figure 10). Five sets per exercise resulted in more pronounced improvements in muscle strength (SMD wm = 2.76) compared with fewer sets. Three sets per exercise tended to be more effective in improving vertical jump performance (SMD wm = 1.19), as compared with four or five sets per exercise.

Each filled grey circle illustrates between-subject SMD per single study with active control. Filled black triangles represent weighted mean SMD of all studies. NA, not applicable; SGA, subgroup analyses; SMD, standardised mean difference.

For plyometric training, there was a tendency towards larger training-related effects on measures of muscle strength (p = 0.09), linear sprint performance (p = 0.07), as well as sport-specific performance (p = 0.05) depending on the number of sets per exercise. Four sets per exercise revealed the largest effects for measures of muscle strength (SMD wm = 0.79) and sport-specific performance (SMD wm = 1.84), while three or four sets appear to be most effective for improving linear sprint performance (SMD wm = 0.95).

### Simultaneous motor preparation and execution in a last-moment reach correction task [^2959248f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We next assessed the neural response to a target jump in the preparatory and movement dimensions. For each jump condition, we calculated the average firing rates of jump trials initiated to the first target and to the final target. We then projected that activity into the preparatory and movement subspaces, found as described above. We compared the neural activity in target jump conditions to neural activity during non-jump reaches to the first and final target. We calculated the euclidean distance at each time between the trajectories in each subspace at each time point, aligned to the target onset, go cue, and movement onset.

We wanted to determine whether the distance between jump trials initiated toward the first target and the neural trajectory for non-jump reaches to the final target was higher than expected in the preparatory space during the movement epoch. For scale, we compared the average preparatory space distance between the non-jump trajectories to the first and final targets, from 0–200 ms after movement onset. We then calculated the distance from the non-jump trajectory to the final target, and the average target jump trial trajectory (for jump trials initiated toward the first target). We then calculated a Wilcoxon rank-sum test across the jump versus non-jump distance distributions for all target jump pairs for each monkey to assess significance.

### Patellofemoral pain [^c41d084c]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) — prognostic factors for pain and function: They reported limited evidence for several factors as predictors of pain: frequency of pain, pain catastrophizing, fear avoidance, AKPS scores, quadriceps cross-sectional area, and muscle recruitment, and there was limited evidence for the following predictors of function: pain catastrophizing, anxiety, fear avoidance, AKPS scores, Functional Index Questionnaire (FIQ) scores, quadriceps cross-sectional area, and gastrocnemius muscle length. The authors also reported that there is strong evidence that pain coping skills and kinesiophobia are not predictive of PFP or patellofemoral symptoms and function; baseline pain intensity is not predictive of pain at follow-up, and baseline activity-related pain is not predictive of function at follow-up. There is moderate evidence that the triple jump test; muscle length of the quadriceps, hamstrings, or soleus; and activities of daily living (ADLs) are not predictive of pain or function, and bilateral symptoms and the step test are not predictive of pain. There was limited evidence that BMI, anxiety, being an athlete, and movement quality were not predictive of pain or function; there was also limited evidence that gastrocnemius muscle length, depression, working status, and the single-leg jump test did not predict pain; and, in addition, there is limited evidence that fear avoidance at work, muscle recruitment, work type, and preferred treatment were not predictive of function.

### Jumper's knee paradox – jumping ability is a risk factor for developing jumper's knee: a 5-year prospective study [^1da8175f]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The 'jumper's knee paradox', where symptomatic athletes appear to perform better in a counter movement jump (CMJ) compared to asymptomatic controls in previous case-control studies is not fully understood.

Aim

The aim was to examine the relationship between jumping ability and change of jumping ability as potential risk factors for developing jumper's knee.

Methods

A 5-year prospective cohort study among elite volleyball players, aged 16–18. Jump tests were done on a portable force plate at the time of inclusion and semiannually. Jumper's knee was diagnosed based on a standardised clinical examination.

Results

All 150 students (68 males and 82 females) were included and 28 developed jumper's knee (22 males and 6 females). At the time of inclusion, male athletes who went on to develop jumper's knee had significantly better results in CMJ (38.0 ± 5.8 cm) compared to asymptomatic males (34.6 ± 5.5 cm, p = 0.03), while no difference was detected in standing jump (SJ: jumper's knee: 30.3 ± 7.4 cm, asymptomatic: 28.1 ± 6.1 cm, p = 0.23). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis corrected for gender and previous volleyball training, the OR was 2.09 (1.03–4.25) per cm difference in CMJ at the time of inclusion. Our results did not reveal any significant differences in the change in jumping ability between the groups, although both groups improved their jump performance.

Conclusions

Volleyball players with a natural ability for jumping high are at an increased risk for developing jumper's knee.

### Muscle contributions to take-off velocity in the long jump [^0cfdfb93]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A key determinant of long jump performance is the ability to increase the vertical velocity of the center of mass (COM) while minimizing the loss in forward velocity (running speed) during the take-off phase, but exactly how this occurs is not fully understood. We combined a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the body with dynamic optimization theory to simulate the biomechanics of the long jump take-off and determine the contributions of the individual leg muscles to jump performance.

Methods

The body was modeled as a 29-degree-of-freedom skeleton actuated by a combination of muscles and net joint torques. A dynamic optimization problem was solved to reproduce full-body motion and ground-force data recorded from experienced subelite jumpers. The optimization solution then was analyzed to determine each muscle's contribution to the ground-force impulse and hence the change in velocity of the COM during the take-off phase.

Results

The hip, knee, and ankle extensors dominated the change in velocity of the COM during take-off. Vasti (VAS) generated the highest support impulse and contributed one-third (33%) of the increase in vertical COM velocity generated by all the muscles. Soleus (SOL) and gluteus maximus (GMAX) also developed substantial support impulses and contributed 24% and 16% of the increase in vertical COM velocity, respectively. VAS also generated the highest braking impulse and contributed approximately one-half (55%) of the loss in forward COM velocity generated by all the muscles, whereas SOL and GMAX made much smaller contributions (12% and 7%, respectively).

Conclusions

VAS, SOL, and GMAX contributed nearly three-quarters (73%) of the increase in vertical COM velocity at take-off, suggesting that these muscles ought to be prioritized in strength training programs aimed at improving long jump performance.

### SPORTS STARS study protocol: a randomised, controlled trial of the effectiveness of a physiotherapist-led modified sport intervention for ambulant school-aged children with cerebral palsy [^71c1edd1]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Functional Lower Limb Strength: Standing Broad Jump

The standing broad jump measures lower limb strength in the context of sports participation. Standing with toes up to a line, children are asked to jump forward as far as they can, landing with both feet. The distance between the start line and the most distal part of their toes of their back foot will be measured for three jumps, with the average recorded to the nearest centimetre. The standing broad jump has excellent test-retest reliability in typically developing children (ICC- 0.88) and in children with down syndrome (ICC- 0.89). It has excellent concurrent validity with measures of physical fitness (r = 0.84), Paralympic throwing (r = 0.77–0.86) and sprinting (r = 0.82) for children with disabilities. It has been reported to be sensitive to change as part of a test battery and is a feasible clinical test.

Functional Lower Limb Strength: Vertical Jump

The vertical jump measures lower limb strength. Standing next to a wall, children raise their arm. The most distal point of their fingers is marked. They are instructed to jump as high as they can, a second mark being made at the height of their jump. The vertical distance of three jumps will be measured and averaged to obtain the jump height to the nearest centimetre. The vertical jump has been used to represent the core functional output of children's strength in previous literature. It is also utilised readily in mainstream sport and physical education and is included in Australia's national talent identification and development program.

Functional Upper Limb Strength: Seated throw

The seated throw measures functional upper limb strength. Children are seated comfortably with their back against a wall. Using a chest pass, they are asked to throw a basketball as far as possible while keeping their back against the wall. The distance between the wall and the first point of contact of the ball will be measured to the nearest centimetre for three throws and the average calculated. Similar to the vertical jump, the seated throw has been used to represent the core functional output of children's strength in previous literature, is common and clinically feasible in mainstream sport and physical education and is included in Australia's national talent identification and development program.

Age, height, and weight are presented as the mean and standard deviation. Playing level was defined as elite (top two divisions of Swedish football), sub-elite (third and fourth highest divisions), and recreational (lower divisions and youth football)

Tuck jump

Women had higher tuck jump scores than men (mean ± standard deviation, 5 ± 2 vs 3 ± 2, respectively, F (1, 91) = 26.50, P < 0.01, np 2 = 0.23) (Fig. 2). There was no difference between sexes in number of tuck jumps performed (women 15 ± 2 jumps, men 14 ± 3 jumps, F (1,91) = 2.00, n.s. np 2 = 0.02). There were significantly more women with abnormal tuck jump scores (18 [39%]) than men (4 [9%], P < 0.01) (Fig. 2). Women more frequently had flaws in the items: thighs not parallel at peak, feet not shoulder width apart, foot placement not parallel front to back, and does not land in the same footprint (Table 2).

### A biomechanical analysis of the long-jump technique of elite female amputee athletes [^5937d2f4]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether female lower-limb amputees conform to the established long-jump model and to compare the kinematics of the approach and take-off phases for elite female transfemoral and transtibial amputee long jumpers.

Methods

Eight female transfemoral and nine female transtibial amputee athletes were videotaped (sagittal plane movements at 50 Hz) from third-to-last step to take-off during the 2004 Paralympic Games long-jump finals. After digitizing and reconstruction of 2D coordinates, key variables were calculated at each stride and during contact with the take-off board. Additionally, approach speed during the run-up of each jump was recorded (100 Hz) using a laser Doppler device (LDM 300 C Sport, Jenoptik Laser, Jena, Germany).

Results

The transfemoral amputees had a consistently higher center of mass height on the last three steps before take-off than the transtibial amputees. However, at touch-down onto the take-off board, they lowered their center of mass excessively so that from touch-down to take-off, they were actually lower than the transtibial amputees. This resulted in a greater negative vertical velocity at touch-down and may have inversely affected their jump performance.

Conclusion

Female transtibial athletes conformed to the long-jump model, although adaptations to this technique were displayed. Female transfemoral athletes, however, exhibited no relationship between take-off speed and distance jumped, which may be attributable to their excessive lowering of their center-of-mass height at touch-down onto the take-off board. It is recommended that coaches and athletes proceed with caution when trying to replicate techniques used by able-bodied athletes because adaptations to the constraints of a prosthesis should be considered.

Countermovement Jump (Bilateral/Unilateral)

Participants were instructed to stand fully upright, with hands on hips, and align their feet on a synchronized, uniaxial dual force plate system (ForceDecks Version 1.2.6109; VALD Performance). Before the initiation of the test, each player was instructed to remain motionless for a minimum of 3 seconds to ensure that a stable baseline of force at body weight was obtained. Players then performed a downward motion (descent phase) until they reached their preferred self-selected depthbefore rapidly reversing the motion by triple extending at the hip, knee, and ankle. The aim of the task was to achieve their maximum vertical displacement of the center of mass. Hands remained on the hips throughout, and no bending of the knees was permitted while airborne. The procedures were replicated for the single-leg CMJ, except that the nontested leg was positioned with the hip and knee at 90° and no obvious swinging was allowed to minimize contralateral propulsion. Limb order was randomized. There were 2 trials performed with a 30-second rest period between each jump, with the best trial recorded for statistical analysis.

Vertical ground-reaction force data were recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The initiation of the jump was defined by a 20-N change in body weight calculated between the quiet standing period and the instant of takeoff, when the total vertical force dropped below 20 N. Jump height was calculated from the impulse-momentum relationship–derived take-off velocity and the equation for constant acceleration (velocity at takeoff squared divided by 2 * 9.81 and v²/2g). Peak power was measured and normalized to body weight (W/kg; relative peak power) during the propulsion phase. The RSImod value was calculated by dividing jump height by contraction time (determined from movement onset to time to takeoff). This variable was used to determine the ability to store and reutilize elastic energy during stretch-shortening cycle activities.

### Water striders adjust leg movement speed to optimize takeoff velocity for their morphology [^68f67d2c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In the model, the angular velocity of leg rotation ω does not change during a jump. This concept is unrealistic, but to illustrate how close our theoretical approximation of leg rotation ω is to the real angular leg movements by jumping insects, we compared the time derivative of average angle of four legs with respect to the horizontal plane through the body centre,(extracted from the video), with the value of ω that leads to a good match between empirical and modelled vertical distance of the legs l s (Fig. 2a) and downward linear velocity of the legs v s (Fig. 2b). We calculated the value of ω for each jump (ω = v s, max /Δ l) with empirically measured v s, max (maximum value of v s) and Δ l. We also calculated the time derivative of the empirically measured (from video) average angle of legs with respect to the horizontal plane through the body centre (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note 3). The value ofwas not constant during the jump, but rather tended to quickly increase during the initial 8–10 ms of a jump, and then it fluctuated randomly (partly due to measurement error) indicating the apparent plateau as shown in Fig. 2c. Interestingly, the angle θ varies over time in a manner resulting in the changes of the vertical distance from the tip of the legs to the horizontal plane through body centre, l s, approximating a sinusoidal function of ωt. Note that l s = Δ l sin θ (t)≈Δ l [1−½cos(2 ωt)]+ y i. Furthermore, the value of ω is similar to the time average of empirical value of the average angular velocity of the leg rotationas seen in Fig. 2c. Therefore, we believe that our theoretical approach by using ω is a reasonable theoretical representation of the average angular velocity of leg rotation of vertically jumping water striders.

### Augmented feedback supports skill transfer and reduces high-risk injury landing mechanics: a double-blind, randomized controlled laboratory study [^d87cbfd0]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a current need to produce a simple, yet effective method for screening and targeting possible deficiencies related to increased anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk.

Hypothesis

Frontal plane knee angle (FPKA) during a drop vertical jump will decrease upon implementing augmented feedback into a standardized sport training program.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Thirty-seven female participants (mean ± SD: age, 14.7 ± 1.5 years; height, 160.9 ± 6.8 cm; weight, 54.5 ± 7.2 kg) were trained over 8 weeks. During each session, each participant received standardized training consisting of strength training, plyometrics, and conditioning. They were also videotaped running on a treadmill at a standardized speed and performing a repeated tuck jump for 10 seconds. Study participants were randomized into 2 groups and received augmented feedback on either their jumping (AF) or sprinting (CTRL) form. Average (mean of 3 trials) and most extreme (trial with greatest knee abduction) FPKA were calculated from 2-dimensional video captured during performance of the drop vertical jump.

Results

After testing, a main effect of time was noted, with the AF group reducing their FPKA average by 37.9% over the 3 trials while the CTRL group demonstrated a 26.7% reduction average across the 3 trials (P < .05). Conversely, in the most extreme drop vertical jump trial, a significant time-by-group interaction was noted (P < .05). The AF group reduced their most extreme FPKA by 6.9° (pretest, 18.4° ± 12.3°; posttest, 11.4° ± 10.1°) on their right leg and 6.5° (pretest, 16.3° ± 14.5°; posttest, 9.8° ± 10.7°) on their left leg, which represented a 37.7% and 40.1% reduction in FPKA, respectively. In the CTRL group, no similar changes were noted in the right (pretest, 16.9° ± 14.3°; posttest, 14.0° ± 12.3°) or left leg (pretest, 9.8° ± 11.1°; posttest, 7.2° ± 9.2°) after training.

Conclusion

Providing athletes with augmented feedback on deficits identified by the tuck jump assessment has a positive effect on their biomechanics during a different drop vertical jump task that is related to increased ACL injury risk. The ability of the augmented feedback to support the transfer of skills and injury risk factor reductions across different tasks provides exciting new evidence related to how neuromuscular training may ultimately cross over into retained biomechanics that reduce ACL injuries during sport.

Clinical Relevance

The tuck jump assessment's ease of use makes it a timely and economically favorable method to support ACL prevention strategies in young girls.

### Ground reaction forces associated with an effective elementary school based jumping intervention [^f50cad30]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Mechanical loading during childhood plays a critical role in normal growth and development of the skeleton. Ground reaction forces (GRFs) may provide a surrogate measure for the strain experienced by bone on landing and at take off. However, there appear to be no paediatric studies that assess GRFs across a variety of loading activities.

Objectives

To measure biomechanical variables in commonly performed childhood activities used in an elementary physical education intervention study which augmented bone health in boys and girls.

Methods

Maximal GFR, maximal rates of force, and time to maximum force were measured for 12 different jumping activities on a force platform. The jumps measured were drop jumps from 10, 30, and 50 cm, all followed by a plyometric jump, submaximal and maximal jumping jacks, alternating feet jump, counter movement jumps, and side to side jumps over 10 and 20 cm foam barriers. The subjects were 70 children (36 boys and 34 girls), 8.3–11.7 years old.

Results

Subjects ranged in height from 128.4 to 172.6 cm and had a mass of 25.0–57.0 kg. Mean (SD) for vertical jump was 24.2 (5.5) cm and 135.2 (16.6) cm for standing long jump. The children engaged in loaded physical activity 5.7 (5.3) hours a week, on average. The highest mean maximal GRFs, normalised for body weight (BW), were generated from the plyometric portion of the drop jumps and the counter movement jump (about 5 times BW) compared with 3.5 times BW for jumping jacks. Similarly, the highest rates of change in force were 514 times BW/s for the drop jump from 10 cm and 493 times BW/s for the counter movement jump.

Conclusions

Simple jumps requiring minimal equipment produce GRFs of 3.5–5 times BW and rates of force of around 500 times BW/s. As children appear to attenuate higher impact forces when jumping from increased heights, it cannot be assumed that merely increasing the height of the jump will necessarily "progress" the exercise intervention.

### Curved approach in high jump induces greater jumping height without greater joint kinetic exertions than straight approach [^ef072299]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The most height-specific jumping mode, the athletic high jump, is characterized as a running single-leg jump (RSLJ) from a curved approach. The main advantage of a curved approach is believed to be facilitation of bar clearance. However, the effect of a curved approach on center-of-mass (CoM) height generation has not been clarified. Here, we show that the curved RSLJ (C-RSLJ) is more suitable than the straight RSLJ (S-RSLJ) for CoM height generation.

Methods

We collected data using motion capture from 13 male high jumpers (personal best, 2.02–2.31 m) that performed C-RSLJ and S-RSLJ. We then compared the energy generation contributing to CoM height (Evert) in each approach.

Results

All participants attained greater CoM height in C-RSLJ than in S-RSLJ (difference, 0.055 ± 0.024 m). Three-dimensional joint kinematics and kinetics were similar between both approaches, except for the ankle plantar-flexion torque, which was smaller in C-RSLJ. The sum of positive work was comparable between the approaches, whereas the sum of negative work in C-RSLJ was significantly smaller than in S-RSLJ. The shank forward rotation induced a larger difference in Evert generation between C-RSLJ and S-RSLJ (0.80 ± 0.36 J·kg⁻¹) than any other segment (≤ 0.36 J·kg⁻¹).

Conclusions

Compared with a straight approach, a curved approach induces greater CoM height without increasing joint kinetic exertions during takeoff. The curved approach changes the initial condition of the takeoff and promotes the transformation of horizontal kinetic energy into Evert. This study provides novel practical perspectives for high jumpers and highlights the importance of segment biomechanics in human motor performance.

### Single leg vertical jump performance identifies knee function deficits at return to sport after ACL reconstruction in male athletes [^155f4afd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Vertical jump performance (height) is a more representative metric for knee function than horizontal hop performance (distance) in healthy individuals. It is not known what the biomechanical status of athletes after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) is at the time they are cleared to return to sport (RTS) or whether vertical performance metrics better evaluate knee function.

Methods

Standard marker-based motion capture and electromyography (EMG) were collected from 26 male athletes cleared to RTS after ACLR and 22 control healthy subjects during single leg vertical jumps (SLJ) and single leg drop jumps (SLDJ). Performance outcomes, jump height and the Reactive Strength Index, were calculated. Sagittal plane kinematics, joint moments and joint work were obtained using inverse dynamics and lower limb muscle forces were computed using an EMG-constrained musculoskeletal model. Muscle contribution was calculated as a percentage of the impulse of all muscle forces in the model. Between-limb and between-group differences were explored using mixed models analyses.

Results

Jump performance, assessed by jump height and Reactive Strength Index, was significantly lower in the involved than the uninvolved limb and controls, with large effect sizes. For the ACLR group, jump height limb symmetry index was 83% and 77% during the SLJ and SLDJ, respectively. Work generation was significantly less in the involved knee compared to uninvolved limb and controls during the SLJ (p < 0.001; d = 1.19; p = 0.003, d = 0.91, respectively) and during the SLDJ (p < 0.001; d = 1.54; p = 0.002, d = 1.05, respectively). Hamstrings muscle contribution was greater in the involved compared to the uninvolved limb and controls, whereas soleus contribution was lower in the involved limb compared to controls.

Conclusions

During vertical jumps, male athletes after ACLR at RTS still exhibit knee biomechanical deficits, despite symmetry in horizontal functional performance and strength tests. Vertical performance metrics like jump height and RSI can better identify interlimb asymmetries than the more commonly used hop distance and should be included in the testing battery for the RTS.

### Positive effects on bone mineralisation and muscular fitness after 10 months of intense school-based physical training for children aged 8–10 years: the FIT FIRST randomised controlled trial [^af9155d9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Maximal horizontal jump length

The maximal horizontal jump test was performed as a squat jump (SJ) with the arms held steady behind the back and from standing erect, starting with a knee flexion to the squat position which was held in 2 s before a maximal forward jumping and as a countermovement jump (CMJ) allowing use of the arms. After a standardised warm-up, the children were placed behind a line with their feet parallel and shoulder-width apart starting with the CMJ followed by the SJ after a 2 min rest period. In both jumps, the distance from the starting line to the heel was measured. Maximal horizontal jump length is a reliable method that is well correlated with muscular leg strength in children.

20 m sprint test

After the warm-up, the children performed 2×20 m maximal sprints with at least 2 min of recovery between sprints. All sprints started from a standing position and were timed using two ports of light sensors (Witty Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) placed at 0 m (positioned 30 cm in front of the standing start position) and 20 m: the fastest time was recorded as the test result. Sprinting abilities rely on muscle strength, body weight and neuromuscular function.

Gross motor skill

Time (in seconds) to complete a coordination wall with three stages of increased difficulty was used to evaluate gross motor skill. Each stage consisted of a table (9×8 A5 size squares) with numbered marks from 1 to 10. Half the numbers were blue, half were red. The two lowest ranks were separated from the higher ranks by a thick line. The participants had a red mark on the right hand and a blue mark on the left hand, and were instructed to touch the numbers from 1 to 10 in the correct order, and as fast as possible with the hand (above the thick line) or foot (below) matching the colour of the number. If the participants made a mistake, they were told to correct the mistake and proceed, while the clock was still ticking. Stage 1 and stage 2 were unilateral. Stage 1 had no crossing over the vertical midline, stage 2 was with crossing over the vertical midline, over the vertical midline, and stage 3 was bilateral. Each child was given three attempts at each stage and the best (shortest) times at each stage were summed to provide a combined score of stages 1–3.

### Update in the understanding of altitude-induced limitations to performance in team-sport athletes [^a50b7e28]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Soccer athletes, for example, regularly repeat short, high-intensity efforts, interspersed with longer intervals of rest or submaximal exercise over ≥ 30 min. The typical distance covered by top-class centre-midfielders is ∼9–13 km/match, which is comprised of 70% low-intensity activity and ∼150–250 brief intense actions (average sprint distances of ∼10–20 m). Australian footballers cover the highest distances in field sports, up to 15 km in finals matches, and undertake up to 30% of this distance as HiVR. In addition to these locomotive activities, athletes must perform other energy-demanding activities (eg, jumping, moving while controlling the ball and tackling) during matches that require them to accelerate. These high-intensity movements and accelerations often occur in response to cues such as ball movement or opponents' actions. Such movements are typically short and, when started from a low velocity, have not been traditionally accounted for in match analysis research. In fact, analysis from elite soccer athletes reveals that 85% of accelerations (≥ 2.78 m/s²) do not exceed the determined HiVR threshold. Thus, in match analysis studies that only report movements occurring at high velocities, accelerations are often excluded. A recent study demonstrated a 13-fold increase in high-intensity actions over the course of a match when combining sprint bouts and accelerations in the analysis. It is imperative to consider these short actions, as they are energetically the most challenging during a matchand thus contribute greatly to total energy expenditure in a match.

Characteristics of elite team-sport athletes

Elite TS athletes must adapt to varied physical demands during the course of a match. Typically, athletes compete on average at 70% of their maximal aerobic O 2 uptake (VO 2max), and cover an average distance of ∼9–13 km/match. This suggests that, in addition to the intermittent high-intensity nature of TS, high aerobic power is important for success. In fact, while elite TS athletes do not exhibit the specific physical/physiological capacities of elite endurance and sprint athletes, they do possess high levels of 'aerobic' and 'anaerobic' potentials.

### Jump power and force have distinct associations with cortical bone parameters: findings from a population enriched by individuals with high bone mass [^c26b41cd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Jumping mechanography

A Leonardo Mechanography Ground Reaction Force Platform (Leonardo software version 4.2; Novotec Medical GmbH) was used to assess lower limb muscle force, power, velocity, jumping height, and total body weight by a trained assistant using a standard operating procedure. The ground reaction platform was calibrated before each participant assessment, and participants wore standard footwear. When an individual had difficulty performing either jump type, free text details were recorded by the operator. Peak power and jump height were assessed during countermovement jumps; ie, individuals briefly squat before jumping. The initial jump was 2-footed. Individuals were asked to jump, aiming to get their head as high as possible, thus producing the maximum elevation of the center of mass. Peak force was assessed for the dominant leg, during the hopping test, with participants instructed to bounce on the ball of the foot with the knee almost straight and to keep the ankle joint as stiff as possible. Each type of jump was repeated until 3 acceptable jumps were obtained, and the jump with the greatest peak power/force was then analyzed.

pQCT methods

pQCT scans were performed in those participants attending the center at Hull, where the largest number were seen. The diaphyseal midshaft of the tibia (66% from the distal endplate) was scanned in the nondominant lower limb using a Stratec XCT2000L (Stratec Medizintechnik) with voxel size 0.5 mm, CT speed 30 mm/s (XCT software version 5.50d). A reference line at the distal endplate was determined from the initial frontal scout view. Cortical bone was defined using a threshold above 650 mg/cm³ (optimal for bone geometry). Cortical thickness, periosteal circumference, and endocortical circumference were derived using a circular ring model. Other cortical parameters were measured, including cortical BMD, total bone area, cortical bone area (reflecting a combination of periosteal and endocortical expansion), and cortical bone area/total bone area (percent). SSI was calculated according to Stratec's user manual. Data acquisition and analysis methods were uniform for all participants.

Ethics

Recruitment ran from September 2008 until April 2010. Written informed consent was obtained for all in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the Bath Multicenter Research Ethics Committee and at each National Health Service Local Research Ethics Committee.

### Performance and symmetry measures during vertical jump testing at return to sport after ACL reconstruction [^25cc7ac5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vertical jump tests are more sensitive in revealing asymmetries in performance metrics at the time of return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) than horizontal hop tests. However, it remains unclear which vertical tests (bilateral or unilateral) and which metrics (kinetics or performance) are most effective in informing the rehabilitation status and readiness for return to sport. We aimed to investigate the status of athletes during vertical jump testing at return to sport after ACLR.

Methods

A dual force platform system was used to evaluate jumping performance of 126 recreational and professional athletes at the time of return to sport after ACLR, as well as 532 healthy control participants. Performance and kinetic metrics were collected during four jump tests: double-leg countermovement jump, single-leg countermovement jump, double-leg 30 cm drop jump and single-leg 15 cm drop jump. Between-limb and between-group differences were explored using mixed models analyses.

Results

At the time of return to sport after ACLR, athletes still presented significant differences favouring the uninvolved side, particularly in the symmetry of the concentric impulse (p < 0.001) in all jumps compared with the control group. Peak landing force asymmetry was greater in the ACLR group than the controls during the countermovement (p < 0.001, MD = -11.6; 95% CI -15.4 to -7.9) and the double-leg drop jump (p = 0.023, MD = -8.9; 95% CI -14.9 to -2.8). The eccentric impulse asymmetry was significantly greater (p = 0.018, MD = -3.8; 95% CI -5.8 to -1.7) in the ACLR group during the single-leg drop jump only. Jump height was significantly lower (p < 0001) in the ACLR group compared with controls in all tests except the double-leg drop jump.

Conclusion

At the time of return to sport after ACLR, despite passing the traditional discharge criteria, athletes remained asymmetrical during all vertical jump tests, in the concentric (push-off) phase, during landing from bilateral jumps and for most performance metrics. Clinicians should aim to restore not only symmetry in ground reaction forces but also absolute performance metrics such as jump height, reactive strength index and contact times, to potentially reduce injury risk and improve overall athletic performance.

### Jump performance in male and female football players [^205a1db9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Tuck jump

Players were instructed to stand with their feet shoulder width apart, bringing their thighs parallel to the floor, and landing in the same place. Players were instructed to immediately start the next jump upon landing and were filmed (two Panasonic HC-V500M video cameras, one in the frontal and one in the sagittal plane) as they jumped continuously for 10 s. Video was recorded at 50 Hz with advanced video coding high definition at 1080/50p. The tuck jump was analyzed according to a clinician friendly screening tool. The screening tool consists of ten criteria, each scored as either 0 indicating no flaw or 1 indicating flawed technique, for a total score ranging from 0 to 10. Players were classified as having an abnormal tuck jump score if their total tuck jump score was ≥ 6. This cutoff was previously proposed to indicate players who might be at a higher risk for ACL injury and might benefit from injury prevention programs. Grading was performed, by one researcher (AA), according to Herrington et al. at normal video speed, reviewing each plane three times.

Drop vertical jump

Players were given standardized instructions to drop down off the box (31 cm) and immediately jump as high as possible reaching with both hands towards a ball suspended above them. The first landing of the DVJ was assessed with two different methods, quantitatively and qualitatively. To simplify measurements and increase visibility, the athlete's greater trochanter, the lateral knee joint line, fibular head, lateral malleolus, patella tendon, and center of the patella were identified by palpation and marked with a marker pen. Three DVJ trials were filmed using the same one camera in the frontal and one in the sagittal plane.

### Jump power and force have distinct associations with cortical bone parameters: findings from a population enriched by individuals with high bone mass [^df95e73f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Two-legged jump power and bone outcomes

After adjustment for age, gender, and participant height, jump power was strongly associated with total hip BMD (standardized β [95% confidence interval, CI] = 0.48 [0.28, 0.67], P < .01, model 1, Table 2). Jump power was also strongly positively associated with midtibial cortical area, total bone area, cortical to total bone area ratio, and tibial SSI (model 1, Table 2). A strong inverse association between 2-legged jump power and endocortical circumference (EC PC) was also observed.

Table 2.
Regression Analysis of Logged Maximum 2-Legged Jump Power Versus Bone Outcomes a

After additional weight adjustment (model 2, Table 2), jump power remained strongly associated with hip BMD (0.29 [0.07, 0.51], P = 0.01), cortical area of the midtibia (0.29 [0.11, 0.46], P < .01), and tibial strength (SSI 0.26 [0.09, 0.44], P < .01); however, the association with overall bone size (total bone area (0.10 [−0.10, 0.30], P = 0.33, model 2, Table 2) was attenuated. Interestingly, power remained strongly inversely associated with EC PC after age, gender, height, and weight adjustment (−0.24 [−0.40, −0.08], P < .01, model 2, Table 2), suggesting that jump power is more closely related to reduced endocortical expansion than periosteal expansion. Although a positive association was seen between jump power and cortical BMD (0.39 [0.06, 0.73], P = 0.02), examination of the distribution revealed one obvious outlier, exclusion of which attenuated this association (0.23 [−0.08, 0.54], P = 0.15 excluding outlier).

### Jump performance in male and female football players [^deb0d58d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The tuck jump has been studied in women of various ages, sports and skill levels, but fewer studies report results in men. The women in this study had tuck jump scores similar to those previously reported in collegiate women athletes; however, the women's scores were worse than their matched male counterparts in the present study. Significantly more women (39%) had abnormal tuck jump scores (total score ≥ 6) compared to men (9%). Prior to puberty it is thought that boys and girls have similar strength and neuromuscular control, however through/after puberty women's strength and dynamic control over their knee joint may decrease relative to men's. The higher tuck jump scores in women seems to support that women may have worse neuromuscular control than men. Women were more likely to have flaws in thighs not reaching parallel, feet not shoulder width, feet not parallel at landing, and does not land in the same footprint. According to the factor analysis performed by Lininger et al. these results could indicate that, compared to men, women have more deficits in proximal control (a lack of hip strength to control the knees and feet during landing) and more of a distal landing pattern (greater strength in the quadriceps compared to the hip extensors leading to landing with the quadriceps and hamstrings co-contracted with a flatter foot). Looking at the frequency of flaws overall, two of the three most frequent flaws seen in the men and the women were the same. These two flaws, technique declines before 10 s (flawed in 27 of 46 men and 34 of 46 women) and feet not shoulder width apart (flawed in 22 of 46 men and 35 of 46 women) could represent flaws that are ubiquitous among football players.

### Effect of menstrual cycle and contraceptive pill phase on aspects of exercise physiology and athletic performance in female athletes: protocol for theinternational multisite innovative project [^4317a616]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Power: countermovement jump

This test will be administered using the MyJump2 app, which calculates jump height by recording the jump and accurately selecting its take-off and landing. A smartphone or tablet will be positioned at the same height (1 m height) and the same distance (1.5 m) from the participant, enabling a clear view of the participant's lower limbs. The sagittal plane is used to identify the exact take-off and landing frames more easily. Arm-swing will be prohibited; participants must keep their hands on the hips throughout the test. The test administrator will pay strict attention to the participant's hands to ensure they are not used to apply additional force through the legs. Verbal instructions will be given to participants to rapidly descend by flexing at the knees and hips to approximately 90° and then immediately extend their knees and hips to 'jump' vertically up off the ground as high as possible, landing back on the mat on both feet at the same time. A 1-min rest will be allowed between trials. The take-off will occur from both feet simultaneously, with no initial steps or shuffling. Participants will not be allowed to pause at the bottom position of the squat. The best result of three attempts will be recorded. However, if improvements are made, participants may continue to jump beyond three attempts. It is also important that the athlete attempts to land in the same position as they took off, as jumping forwards, backwards, or sideways can affect the test results. To aid this, experimenters should stick tape to the floor as a marker for participants to take-off from and land on. The outcome measure is the highest jump recorded. Test-retest reliability of the CMJ using the My Jump app showed an ICC of 0.94 in recreationally active women.

### Olympic weightlifting training improves vertical jump height in sportspeople: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^872906b2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effect of Olympic weightlifting (OW) on vertical jump (VJ) height compared to a control condition, traditional resistance training and plyometric training.

Methods

Five electronic databases were searched using terms related to OW and VJ. Studies needed to include at least one OW exercise, an intervention lasting ≥ 6weeks; a comparison group of control, traditional resistance training or plyometric training; and to have measured VJ height. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist. Random and fixed effects meta-analyses were performed to pool the results of the included studies and generate a weighted mean effect size (ES).

Results

Six studies (seven articles) were included in the meta-analyses and described a total of 232 participants (175 athletes and 57 physical education students) with resistance training experience, aged 19.5 ± 2.2years. Three studies compared OW versus control; four studies compared OW versus traditional resistance training; and three studies compared OW versus plyometric training. Meta-analyses indicated OW improved VJ height by 7.7% (95% CI 3.4 to 5.4cm) compared to control (ES = 0.62, p = 0.03) and by 5.1% (95% CI 2.2 to 3.0cm) compared to traditional resistance training (ES = 0.64 p = 0.00004). Change in VJ height was not different for OW versus plyometric training.

Conclusions

OW is an effective training method to improve VJ height. The similar effects observed for OW and plyometric training on VJ height suggests that either of these methods would be beneficial when devising training programmes to improve VJ height.

### Differing levels of acute hypoxia do not influence maximal anaerobic power capacity [^45a31a7f]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of different inspired oxygen fractions (Fio2) on average and peak power capacity during consecutive jumps to assess the effectiveness of a hypoxic explosive-strength program.

Methods

Eight physically active subjects (aged 33.62 ± 4.07 years; height, 1.77 ± 0.05 m; weight, 74.38 ± 6.86 kg) completed a Bosco jump test, consisting of a series of 15-second "all-out" jumps with 3 minutes of recovery, performed in a normoxia condition (N [Fio2 = 21%]) and in two hypoxic conditions: moderate hypoxia (MH [Fio2 16.5% o2]) and high hypoxia (HH [13.5% o2]). A force platform provided the average and the maximal power output (W) generated during consecutive jumps. Measurements were also taken of lactate, creatine kinase, arterial oxygen saturation, and perceived exertion using the Borg fatigue scale.

Results

The average power outputs throughout the entire sets were similar between N (3187 ± 46) and MH (3184 ± 15; P > .05), but slightly greater with HH (3285 ± 43) compared with N (P < .05). Values for lactate during N (7.5 ± 3.0), MH (7.7 ± 4.0), and HH (7.9 ± 3.0; P > .05), and for creatine kinase (values before, 69.8 ± 15; and 24 hours after in N [79.4 ± 15.60], MH [85.2 ± 26.7], and HH [84.3 ± 47.2]; P > .05) were similar for all conditions. Only during exercise in hypoxia were moderate and severe hypoxemia induced as the sets increased and Fio2 was lower (P < .05). At the same time, the perceived exertion reported by subjects was substantially higher at HH (8.9 ± 1.1) than at N (7.1 ± 1.9; P < .05).

Conclusions

Jumping power output was not negatively affected by mild or high hypoxia in comparison with normoxia during an anaerobic workout despite having higher hypoxemia and a greater perception of exertion.

### Factors associated with persistently high muscular power from childhood to adulthood [^c5546c6e]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Child and adult muscular power have been shown to associate with contemporary cardiometabolic health. Muscular power typically persists (tracks) between childhood and adulthood. Few studies span childhood to adulthood, so we aimed to identify modifiable and environmental factors associated with the persistence or change in muscular power across the life course.

Methods

Prospective study examining 1938 participants who had their muscular power (standing long jump distance) measured in 1985 as children 7–15 yr old and again 20 yr later in adulthood (26–36 yr old). A selection of objectively measured anthropometric characteristics (adiposity and fat-free mass), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), self-reported physical activity, dietary (quality and fruit, vegetable, and protein intake), and sociodemographic data were available at both time points. Muscular power was separated into thirds, and participants were reported as having persistently low, decreasing, persistently moderate, increasing, or persistently high muscular power.

Results

Higher adiposity, lower physical activity, diet quality and socioeconomic status (SES) across the life course, and lower adult CRF were associated with persistently low muscular power. Lower adult protein intake and an increase in adiposity over time were associated with decreasing muscular power. An increase in fat-free mass was associated with a reduced probability of decreasing or persistently high muscular power and an increased probability of increasing muscular power. Higher adult fruit intake was associated with increasing muscular power. Lower adiposity across the life course, higher adult CRF and SES, and higher child protein intake were associated with persistently high muscular power.

Conclusion

Healthy weight, good CRF, greater protein intake, and high SES are important correlates of high muscular power maintained from childhood to adulthood.

### Jump power and force have distinct associations with cortical bone parameters: findings from a population enriched by individuals with high bone mass [^efe4db7d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Little is known of the relationships between muscle function and bone, based on the recently developed technique of jumping mechanography.

Objective

Our objective was to determine associations between peak ground reaction force and peak power during a 1-legged hopping test and a single 2-legged jump, respectively, and cortical bone parameters.

Design and Setting

This was a cross-sectional observational study in participants from the high bone mass cohort.

Participants

Participants included 70 males (mean age 58 years) and 119 females (mean age 56 years); high bone mass cases and controls were pooled.

Main Outcome Measures

Total hip bone mineral density (BMD) (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning) and mid-tibial peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Stratec XCT2000L).

Results

Jump power was positively related to hip BMD (standardized β [95% confidence interval] = 0.29 [0.07, 0.51], P = 0.01), but hopping force was not (0.03 [-0.16, 0.22], P = 0.74) (linear regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight). In 113 participants with force and peripheral quantitative computed tomography data, both jump power and hopping force were positively associated with tibial strength strain index (0.26 [0.09, 0.44], P < .01; and 0.24 [0.07, 0.42], P = 0.01 respectively). Although hopping force was positively associated with bone size (total bone area 0.22 [0.03, 0.42], P = 0.02), jump power was not (0.10 [-0.10, 0.30], P = 0.33). In contrast, jump power was inversely associated with endocortical circumference adjusted for periosteal circumference (-0.24 [-0.40, -0.08], P < .01) whereas no association was seen for hopping force (-0.10 [-0.26, 0.07], P = 0.24).

Conclusions

Although power and force are both positively associated with cortical bone strength, distinct mechanisms appear to be involved because power was primarily associated with reduced endocortical expansion (reflected by endocortical circumference adjusted for periosteal circumference, and hip BMD), whereas force was associated with increased periosteal expansion (reflected by total bone area).

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Capturing and reporting athlete exposure

Assessing exposure is fundamental to quantifying injury and illness risk in sport. There are many ways to quantify athletic exposure and no single measure will suit all surveillance settings and research questions. The choice of exposure measures is heavily influenced by sport-specific and contextual factors, as well as which types of health problems are of interest. Therefore, it is often necessary to record exposure in several ways.

Tracking exposure for injury analyses

For injuries, exposure is generally quantified as the time during which athletes are at risk of injury (eg, minutes played), distance covered or a count of the number of specified events (eg, tackles, throws or jumps). In some sports, exposure is commonly expressed as the number of athletic participations (eg, games, races, training sessions), often referred to as 'athletic exposures'. Table 2 in online supplementary appendix 1 provides a range of examples of exposure measures used.

In team sports, we recommend recording exposure for each individual within a team rather than merely estimating the number of matches the team plays and match duration (team exposure), because the former permits the researcher to examine individual risk factors. Results of all the individuals are then summed to provide exposure at the sport or team level.

As injury risk is often markedly different between training and competition, these exposures should be recorded and reported separately. To do this consistently, it is necessary to define competition and training, and to consider situations where applying the definition may be challenging.

We define competition as organised scheduled play between opposing athletes or teams of athletes, or athlete(s) competing (i) against time and/or (ii) to obtain a score (judged or measured).

We define training as physical activities performed by the athlete that are aimed at maintaining or improving their skills, physical condition and/or performance in their sport.

In many sports, it is common to simulate competition as a part of training. Examples include preseason 'friendly scrimmages' between two teams or dividing a single squad into teams that compete against each other. In general, this should be counted as training exposure. Additionally, activities such as warm up and cool down should be counted separately and reported as training injuries, even if occurring around competition.

It is likely that in some sports, these definitions will not be fully applicable. In such cases, we encourage sport-specific consensus groups to define what constitutes competition and training in that sport.

Item 7: Give the total number of included studies and participants, and summarise relevant characteristics of studies.

Example: 'Twenty studies comprising 2375 injuries from 1234 athletes (all males and mean age of 24 years) from different sports were included. Internal (65%) and external loads (70%) were collected in more than half of the studies and the session-rating of perceived exertion and total distance were the most commonly collected metrics. The acute chronic workload ratio was commonly calculated using the coupled method (95%), 1:4 weekly blocks (95%) and subsequent week injury lag (80%). There were 14 different binning methods with almost none of the studies using the same binning categories'.
Item 8: Present results for main outcomes, preferably indicating the number of included studies and participants for each. If meta-analysis was done, report the summary estimate and confidence/credible interval. If comparing groups, indicate the direction of the effect (ie, which group is favoured).

Example: 'Overall, 42.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18%, 69%) of patients passed return to sport (RTS) criteria, and 14.4% (95% CI: 8%, 21%) of those who passed experienced a second ACL injury (graft rupture or contralateral ACL injury). There was a nonsignificant 3% reduced risk of a second ACL injury after passing RTS criteria (risk difference, −3%; 95% CI: −16%, 10%; I² = 74%, p = 0.61)'.
Item 9: Provide a brief summary of the limitations of the evidence included in the review (eg, study risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision).

Example: 'The evidence rating of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation scale was 'very low certainty' due to imprecision and heterogeneity of the pooled risk difference estimate'.

Coaches awareness

A questionnaire comprising of five distinct domains was developed to assess youth sports coaches' current knowledge regarding guidelines for sports volume recommendations. It will be used as coaches awareness questionnaire.

Parent awareness

To assess parents' knowledge of sports volume recommendations and examine their perceptions of sports specialisation, parent awareness questionnairewill be used.

Physical fitness assessment

The secondary outcome includes physical fitness assessment, which contains different tests to assess upper-body muscular fitness, lower-body muscular fitness, flexibility, power and agility.

Push-up test

The assessment of upper-body muscular fitness will employ this test. The participants' hands and feet will be situated on the floor in a plank position, with the body stretched out and feet spaced apart. Their hands will be aligned below the shoulder line. Participants will be instructed to maintain a 90° angle between the arm and forearm and will be required to return to the initial position. The test involved repeating the action of completing 20 push-ups within 1 min. The results will be determined by totalling all the performances of the participants.

Horizontal jump

The assessment of lower-body muscular fitness involves a horizontal jump test. To initiate the test, the participants will stand upright, with their feet slightly apart and aligned with their shoulders, positioned just behind a marked line on the floor. The test required participants to leap forward, striving to cover the maximum possible distance and land with their feet touching together. The distance between the starting line and the heel of the backward foot will be recorded for scoring purposes.

Vertical jump

The evaluation will start with the participants standing sideways on a wall and extending their arms upwards to trace the initial line on the wall. Participants leapt as high as they could with their knees slightly bent and feet slightly spaced below the shoulder line. On landing, the participant touches a second line on the wall using chalk. Scoring will be determined by calculating the variation between both lines: the standing-reach height and jumping-reach height.

Sit and reach the test

To assess the versatility of the lumbar spine muscles and hamstrings, the individuals engaged in forward flexion of the torso with extended arms and an extended leg, making contact with the sole on the measurement box. Measurements in centimetres will be calculated and considered for data analysis.
