## Question

James opens up a flower shop. He needs to pay rent of $1200 a week with an additional 20% of rent to pay for utilities and he has 2 employees per shift with the store open 16 hours a day for 5 days a week. If he pays each employee $12.50 an hour, what are his weekly expenses to run the store?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about James's weekly expenses to run his flower shop, including rent, utilities, and employee wages. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fixed weekly rent. Then, I should verify the utility cost as a percentage of rent. Next, I will calculate total weekly employee hours and multiply by the hourly wage. Finally, I will sum rent, utilities, and wages to get the total weekly expenses, making sure I double-check each step for arithmetic accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the fixed rent cost. The weekly rent is explicitly stated as $1,200, so that is straightforward and does not require calculation [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the utilities calculation. The problem states utilities are an additional 20% of rent, so I should multiply the rent by 0.20 to get the weekly utility cost. $1,200 × 0.20 equals $240 per week for utilities, which seems correct at first glance [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the employee cost logic before I multiply. The store is open 16 hours per day for 5 days, which is 80 hours per week of operation. With 2 employees per shift, that is 2 × 80 = 160 employee-hours per week. At $12.50 per hour, the weekly wage cost is 160 × $12.50, which equals $2,000. I initially thought "per shift" might imply something different, but the math holds if both employees work the full shift length each day the store is open, so I will proceed with $2,000 per week for wages [^notfound].

> I will now examine the total weekly expenses by summing the components. Rent is $1,200, utilities are $240, and wages are $2,000, so total weekly expenses are $1,200 + $240 + $2,000 = $3,440. Let me double-check the addition: 1,200 + 240 is 1,440, and 1,440 + 2,000 is indeed 3,440, so the total is correct [^notfound].

> Final answer: James's weekly expenses to run the store are $3,440, comprising $1,200 rent, $240 utilities, and $2,000 in employee wages [^notfound].

---

James's weekly expenses are **$3,440**. This includes $1,200 rent, $240 utilities (20% of rent), and $2,000 for employee wages (2 employees × 16 hours/day × 5 days × $12.50/hour). There are **no other weekly expenses** specified in the problem.

---

## Rent and utilities

Rent is **$1,200 per week**. Utilities are **20% of rent**, which equals $1,200 × 0.20 = **$240 per week**.

---

## Employee wages

- **Hours per employee per week**: 16 hours/day × 5 days = 80 hours/week
- **Total hours for 2 employees**: 80 hours × 2 = 160 hours/week
- **Hourly wage**: $12.50/hour
- **Total weekly wages**: 160 hours × $12.50/hour = **$2,000**

---

## Total weekly expenses

| **Expense category** | **Amount** |
|-|-|
| Rent | $1,200 |
| Utilities (20% of rent) | $240 |
| Employee wages | $2,000 |
| Total weekly expenses | $3,440 |

---

James's total weekly expenses to run the store are **$3,440**.

### How do people who smoke perceive a tobacco retail outlet reduction policy in aotearoa new zealand? A qualitative analysis [^d0b76826]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Responding to retail disruptions

Many participants expected they themselves would adjust to the changes by purchasing tobacco in bulk (eg, buying a week's supply at once or increasing their pouch size), yet felt concerned stocking up could lead them to smoke more. Nicolas commented: "You know, a lot of the time I look inside my pouch of tobacco and go, 'Oh… I need to make it last several more days because I don't want to spend the money just yet'. But if it's right there, I'm not even gonna notice. I'm gonna… smoke two weeks' worth in a week and a half." However, some felt cost constraints would limit their ability to purchase in bulk. Tui commented: "I do have a restraint on me as far as that goes. Like, if I run out of cigarettes in a week, well, that's it. You know… I never ever feel good about having to buy a second pack of cigarettes and usually I don't have that money there anyway." Some expected to budget more carefully and monitor their tobacco use to last a full shopping cycle. Whina commented: "I'm a bit of a pre-planner. Before I even run out of cigarettes, I like to make sure I've got another packet. So now it just means for me, that I'd have to budget my cigarettes for the week… if I'm having to buy them at the supermarket, so I'm not having to keep going back."

### Public mental health-a challenge for local communities and research [^294b8447]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The resources mentioned so far already exist and just need utilizing and promoting to strengthen their benefit for public mental health. Other resources in form of supportive interactions in the community can be established but need new initiatives to be set up. Here are a few examples:

In most parts of the world the population is aging, and an increasing number of retired people suffer from social isolation. Some of them cannot continue in their original profession but may be available for local activities on a flexible part-time basis, possibly only for a few hours per week. That resource may be used to provide local childcare for young families which otherwise would not exist or be very expensive. Such an arrangement can provide meaningful and feasible occupation for the elderly, help to overcome their isolation with wide-ranging physical and mental health benefits (Choi, Irwin, & Cho,), foster intergenerational contacts and community cohesion, and facilitate raising children in the light of low birth rates in most parts of the world.

In rural areas, communities can run community shops and community pubs which bring people together, make them share a task, create collaboration, provide a sense of common success, and promote interactions that may help to prevent and overcome mental distress.

In urban areas, simple parklets can increase the chance that people pause and talk with each other. More ambitious projects are the establishment of blocks of a few streets with limited through traffic, enhanced green space, reduced air pollution, and the provision of most required amenities, such as the 'superilles' in Barcelona or the 'Kiezblocks' in Berlin (Palència et al.). They help people to spend time in public spaces and engage in interactions and relationships. Some of these interactions are likely to provide direct emotional and practical support. Others may help to establish networks of various flexible and loose relationships, in the sense of the 'weak ties' that in sociology have been suggested as a central resource for people already 50 years ago (Granovetter). Weak ties widen the options for exchange, for further contacts, and for both providing and finding variable support when needed (Collins, Hagerty, Quoidbach, Norton, & Brooks; Moreton, Kelly, & Sandstrom).

### Participation needs of older adults having disabilities and receiving home care: MET needs mainly concern daily activities, while unmet needs mostly involve social activities [^61dd6a39]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Moreover, needs for social activities were rarely fulfilled, especially for activities of community life and interpersonal relationships domains of participation (Table 4). Nevertheless, a median of five participants had fulfilled needs in the responsibilities domain. Hence, most needs related to personal and financial responsibilities were fulfilled by caregivers as mentioned by this woman who assumed her husband's personal choices: "We don't share [decisions] like we used to. I make all the decisions, I take charge of everything" [C08]. In that other case, the older man's needs to go shopping were compensated through respite periods, which allowed his wife to realize this important activity in community: "If I don't have time to get groceries and run errands during the week, I do it those days. And I take a couple of hours to go shopping for him" [C07]. Finally, this older man described having relaxing activities, which he did mostly by himself at home: "I love to read and watch television. I also have my flowers, which I water. I have a green thumb" [A05]. However, needs to participate in leisure were generally more rarely satisfied.

### Why do people purchase antibiotics over-the-counter? A qualitative study with patients, clinicians and dispensers in central, Eastern and Western Nepal [^14fee958]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In Nepal, with limited healthcare coverage and a high burden of infectious diseases, seeking OTC medication is a common practice. This is largely driven by accessibility, costs, time and the quality of services at formal healthcare centres. Drug shops offer convenient and approachable health services for patients, where poor-quality care is compensated by the minimal direct, indirect and opportunity costs, and ease of access. Clients often receive inappropriately short treatment courses (usually of 2–3 days) at drug shops and are advised to visit doctors/hospitals if not cured.

OTC dispensing and its implications

Drug shops are a recognised part of health system infrastructure in LMICs, including Nepal. They reach a large population, offering an immediate and cost-effective service through OTC medication. Drug shops are often run by under-qualified non-professionals, such as non-pharmacists, which can lead to sub-optimal care and undesired outcomes for patients. Dispensers' lack of follow-up and advice to visit doctors if not cured has several ramifications. This practice ostensibly encourages patients/customers to visit doctors, but it also acts as a safety net for dispensers to avoid accountability for the prognosis and the adverse outcomes of the medicine sold. If patients/customers recover, the drug shops and the drug dispensers gain easy goodwill; if not, their advice to visit doctors simply insulates them from patients' or their familys' complaints.

Patients' visits and interactions at drug shops resemble retail transactions. Patients used past medicine strips or blisters, old prescriptions, name of the medicines, and symptoms as hints to prompt pharmacists or drug dispensers to sell specific medicines. Financial incentives to dispensers also played a role in dispensing practices to the extent that particular medicines sometimes exceeded patients or customers' needs (such as selling multiple antibiotics, stronger and expensive antibiotics). Representatives from pharmaceutical companies were recognised as playing a role here: they incentivise to increase the sale of their particular brands of drugs.

Dispensers' lack of competence was a major concern among clinicians and (other) dispensers. Most drug shops, particularly in rural Nepal, are run by unqualified personnel (non-pharmacists) who learn during their work and operate using someone else's license (which is generally displayed on the drugstore wall) or have no license at all.

### "You obviously just have to put on a brave face": a qualitative study of the experiences and coping styles of men with rheumatoid arthritis [^e6c53bbc]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Destructive behaviors

In an attempt to get on with their lives despite their RA, some men discussed pushing themselves to their limits, while disregarding any consequences: "I will work all day and then wonder the next day why I can't use my hands… and my knees have had it" (Edward). "… I feel you've got to finish the task" (Ron). Some men reported using exercise as a way to vent frustration and anger. This was sometimes at the expense of putting strain on the body and joints: "I use [running] as a way of getting rid of the frustration and the anger; I just run and run and run until I can't run anymore… I just feel like just punishing myself. I know I shouldn't because I know I'm going to pay for it in the long run" (Steve). Risk‐taking behaviors were also discussed, such as skipping medication to accommodate their social life and drinking more alcohol than recommended with their medication: "If I'm going out, like the weekend, I don't take one methotrexate that week. I know slap on the wrist there" (Steve). "[Rheumatologist] said you can drink, as long as it's within moderation… well, I'm going on holiday in 6 weeks' time. I mean, what do you go on holiday for? To get drunk and fall down" (Will).

Social withdrawal

Some men reported dealing with the emotional aspects of their RA by avoiding people: "I live on my own… so I can rattle around, chuck stuff and just be thoroughly frustrated and just lay in bed all day" (Steve). Social involvement could also be withdrawn due to no longer feeling able to join in with activities. Some men appeared black and white in their thinking and were therefore unable to consider ways to replace lost activities: "I've lost my social life as it is now, because I don't go out playing pool, I don't go out playing golf, which are the two main things I done" (John). "… I gave up going to pubs completely because I just didn't feel right going into a pub and having soft drinks" (Mike).

### A population-based survey of the workplace costs for caregivers of persons with treatment-resistant depression compared with other health conditions [^536cb972]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To assess the direct costs of caregiving, questions asked about the amount of time spent on specific caregiving role demands and out-of-pocket expenses related to caregiving. The sum of the two amounts was the total direct cost. Time spent caregiving was based on responses to a modified version of the validated Family Experiences Interview Schedule (FEIS)asking, during the past 4 weeks, how much of the time did you help with grooming, bathing, or dressing; taking medicine; doing housework or laundry; shopping for groceries, clothes, and other things; cooking or helping with preparing meals; providing transportation or using public transportation; managing money; encouraging him/her to go to work, school or aftercare, or visit with friends; The responses were: (1) not at all; (2) less than once a week; (3) one or two times a week; (4) three to six times a week; or (5) every day. Responses were converted to hours as follows: not at all = 0; less than once a week = 0.5 hours; one or two times a week = 1.5 hours; three to six times a week = 4.5 hours; every day = 7 hours. Hours were converted to annualized costs by multiplying the number of weekly hours by $25 per hour and 52 weeks.

Results

Fifteen individuals were invited to participate, but five (33.3%) declined the invitation due to conflicting agenda. Therefore, 10 participants signed the informed consent form and were included in this study. The participants were: one sports physician (10%); two physiotherapists (20%); two exercise and sports sciences practitioners (ie, running trainers; 20%); two researchers from the biomechanics field (20%); two recreational runners (20%); and one stakeholder who was the owner of a health-related shop (10%). A total of three face-to-face meetings held between February and March 2018 were required to cover all IM steps. These meetings had an average duration of 2.5 hours with an average interval of 4 weeks between the meetings. The outcomes elicited during the focus group meetings can be found in online supplemental appendices D–G. All participants collaborated directly to the design of the running-related injury prevention programme, and all had the opportunity to revise the proposed final product in the last focus group meeting, when the research group presented the prototype to the participants encouraging an open discussion on the matter.

This includes all cancer-relevant genes.

2. The volume of testing: presuming a TAT of 1–2 weeks and a minimum of 1 run per week, an accurate assessment of the laboratory's average working volume throughout the year is vital for allocation of resources and choice of testing platform. Clinical factors impacting on this such as introduction of new surgical services must be anticipated through a management structure.

3. The size of the runs: tightly related to the previous point. A chip with capacity for 20 cases may be more affordable per case than a chip of 12 samples. However, if a lab has 9–12 cases per week, and runs a chip per week for TAT purposes, then a 12 sample chip may be more cost-effective (Figure 4).

4. The technology: different platforms may need different up-front costs, and many have different running costs.

5. The minimum DNA requirement: Diagnostic practices with resection specimens are likely to yield significant DNA content per sample, and thus the minimum DNA concentration threshold necessary to run the test is easily achieved. However, in small biopsy or cytology samples total DNA may be limiting, with larger numbers of cases deemed inadequate. This is an important consideration for overall laboratory budgeting, because the number of fails and need to maintain accreditation for single-gene orthogonal tests can make the overall cost of NGS testing significantly more expensive.

6. The availability of a clinical reporting bioinformatics system: discussed with validation below.

### Effect of financial incentives and default options on food choices of adults with low income in online retail settings: a randomized clinical trial [^b4fa42df]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Despite recent growth in online redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, no previous work has tested the impact of economic and behavioral economic strategies on food purchasing behaviors in an online grocery retail setting among adults with low income.

Objective

To examine the extent to which financial incentives and default shopping cart options influence fruit and vegetable purchases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial used an experimental online grocery store for adults who currently or have ever received SNAP benefits. From October 7 to December 2, 2021, participants were instructed to shop for a week's worth of groceries for their household, with a budget tailored to household size; no payment was taken.

Interventions

Random assignment to 1 of 4 conditions: no intervention, 50% discount on eligible fruits and vegetables, prefilled shopping carts with tailored fruit and vegetable items (ie, default options), or a combination of the discount and default options.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage of nondiscounted dollars spent on eligible fruit and vegetables per basket.

Results

Of 2744 participants, mean (SD) age was 46.7 (16.0) years, and 1447 (52.7%) identified as women. A total of 1842 participants (67.1%) reported currently receiving SNAP benefits and 1492 (54.4%) reported shopping online for groceries in the previous 12 months. Participants spent a mean (SD) 20.5% (23.5%) of total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables. Compared with no intervention, those in the discount condition spent 4.7% (98.3% CI, 1.7%-7.7%) of more total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables; those in the default condition, 7.8% (98.3% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) more; and those in the combination condition, 13.0% (98.3% CI, 10.0%-16.0%) more (P < .001 for all). There was no difference between the discount and the default conditions (P = 0.06), but the effect in the combination condition was significantly larger than both discount and default conditions (P < .001). Default shopping cart items were purchased by 679 participants (93.4%) in the default condition and 655 (95.5%) in the combination condition, whereas 297 (45.8%) in the control and 361 (52.9%) in the discount conditions purchased those items (P < .001). No variation was observed by age, sex, or race and ethnicity, and results were similar when those who reported never shopping online for groceries were excluded.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, financial incentives for fruits and vegetables and default options, especially in combination, led to meaningful increases in online fruit and vegetable purchases among adults with low income.

### Assessing the value of integrating national longitudinal shopping data into respiratory disease forecasting models [^09ee8d47]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To assess whether the PADRUS model created was valuable, two baseline models were created. The first, baseline, was created using the same methodology; a random forest regressor optimized using a time series cross-validation grid-search on training data. The baseline performed the same task of predicting weekly respiratory deaths 17 days in advance for each of the 314 LTLA areas in England from 18th March 2016 to 27th March 2020. Data was stratified using the same splits on the training and test data (45,844 training data points, 20,410 test data points), and model predictions on the held out test data were scored using RMSE, MAE and R 2. The only difference between PADRUS and the baseline model is its feature inputs, with the baseline inputs consisted of only: the week number (1 to 52) for a dynamic input, and secondly the static input of the population of over 65s in each LTLA. The first feature was chosen because of the known seasonality of deaths by respiratory disease, yet used alone the prediction accuracy levels were very low. Therefore the second feature was chosen due to the assumption that the size and age of population would greatly influence the number of deaths, with 90% of deaths from respiratory disease in Europe occurring in those aged 65 and over. The second comparative model, PADRUNOS, was formed in exactly the same way, and used the exact same features as PADRUS except any that related to sales data (see §4.4.5)

Variable importance analyses

In order to understand the impact of the different features driving predictions in the PADRUS model, we conducted a range variable importance analyses. First standard permutation importance was used to score of each feature in producing the model's predictions, relaying the expected increase in error after the a features contents are randomly shuffled. Second, a SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Analysiswas conducted. SHAP carries out a more complex calculation of feature importance, with the Kernel Explainer SHAP tool used in this analysis applying weighted linear regression to determine the importance of each feature based on Shapley values, as derived from game theory. Both tools were applied to the training data set on an arbitrary instance of the PADRUS model. The SHAP analysis is computationally expensive approach and therefore was run on two random samples of data points of 100 and 1000. This enabled a comparison of results between sample sizes to ensure a large enough sample had been evaluated.

### Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis and planning for the future [^7ea31762]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 AND THE U.S. ECONOMY

In early to mid-March, many U.S. state and local governments started implementing temporary restrictions on public life and nonessential work in an attempt to decrease the spread of the virus, leading to a temporary economic shutdown. Accordingly, U.S. economic output declined sharply and drastically for quarter 1 of 2020, with real gross domestic product decreasing at an annual rate of 5.0%. Simultaneously, the number of people filing for unemployment increased rapidly, reaching 43 million by the end of the second week in May. The unemployment rate increased from 3.5% in February to 14.7% in April, which, when considering all workers placed on temporary layoff, could have been as high as 22%. Simultaneously, U.S. retail sales declined by 16.4% (∼$80 billion) in April as compared with March 2020. In early May, the U.S. government started to place increasing emphasis on the necessary economic recovery from the COVID-19–related temporary shutdown. Given uncertainties about the further spread of COVID-19, it is not surprising that predictions about the shape and speed of economic recovery in the United States vary among experts and are adjusted continuously. For instance, predictions about the decline of real gross domestic product at an annual rate for quarter 2 of 2020 are in the range of 25%–40%, with an estimated growth of −5.6% for all of 2020 as compared with 2019. Of note, in the United States, consumer demand for goods and services has been a key element of economic growth over the past 50 years. Accordingly, as long as consumer confidence remains low, at least in part because of uncertainty about employment and health status, economic recovery will remain sluggish. In a recent survey among global business chief financial officers (91% from the United States), participants from all industries expressed less (!) optimism about the state of the economy and the financial prospects of their own company than during quarter 1 of 2020, and 60% did not expect a return to near-normal operating levels until sometime in 2021. In another survey among global business executives, only 48% of participants from North America expected a moderate or substantial improvement in the economy. The Congressional Budget Office projects a robust uptick in economic growth for the second half of 2020. Nevertheless, it may take until the end of 2021 or beyond for real gross domestic product to recover to pre–COVID-19 levels. Finally, global supply chains could be disrupted for an extended period.

VA/DoD asthma guideline — HEPA filters and classroom IPM: In Phipatanakul et al. 2021, asthma-related healthcare utilization (sum of unscheduled clinic visits, emergency department visits, and overnight hospitalizations) showed no statistically significant differences, including school IPM (IRR: 0.94 [0.38 to 2.31]) and classroom HEPA filters. Across pulmonary function studies, Fong et al. 2023 reported no significant differences in FEV1, FVC, or FEV1:FVC between intervention and sham filters; Vesper et al. 2023 described no significant differences in average FEV1 percentile before versus after intervention; and Phipatanakul et al. 2021 found no significant mean differences in FEV1 mean percent predicted or FEV1:FVC mean ratio with IPM or HEPA. Quality of life analyses showed no between-group AQLQ differences in Fong et al. 2023 and no significant differences between HEPA and "dummy" treatments in James et al. 2020. The guideline interprets that HEPA filters and NO2 filters have no significant improvements in asthma control, exacerbations, health-care utilization, objective lung function measures, or quality of life, and can only be obtained at personal cost.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5204208e]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider that when some medications are prescribed and adhered to, healthcare spending declines by lowering emergency admissions. Eleven such medications reduce emergency admissions by hundreds of thousands annually. These drugs essentially displace a non-genericizable service with a genericizable medicine, a logical way to save money in the long run, and yet, if one only scrutinizes the drug's temporary branded cost without considering the alternative of forever relying on emergency department services to manage patients, society could easily end up misallocating resources away from developing such a medicine. Reasons for not performing value assessments on hospital procedures may include a lack of randomized controlled trial data which are important inputs into cost-effectiveness analyses. However, this and other reasons are not insurmountable, and real-world data can provide important information on the effectiveness of an intervention potentially through time series analyses if comparators are not obvious. Comprehending the potential cost-effectiveness of all varieties of healthcare interventions is paramount for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare systems and optimizing the health of populations.

### SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens are detected in continuous air samples from congregate settings [^7692d6a6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Extending the duration of continuous air sampling

Daily air surveillance programs are resource-intensive and expensive. To reduce the cost and complexity of surveillance programs, we tested the feasibility of extending the sampling interval while maintaining the detection sensitivity of daily testing. Over the course of five weeks, two adjacent AerosolSense instruments were deployed to either run continuously (~168 h) or daily (~24 h) over several days. Air samples were gathered throughout the week, nucleic acids were isolated simultaneously, and tested with two RT-qPCR Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2. During the first week of sampling, both air samplers detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA, showing continuous air sampling for a week captured similar copies of viral RNA, determined by Ct values, when compared to more resource-intensive daily sampling (Fig. 2). Weekly and daily air sample results were concordant for the next two weeks; air samples were either negative or inconclusive. Continuous air samples were negative for the last two weeks, while daily sampling identified one inconclusive sample during each of these weeks. However, each of the inconclusive samples had N1 Ct values > 40 and high N2 Ct values of 39.1 and 39.4, respectively. This suggests that congregate settings can use either daily or weekly sampling to balance cost and turnaround time while maintaining detection sensitivity.

Fig. 2
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR results from continuous and daily air sampling intervals.

Two adjacent Thermo Scientific AerosolSense instruments were run continuously or daily over several days. SARS-CoV-2 genomic material was detected by two separate RT-qPCR CDC assays. If the cycle threshold values of one or both N1 and N2 assays were less than 40, the Ct values are shown in the box separated by a "|". "Undet." was used for assays that had Ct values greater than 40. If the Ct values of both RT-qPCR assays were greater than 40, the boxes are labeled as "Neg". Samples considered to be positive are shaded red. Boxes shaded in gray are either inconclusive or negative, marked "Neg".

### Equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals: how much might it cost to achieve basic surge capacity? [^fc7bd16e]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The ability to deliver optimal medical care in the setting of a disaster event, regardless of its cause, will in large part be contingent on an immediately available supply of key medical equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals. Although the Department of Health and Human Services Strategic National Stockpile program makes these available through its 12-hour "push packs" and vendor-managed inventory, every local community should be funded to create a local cache for these items. This report explores the funding requirements for this suggested approach. Furthermore, the response to a surge in demand for care will be contingent on keeping available staff close to the hospitals for a sustained period. A proposal for accomplishing this, with associated costs, is discussed as well.

Miscellaneous and generous incentives

Contracts also commonly incentivise retailers with monetary rewards or vouchers. The reported cash equivalence for retailer incentives varied greatly between $20/month in urban US cities in 1991and $20 000/year reported in 2001 in the USA, with one study reporting the median incentive value at $930/year in the USA between 2013 and 2014. Contractual relationships also provided retailers with professional support or education from manufacturers in the USA and Australia. This included one-on-one meetings, help with designing and merchandising new stores, and off-site events to educate the retailers on new products available and how to best promote them. Generous incentives were given to well-preforming retailers in the UK, Australia and, the USA. These included tickets for sports, music, and movie events; lavish parties in which tobacco products were promoted and gifted to guests and staff; and once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as paddle boarding around glaciers, driving Lamborghinis and Ferraris, travelling to Fiji on all-expenses paid trips to view tobacco growing and manufacturing, and sweepstakes to win a Cadillac.

Manufacturer control and retailer compliance

Three-quarters of the retailers interviewed in one US study reported that manufacturers were in complete control of their tobacco displays and promotional materials. A retailer in another US study described the interaction with a manufacturer representative, reporting, 'it's almost like it's not my store… I was overwhelmed, she [the representative] walks in one day and throws some books on my counter and tells me, "I'll tell you what you are going to do"'.
According to an interview in one US study, most retailers participate in multiple incentive programmes. In multiple studies, contracts were viewed as necessary evils for US retailers to stay in business, with one retailer reporting, 'We don't make a lot of money on cigarettes but we make a lot of money on displays'.or this reason, retailers upheld contracts even though they were controlling and demanding'.hey're trying to control my business,' a retailer reported in one study, and, 'It's not an offer, it's a mandatory thing. It has to be the way they want it,' reported another.

### The burden of neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a patient's perspective [^8240bc9b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

The most significant barriers to treatment adherence identified were the frequency and travel times associated with intravitreal injections. Many patients acknowledged the high number of other medical appointments they must manage due to other comorbidities related to aging. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n = 76, 74%), osteoarthritis (n = 37, 36%), and depression (n = 16, 16%). Total appointments/injections within a 12-month period were 10.4 ± 0.8, and the mean travel time for ophthalmic appointments was 1.2 ± 0.7 hours in each direction.

The loss of productivity of the patient amounted to 4.4 ± 1.7 hours per visit, amounting to a cost of $186.30 ± $71.90 among those still working. Furthermore, patients may need up to a day of recovery after an intravitreal injection, which results in further work-time loss among employed patients, as well as careers, who patients rely heavily on to get them to and from injection appointments. The caregivers reported the time they spent accompanying the patient to their medical appointments specifically for intravitreal injections took an average of 6.2 ± 1.1 hours per month, which equates to a loss of $262.45 ± $46.60 in income based on the national average hourly wage. Additionally, caregivers reported the time given to various activities in the daily life of the patient. This included time spent on household assistance and such tasks as grocery shopping, amounting to 4.3 ± 3.2 hours per week or a cost of $782.10 ± $135.50 per week. Table 2 summarizes direct and indirect medical costs.

### The cost-effectiveness of a novel online social therapy to maintain treatment effects from first-episode psychosis services: results from the horyzons randomized controlled trial [^126ddc79]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

We calculated costs by multiplying volumes of health services by related unit costs (Supplementary Table 2). Where appropriate, we asked participants how long each consultation with the health professional was, their mode of transport to make a return journey from home to each health care provider, whether they were accompanied by someone, and the estimated out-of-pocket costs. We obtained unit costs for different resources from the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) for health professional visits and diagnostic tests (using a weighted average cost paid by the government), and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for medication. We accessed online Australian retail pharmacy sites to determine patient costs for other medications and supplements not covered by the PBS. The National Hospital Cost Data Collection Cost Report (Round 18) was used for hospital stays and emergency department visits; the same report was sourced to cost specialized mental health services based on nonadmitted services (Tier 2) that included outpatient community services. For hospital stays and emergency department visits, we applied different unit costs depending on whether the reason for the visit was mental health-related (based on reasons provided in the RUQ). Unit costs for other services, such as financial advice or vocational guidance were obtained from the National Disability Insurance Scheme pricing agreement; some professionals costs were based on national employee earnings. Travel costs were calculated according to the type of transport used (eg, car, public transport, and taxi) and a 20 km return trip was assumed. The use of ambulances was costed separately. Time costs were calculated based on the average length of each visit reported in the RUQ in addition to travel time, which was assumed to be 30 min. An assumption was made that visits to health professionals occurred outside the working hours for patients that engaged in formal employment. Time costs were valued at 25% of the average wage rate to represent the value of participants' lost leisure time. The same unit cost was used to value the time cost of the person accompanying the participant to the visits, where applicable. We based productivity costs on the number of days participants were absent from work and valued those using the human capital approach, because recommended. Thereby, lost working hours were multiplied by the average hourly wage rate. Unpaid and volunteer work were valued at 25% of the average wage rate. All-costs are presented in Australian Dollars (AUD) for the 2014 reference year; unit costs reported for other years were adjusted for inflation using industry-specific indices. Discounting of 5% was applied to all-costs occurring beyond 1 year. The impact inventory provided in Supplementary Table 3 outlines the details of cost components by the respective perspective adopted.

### Review on the update in obesity management: epidemiology [^4df3b981]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Calorie imbalance: intake versus expenditure

It is common for individuals to underestimate their daily caloric intake and overestimate the number of calories they burn during physical activity. The imbalance of calorie intake and energy expenditure most individuals experience is the main reason obesity is such a common and difficult disease to manage. A typical 50-year-old man who measures 5′8″, weighs 200 lbs and has a BMI of 30.4 requires 2090 calories per day to maintain their weight, assuming they have a sedentary lifestyle. To lose one pound per week, this individual would have to consume 75% of their daily requirements (1590 cal/day). To lose two pounds per week or approximately 1 kg, the individual would have to reduce their intake by almost 50% (1090 cal/day). This is a significant reduction from this individual's original daily calorie intake. Therefore, individuals may be unaware how much of a reduction in calories are required to achieve a small weight change. An average 50-year-old woman measuring 5′3″, weighing 178 pounds with a BMI of 30 and a sedentary lifestyle requires less caloric intake to maintain her weight. She needs to consume 1676 cal/day to maintain her weight while a male requires 2090 cal/day. To lose one pound a week, this individual has to reduce her calorie intake by 30% to 1176 cal/day. She would have to reduce her intake by 60% to 676 cal/day to lose two pounds a week.

Not only do individuals overestimate their daily calorie requirement, but they also underestimate the number of calories their food contains and the amount of physical activity required to burn off these calories. For instance, a big Mac Trio, which includes a Big Mac hamburger, medium fries and a large soft drink, contains 1100 calories. This is 59% of the daily caloric requirements for an average 50-year-old man and 74% of the daily caloric intake for a 50-year-old woman. The amount of exercise required to expend 1000 calories is significant. Examples include running vigorously for 70 min, walking for 5 hours at a brisk pace or cycling at 14 mph for 70 min. The disparity between calorie intake and energy expenditure makes obesity a particularly challenging condition to address.

### Study protocol of a 52-week prospective running INjury study in gothenburg (SPRING) [^21ee1db8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Running is one of the most popular forms of physical exercise among able-bodied individuals on a global scale. Millions of people across Europe run regularly, with proportions reported as 29% in Denmark, 25% in Germany, 19% in Belgium, 17% in Sweden, 14% in Finland and 12% in the Netherlands. Interestingly, the popularity of running has increased tremendously in the past decades, which is demonstrated in part by the growing amount of running eventsand increasing number of runners completing road races, such as 5 km, 10 km, half-marathon and marathon distances. The increase in popularity is in contrast to other sports, for example soccer and handball, which have been experiencing a decline in the proportion of athletes over the last few years. Running is characterised by its nature of simplicity, the opportunity to exercise whenever and wherever suitable and the relatively low cost. These characteristics makes running advantageous to other sports requiring fixed training days and more expensive equipment. Major reasons for running as a primary exercise modality include, but are not limited to, increased physical and/or psychological well-being, weight loss, self-development, performance enhancement and social interaction. From a health perspective, physical exercise, including running, offers substantial benefits, such as reduced risk of several metabolic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, pulmonary and neurological diseases compared with a sedentary behaviour. Consequently, the public health gains of keeping runners active should not be underestimated.

### Seed dispersal by martu peoples promotes the distribution of native plants in arid Australia [^9344fb47]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

On return to their homelands, Martu reinvigorated their customary subsistence and landscape burning practices, and many remote-living families continue to maintain fundamental aspects of their foraging livelihoods, typically spending about 25% of their days in hunting or gathering activities. People often go out foraging on day trips to various locales, which includes establishing a temporary 'dinner camp' for the purpose of bush food preparation, cooking and consumption. We have previously reported quantitative details of foraging time allocation, labor decisions, bush food yields, return rates from regular hunting and gathering practices, the role of cultural burning in facilitating hunting strategies, the ecological role of these practices, and significant changes in subsistence over the last half-century.

While the three remote communities in the Martu Native Title lands have semi-permanent infrastructure — including housing, a primary school, a small shop, and a health clinic — it would be misleading to describe Martu as "settled" or even "semi-settled". Most exercise extremely high mobility, shifting residence many times over the course of a year across the remote communities and throughout settlements and towns beyond the Native Title boundaries. The composition of Martu residential communities and foraging groups is thus constantly fluctuating. Their mobility and foraging activities are vital in maintaining the landesque capital of their estates, fundamentally entangled in a web of both social and ecological interactions between people, fire, plants, and animals that make the landscape of country "ngurra-ra", or homeland. These interactions are material manifestations of the creative epoch (The Dreaming), in which people re-enact the process of creation through the maintenance and support of ecological networks.

### Current and future trends in the consumption, sale and purchasing of alcohol-free and low-alcohol products in great britain, 2014 to 2023 [^1c1dbd5d]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Indicators of no/lo sales, purchasing and consumption

We use seven indicators of no/lo sales, purchasing and consumption, which are calculated from our four datasets and are, therefore, available for different time periods (see Supporting information, Appendix A1 for dataset, time period and the frequency and number of data points). Indicators using sales and purchasing data may be affected by stockpiling, where consumers buy products and keep them for some time before consumption. We selected these indicators in consultation with the UK Department of Health and Social Care as the current analyses were designed to inform their policy development and monitoring. Our indicators are as follows:
Percentage of total on‐trade alcohol sales volume that is no/lo: the numerator and denominator are both expressed in servings (see above).
Percentage of total off‐trade alcohol sales volume that is no/lo: the numerator and denominator are both expressed in servings (see above).
Percentage of on‐trade outlets offering a no/lo beer on draught: draught beer is dispensed into glass from a tap on the bar, as opposed to sold in a bottle or can, and is, therefore, more visible to the consumer. The denominator for the percentage is the total number of licensed outlets. Increasing the availability of draught no/lo beer is attractive to policy‐makers because it makes these products more visible and normalised. It may also improve perceived value for money by increasing the serving size of no/lo beers and improve perceived quality where consumers prefer draught beer to packaged alternatives.
Percentage of households who do not normally purchase alcohol that are purchasing no/lo products (off‐trade only): calculated in KWP for each week based on whether households in the sample in that week have purchased no/lo and alcoholic drinks in the preceding year. Households not present continuously in the survey for at least 12 months were excluded from analyses using this measure as they could not be robustly identified as non‐alcohol purchasers in the last year.
Percentage of increasing or higher risk households who are increasing their purchasing of no/lo products relative to alcohol products (off‐trade only): increasing or higher risk households are those that purchased more than 14 units (1 UK unit = 8 g/10 mL ethanol) of alcohol per adult in the household per week on average over the previous 12 months. For each increasing or higher risk household in KWP each week, we calculated the number of no/lo servings and standard alcohol servings purchased during the previous 52 weeks. We, then, calculated no/lo servings and standard alcohol servings purchased during the current week and previous 51 weeks, and identified whether they purchased a greater proportion of no/lo servings compared to standard alcohol servings in this more recent period. We, then, calculated the percentage of households whose no/lo purchasing increased relative to standard alcohol. As above, households not present continuously in the survey for at least 12 months and 1 week consecutively were excluded from analyses using this measure.
Percentage of households who are increasing their purchasing of no/lo products and decreasing their purchasing of alcohol products: this is similar to indicators 4 and 5 except indicator 6 includes all alcohol‐purchasing households and, instead of calculating a ratio, identifying households where there was an increase in purchased servings of no/lo drinks and a decrease in servings of standard alcoholic drinks.
Percentage of hazardous or harmful drinkers who are trying to cut down their alcohol consumption that used no/lo products in their most recent attempt: the ATS did not include no/lo products as a method of cutting down in England in five waves (May 2022, July 2022, September 2022, November 2022, December 2022, July 2023), but did include it in Wales and Scotland. We, therefore, used multiple imputations to estimate data for England in these waves (see Supporting information, Appendix Section 3 for details). We calculated a monthly time series for the percentage of respondents per wave who used no/lo in their most recent attempt to cut down. The analysis was not pre‐registered, and therefore, the results should be considered exploratory.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^3d584436]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

In both the quantitative and qualitative data, expenditure on non-essentials such as takeaways or hair treatments were reported. Some reimbursement money was also sporadically spent on rent, debt repayments, clothing lay-byes, school books, and cell phone credit.

[M]ost of the youth is at home and is not working. So, this money helps in every way it can help. Sometimes you get to find that, okay, you find that you didn't know what you would eat but since you know that okay at a certain date… you are able to borrow money. Then when you have gotten the reimbursement money, you go and patch up where you borrowed from. (Participant 3, Umgungundlovu, FGD 1)

One woman used the money to further her employment search.

It helped me before when I wanted to submit CVs. There is no one who can just give you money and say "Go and submit CVs". Firstly, you have to go to the internet cafés with the CV and do it.

### Underage youth and young adult e-cigarette use and access before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic [^a6bd3246]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Participants were asked, How long does it usually take to finish your e-cigarette or pod?, as used in a previously published survey, both before COVID-19 and since staying at home due to COVID-19. We included 7 response categories: (1) less than a day, (2) 1 to 2 days, (3) 3 to 5 days, (4) a week (7 days), (5) 2 weeks, (6) 1 month, and (7) don't know. We then created a new variable indicating whether and how e-cigarette users changed the time they took to finish either an e-cigarette or pod, coded as follows: (0) no change, (1) taking more time, (2) taking less time, (3) did not know since COVID-19, (4) did not know before and knew since COVID-19, and (5) did not know before or after COVID-19.

Questions on changing patterns of where youth and young adults accessed e-cigarettes during the COVID-19 pandemic did not exist; as such, we developed these questions with input from our Youth Advisory Board. Participants were asked, Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, what is your experience of getting vapes or vaping-related products? We provided 2 response categories: (1) it is much easier to get products and (2) it is much harder to get products. If participants found it easier to obtain the products, they were asked why it was easier with 5 response categories: (1) vape shop/dealer delivers it to my friend directly, (2) vape shop/dealer delivers it to me directly, (3) I switched to buying it online, (4) it is cheaper than before due to promotions, and (5) I use my parents' vape. If participants responded that the products were harder to obtain, they were asked why it was harder, with 6 response categories: (1) my product is not available online, (2) I can't go to a grocery store or gas station, (3) longer shipping times, (4) I can't go to the vape shop, (5) it's more expensive, and (6) restrictions on the number of products I can buy.

### Strategies to maximize available resources with minimum cost escalation for improving radiation therapy accessibility in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 era: an analysis for Asia [^394f1a94]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Strategies for maximal utilization of RT infrastructure with minimal cost escalation

It is assumed that RT centers presently functioning have adequate RT personnel to run their existing facilities for 8 hours of normal working time of a department. Thus, the various approaches that were considered for increasing patient throughput from 500 patients/TRT unit/y with minimal cost escalation are
1 Hypofractionated RT (HFRT) within 8 working hours of a department: It is assumed that in a routine department, patients undergoing radical, postoperative, or preoperative RT are usually treated with standard fractionation RT (SFRT) schedules of 70 Gy/35 fractions/7 wk, 60 Gy/30 fractions/6 wk, and 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 wk, and annually these constitute around 30%, 30%, and 20% of patients, respectively. The remaining 20% of the patients are treated with palliative RT to doses of 30 Gy/10 fractions/2 weeks (10%) and < 20 Gy/5 fractions/1 week (10%) (Table E1). Most patients considered for palliative treatment with < 20 Gy present with bone metastasis. They are likely to be treated by single fraction as this has been shown to be equally effective as multiple fraction RT. These assumptions are based on the first author's experience of working at several centers in an Asian country. However, individual centers in different countries could review their own patient data and distribution of patients subjected to different RT treatment fractionation plans based on the current practices prevalent in a particular center. Accordingly, they could alter these values to conform to their patient population and RT time-dose fractionation schedules.
A mild to moderate HFRT could be adopted whereby the treatment durations for radical, postoperative, preoperative, and the 2-week palliative RT schedule are reduced by 1 week, each keeping the respective total RT doses the same. Correspondingly, this would result in a dose/fraction of 2.33 Gy, 2.40 Gy, 2.5 Gy, and 3 Gy for these treatments. The biologically effective doses (BED) for early effects with time factor for both SFRT and HFRT schedules could be computed using the linear-quadratic model, assuming α/β = 10 Gy, α = 0.3 Gy -1, potential doubling time, T pot = 5 days, and kick-off time = 21 days. The BED for late effects for all regimens was computed assuming α/β = 3 Gy.
As evident from Table E1, the additional number of patients who could be treated by changing from SFRT to HFRT would be > 80 patients/TRT unit/y. Depending on the choice of single or multiple (1–5 fractions/1 wk) RT fractions for palliation, the number of additional patients treated with < 20 Gy/1 week could even exceed by 0 to 200/y. This would depend on the proportion of patients treated with single or multiple palliative RT fractions at a center. For computational purposes, a conservative value of 100 additional patients/TRT unit/y has been assumed. Thus, at least 600 patients/TRT unit/y could be added with HFRT treatment within the usual 8 working hours of a department.
2 Additional 25% working hours with SFRT: By increasing the working hours by 25% (2 additional hours for a typical 8-hour work day of a department), an additional 125 patients could be accommodated per year. As a result, the estimated number of patients who could be treated by each TRT unit/y could increase to 625.
3 Additional 25% working hours with HFRT: Using a combination of the strategies (a) and (b), an additional 225 patients could be treated, thereby allowing 725 patients to be treated annually in a TRT unit.
4 Additional 50% working hours with SFRT: A 50% increase of working hours by 4 additional hours with SFRT could increase the annual number of patients treated in a single TRT unit by 250, thus bringing the total number to 750 patients/TRT unit/y.
5 Additional 50% working hours with HFRT: A 50% increase of working hours with HFRT could increase the annual number of patients treated in a single TRT unit by 250. Consequently, 850 patients could be treated per TRT unit annually.

### Trial-based economic evaluations in occupational health: principles, methods, and recommendations [^55ef3227]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Intervention Costs

Information on the market price of an intervention may be derived from vendors or company and/or research project records. Many trials, however, assess novel interventions that either have no predefined price weights associated with them or for which the use of market prices is inappropriate (eg, when the societal perspective is applied). In such cases, the actual intervention costs can be assessed using a bottom-up micro-costing approach, in which detailed data regarding the quantities of resources consumed as well as their unit prices are collected per intervention component separately. Such resources may include intervention staff hours, materials used, depreciation, overhead activities, square feet of office space, and traveling. Also, workers may be taken away from their regular production activities to participate in the intervention and this should be accounted for as well. Costs associated with the intervention's evaluation should not be included unless it is a condition of implementation. Quantities of resources consumed can be measured using administrative databases, expert panels, surveys or interviews with intervention participants and/or providers, intervention operation logs, or observations. Unit prices may be collected from administrative databases, scientific literature, vendors, and/or costing manuals (eg).

There are many serious problems in medical care today e, g., the outrageous cost of many new drugs. However, we will have to wait until 2028 to fix them. I propose a radical solution to implement the reforms which include VALUE as a key criterion. I propose a heuristic model which would include a SPECIAL COMMITTEE whose members would be approved by the president to carry out the necessary reforms.

### The balancing act of urban conservation [^a7cec7ef]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Post-industrial cities such as Cleveland, Ohio, USA face the significant challenge of managing thousands of vacant lots (i.e. parcels where pre-existing structures have been torn down and replaced by minimally-managed vegetation) (a). Although typically viewed as blight, these sites do offer opportunities to conserve urban biodiversity. In 2014, the Gardiner Laboratory established 64 conservation habits on vacant land across the city of Cleveland, including 32 sites seeded with native perennial wildflowers (b). Our cost to establish the 32 pocket prairies was approximately $2500 per site and included soil preparation, seeding, invasive plant management, and installing 'cues to care'such as fencing and mulching. Maintaining cues to care required substantial time and financial investment. Trash, furniture, appliances, and other refuse are frequently dumped into urban lots and must be removed (c). Vandalism to signs, fencing, and vegetation is also common, especially in the springtime when native plantings have not bloomed yet and sites can appear weedy and unkempt (d). Similar aesthetic concerns can happen during the winter. Thus, it is imperative to work with local stakeholders to identify what design modifications can indicate year-round investment into a conservation site. For instance, greenspace managers at the Sunflower+Project: STL, in St. Louis, Missouri, partnered with local elementary schools to paint sustainability flags which hung above their over-wintering sunflower fields (e). However, even with substantial investment, vacant lot ecosystem management can remain a controversial endeavor. Although many residents view rain gardens established though a multi-million USD investment by the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District as valuable storm water management, others see a poor use of funds that raises health and safety concerns(f). Thus, we must work with urban residents and municipal governance as community developers to meet the needs of the diverse human ecosystem. Photograph E courtesy Richard Reilly.

Liraglutide — randomized controlled trial context, dosing, and run-in requirements: Direct comparative evidence from RCTs addressed long-term treatment "at a study duration of at least 52 weeks." In 3 studies, both groups received individualized intensive lifestyle intervention; most emphasized "at least 500-kcal" deficit and " ≥ 150 min/wk of physical activity." Liraglutide or placebo was given as a daily SC injection "starting at a dose of 0.6 mg, with weekly dose escalation until the target dose of 3.0 mg daily was reached." In 3 weight maintenance studies, participants followed a calorie-restricted run-in; in 2 studies subjects had to lose "at least 5%" and follow "LCD (800–1000 kcal/d for 8 weeks)," whereas another required " ≥ 5%" during a variable-length "(4–12 weeks)" run-in with "LCD (1200–1400 kcal/d)." In SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence)-Maintenance, participants lost " ≥ 6.5 kg" during the run-in, and in the other studies they lost an average of "12.5–13.1 kg." Overall, "A total of 3964 subjects were randomized to liraglutide 3.0 mg and 2498 subjects were randomized to control groups."

### Cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses: how did we get here and where are we going? [^1c01fb01]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses are currently the only tools available for evaluating whether the cost of an intervention is a good use of resources when compared with other ways that money could be spent on health care (allocative efficiency). Cost-utility analyses assess health in terms of length and quality of life using the quality adjusted life year whilst cost-benefit analyses measure health in monetary terms. The measurement of health gain with either approach has a number of problems and the accuracy of these measures is uncertain. Cost-benefit analysis has certain advantages when measuring improvements in mild diseases such as irritable bowel disease and dyspepsia, which are common problems in gastroenterology. The results of cost-benefit analysis may provide more transparent guidance for policy makers, doctors and patients.

### "Green medicine": the past, present, and future of botanicals [^cc2f8ff1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Botanicals are plant-derived products that have been consumed by humans for centuries. Today, the marketing and use of botanicals for health and wellness benefits continues to thrive worldwide, with consumers projected to spend more than $140 billion globally by 2024 (Global Analysis, Inc). However, research on the quality and safety of these products has lagged behind sales. Because of this divergence, opportunities abound for collaborations amongst scientists from industry, academia, and government to address these unmet public health needs. Clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists from all of these sectors play critical roles in developing harmonized approaches to achieve the common goal of ensuring botanical products with superior quality and safety.

Fatigue risk management — business drivers of overtime and productivity notes that cutting staffing and relying on overtime reduces benefits and training costs, usually estimated to be around 40% of base salary, but paying time and a half or even double time on holidays may yield little actual savings; the amount of productive work performed per week per employee comes out at as little as about 50 hours, so more than 50 hours of overtime per week may not produce much additional productive work; efforts to increase utilization of capital equipment by as much as 40% by converting sites to seamless 24/7 operations can extend schedules from 24-hours a day for 5 days a week to 6 or 7 days, with employees working 6 or 7 days a week with occasional days off and experiencing burnout from fatigue and stress.

### The impact of introducing alcohol-free beer options in bars and public houses on alcohol sales and revenue: a randomised crossover field trial [^b59ca692]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

The study aimed to estimate the impact of introducing a draught alcohol-free beer, thereby increasing the relative availability of these products, on alcohol sales and monetary takings in bars and pubs in England.

Design

Randomised crossover field trial.

Setting

England.

Participants

Fourteen venues that did not previously sell draught alcohol-free beer.

Intervention and Comparator

Venues completed two intervention periods and two control periods in a randomised order over 8 weeks. Intervention periods involved replacing one draught alcoholic beer with an alcohol-free beer. Control periods operated business as usual.

Measurements

The primary outcome was mean weekly volume (in litres) of draught alcoholic beer sold. The secondary outcome was mean weekly revenue [in GBP (£)] from all drinks. Analyses adjusted for randomised order, special events, season and busyness.

Findings

The adjusted mean difference in weekly sales of draught alcoholic beer was -20 L [95% confidence interval (CI) = -41 to +0.4], equivalent to a 4% reduction (95% CI = 8% reduction to 0.1% increase) in the volume of alcoholic draught beer sold when draught alcohol-free beer was available. Excluding venues that failed at least one fidelity check resulted in an adjusted mean difference of -29 L per week (95% CI = -53 to -5), equivalent to a 5% reduction (95% CI = 8% reduction to 0.8% reduction). The adjusted mean difference in weekly revenue was +61 GBP per week (95% CI = -328 to +450), equivalent to a 1% increase (95% CI = 5% decrease to 7% increase) when draught alcohol-free beer was available.

Conclusions

Introducing a draught alcohol-free beer in bars and pubs in England reduced the volume of draught alcoholic beer sold by 4% to 5%, with no evidence of the intervention impacting net revenue.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Patient and caregiver costs and treatment burden in atopic dermatitis (AD) are substantial. Survey data report that "the median annual AD out-of-pocket expense was $600; 42% of patients with AD reported greater than $1000 out-of-pocket expenses annually and 9% reported out-of-pocket expenses greater than $5000 per year," and that "Higher out-of-pocket expenses are associated with increased disease severity and flares." Treatment intensity is common: "many patients with AD use, including concurrently, at least 3 prescription therapies," and cost gaps are frequent as "Nearly half of all study respondents (49%) reported out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications that were not covered by insurance." Caregiving demands are high, with "Caregivers of children with moderate-to-severe AD reported spending an average 20 hours per week managing the disease."

### Excellent hospital care for all: open and operating 24 / 7 [^191c7ed8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Nights and weekends are the times when most people are admitted to the hospital. They are also synonymous with reduced staffing levels and fewer specialized diagnostic, procedural, and treatment options. Indeed, there is increasing evidence suggesting that patient care is compromised during these times. Equally important is the inefficient use of capital investments during nights and weekends, and inappropriate utilization of hospital beds caused by poor weekend discharge flexibility. We believe that these findings should be of concern not just to hospital care providers, but across care settings and to the general public. In this perspective article, we highlight how our current office-hours system of running hospitals threatens the lives of our sickest, most vulnerable patients, describe solutions currently implemented in hospitals that may alleviate this disparity, and discuss challenges to wider scale implementation.

### The impact of shift work and long work hours on employers' health care costs [^a6757217]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Third, costs related to long work hours were difficult to estimate due to the lack of epidemiological research currently available. The available evidence suggests that long work hours compromise worker health, but risk ratios are available for only a limited number of conditions. Our estimates represent an underestimate of the true costs of shift work and long work hours.

There are several limitations to this study. First, the third party vendors used different approaches to identify incidence of the health conditions among the employee populations, therefore the data are not entirely comparable across companies. Second, incidence of the conditions was derived from diagnosis codes in claims across multiple years so that we could accurately more identify all employees with the condition. Our results may overstate the number of workers with the condition in a given year. Still, these findings related to excess cost are likely underestimates because the third party vendors only supplied data for a limited number of conditions, and our literature review only produced risk ratios for a limited number of conditions, particularly for long work hours. Third, we used Medicare prices for the cost estimates, which likely underestimate the actual costs incurred by companies for the conditions. Finally, cost estimates for occupational injuries and other conditions may not adequately capture the full cost as few workers are affected but large outlier costs may result.

In conclusion, we found that two large US manufacturing companies incurred substantial excess health care related costs due to their shift work and 12-hour shift policies across four plants. The costs are likely underestimates, given the limited data available, particularly regarding the health risk associated with long work hours. Nevertheless, excess health care costs associated with shift work and long work hours may not be substantial enough to warrant major changes in work schedules. However, they should influence employers to make additional investments in interventions to prevent and manage chronic health conditions.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 5 health care abroad [^86971d46]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Medical evacuation insurance — medical evacuation from a resource-poor area to a hospital delivering definitive care might be necessary despite having travel health insurance. The total cost of a medevac varies by location, ranging from USD 25,000 for transport within North America to over USD 250,000 for more distant and remote locations, and costs increase when the patient being evacuated is critically ill or needs complex infection control measures. The decision to medically evacuate is at the discretion of the insurance company; it is not made at the request of the traveler, and typically, the traveler must be hospitalized with anticipation that multiple additional days of hospitalization will be required or specialized surgery or treatment is needed that is not of comparable quality at the current destination. Some medical evacuation companies have more extensive experience working in some parts of the world than others; travelers should ask about a company's resources in each region of travel, especially if planning trips to hard-to-reach locations, and if the health risks are too high, a traveler might want to postpone or cancel their international trip.

Suggested Dosage Charts *(Note Disclaimer)

* This is a suggested dose chart only. Dose regimen has not been subjected to adequate and well controlled studies to determine safety and efficacy.

Please read entire instructions before commencing immunotherapy. Observe patients for 30 minutes after an injection. Note: Certain individuals may not tolerate this suggested schedule. The physician may need to adjust both the dosage and interval accordingly.

Note: Maintenance dose is that dose which provides symptomatic relief or the strongest dose that can be tolerated by the patient. Therefore, a physician must determine each patient's maintenance dose.

Intervals between doses: The optimal interval between doses of allergenic extract has not been definitely established. However, as it is customary practiced, injections are given once or twice per week until the maintenance dose of extract is reached. At this time, the injection interval may be increased to 2 weeks, then 3 weeks and finally to 4 weeks. If the patient does not return for 6–8 weeks after the last injection, the dose should be reduced to 25% of the last dose. If longer than 8 weeks, a dose reduction of 1,2, or 3 dilutions may be made depending on a consideration of the components and the patient's sensitivity.(3)The dosage and the interval between injections may need to be modified according to the clinical response of the patient. When switching patients to a new extract the initial dose should be reduced 3/4 so that 25% of previous dose is administered.

Duration of Treatment: The usual duration of treatment has not been established. A period of two or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Effectiveness of a total meal replacement program (OPTIFAST program) on weight loss: results from the OPTIWIN study [^09a08338]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

OP

Participants randomized to OP were provided all MR at no cost. Participants with BMI < 45 were instructed to use five MRs per day (800 kcal total) with 40% of calories as protein, 40% as carbohydrate, and 20% as fat. Participants with BMI of 45 to 49.9 received six MRs per day (960 kcal); those with BMI ≥ 50 received six MRs plus one meal daily of lean protein (3‐4 ounces) and one nonstarchy vegetable serving (1,100‐1,200 kcal). Participants followed their prescription for 12 to 16 weeks based on provider discretion and patient preference, after which there was gradual reintroduction of food through week 26. After week 26, participants' calories were gradually increased to achieve weight stability. During this time, participants were advised to use one to two MRs daily to facilitate weight‐loss maintenance.

The OPTIFAST protocol requires medical monitoring during the initiation of TMR. OP participants saw a clinician regularly to address health concerns and adjust medications for a total of 11 medical monitoring visits during the first 26 weeks and 4 medical monitoring visits in weeks 27 to 52. Labs for medical monitoring, including either a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel, were obtained at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16. Participants had individual counseling with trained interventionists for a total of 16 individual counseling visits through the first 26 weeks and 11 individual counseling visits from week 27 through week 52.

FB program

The FB program was a modified version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) intervention 9, 10, 11. During active weight loss (0‐26 weeks), FB participants were prescribed a calorie‐restricted diet emphasizing lower fat intake (25%‐30% of total calories). They were advised to reduce calories by 500 to 750 kcal below estimated total energy expenditure, calculated based on resting metabolic rate measured by indirect calorimetry (MedGem; Microlife USA, Inc. Clearwater, Florida) plus an activity factor based on self‐reported physical activity. To balance the incentive of free MR in the OP arm, FB participants received gift cards totaling $800 to offset the cost of groceries during the active weight‐loss phase. They also had two medical monitoring visits and seven individual counseling visits through week 26. During the maintenance phase (27‐52 weeks), they had two medical monitoring visits and five individual counseling visits.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 8 travel for work and other reasons [^fd1d9bc1]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

International business traveler — In 2017, approximately 4.8 million US residents traveled overseas for business; despite the slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global Business Travel Association predicted in 2023 that business travel, although recovering more slowly than leisure travel, would exceed pre-pandemic levels by 2024. Globalization and offshore manufacturing have expanded travel to an increasing number of countries worldwide, including many countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America; some companies are using webconferencing and online and hybrid meetings to cut travel budgets, and such approaches have the benefit of cost savings and a lower carbon footprint. Business travelers include people traveling for conventions, research, work-related training, and volunteer work, and some combine work with tourist activities by bringing a friend or family member or by extending their business trip to include a leisure component. For business travelers, the likelihood of an adverse health event increases with the number of trips made to at-risk areas, the length of time spent at the destination, and lifestyle at the destination. Many international business travelers take multiple trips each year.

### Sustainable IT budgeting: a method to determine not to exceed values for annual infrastructure purchases [^4a88103f]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Picture-archiving and communication systems are complex entities, but at core they consist of compute processors that are networked together to store and retrieve objects. Therein lay fundamental aspects of both performance benchmarking and predicting future costs, provided one can accurately predict trends in both exam volumes and sizes. Hence, determining the correct amount of capital to reserve annually for the information technology infrastructure can be a difficult process for the administrator of a medical center. Both exam volumes and sizes tend to increase over time. In addition, users demand more compute-intensive applications and expect exam delivery to the desktop to be ever timelier despite the increase in size. Against this, storage, compute, and networking costs tend to decrease over time for the same performance level. At the end of the day, the question of whether to budget more or less capital for next year's infrastructure is not trivial. This paper develops a methodology that uses current baseline data to predict the "ampleness" of a budget to meet future needs.

### Physician perspectives on telemedicine in radiation oncology [^b36f6253]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

As noted, some private payers serving patients at our institution recently elected to stop covering telemedicine weekly see visits, which has restricted the ability of our patients to use telemedicine without significant out-of-pocket expenses and has led to an institutional decision to stop performing telemedicine weekly see visits for RO patients. Sadly, our experience illustrates both the dangers of a fragmented payer system and the risk that policy changes and individual insurer coverage determinations may pose to advanced models of care that have been developed over the past 2 years. Given that telemedicine workflows have been shown to be cost-effective for patients and providers without any increase in adverse events, the rationale for reversing coverage parity specifically for telemedicine weekly see visits is unclear. Especially in the case of organizations with multiple facilities or for physicians who have academic, administrative, or other responsibilities, telemedicine weekly see visits are a patient-centered solution that allow patients to be managed by the radiation oncologist that knows them best (in conjunction with a covering physician overseeing on-site treatment delivery). Although radiation oncologists must weigh multiple clinical and nonclinical factors to determine whether to use telemedicine, our data suggest that more than half of weekly see visits could be clinically appropriate for telemedicine depending on the treated site, and that providers feel comfortable determining which visits can be performed with telemedicine. The costs of acquiring compatible equipment and developing and maintaining the software infrastructure to perform video visits have already been borne by practices, vendors, and patients, so coverage policies that restrict broader clinically appropriate telemedicine utilization are obstacles to efficient health care delivery.

Methods

This open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study in adult subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will evaluate THOR-707 as a single agent and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Study objectives are to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of THOR-707 as single agent and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor; and to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability as well as, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity. The study will be conducted in 3 parts.
Part 1 will evaluate THOR-707 as a single agent across different dosing schedules (e.g. dosing every 2 weeks [Q2W] or 3 weeks [Q3W]).
Part 2 will evaluate THOR-707 (Q3W) in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.
Part 3: Dose expansion will begin after the RP2D for THOR-707 as a single agent or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor has been determined and will enroll selected populations (e.g. specific tumor types, treatment history, and/or biomarker profile).

Between 50–100 subjects may be enrolled in the dose escalation phase to determine the MTD and/or RP2D as a single agent and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. After defining the MTD and/or RP2D, additional subjects may be enrolled at the respective dose schedules to further evaluate safety, pharmacodynamic effects, and anti-tumor activity

### Increased labor losses and decreased adaptation potential in a warmer world [^c7b72323]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The current and projected economic costs of heavy labor losses are substantial. We find that already each year sees nearly 670 billion purchasing power parity-adjusted international dollars (2017 PPP$) lost globally in the 12-h workday, with 82 billion 2017 PPP$ lost at the hottest hour of the day and 14 billion 2017 PPP$ lost in the coolest hour of the day ("Methods"). Economic productivity losses associated with heat exposure accelerate as the globe warms, with 1.6 trillion 2017 PPP$ annual losses in the 12-h workday in a 2 °C warmer world (Fig. 4d). If workers attempt to minimize productivity losses by shifting work hours from midday to the early morning, losses in the morning relative to those at midday increase from about 2–3%/°C for the next degree of warming, to 3–4%/°C of warming under higher warming levels (Fig. 4e, f).

### Describing economic benefits and costs of nonstandard work hours: a scoping review [^44c276ad]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefits of nonstandard work hours include increased production time and the number of jobs. While for some sectors, such as emergency services, around-the-clock work is a necessary and critical societal obligation, work outside of traditional daytime schedules has been associated with many occupational safety and health hazards and their associated costs. Thus, organizational- and policy-level decisions on nonstandard work hours can be difficult and are based on several factors including economic evaluation. However, there is a lack of systematic knowledge of economic benefits and costs associated with these schedules.

Methods

We conducted a scoping review of the methodology and data used to examine the economic benefits and costs of nonstandard work hours and related interventions to mitigate risks.

Results

Ten studies met all our inclusion criteria. Most studies used aggregation and analysis of national and other large datasets. Costs estimated include health-related expenses, productivity losses, and projections of future loss of earnings. Cost analyses of interventions were provided for an obstructive sleep apnea screening program, implementation of an employer-based educational program, and increased staffing to cover overtime hours.

Conclusions

A paucity of studies assess nonstandard work hours using economic terms. Future studies are needed to expand economic evaluations beyond the employer level to include those at the societal level because impacts of nonstandard work go beyond the workplace and are important for policy analysis and formulation. We pose the opportunity for researchers and employers to share data and resources in the development of more analyses that fill these research gaps.

### Health professional experiences of kidney transplantation in regional, rural, and remote Australia [^73977839]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Crushing financial peril

Contending with unexpected expenses

Participants highlighted some of the unexpected expenses associated with transplant that patients and their families are faced with, explaining "you might get your accommodation and airfare, or transport paid for, but then they have to pay for food, and they're used to living off bush tucker or rice or something really cheap in the community that they share with family". Another participant stated, "they have to fork out money to buy all the transplant medications and some of them are actually not financially prepared for that".

Scarcity of financial assistance

The inadequacy of current subsidies offered through the public health system for travel and accommodation costs was frequently cited by participants as being out of touch with current costs of living. According to one participant "most accommodations here are between $140 up to about $220 (per night)", yet "only $70 (per night) is covered for that accommodation". One participant emphasised the additive effect of these out-of-pocket expenses over time, explaining "around $1,500 to $2,000 that you need in your pocket for that".

Juggling competing priorities

Another issue contributing to the overall financial burden of transplant is the fact that many patients are managing other competing financial priorities, for example, "people who are working, who are living day-to-day, paying rent for where they live, paying a mortgage for where they live, and now they've also got this added expense". Obligations to employers or businesses can also present an issue for some "if they can't take time off work", as that makes attending scheduled appointments difficult.

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

### Quantifying the costs of hospital admission for families of children with a febrile illness in the north east of england [^2caab003]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Loss of earnings

Loss of earnings contributed significantly to the total costs families faced (figure 4). 44.6% of participants (N = 37) reported costs, which amounted to a median £81.67 (IQR £37.71–£138.33) per day.

Partner [is] self-employed and has lost £300 per day. He's tried to work as much as he can through this, but our loss is around £600. (participant 36)

Most often income was lost by the parent in-hospital (N = 32, 38.6%) and included not just financial losses but also loss of opportunities and clients if services could not be delivered.

My husband is self-employed and cancelled a few jobs to be here [in hospital]. (participant 67)

I am still struggling to get work back to normal again and lost clients. (participant 42)

Figure 4
Boxplots of total admission costs per day for all participants, including and excluding loss of earnings.

Total costs and financial impact

All costs combined, total admission costs were median £221 (IQR £61.50–£695). Per day, this amounted to median £56.25 (IQR £32.10–£157.25) (figure 4).

One participant provided an exemplary breakdown:

27 days hospital so far. £18 per day parking = £486. Petrol = £50 over 3 admissions, as we are from another town. Food/snacks approx. £10 per day (and that's bringing our own in too as hospitals are expensive) = £270. So around £800! Plus annual leave or pay loss which is around £75 per day. (participant 15)

Ten participants (12%) required additional support, and 19 participants (22.9%) subjectively reported financial hardship directly caused by this hospitalisation.

Our final question was to ask families if there were any unexpected costs that we did not ask about. 14 (16.9%) participants responded and most stated that costs for entertainment, while not a necessity, were important to their child's well-being:

I've spent more money on things like drinks, snacks and entertainment on tablets to keep my child settled. (participant 43)

### WHO-led consensus statement on vaccine delivery costing: process, methods, and findings [^e021a98a]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommended costing terminology and principles

After reviewing the definitions of costing terms, the following definitions of costing terms are recommended:
Vaccine delivery costs Costs associated with delivering immunization programs to target populations, exclusive of vaccine costs.
Vaccine cost At a minimum includes the cost of the vaccine and diluent (if applicable); the analysis should include accounting for wastage rates; the analyst should specify whether this also includes injection supplies (syringes), international shipment, insurance, and customs/duties.
Financial cost Monetary outlays, with straight-line depreciation for capital goods; does not include opportunity costs for use of resources or donated goods and services from sources other than the payer(s) defined in the analysis. Definition is dependent on perspective since monetary outlays are specific to the payer(s) defined in the analysis.
Economic cost The value of all resources utilized, regardless of the source of financing. Includes opportunity costs for use of existing resources and any donated goods or services from any source. Capital costs are annualized and discounted.
Undepreciated financial cost Financial costs without depreciation of capital costs (note: such costs have been termed "initial investment" in some costing tools and referred to as fiscal costs in previous analyses.)
Recurrent cost Value of resources that last less than one year. Start-up activity costs may include recurrent costs.
Capital cost Value of resources lasting more than one year such as equipment, buildings, and trainings. Start-up activity costs may include capital costs.
Incremental cost Cost of adding a new service/intervention or a package of services/interventions over and above an existing program; inclusion of existing resources will depend on assumptions made about excess capacity (i.e. whether resources are underemployed; if there are no slack resources (e.g. all personnel time is fully allocated before the addition of the new service/intervention), then their use for the new service or intervention incurs an opportunity cost that should be included — either by measurement or assumption).
Full cost Baseline cost as well as the additional/incremental cost of the new intervention, including vaccine cost.
Cost projection Estimation of future costs of both recurrent and capital inputs.
Prospective data collection Direct observation of resource use during intervention implementation; i.e. data are collected concurrently with intervention implementation.
Retrospective data collection Data collection after resource use is completed.
Start-up cost Cost of initial one-time programmatic activities. Examples may include initial micro-planning, initial training activities, and initial sensitization/social mobilization/information, education, and communication (IEC); does not include routine or repeated programmatic activities such as refresher training or annual microplanning. Start-up activities may include both recurrent and capital costs; they are defined by the non-repeating nature of the activity, not the type of input.
Micro-costing Focuses on granular accounting of input prices and quantities; disaggregates costs of particular output into specific goods and services consumed.
Bottom-up costing Measures input quantities at the client (e.g. per vaccination administered) or activity level.
Top-down costing Divides overall program cost or expenditures, often including those at administrative levels above service delivery level, by number of outputs to calculate unit cost.
Perspective The point of view considered for costs (and benefits, if included) in a costing study, by whom the costs were incurred. Payers are the disbursing agents for a good or service, and may differ from the original source of funding. A provider perspective includes costs incurred by health service providers (can be limited to the government), a payer perspective includes costs to the payer(s), such as government or an external partner, while the societal perspective includes all costs incurred by providers as well as clients.
Shared cost Shared resources that are not used only for immunization, but also for other productive activities.

### Comparing the levelized cost of electric vehicle charging options in Europe [^9c551e6d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Second, we consider additional upfront expenses other than the charging hardware as installation cost. Mainly, these include the mechanical and structural installation of the charger (charging pole, wall mount, foundation), the establishment of an appropriate electrical distribution (grid connection, conduits, wires, trenches, safety switches, transformer for DC stations), as well as miscellaneous other expenses such as cost for planning, permitting or material transport. For high power levels, significant additional costs for bolstering the grid connection may be required. However, these additional costs vary considerably between different electricity grid area regulations and often do not reflect actual connection costs. To be as consistent as possible and to estimate comparable costs of charging, grid connection costs are therefore neglected. Within the installation cost, we differentiate costs for structural and electrical material, which are assumed to be uniform across all countries, and labor costs for construction workers and electricians, which vary by country. To determine installation costs, we collected cost information available in the literature, estimated the costs for the different charging options and then validated the cost compilation with industry experts. To account for country differences of labor costs, we estimate labor shares of the installation cost and scale the corresponding cost based on national hourly labor rates in the construction sector.

The third infrastructure component is the yearly cost for operation and maintenance (O&M) over the lifetime of a project. In general, EV charging equipment is assumed to have very low maintenance requirements. Consequently, for residential and commercial, privately accessible charging sites, we assume the O&M to be 2% of the equipment cost, covering 1–2 maintenance or repair incidents, based on expert interviews. At publicly accessible stations, we assume the O&M to be 4% of equipment cost due to higher strain of the stations. Besides the technical maintenance (O&M), for the operation of commercial, publicly accessible charging options we assume an additional 180 € per year (or 15 € per months) service cost for billing, network and load management systems, based on expert interviews.

### Differential pricing of drugs: a role for cost-effectiveness analysis? [^b9834658]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Internationally, the high costs of pharmaceutical products limit access to treatment. The principle of differential pricing is that drug prices should vary according to some measure of affordability. How differential prices should be determined is, however, unclear. Here we describe a method whereby differential prices for essential drugs could be derived in countries of variable national wealth, and, using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors provide an example of how the process might work. Indicative prices for drugs can be derived by cost-effectiveness analysis that incorporates a measure of national wealth. Such prices could be used internationally as a basis of differential price negotiations.

### The challenge of phasing-out fossil fuel finance in the banking sector [^6756f334]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A timely and well-managed phase-out of bank lending to the fossil fuel sector is critical if Paris climate targets are to remain within reach. Using a systems lens to explore over $7 trillion of syndicated fossil fuel debt, we show that syndicated debt markets are resilient to uncoordinated phase-out scenarios without regulatory limits on banks' fossil fuel lending. However, with regulation in place, a tipping point emerges as banks sequentially exit the sector and phase-out becomes efficient. The timing of this tipping point depends critically on the stringency of regulatory rules. It is reached sooner in scenarios where systemically important banks lead the phase-out and is delayed without regional coordination, particularly between US, Canadian and Japanese banks.

### Anomalous supply shortages from dynamic pricing in on-demand mobility [^6ad77555]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Dynamic multiplayer game

For the dynamic multiplayer game, we consider a single origin location with N = 160 drivers. Upon completing a trip, drivers return to the origin location after a total round-trip time t s uniformly distributed inminutes. We increase the round-trip time from the base valuemin tomin in the morning and afternoon (starting at 08:00 and increasing linearly up to the maximum at 9:30 and back to the base value until 11:00. Similarly in the afternoon from 15:00 to the maximum at 18:00 and back until 20:00).

The base cost p base depend linearly on the round-trip time asUSD as the round-trip time changes during the day. Similar to the two-player game, we take a linear price dependence for the surge pricing asbased on the number N idle of online drivers at the trip origin and the number of drivers N thresh before the surge fee becomes non-zero. We take, where λ = 2 requests per minute describes the demand modeled as a Poisson process in time. We model responses of the price to the current system state (number of available drivers and round-trip time) as instantaneous.

The behavior of customers and drivers is as follows: Each customer i is assigned a uniformly random maximum pricethey are willing to pay, where we takeUSD. When the customer makes a request, they check the current total fare. If the current total fare is smaller than, the customer orders the ride. If the total fare is higher or no drivers are online and idle, the customer waits and checks again every 2 min. After 10 min without ordering a ride, the customer leaves the system.

At every point in time the drivers decide whether to switch their app off or on. They make this decision based on the (mean field) optimal strategy to optimize their collective payoff. A driver switches off their app only if two conditions are fulfilled: first, if there are sufficiently many drivers available and willing to be offline to induce a non-zero surge fee. Second, if the price is less than the (mean field) optimal value for the drivers given the current system state. Each driver remains offline for at most 20 min. After this time, the driver only considers going offline again after serving a customer (drivers try to obtain similar individual profits whereas their optimal strategy based on maximizing their collective profit would be for some drivers to be always offline).

### How much running is too much? Identifying high-risk running sessions in a 5200-person cohort study [^10eefdb9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We explored whether a spike in running distance during a single session or over 1week, compared with the preceding period, was associated with increased risk of running-related overuse injury.

Methods

Adult runners were recruited for an 18-month cohort study. Three training-related exposures were defined based on a relative change in running distance, using data collected via Garmin devices: (1) session-specific running distance relative to the longest distance run in the past 30 days; (2) 1-week period relative to the preceding 3weeks using the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR); (3) 1-week period using a week-to-week ratio. Runners were categorised into one of four time-varying states: (1) regression, or up to 10% increase (reference); (2) 'small spike' between > 10% and 30%increase; (3) 'moderate spike' between > 30% and 100%increase; and (4) 'large spike' > 100% increase. Outcome was self-reported overuse running-related injury. A multistate Cox regression model was used to estimate adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRR).

Results

Among 5205 runners (mean age 45.8 years, SD = 10.4; 22% female), a total of 1820 (35%) sustained a running-related injury during 588071 sessions. Significantly increased rates were identified for small spikes (HRR = 1.64 (95% CI: 1.31 to 2.05, p = 0.01)), moderate spikes (HRR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.16 to 2.00, p < 0.01)) and large spikes (HRR = 2.28 (95% CI: 1.50 to 3.48, p < 0.01)) in single-session running distance. A negative dose-response relationship was observed for the ACWR. No relationship was identified for the week-to-week ratio.

Conclusion

A significant increase in the rate of running-related overuse injury was found when the distance of a single running session exceeded 10% of the longest run undertaken in the last 30 days.

### An unforeseen glimmer of hope [^817e7d4e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

One corner of the corridor served as a small makeshift emergency room with a bed (that could be folded if needed for a child), an examination lamp (that was strategically attached to one limb of the crash cart), and the Emergency Triage and Treatment chart on the wall. Another tidy room with five beds served as the ward. The adjoining room was a kitchen where food was cooked for the patients and also doubled up as the nurses' duty room.

Along the stairs to the first floor, the wall was adorned with sprucely set frames with visitors' feedback. With encouraging words from officers of neighboring villages to experts from world-renowned universities like Johns Hopkins, the wall literally sung praises to the healthcare team!

The first floor of the building housed a laboratory which performed basic tests. One corner of the floor, earlier a dump yard for waste, had been renovated to a tidy seminar room. Other than training peripheral workers about aspects of health care, the medical officer, along with two other volunteers, helped them become more literate. "Early marriages and financial troubles forced several of them to discontinue formal education but could not dampen their desire to learn. We try to fulfill their long unrealized wish," he remarked.

As we strolled around the PHC, he recalled his initial days. "Before I took over 4 years back, the area surrounding the PHC was a junkyard; we used to spend the first few hours every day cleaning the place, picking up broken bottles, and other litter. Snakes were a common sight; I myself have killed three!" Small glass bottles originally bought with laboratory reagents in them, now hung prettily with ornamental plants in the garden. The space behind the building was now a kitchen garden brimming with plants of several varieties. At the corner was a fish tank with Gambusia fish which devour mosquito larvae, another example of adept use of available space.

### How much diagnostic safety can we afford, and how should we decide? A health economics perspective [^0188dc5a]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Conceptual complexities notwithstanding, we believe that as long as the psychological value (benefit or harm) of uncertain, correct and incorrect diagnoses is considered for its impact on health-related quality of life, then the standard measure of health effect used in economic analyses of medical treatments, the 'quality-adjusted life year' (QALY), is an appropriate measure of diagnostic test outcomes. Similarly, the cost per QALY or incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is an appropriate measure of societal value in diagnosis. Within this framework, individual diagnostic tests or overall diagnostic strategies which lead to health benefits at a cost of < US$100 000 per QALY (or any societally sanctioned alternative threshold)would be considered cost effective. In a comparative effectiveness (or relative cost effectiveness) framework, diagnostic interventions offering the greatest number of QALYs per healthcare dollar spent should be endorsed at a societal level. We propose that high-value targets are those with a high burden of harm from misdiagnosis and a low cost of reducing misdiagnosis, while those with the opposite profile are of low value (figure 2).

### Active and passive case-finding in tuberculosis-affected households in Peru: a 10-year prospective cohort study [^f30c24b7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Intensified study active case-finding

Study research nurses visited households at recruitment then again after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks, and then every 4 weeks throughout the index patient's treatment (usually for 6 months but could be longer for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis). During these visits, study nurses offered active case-finding to all participating contacts. This entailed offering free sputum testing for contacts who had any symptom suggestive of tuberculosis — ie, cough of any duration and type (whether productive or not), fever, night sweats, weight loss, or chest pain. Spot sputum samples were obtained with careful instruction in the privacy of the contact's own home. The sample provided (whether it appeared macroscopically to be sputum or saliva) was tested by smear microscopy and cultured using the MODS assay. After completion of the index patient's treatment, we visited households on three occasions, approximately every 4 years. At these visits, we offered all available contacts free sputum testing with smear microscopy and culture using the thin-layer agar MDR/XDR-TB Colour Test. At the first two visits, testing was offered only to contacts who had symptoms. At the final visit, testing was offered to all contacts. If a contact was not present at the time of an active case-finding visit, another household member completed the screening questions on behalf of the absent contact and sputum pots were left with instructions and collected 24 h later.

Programmatic passive case-finding

Throughout the follow-up period, contacts had access to passive case-finding at MINSA-run health posts, free of direct charges, both inside and outside the study area. The main diagnostic test available for tuberculosis during the study period was (and remains) smear microscopy of sputum, usually obtained with little instruction. Chest radiography was done at the contact's expense and was interpreted by the consulting doctor and rarely by a radiologist. Investigation for tuberculosis was typically initiated among individuals presenting to health posts with cough for longer than 2 weeks. Tuberculosis in this setting was also diagnosed and treated in MINSA-run hospitals, employer-insured health facilities for people with formal employment, prisons, and private clinics.

### Cost-effectiveness studies in endoscopy: are they worth it? [^08f1bee6]. Endoscopy (2000). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is currently in great demand. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopy in comparison with surgical and radiological alternatives for diagnosis and therapy would appear particularly important, since the costs they incur may be substantial. However, several technical and practical issues may limit the perceived value of cost-effectiveness studies and the applicability of their results to daily practice. Despite this, they are likely to be used to make decisions regarding health-care resource allocation. A better understanding of their limitations by all parties involved and active participation by physicians (as opposed to health-care administrators) in their conception and execution should help optimize our ability to provide excellent patient care at a reasonable price.

### The emergence of cost effective battery storage [^8264016c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The optimally sized battery will be fully charged on representative days during five months of the year. Thus. In the remaining 7 months there is either insufficient supply of solar power (November–February) or there is insufficient demand in the after sunset hours (June–August). The household will be grid-positive during average days in June, July, and August in the sense that the energy stored in the battery is sufficient to meet the household's electricity load. Formally, during those months.

Under current rules, solar PV systems in Germany exhaust their feed-in tariff support after 20 years. At that point in time, the household would probably not receive more than the average wholesale rate (around 3 € cents per kWh) for any surplus energy sold back to the energy service provider. For such older solar PV systems, the financial return from adding a battery system would at that point increase further because the price premium would then effectively be at least 27 € cents per kWh. Under this scenario, it would be economical to install a larger power rating (over 4 kW) and coupled larger energy capacity (between 8 €kWh and 11 kWh).

In contrast to Germany, California may at first glance not appear ideally suited for behind-the-meter storage installations. The state's continued commitment to the policy of net metering effectively allows both residential and commercial customers to sell any temporal surplus electricity back to their energy service providers at the same rate at which the customer acquires electricity from the grid. From the perspective of the customer, this policy effectively enables free energy storage. In the context of the above model, the price premium for storage systems in California would therefore be zero. It should be noted, though, that in confirming the state's commitment to net metering, California utilities were nonetheless allowed to impose a non-bypassable charge for all electricity consumed by customers with residential solar PV installations. The average non-bypassable charge rate is 2.7¢ per kWh. This surcharge thus becomes an effective price premium because any energy fed back to the grid from the solar facility will only be credited at the basic electricity retail rate.

### Strategically growing the urban forest will improve our world [^b8a37dff]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Services from five urban forest types advance UN Sustainable Development Goals with varying significance

a #1 = no poverty, #2 = zero hunger, #3 = good health and well-being, #6 = clean water and sanitation, #7 = affordable and clean energy, #8 = descent work and economic growth, #11 = sustainable cities and communities, #13 = climate action, #15 = life on land

Healthcare, education, and military spending typically consume the largest fraction of governmental budgets, and trees assist with disease prevention, therapy, and recovery, making for a healthier and happier population. Urban forests can contribute to a tenth SDG of peace, just and strong institutions by providing shared spaces that enhance mixing of community across ages, cultures, and incomes. Evidence from urban forests suggests they contribute to an 11th SDG of industry, innovation, and infrastructure, generating $148 billion annually in the US from arboriculture and landscape design expenditures. London's urban forest was estimated to have 8,421,000 trees yielding annual benefits of £132.7 million (not including all services), a replacement cost of £6.12 billion, and an amenity value of £43.3 billion. The London study was extrapolated to the megacities of Beijing, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Istanbul, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, and Tokyo and estimated the annual benefit of forests within these metropolitan areas had a median annual value of $505 million, the potential to obtain nearly $1 billion in annual benefits, and an additional $7.9 billion in total value of carbon storage. With money effectively growing on trees, what could slow growth of the urban forest?

### Straight to test: introduction of a city-wide protocol driven investigation of suspected colorectal cancer [^c10dacd7]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To decrease waiting times for colorectal cancer diagnosis.

Methods

Following extensive negotiations on three sites, we replaced the standard referral route of GP to outpatient clinic with city-wide implementation of a protocol driven sequence based on the patient's declared symptoms, the initial consultation being replaced by the first test taking place within 31 days. No choice in test allocation was granted; difficult cases were adjudicated by named consultants. We used a 'dry run' to make sure that our planned changes would not overload our local capacity, leading to a pilot run involving 1/3 clinicians, followed by a full cross-city implementation over two months.

Results

In 2001, before the pilot only 116/188 (62%) of our colorectal cancers who were referred either under the 2-week-wait arrangements or on a 'soon' basis were diagnosed within 31 days of referral. Our 'dry run' established that we did have the capacity to service our planned sequence of tests. In the pilot, all colorectal cancers were diagnosed within 31 days of referral, and 95% of all diagnoses (no abnormality or benign disease) were reached within 31 days of referral. After full implementation 19/19 (100%) of our cancers coming through our protocol system were diagnosed within 31 days and 95% of patients with benign disease.

Conclusion

Follow-up audit of our system one and two years later shows that we now diagnose approximately 80% of our colorectal cancers who are referred under the 2 week wait or as 'soon' referrals within 31 days. We have successfully redesigned our service, at minimal expense, in a way, which should enable us to meet the government targets in the National Cancer Plan.

Cost control in CCL operations — labor is a major CCL expense, which can be minimized by ensuring that all CCL personnel are 'working at the top of the licensure', with down time minimized by preventing late starts, decreasing turnover times, and closing the CCL early on slow days, and overtime minimized by restricting after-hours procedures to those which clearly benefit patients and decrease length of stay; costs of disposable items used in a CCL are unknown to most interventionalists, making physicians aware that alternative products offer equal quality at less cost is often effective in changing their behavior, CCL managers should provide physicians with regular reports on their utilization of CCL time and equipment costs and how they compare to their peers in the same CCL, interventionalists' natural competitiveness may cause outliers to modify their practices, and costs of disposable supplies can be minimized through membership in buying groups, which leverage large numbers of buyers to obtain the lowest discounts from manufacturers.

### High-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training in adults with Crohn's disease: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^02443f97]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Interventions

All three groups received usual care, which comprised evidence-based medical treatment optimisation. Participants allocated to usual care did not receive any supervised exercise or exercise advice as part of the trial; however, following the final study assessment they were offered a telephone-based consultation with a research assistant who discussed their individual facilitators/barriers to exercise, and provided guidance on incorporating physical activity into their lifestyle.

Participants allocated to the HIIT and MICT groups were invited to complete three supervised exercise sessions per week for 12 consecutive weeks, commencing the week following their baseline assessment and randomisation. Reimbursement was provided for travel expenses. All exercise was undertaken on a leg cycle ergometer (Lode Corival or SRM Ergometer), with each session comprising a 5-min warm-up at 15% of peak power output (Wpeak; determined during the baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test), a main conditioning phase, and then a 3-min cool-down at 15% Wpeak. For HIIT, the conditioning phase involved ten 1-min bouts at 90% Wpeak, interspersed with 1-min bouts at 15% Wpeak (total session duration = 28 min), whereas for MICT it involved 30 min at 35% Wpeak (total session duration = 38 min). Heart rate (Polar FT1, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland), differential ratings for central (i.e. cardiopulmonary sensations) and leg exertion (RPE-C and RPE-L, respectively; Borg CR-10 scale), and general affective valence (i.e. pleasure and displeasure; 11-point feeling scale) were recorded at regular intervals during each session. The feeling scale data will be published elsewhere. Incremental cycle exercise testing to maximum volitional exertion was performed in the final sessions of weeks 4 and 8 to re-calculate Wpeak and determine if the power output of the upcoming exercise sessions needed to be changed.

After the initial 12-week supervised training period, all exercise group participants were encouraged to continue a similar exercise regime in their own home or community setting without the support of the trial team.

### DIET @ NET: best practice guidelines for dietary assessment in health research [^a61ec1cf]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

3.1 Are you interested in 'actual'/short-term (hours or several days, up to one week) or 'usual'/long-term intake (e.g. Months or years)? consider what reference period (e.g. Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) would be best suited to your dietary component of interest (essential)

Long-term average intake or the usual/habitual pattern differs from intake reported for a single day or a few days. Short-term intake (e.g. over a single day), such as a 24HR, only represents a snapshot in time but may provide less biased dietary data. More than one day of dietary information is preferred to estimate usual intake, since it can assess both within- and between-person variation. Nevertheless, to assess a mean population-level food or nutrient intake, one day of intake on a large sample will be adequate. Non-consecutive days may capture more individual variability. A single 24HR may not be sufficient to describe participants' long-term usual intake, in part because of social desirability bias and also day-to-day variation with reports of energy intake being higher on a weekend than on a weekday. Two recalls were found to be better than one, and three minimised the mean difference between reported and objectively measured intakes. However, self-report has been challenged in terms of suitability for measurement of energy intake, although it may be useful for adjustment of other nutrients to improve risk estimates.

### A method to estimate the economy-wide consequences of widespread, long duration electric power interruptions [^10ff5a29]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Figure 3, panel A elucidates the total (direct and indirect) household impacts. As fractions of baseline expenditure, short-duration interruptions have the largest impact on high-income households, while low-income households are most heavily impacted by a prolonged interruption. For 1 d and 3 d interruptions, low- and medium-income households' real expenditure falls by < 1%, and 2%–4%, respectively, while high-income households' real expenditure declines by up to twice as much. A 14 d interruption triggers expenditure losses of up to 16% for low-income households — and all households in Cook county — but 8%–14% for low- and particularly middle-income households in half of the micro-regions.

Figure 3, panel B elucidates the total (direct and indirect) sectoral impacts. A 1 d interruption induces real gross output reductions of < 2% in most sectors, with the exception of retail and wholesale trade & transport, whose declines are twice as large. In a 3 d interruption scenario output losses follow a similar but accentuated pattern, with additional 7%–10% real gross output reductions in agriculture, construction & mining in multiple regions, and utilities in Cook county. In a 14 d interruption, government, manufacturing, retail and particularly restaurants, entertainment & other services tend to be the most economically-resilient, with the latter increasing output by 2%–3% to satisfy households' increased demands for food outside the home. Conversely, hospitals, education, and especially utilities and wholesale trade & transport are especially vulnerable, experiencing as much as 11%–17% real output declines.

### Nutrition and physical activity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^5a4b7ac6]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Steps and energy expenditure categorization — In terms of number of steps taken, < 5,000 steps per day is considered sedentary, 5,000–7,500 steps per day is low active, 7,500–10,000 steps per day is somewhat active, and ~10,000 steps or more per day is active. Although variable, one Calorie (kcal) is "burned" for every 20 steps (i.e., 4,000 steps/200 Calories), and 10,000 steps per day x 7 days per week x one Calorie per 20 steps = 3500 Calories burned per week; the adage of "3500 Calories per pound of fat" is an approximation, and the amount of physical activity required to "burn 3500 Calories" depends on body weight and related efficiencies.
