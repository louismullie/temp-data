## Question

LDH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) across oncology, infectious disease, hepatology, critical care, and laboratory medicine contexts, including pitfalls, thresholds, and practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core biology and isoenzymes of LDH. Then, I should verify the prognostic role of LDH in cancer across major tumor types. Next, I will examine LDH in COVID-19 and other infections. After that, I need to check LDH in liver disease, sepsis, and hemolysis. I will then review LDH dynamics and serial monitoring. Finally, I should double-check pre-analytical issues, thresholds, and guideline-based recommendations before synthesizing a pragmatic clinical approach.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental biology and clinical meaning of LDH. LDH is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with NADH/NAD+ cycling; it exists as five tetrameric isoenzymes (LDH1–5) with tissue-specific distributions, so elevations reflect cellular injury or turnover rather than a disease-specific signal, which explains its nonspecificity in serum testing [^113fFuD9] [^11554ccX]. Hold on, I should verify the isoenzyme nomenclature and tissue sources: LDH1–2 predominate in heart and erythrocytes, LDH3 in lungs, and LDH4–5 in liver and skeletal muscle, which is why isoenzyme patterns can sometimes localize the source of injury, though they are rarely ordered in routine practice today [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine LDH as a prognostic biomarker in oncology. High serum LDH consistently portends worse survival across diverse cancers, reflecting tumor burden, hypoxia, Warburg metabolism, and immunosuppressive milieu; it is incorporated into multiple prognostic indices and staging schemas, including melanoma TNM, lymphoma IPI variants, and testicular cancer IGCCCG risk, and is emphasized by SITC as an essential baseline and on-treatment biomarker in immunotherapy protocols [^111NqonS] [^115d2Xq9] [^114VFD5W] [^117XZ4Wp]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of effect: in a large pooled analysis, elevated LDH was associated with an OS hazard ratio around 1.7, with stronger effects in renal cell, melanoma, gastric, prostate, nasopharyngeal, and lung cancers, reinforcing its broad prognostic value [^115d2Xq9].

> I should confirm tumor-specific nuances. In melanoma, baseline LDH is among the strongest adverse prognostic factors and stratifies outcomes with targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Pooled analyses show markedly inferior PFS and OS when LDH is elevated, especially at or above twice the ULN, and dynamic increases during therapy predict early progression and poorer survival [^1115tLct] [^112yxY7H]. In metastatic colorectal cancer, pretreatment LDH above ULN independently associates with shorter OS and may predict reduced benefit from antiangiogenic therapy, and longitudinal LDH dynamics improve survival prediction over baseline alone, supporting serial monitoring in select patients [^112811BC] [^114d1ZAV]. In small-cell lung cancer, elevated LDH correlates with worse survival in both limited and extensive disease, and in testicular germ cell tumors, LDH reflects tumor bulk and is used for IGCCCG risk stratification, though it is less specific than AFP and hCG and should not drive decisions when isolated and mildly elevated [^111FEP8C] [^113XbmKF] [^117XZ4Wp].

> Now, let me consider infectious disease, especially COVID-19. Multiple meta-analyses and cohort studies show that elevated LDH at presentation associates with a several-fold higher risk of severe disease and mortality, and dynamic changes track with radiographic progression or improvement; proposed thresholds such as a rise around 62.5 U/L have shown reasonable discrimination for progression, though I should emphasize these are study-specific and not universally validated [^112hbMuZ] [^111GHnw8] [^115yrVW6]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: LDH is nonspecific and may also rise with hepatic injury, hemolysis, or secondary infections in COVID-19, so I need to ensure clinical correlation and consider isoenzymes or parallel markers when the source is unclear [^114iuQSP] [^1165WDom].

> I will now examine hepatology contexts. Elevated LDH is common in liver diseases, including NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, and may reflect hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrogenesis; some NHANES-based analyses suggest LDH could complement standard liver tests, but I should double-check that these are observational and not yet practice-changing, so LDH should be interpreted alongside ALT, AST, GGT, and clinical context rather than as a standalone diagnostic test [^113fFuD9] [^11659giY]. But wait, what if LDH is disproportionately high relative to transaminases? That pattern can hint at ischemic hepatitis, infiltrative processes, or hemolysis, prompting me to review hemolysis indices, haptoglobin, and bilirubin before attributing it to hepatocellular injury alone [^notfound].

> Next, I should review critical care and sepsis. Elevated LDH correlates with 28-day mortality in sepsis cohorts and tracks with organ dysfunction markers, likely reflecting tissue hypoxia, endothelial injury, and cell death. However, it lacks specificity and should augment, not replace, lactate-guided resuscitation and clinical assessment in sepsis care pathways [^1168PDZD] [^115asmtM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated LDH with lactate there; lactate remains the cornerstone for resuscitation guidance and risk stratification in sepsis, whereas LDH serves as an adjunctive marker of cellular injury rather than a direct metabolic target in resuscitation algorithms [^111BdPwn] [^114jA46a].

> I need to ensure I cover hemolysis and mechanical circulatory support. LDH is a sensitive marker of intravascular hemolysis and is central to LVAD-associated hemolysis surveillance; early intervention at moderately elevated LDH reduces pump thrombosis and adverse events, and consensus criteria now incorporate LDH normalization or substantial reductions as response endpoints in transplant-associated TMA, underscoring its mechanistic and prognostic relevance in these settings [^111NkgaH] [^113PSN4X]. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: many programs use LDH ≥ 2.5× ULN to define hemolysis, but device- and lab-specific baselines matter, so trend analysis and corroborative markers like plasma free hemoglobin improve specificity and timeliness of detection [^111NkgaH] [^112evo8X].

> Let me consider LDH dynamics and serial monitoring. Changes in LDH during therapy can outperform baseline values for predicting outcomes in several cancers, including melanoma and colorectal cancer, and in COVID-19, serial LDH tracks disease trajectory and treatment response. However, I should confirm that rising LDH alone is insufficient to prove progression without clinical or radiographic correlation, given false positives from hemolysis, liver injury, or infection [^114d1ZAV] [^112yxY7H] [^112K4zAH]. I should double-check that guideline bodies increasingly endorse baseline and on-treatment LDH in immunotherapy protocols, reflecting its integration into modern biomarker panels alongside NLR and CRP, while acknowledging its nonspecificity and the need for contextual interpretation [^115d2Xq9].

> Next, I should review pre-analytical and laboratory pitfalls. Plasma LDH is systematically higher than serum due to platelet contamination and lysis with storage, so serum is preferred for consistency; hemolysis markedly elevates LDH and can mimic disease progression, so I need to check hemolysis indices and, if present, repeat testing before acting on an isolated LDH rise [^114SjTWt] [^11554ccX]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: plasma LDH averaged about 22% higher than serum in paired samples, reinforcing the need to standardize specimen type longitudinally in the same patient [^114SjTWt].

> I should confirm practical thresholds and cutoffs, while cautioning that they are assay- and cohort-specific. In COVID-19, a rise near 62.5 U/L has been used to flag progression, but this is not a universal rule; in oncology, LDH above ULN generally confers worse prognosis, with more pronounced risk at ≥ 2× ULN in melanoma and other solid tumors; in hemolysis and LVAD care, LDH ≥ 2.5× ULN triggers evaluation and intervention in many programs, but institutional baselines and clinical context should guide action [^115yrVW6] [^1115tLct] [^111NkgaH]. Hold on, I should verify that these thresholds complement, not replace, clinical judgment and imaging, especially when deciding to switch therapies or escalate care [^1115tLct].

> Let me synthesize a clinical approach. First, confirm the result and exclude hemolysis and specimen issues. Then, interpret LDH within the disease-specific context: in cancer, integrate LDH with stage, performance status, and other biomarkers. In COVID-19, pair LDH with inflammatory markers and imaging. In liver disease, align with liver enzymes and fibrosis scores. In sepsis, prioritize lactate and perfusion assessment while using LDH as an organ injury adjunct. In suspected hemolysis or LVAD complications, act on LDH trends with confirmatory testing and device parameters [^115d2Xq9] [^114jA46a] [^111NkgaH]. I need to ensure I emphasize that LDH is most powerful when trended serially and interpreted alongside the clinical picture, rather than as a standalone diagnostic test [^114d1ZAV].

> Finally, I should double-check guideline anchors to avoid overreach. SITC recommends baseline and on-treatment LDH in immunotherapy, NCCN incorporates LDH into melanoma staging and testicular cancer risk stratification, and consensus statements use LDH response criteria in TMA. Conversely, routine LDH in broad order sets has been discouraged due to low specificity, so ordering should be indication-driven and results contextualized to avoid unnecessary alarms and investigations [^115d2Xq9] [^117XZ4Wp] [^113PSN4X] [^111NqonS] [^11554ccX]. Hold on, I should verify that these positions align with current practice patterns and that I have balanced the prognostic value against the risk of false positives, which they do, provided clinicians adhere to disease-specific protocols and serial interpretation principles [^117XZ4Wp] [^115d2Xq9].

LDH is a **nonspecific marker of tissue injury** [^11554ccX] elevated in cancer, hemolysis, liver disease, infections, and muscle injury [^114iuQSP] [^111NqonS]. In oncology, **high LDH predicts worse outcomes** [^111xBY75] and is used for staging and prognosis [^111NqonS] [^117XZ4Wp], especially in lymphoma, melanoma, and germ cell tumors [^114VFD5W] [^1115tLct] [^117XZ4Wp]. In COVID-19, elevated LDH correlates with severity and mortality [^112hbMuZ] [^111GHnw8]. LDH is not specific; interpret with clinical context and other tests [^11554ccX].

## Biological function and isoenzymes

LDH catalyzes the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate [^113fFuD9], regenerating NAD+ for glycolysis. It has **five isoenzymes** (LDH-1 to LDH-5) with distinct tissue distributions:

| **Isoenzyme** | **Predominant tissue** |
|-|-|
| LDH-1 | Heart, red blood cells |
| LDH-2 | Heart, red blood cells |
| LDH-3 | Lungs, lymphoid tissue |
| LDH-4 | Liver, skeletal muscle |
| LDH-5 | Liver, skeletal muscle |

## Clinical significance of elevated LDH

Elevated LDH is a **nonspecific indicator of tissue injury** [^11554ccX] and is seen in:

- **Cancer**: Lymphoma, melanoma, germ cell tumors, lung, liver, and other solid tumors [^111xBY75] [^114VFD5W] [^1115tLct] [^113XbmKF].

## LDH in infectious diseases

In COVID-19, elevated LDH correlates with **severity and mortality** [^112hbMuZ] [^111GHnw8] and is a useful marker of disease progression and treatment response [^112K4zAH] [^115yrVW6]. In sepsis, elevated LDH is associated with **increased mortality** and reflects tissue damage and inflammation [^1168PDZD].

---

## LDH in liver disease

In liver disease, LDH is elevated in hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver metastases and reflects hepatocyte injury and necrosis [^1113VVVZ] [^11659giY]. In NAFLD, elevated LDH is associated with **advanced fibrosis** and poor prognosis [^113fFuD9] [^11659giY].

---

## LDH in hemolysis and muscle injury

In hemolysis, LDH is released from ruptured RBCs and is a **sensitive marker of intravascular hemolysis** [^114Bw26b]. In muscle injury, LDH rises in rhabdomyolysis and myocardial infarction and reflects muscle cell necrosis [^114qoNNp] [^116E5z8K].

---

## Limitations and considerations

LDH is **nonspecific**; interpret alongside clinical context and other tests [^11554ccX]. Hemolysis and sample handling can falsely elevate LDH; ensure quality control [^114SjTWt]. Serial measurements can help assess treatment response and disease progression [^111NqonS] [^114d1ZAV].

---

LDH is a **nonspecific marker of tissue injury** elevated across cancer, hemolysis, liver disease, infections, and muscle injury. It is a key prognostic biomarker in oncology and correlates with severity in COVID-19 and sepsis; interpret with clinical context and other tests [^111xBY75].

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^117DAB7u]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults notes that an elevated serum lactate is associated with sepsis and part of the definition of septic shock, but that "a serum lactate level alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnosing sepsis and should be interpreted based on the clinical context and with consideration for other causes of an elevated lactate level"; for these reasons, "a weak recommendation is made for measurement of serum lactate levels in adults suspected of having sepsis".

### Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels detected during routine follow-up do not predict relapse in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who achieve complete remission after primary treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone-like immunochemotherapy [^116EJiEi]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2012). Low credibility.

A significant minority of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who enter a complete remission following standard first-line immunochemotherapy will relapse. A primary aim of follow-up is to detect early relapse, with the hope of improving outcome following salvage chemotherapy. It is often routine to measure lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as part of follow-up; however, the evidence for the utility of LDH as a predictor for relapse is scant. A retrospective analysis of the LDH results recorded during the follow-up of 102 patients with DLBCL who achieved a CR following treatment was undertaken in order to determine the utility of LDH as a predictor for relapse (median follow-up 24 months). Despite the fact that the sensitivity of LDH was 69% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39–91), the positive predictive value (PPV) of a raised LDH was only 9/63, 14% (95% CI 6.7–25). Furthermore, in eight of the nine patients who had a raised LDH prior to relapse, symptoms suggestive of relapse were documented simultaneously. As the PPV of a raised LDH is so low and because a raised LDH may cause unnecessary worry, leading to unnecessary radiological investigations, routine evaluation of LDH in patients with DLBCL who achieve CR and who are asymptomatic is not recommended.

### Association of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and advanced hepatic fibrosis in the United States: a cross-sectional study using NHANES data from 2007 to 2018 [^11659giY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Relevant covariates such as ALT, AST, TC, TG, and GGT were included due to the impact of relevant biomarkers on the liver. The reasons for selecting LDH as the primary biomarker over other potential candidates are further interpreted in the subsequent biological mechanisms. The abnormal energy metabolism presented in NAFLD and AHF is of particular interest. LDH, a key enzyme in energy metabolism, significantly impacts the disease process with other biomarkers. Moreover, it becomes evident that acute liver injury might be related to LDH and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, resulting in an increase in lactate accumulation within the nucleus, which exacerbates liver damage and ultimately leads to cell death. LDH is more sensitive to liver injury than ALT and AST, which is more representative of liver fibrosis than other biomarkers. Oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver play a key role in the progression of AHF. Due to the presence of long-term abnormal metabolic processes in both NAFLD and AHF, such as lipid accumulation and insulin resistance, which ultimately lead to hepatocyte apoptosis, LDH levels are elevated. This ultimately leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1) and Kupffer cells, which can exacerbate liver injury and liver fibrosis. Oxidative stress also increases LDH levels through cellular destruction, leading to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate hematopoietic stem cells and stimulate the production of extracellular matrix and other substances that play an important role in the process of liver fibrosis. In addition, lactate, a byproduct of LDH activity, has been shown to enhance TGF-β1 signaling through the lactate-GPR81 axis, ultimately leading to increased production of fibrosis-related factors. While other biomarkers may also reflect liver injury or oxidative stress to some extent, they have their limitations. LDH can complement these biomarkers to provide insight into the pathogenesis of NAFLD and AHF. Additionally, the acetylation of LDH in NAFLD leads to an imbalance of lactate metabolism, hastening the progression of NAFLD. Elevated LDH has been associated with a variety of diseases, and its value as a parameter in the management and monitoring of AHF is significant. Although the associations do not imply causality, they are useful in guiding subsequent clinical monitoring. In clinical settings, LDH can play a major role in the diagnosis of AHF, as elevated levels may prompt medical professionals to exercise caution regarding the potential for AHF in their patients. The findings of this study indicated that elevated levels of log-transformed LDH were associated with AHF prevalence, which led to earlier identification of high-risk groups for related diseases in clinical settings. Especially for patients with risk factors (e.g. male, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, etc.), physicians should consider the medical history, clinical presentation, laboratory tests, medical history, and physical examinations in a timely manner to diagnose and treat patients. LDH levels are also an indicator of disease progression in AHF, and an increase in LDH levels may indicate a worsening of the degree of liver injury. Therefore, continuous measurement of LDH levels in the clinic will enable clinicians to better understand the extent of liver injury and take more proactive interventions. For patients with NAFLD and AHF who have elevated LDH levels, physicians can recommend lifestyle modifications, timely exercise, weight loss, a healthy diet, and reduction of alcohol consumption and smoking. Our subgroup analysis shows that NAFLD and AHF are often associated with hypertension, diabetes, and other complications, so controlling blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood lipids in patients with elevated LDH levels would be effective in preventing the disease. However, there is no evidence to recommend routine monitoring of LDH, and its use as a biomarker of AHF requires further validation for clinical use. Further research promises to better understand the underlying pathophysiology of the disease and refine our understanding of energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

### The multiple roles of LDH in cancer [^111xBY75]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

High serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are typically associated with a poor prognosis in many cancer types. Even the most effective drugs, which have radically improved outcomes in patients with melanoma over the past decade, provide only marginal benefit to those with high serum LDH levels. When viewed separately from the oncological, biochemical, biological and immunological perspectives, serum LDH is often interpreted in very different ways. Oncologists usually see high serum LDH only as a robust biomarker of a poor prognosis, and biochemists are aware of the complexity of the various LDH isoforms and of their key roles in cancer metabolism, whereas LDH is typically considered to be oncogenic and/or immunosuppressive by cancer biologists and immunologists. Integrating these various viewpoints shows that the regulation of the five LDH isoforms, and their enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions is closely related to key oncological processes. In this Review, we highlight that serum LDH is far more than a simple indicator of tumour burden; it is a complex biomarker associated with the activation of several oncogenic signalling pathways as well as with the metabolic activity, invasiveness and immunogenicity of many tumours, and constitutes an extremely attractive target for cancer therapy.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at presentation predict outcome of patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer [^11724raM]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a biochemical parameter that is elevated in the majority of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). In this study, distribution and prognostic importance of serum LDH in limited-disease SCLC were investigated. Serum concentrations of LDH were measured in 184 patients at initial examination. These results were compared with prospectively recorded clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcome data. Significant positive association was found between LDH levels and weight loss, performance status, response to chemotherapy, and albumin but not between age, gender, and hemoglobin values. Patients with high concentrations of LDH had a significantly worse prognosis than did patients with normal levels. The probability of overall survival at 1 year was 60.2% in patients with normal serum LDH levels and 33.1% in patients with higher values (p = 0.0017). Also, the prognostic value of LDH on overall survival was shown in multivariate analysis (p = 0.05). At the time of diagnosis, serum levels of LDH appear to have a significant relation to outcome in patients with limited-stage SCLC.

### Hemolysis: a harbinger of adverse outcome after left ventricular assist device implant [^112evo8X]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical relevance of elevated serum markers of hemolysis during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support has not been fully ascertained.

Methods

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum free hemoglobin (sfHg) values were tallied monthly in 182 patients on HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) LVAD support. Peak values for each marker were identified, and 2 hemolysis definitions were applied to the cohort: Hemolysis according to Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) criteria (sfHg > 40 mg/dl with signs/symptoms) and/or hemolysis defined by an LDH ≥ 600 IU/liter (2.5-times the upper limit of laboratory normal). Kaplan-Meier survival free from death, urgent United Network of Organ Sharing 1A transplant for thrombosis, device exchange for thrombosis, and stroke/peripheral embolism was estimated, and Cox hazard ratios (HR) with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for predicting 1-year event-free survival were calculated.

Results

Hemolysis occurred in 32 patients (18%) by INTERMACS criteria and in 68 (37%) patients by LDH criteria. Over a median (25(th), 75(th)) support of 427 days (245, 793 days), there were 78 events. One year event-free survival after the onset of INTERMACS-defined hemolysis was 16% ± 8.3% compared with 85% ± 3.2% in non-hemolyzers (HR, 14.7; 95% CI, 7.9–27; AUC 0.70 ± 0.05; p < 0.001;). One year event-free survival after the onset of LDH-defined hemolysis was 32% ± 7.2% compared with 89% ± 3.2% in those with persistent LDH values < 600 IU/liter (HR, 8.0; 95% CI, 4.4–14; AUC 0.87 ± 0.04; p < 0.001). Patients who met the LDH hemolysis definition had longer times from hemolysis onset to clinical events and larger magnitudes of risk for embolism and device exchange for thrombosis than those with INTERMACS hemolysis.

Conclusions

Serum hemolysis marker elevations are associated with increased events in LVAD patients. LDH monitoring provides an earlier diagnosis of adverse events than sfHg, supporting need for a new INTERMACS definition of VAD-associated hemolysis.

### Real-world testing of serum lactate dehydrogenase among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the United States [^117BVijf]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

In this real-world study that included over 15 000 patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the United States, rates of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) testing were low, with only one-fifth of patients having undergone testing. LDH above the upper limit of normal was associated with an increased risk of shorter overall survival; however, in the absence of specific guidance, LDH testing is currently suboptimal and not widely considered standard of care for patients with mCRC. The results of this study suggest that greater adoption of early LDH testing in clinical practice could help guide treatment decisions.

### The MIMIC study: prognostic role and cutoff definition of monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio and lactate dehydrogenase levels in metastatic colorectal cancer [^112ZuyHu]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are circulating biomarkers that provide information about tumor-related inflammation and immune suppression. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of MLR and LDH in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

Material and Methods

This multicentric study analyzed a consecutive cohort of 528 patients with mCRC treated in 2009–2017. The whole population was randomly divided in training and validation cohort. The first was used to identify a threshold for MLR and to create the prognostic model with MLR and MLR-LDH combined (group 1: MLR-LDH low; group 2: MLR or LDH high; group 3: MLR-LDH high). The second cohort was used to validate the model.

Results

At the median follow-up of 55 months, median overall survival (OS) was 22 months. By multivariate analysis, high MLR > 0.49 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.37; 95% confidence interval [C. I.], 1.39–4.04), high LDH (HR, 1.73; 95% C. I., 1.03–2.90) in the first model, group 2 (HR, 2.74; 95% C. I.; 1.62–4.66), and group 3 (HR, 3.73; 95% C. I., 1.94–7.18) in the combined model, had a worse prognosis in terms of OS. These data were confirmed both in the validation set and then in the whole cohort.

Conclusion

MLR and LDH are circulating cost-effective biomarkers, readily available in clinical practice, that can be useful for predicting the prognosis of patients with mCRC.

Implications For Practice

High monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels could be a sign of a tumor's recruitment of suppressive and inflammatory cells worsening prognosis of different types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Currently, no data are available for metastatic CRC regarding a cutoff definition for MLR or the prognostic impact of MLR and MLR-LDH combined. The present study showed in the training cohort and confirmed in the validation and whole cohort that MLR is a reliable and independent laboratory biomarker, which is easy to use, to predict clinical outcomes in patients with mCRC. Moreover, MLR and composite MLR-LDH could potentially result in an incremental improvement in the prognostic value of these biomarkers, being used as stratification tools for patients with mCRC.

### Elevated lactate dehydrogenase concentrations in plasma compared to serum [^114SjTWt]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the difference in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in plasma vs serum specimens in our patient population.

Materials and Methods

We measured LDH in 110 paired plasma and serum specimens over a 2-week period. Hemolytic indices were performed on each specimen. These paired specimens were drawn in a single setting and stored under the same conditions. For the last 14 paired specimens, cell counts were performed on the plasma/serum.

Results

Plasma LDH was on average 22% higher than serum LDH. There was no difference in the hemolytic indices between the plasma and the serum specimens. In the last 14 specimens, cell counts revealed increased platelets in the plasma specimens compared to the serum specimens.

Conclusion

We propose switching back to using serum for LDH testing because there was unpredictable elevation in plasma LDH concentrations. These elevations in LDH levels may be linked to the platelets present in plasma and that may lyse or become activated with storage at refrigerated temperature.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early-stage testicular cancer: AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^111ZgmDD]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

American Urological Association guideline — staging with serum tumor markers and IGCCCG risk — Nadir serum tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) should be repeated at appropriate T1/2 time intervals after orchiectomy for staging and risk stratification (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). For patients with elevated AFP or hCG post-orchiectomy, clinicians should monitor serum tumor markers to establish nadir levels before treatment only if marker nadir levels would influence treatment (Clinical Principle). For patients with metastatic GCT (Stage IIC or III) requiring chemotherapy, clinicians must base chemotherapy regimen and number of cycles on the IGCCCG risk stratification, with IGCCCG risk stratification based on nadir serum tumor marker (hCG, AFP and LDH) levels obtained prior to the initiation of chemotherapy, staging imaging studies, and tumor histology following radical orchiectomy (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Any post-pubertal male, regardless of age, should be treated according to adult treatment guidelines (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). For patients in whom serum tumor marker (AFP and hCG) levels are borderline elevated (within 3x upper limit of normal) post-orchiectomy, a rising trend should be confirmed before management decisions are made as false-positive elevations may occur (Clinical Principle).

### Prognostic relevance of lactate dehydrogenase and serum S100 levels in stage IV melanoma with known BRAF mutation status [^116Bv464]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Activating mutations of BRAF provide an important treatment target in patients with melanoma. The prognostic role of several biochemical markers in relation to mutation status is not clear.

Objectives

To analyse the prognostic significance of BRAF mutation in patients with melanoma and correlate it to different markers.

Methods

In total, 162 patients with stage IV melanoma and known BRAF mutation status were included. Clinical, histopathological and laboratory information was collected and compared between patients with BRAF mutant (BRAFm) and wild-type (BRAFwt) melanoma at the time of first distant metastasis.

Results

In total, 88 patients (54%) had BRAFm melanoma (V600E/V600K). At the first distant metastasis, S100B levels in BRAFm patients were more frequently elevated (P = 0·01) and significantly higher (P = 0·02). Median overall survival (mOS) was significantly longer in BRAFwt patients with normal compared with patients with elevated S100B levels (P < 0·01). In BRAFm melanoma, elevated S100B levels showed no prognostic influence (P = 0·18). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels had a significantly negative impact on mOS in both groups. mOS was increased for BRAFm patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) compared with BRAFm patients not receiving BRAFi (P = 0·01). No difference in mOS between BRAFm patients who did not receive BRAFi treatment and BRAFwt patients was observed.

Conclusions

Better mOS was observed in BRAFm patients treated with BRAFi. BRAFm patients not treated with BRAFi show similar survival curves to BRAFwt patients. Elevated LDH is a BRAF-independent prognostic parameter; S100B has prognostic significance in BRAFwt melanoma only.

Predictive value of the LDH level to clinical overcome

Following, to determine the optimal cut-off level for an increase or decrease in LDH indicating progress or improvement, ROC curves were calculated. Variations in adjacent LDH levels were computed as a function of the difference around the data of chest CT scan. As shown in Fig. 3, the optimal prognostic "cut-off value of LDH increase" predicting progress of the chest CT image was found to be 62.50 U/L. Applying the cut-off criterion, the sensitivity for disease progression was found to be 73.1% and the specificity was found to be 89.3%. The optimal prognostic "cut-off value of LDH decrease" predicting improvement of the chest CT image was found to be 48.5 U/L, its sensitivity and specificity was found to be 67.3 and 56.0%, respectively.

### Serum glucose, lactate dehydrogenase and hypertension are mediators of the effect of body mass index on severity of COVID-19 [^113eX749]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we find that baseline patient‐related and laboratory parameters in combination can be used to risk stratify COVID‐19 patients. Glycaemia and LDH levels have key roles in mediating the effect of BMI on the severity and outcome of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and should be considered a target for public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic. The current findings have important clinical implications as they suggest that the cardiometabolic risk factors linked in a much stronger way to COVID‐19 severity than to other forms of viral pneumonias may be modulating innate immune responses in a way that could be mediated by a Warburg immunological effect. Our results also suggest the need to look at therapeutic strategies for glyceamic control at earlier stages of the disease progression.

### Clinical evaluation of potential usefulness of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia [^115Rsc4V]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There was much evidence suggesting that the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels reflect the extent of various pathophysiological processes. However, the current information about dynamic change of LDH in COVID-19 pneumonia has not been well investigated.

Methods

Study was performed in 87 cases confirmed by COVID-19 infection. The serum LDH levels were determined at diagnosis and follow-up visits. The evaluation of clinical response to therapy was based on chest CT scan. We selected the value of LDH around the data of chest CT scan (− 1 ~ + 1 day).

Results

At diagnosis, significant differences in LDH levels were found between non-severe and severe group (P < 0.05). It was demonstrated that increase or decrease of LDH was indicative of radiographic progress or improvement (P < 0.05). The time to LDH normalization (5.67 ± 0.55, days) was positively correlated with the time to radiographic absorption (5.57 ± 0.65 days, r = 0.53, P < 0.05). Applying the cut-off value of the increase in LDH has good specificity to predict disease progression.

Conclusions

Serum LDH was validated for its potential usefulness as markers for evaluating clinical severity and monitoring treatment response in COVID-19 pneumonia.

Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase

Hauschild et al. performed a pooled analysis of four randomized clinical trials (BRIM-2, NCT00949702; BRIM-3, NCT00949702; BRIM-7, NCT01271803; and coBRIM, NCT01689519) and, by using a recursive partitioning decision tree, identified baseline LDH levels, ECOG PS, and disease burden as crucial determinants of survival outcomes for patients treated with cTT. Patients with normal LDH levels at baseline and without liver metastases showed a median 3-year PFS of 26.9 months (95% CI 16.1–37.8) on V + C. In comparison, patients with elevated LDH levels at baseline (≥ 2 × ULN) had a median PFS of only 2.9 months (95% CI 0.0–8.4). The ORR ranged from 54.3% in patients with the poorest prognostic characteristic (LDH levels ≥ 2 × ULN) to 77.1% for patients with the most favorable characteristics (normal LDH levels, absence of liver metastases). A CR occurred in 30.5% of patients with normal LDH levels and absence of liver metastases at baseline, compared with 2.9% of patients with elevated LDH levels (≥ 2 × ULN). For D + T, the pooled analysis by Robert et al. of the COMBI-d and COMBI-v trials showed a similar survival outcome regarding baseline LDH levels. At 5 years, patients with normal LDH levels at baseline showed a PFS rate of 25% (95% CI 20–30), compared with 8% (95% CI 4–13) for patients with elevated LDH levels at baseline. In comparison to the pooled analysis by Hauschild et al. which detected the presence/absence of liver metastasis as a prognostic factor, Robert et al. presented higher PFS rates for patients with less than three metastatic disease sites in addition to normal LDH levels at baseline (5-year PFS rate 31%; 95% CI 24–38). For E + B, no respective data for patients with elevated LDH levels at baseline are available yet.

### Lactate dehydrogenase as promising marker for prognosis of brain metastasis [^115MwLzz]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a biomarker for cancer. However, the relationship between serum LDH levels and the survival of patients with brain metastasis has been fully revealed. We aimed to evaluate the serum LDH levels and assess its prognostic value in patients with BM.

Methods

The serum LDH levels were collected from 2507 patients with BM. Patients were categorized into four groups according to the quartile of serum LDH levels. The association between serum LDH levels and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier curves. Three predictive models were used to evaluate patients.

Results

The Kaplan-Meier curve for survival by the serum LDH group demonstrates clear separation between four groups (P < 0.001). The participants in the lower group had longer OS than those in the higher group. After adjusting in multivariate Cox regression models remained significant for patients in the Q4 compared with patients in the Q1 (Q4:Q1 OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.38–1.80). Furthermore, the GPA-LDH model generates a pooled area under the curve of 0.630 (95% CI 0.600, 0.660).

Conclusions

Serum LDH levels and OS in patients with brain metastasis is an inverse association. Moreover, Serum LDH levels can improve the prognosis of the GPA model.

### Association of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and advanced hepatic fibrosis in the United States: a cross-sectional study using NHANES data from 2007 to 2018 [^1113VVVZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent research has shown that lactate plays a significant metabolic role in the liver. Lactate is primarily metabolized in the liver, and the balance of its metabolism is particularly crucial for the whole body. While under normal circumstances, the production and elimination capacity of lactate are in balance, in certain pathological states, an imbalance between these capacities can result in elevated blood lactate concentrations, contributing to a devastating effect in various chronic pathophysiological diseases. Lactate has been implicated in the process of histone acetylation in various pathological conditions such as cancer, hepatitis, liver failure, and other related conditions. Lactate metabolism is significantly influenced by the glycolytic enzyme known as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). LDH is composed of three subunits, namely LDHA, LDHB, and LDHC, which can assemble into six tetrameric isoenzymes. The distribution of these isoenzymes is extensive across various human tissues, with the kidneys having the highest levels, followed by the myocardium, skeletal muscle, and liver. From the study published in 2021, we can conclude that LDH activity is increased in 46 out of the 48 diseases mentioned in this article, including hepatic encephalopathy, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and other liver-related conditions, indicating that LDH's widespread utility as a biomarker for these diseases. Nevertheless, there has not been a comprehensive comparison of serum LDH activity and its fluctuations among different diseases, nor has there been an investigation into its association with NAFLD or its impact on disease progression.

In this study, we calculated the basic data characteristics of log-transformed LDH, NAFLD, and AHF in the NHANES database. Various statistical methods, such as weighted multivariable logistic regression, linear regression, weighted stratified analysis, and the weighted smoothed curve fitting using the GAM, were employed to explore the association between log-transformed LDH and NAFLD, as well as AHF, with the aim of offering additional insights for the clinical application of LDH.

### The regulation and function of lactate dehydrogenase A: therapeutic potential in brain tumor [^116mBYmo]. Brain Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

and Tumor Malignancy

Abnormal LDHA upregulation and LDHB downregulation is a common characteristic of tumors, which promotes a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis, generating lactate as a by‐product. Elevated lactate concentrations have been shown to predict tumor malignancy, recurrence, survival and metastasis in cancer patients 9, 135, 136. Serum LDH concentrations have also been shown to be a good prognostic marker of many types of cancer 50, 78, 91, 139. LDHA overexpression is also associated with many other poor prognostic factors, including tumor hypoxia 111, angiogenesis 59, proliferation and glucose uptake 41, as well as resistance to chemotherapy 66 and radiotherapy 67. Furthermore, in non‐small‐cell lung cancer, which commonly metastasizes to the brain, LDHA expression and NF‐κβ are synergistically associated with death and recurrence 88. Several studies have also demonstrated that LDHA has a role in tumor formation, maintenance and progression 27, 72, 75; however, there has not been adequate research into the use of LDHA as a prognostic marker for brain tumors.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase and survival following cancer diagnosis [^112X27KV]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

We observed a borderline inverse trend between LDH and head and neck cancer death, although our analysis was limited by the number of events. The unique distribution of LDH subunits may explain different associations of serum expression of LDH with specific cancer types. Supporting this notion, our observation of average LDH levels measured by 6-month intervals before diagnosis showed varying trends across different cancer sites that may indicate a different extent of aerobic glycolysis with respect to cancer types. It is known that the majority of LDH subunits detected in the serum is LDH-B, although LDH-A exists in a lesser amount. The absence of LDH-B expression and its enzyme activities have been reported in cell lines of breast, prostate, gastric and pancreatic cancer, suggested to be driven by promoter hypermethylation. As LDH-B kinetically favours the backward reaction of pyruvate–lactate conversion, this may suggest that LDH-A, which mostly catalyses the formation of lactate, is more relevant to cancer than LDH-B. However, recent evidence has shown that higher tissue expression of LDH-B correlates to overall survival in lung cancer and treatment response in breast cancer, highlighting the role of LDH-B in cancer progression. Given the scarcity of data regarding the long-term impact of differential LDH expression on cancer survival, further investigations are needed to confirm the clinical usefulness of LDH with respect to its subunits or isoenzymes.

### Lactate dehydrogenase and susceptibility to deterioration of mild COVID-19 patients: a multicenter nested case-control study [^112PnEDK]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first known analysis to focus on identifying high-risk COVID-19 patients for developing severe illness. To identify a small portion of high-risk patients among the whole population of mild patients, we excluded those who presented with severe illness on admission, thus only comparing patients with stable mild illness and those who deteriorated from mild to severe illness.

The initial symptoms and signs in COVID-19 patients were usually very mild. However, as the disease progresses, some patients' symptoms would deteriorate. According to public data of China CDC and previous studies, about 8–30% of patients would eventually develop severe illness and about 1–11% of patients would die. Guan et al. reported that 40% of ICU patients were non-severe on admission. With proactive screening of close contacts and quicker diagnostic procedures, this proportion may be even higher. Comparing the mild cases with or without deterioration will help clinicians identifying potentially critical patients earlier, allocating medical resources more reasonably, paying more attention to these patients, thus giving necessary interventions as early as possible. Previous studies have uncovered that there were numerous disparities in background illness, vital signs, and laboratory parameters between mild and severe patients, including lymphocytes, prothrombin time, creatine kinase, LDH, and so on. However, which parameter dynamic change that initiates earlier remains unanswered.

LDH is a cytoplasmic glycolytic enzyme found in almost every tissue. Its elevation generally indicates tissue damage. Raised LDH was a common findings in patients infected with MERS-CoV, H7N9, and H5N1. It was reported to be an independent factor of mortality for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and H1N1 infection. It was also one of the biomarkers most strongly associated with ARDS mortality. Our finding of increased LDH in the early phase of severe COVID-19 cases suggested possible subclinical tissue damage. Although the virus binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the lung, which explains why the lungs are the first organs affected, but as the disease progresses, various cytokine abnormalities and multiple organs dysfunction can be found in severe patients, indicating systemic organ damage caused by the excessive activation of the immune system. LDH isoenzymes test can further help to locate damaged tissues or organs.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase and survival following cancer diagnosis [^117ET2qh]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

In addition to the positive association between prediagnostic LDH and death following cancer diagnosis, we were able to demonstrate the importance of timing in LDH measurement. Lactate dehydrogenase measured within 12 months before the diagnosis of cancer was shown to be strongly associated with overall and cancer-specific death, further indicating the relevance between LDH and tumour growth or severity. The positive association between LDH measured within 30 to 36 months before diagnosis and risk of overall as well as breast cancer death further signifies the importance of assessing cancer-specific death, especially because higher LDH is also linked to cardiovascular disease and mortality.

The strengths of our study included the prospectively collected serum LDH before the diagnosis of cancer. Complete follow-up was obtained and all laboratory measurements were performed in the same laboratory. Although a number of studies have indicated the association between LDH and overall survival, this is the first population-based study linking baseline LDH and cancer-specific survival. A limitation of our study is the lack of information on cancer treatment, and given the long period of recruitment (1986–1999), variation in management of cancer may affect timing of cancer diagnosis and its survival. We therefore accounted for period of diagnosis in our analyses as a proxy for difference in screening and treatment over time. Information on race/ethnicity was not available; however, the AMORIS cohort was similar to the general working population of Stockholm that comprised ∼80% Swedish-born individuals in 2000. Serum LDH increases because of other conditions such as myocardial infarction, inflammation and tissue injury, and therefore is not a specific marker of tumour. Higher LDH at baseline may otherwise indicate inflammation or other disorders involved in pathways leading to cancer development. However, we limited our analysis to 3 years before diagnosis to exclude reverse causation and adjusted for CCI in the analysis to take into account other diseases that may have predisposed one to worse survival. Nevertheless, residual confounding may occur. In addition, we did not have information on LDH subunits or isoenzymes and tumour characteristics such as stage, receptor status and histological grade. However, associations between LDH and all-cause or specific cancer death in breast cancer patients were not affected by tumour stage. For several cancers such as lymphoma, the combination between serum LDH and tumour characteristics shows to be useful in predicting treatment response and prognosis. Thus, extrapolating our findings to clinic may require similar combination approaches with other biological markers in order to identify patients at higher risks of dying from cancer.

### Lactate dehydrogenase elevations is associated with severity of COVID-19: a meta-analysis [^116254ja]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that measuring LDH might be helpful in predicting whether COVID-19 will evolve into a more severe state. This conclusion has its reasonable grounds. LDH, a cytoplasmatic enzyme, can be found in basically every main organ system. If cell lysis occurs, or cell membranes are damaged, LDH will be released into the extracellular space. In acute inflammation, the changes in cells are manifested as neutrophils influx which may be the cause of the lung damages occurred and the production of the toxicity of cells. The cytotoxicity of neutrophils was suggested as being related to ARDS. LDH elevations are related to the aforementioned cell damage or inflammation or both.

Our meta-analysis has a few limitations. All studies are from China. In order to exclude the influence of the genetic factor, data from other countries should be compared. Due to the nature of reporting in the emerging outbreak, we do not conduct a risk of bias assessment. Future analyses need to aim at confirming the results of this paper as well as pooling data to find other laboratory markers of severe COVID-19.

We confirm that LDH elevations are associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19. It can be used to provide predictions for the severe disease during hospitalization to guarantee proper clinical care for the patients.

### Comparison of different criteria for the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis reveals limited clinical utility for measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase [^111CM9Xf]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Primary myelofibrosis shows histological and pathogenetic overlap with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. Several diagnostic classifications have been proposed for primary myelofibrosis, although little is known about their clinical utility. In a comparison of three recent classifications, overall concordance was 79%. Inclusion of raised serum lactate dehydrogenase categorized 9% of patients as primary myelofibrosis when other criteria were not met. Although mean serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in patients with primary myelofibrosis, levels were also increased in the majority of patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera, and significant overlap was observed. A positive correlation with higher leukocyte and platelet count, and disease duration in primary myelofibrosis, suggests that serum lactate dehydrogenase is a biomarker for disease bulk and/or cellular proliferation. In conclusion, raised lactate dehydrogenase lacks specificity for primary myelofibrosis, consistent with the concept of a phenotypic continuum between essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis.

### Common and rare variants associating with serum levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase [^116E5z8K]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The release of intracellular enzymes into the serum is an indicator of tissue damage and physiological cell turnover. Thus, measurements of intracellular enzymes in serum are widely used to diagnose tissue damage, monitor its course and severity and gauge the effect of therapy.

Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme, catalyzing the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of creatine that is important for energy buffering in tissues with variable energy demands, most notably skeletal and cardiac muscle. Elevated serum CK levels can indicate tissue damage, and are observed in a number of pathological conditions, including statin-induced myopathy. Monitoring changes in serum CK levels is therefore important in statin-treated patients who display muscle pain or weakness, and in patients deemed at risk of rhabdomyolysis for various reasons.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme with a ubiquitous expression. It is responsible for catalyzing the anaerobic, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which is important during times of high muscular activity. Serum CK and LDH levels were previously used as biomarkers to diagnose myocardial infarction. Because of low specificity, however, they have been replaced by troponin T and troponin I, measured through high-sensitivity assays.

The heritability of LDH levels has been estimated between 40 and 50% (refs,) and upwards of 38% for CK. Our own data indicates a 19.33 and 19.36% heritability for CK and LDH, respectively. A recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 3,232,779 imputed variants in 3,412 statin users found two missense variants affecting serum CK levels, one in CKM (rs11559024) and one in LILRB5 (rs12975366). An association of a variant in CD163 (rs7136716) with serum CK levels has also been reported. To date, no systematic GWAS has been carried out to search for sequence variants influencing serum LDH levels.

To search for common and rare variants that associate with CK or LDH levels, we tested variants detected in a large sequencing study in Iceland for association with these traits. This unbiased approach has the potential to uncover previously unexpected molecular mechanisms regulating levels of this enzyme in serum. A thorough understanding of sequence variants influencing these biomarkers is important to improve the usefulness of their measurements, and in the assessment of tissue damage.

Osteosarcoma — prognostic serum markers and survival: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are identified as prognostic indicators, with higher LDH at presentation in metastatic versus localized disease in a cohort of 1421 extremity cases (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001), and 5-year disease-free survival correlated with LDH (39.5% for high LDH vs 60% for normal). In a retrospective analysis of 789 extremity cases, ALP was a significant prognostic factor for event-free survival, with 5-year EFS 24% when serum ALP was more than four times the normal value and 46% when elevated below this limit (P < .001). However, in multivariate analyses, these markers did not retain prognostic significance when compared with tumor volume, age, and histologic response to chemotherapy.

### Elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase in AL amyloidosis reflects tissue damage and is an adverse prognostic marker in patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation [^1123ikbS]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The significance of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in light chain (AL) amyloidosis has not been previously explored. We studied 1019 newly diagnosed patients and correlated the elevation of LDH above the upper limit of normal (ULN) with disease characteristics and outcome. Four hundred and nine patients had an LDH above ULN, representing 40% of the study population. Patients with an elevated LDH were older, were less likely to be male and had more extensive organ involvement compared to patients with a normal LDH. Patients with high LDH had greater cardiac and renal dysfunction. Elevated LDH was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival and for death within 6 months of diagnosis, but this was restricted to patients not eligible for stem cell transplant. Serum LDH may act as a marker for organ damage and should be explored as a potential marker for tissue healing and organ recovery.

### Lactate dehydrogenase as prognostic factor in limited and extensive disease stage small cell lung cancer-a retrospective single institution analysis [^111FEP8C]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this retrospective study is to present data on clinical significance of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels in an unselected contemporary patient population with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in limited disease (LD) and extensive disease stage (ED).

Patients and Methods

From June 2004 to June 2008, our electronic database including all in-patient and out-patient contacts was searched for patients with newly diagnosed LD and ED SCLC. 397 cases were identified. We collected data on patient characteristics including clinical performance status and LDH serum levels, metastatic sites, efficacy of first line chemotherapy and survival.

Results

In both limited and extensive disease SCLC, elevated LDH serum levels resulted in significantly shorter median survival. The effect was most pronounced if levels were 300 U/l or higher. In patients with limited disease and normal LDH levels, median survival was 18.0 months. If LDH was higher than 300 U/l, overall survival was reduced to 12 months. In cases with extensive disease, overall survival was significantly lower in patients with elevated LDH serum levels with an additional reduction in overall survival in patients with LDH levels above 300 U/l. (7.0 vs. 12.0 months, p = < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed LDH levels to be an independent predictor of mortality after adjustment for age and Performance Status in LD and ED SCLC (HR 1.003, p = 0.017; HR 1.001, p = 0.002 respectively). However, categorizing LDH levels revealed no significant difference in LD SCLC.

Conclusion

In our contemporary comprehensive patient population, LDH is proved to be a strong, independent predictive factor of median survival in patients with LD and ED SCLC.

Burkitt lymphoma — prognosis and risk stratification: In these highly aggressive lymphomas, as in DLBCLs, the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level has prognostic significance, and the BL-International Prognostic Index (based on age ≥ 40 years, performance status ≥ 2, elevated serum LDH (> 3 times upper limit of normal), and CNS involvement) stratified patients into three risk groups (low, intermediate, and high). The estimated 3-year PFS rates were 92%, 72%, and 53%, respectively for the three risk groups and the corresponding 3-year OS rates were 96%, 76%, and 59%, respectively. BL-IPI was validated in a prospective clinical trial of 113 patients with BL treated with dose-adjusted EPOCH + rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R), and the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were higher for patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease compared to those with high-risk disease (90% and 67%, respectively).

### Assessment of intensive care unit laboratory values that differ from reference ranges and association with patient mortality and length of stay [^113NBvkz]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This work is exploratory, and thus has many limitations. First, it is a single-center study from 1 ICU database. Second, the approach described does not immediately lend itself to direct clinical translation. Crude outcomes such as length of stay and mortality are highly dependent on multiple interacting factors, including the patient's specific pathology (or pathologies) and comorbidities, as well as interactions between laboratory values. However, our goal is not direct clinical translation, but rather to point out that there is limited overlap between our normal reference ranges and the laboratory values of patients, and that other approaches may be possible.

Third, our approach does not investigate the interactions with these other factors. It does not take into account specific pathologies or underlying comorbidities — steps that would certainly be necessary for this approach to be translated clinically.

Fourth, generating population-specific, outcome-based probability distributions for laboratory value interpretation requires the input of large amounts of data, as well as complex computational analysis. This represents a major barrier to clinical translation. Again, the purpose of our work is to highlight a potentially different mechanism to interpret laboratory values; the best way to integrate such an approach clinically remains to be seen.

Finally, 1 significant downside to using an approach such as this is that it represents a major departure from how clinicians are trained to interpret laboratory values — that is, to ask, "Is this value abnormal (high or low) and, if so, what does this mean?" The interpretation of values generated in our approach is not clear; thus, how to interpret these novel distributions and how to apply them in clinical decision making remains to be studied.

Future Directions

This approach is intended to question what is normal when interpreting laboratory (or other) tests in a specific patient population. A probabilistic approach to interpreting laboratory results may be applied to other uses of a diagnostic test apart from prognostication, such as translation to the likelihood of a specific clinical event, complication, or disease being present. This approach might lend itself to various use cases, including estimation of the likelihood of life-threatening arrhythmia based on commonly monitored and oft-repleted serum electrolytes (eg, potassium and magnesium); the likelihood of Clostridium difficile infection based on the degree of white blood cell count elevation; or the likelihood of response to chemotherapy based on serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Future research will focus on probabilistic interpretation of discrete outcomes and on probabilistic interpretation of dynamic trends of laboratory values and other clinical parameters.

Purpose

To evaluate the prognostic value of baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

Methods and Materials

Cases of NPC (n = 465) that involved treatment with IMRT with or without chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

The mean (± SD) and median baseline serum LDH levels for this cohort were 172.77 ± 2.28 and 164.00 IU/L, respectively. Levels of LDH were significantly elevated in patients with locoregionally advanced disease (p = 0.016). Elevated LDH levels were identified as a prognostic factor for rates of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), with p values < 0.001 in the univariate analysis and p < 0.001, p = 0.004, and p = 0.003, respectively, in the multivariate analysis. Correspondingly, the prognostic impact of patient LDH levels was found to be statistically significant for rates of OS, DFS, and DMFS (p = 0.028, 0.024, and 0.020, respectively). For patients who experienced subsequent liver failure after treatment, markedly higher pretreatment serum LDH levels were detected compared with patients experiencing distant metastasis events at other sites (p = 0.032).

Conclusions

Elevated baseline LDH levels are associated with clinically advanced disease and are a poor prognosticator for OS, DFS, and DMFS for NPC patients. These results suggest that elevated serum levels of LDH should be considered when evaluating treatment options.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase and survival following cancer diagnosis [^114zHyFP]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Aberrant energy metabolism is a common feature of cancer. In normal cells, when oxygen is available, pyruvate generated during the breakdown of glucose is utilised to produce energy through oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, tumour cells prefer pyruvate metabolism via anaerobic pathway regardless of oxygen availability, leading to inefficient fuel production and formation of lactate. This anomalous metabolic preference is known as the Warburg effect or 'aerobic glycolysis'.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to lactate during glycolysis. It is expressed in all tissues and its A and B subunits, coded by two different genes LDH-A and LDH-B, combine to construct five isoenzymes (LDH1 to LDH5) with selective distribution among tissues and in serum. In addition, LDH is known as a marker for tissue injury, inflammation, haemolysis and myocardial infarction. Elevated LDH levels are seen in cancer patients, and its prognostic value has been shown in several malignancies such as germ cell tumours, lymphoma, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Most of these studies were based in hospital or clinical trial settings, with LDH assessed at diagnosis or after initiation of treatment. However, recent evidence linking LDH-A and the oncogene c-MYC suggests that metabolic derangements may occur before the tumour becomes macroscopic, that is, before it is clinically detectable. The role of these early metabolic disturbances in the context of cancer survival remains poorly understood.

Currently, there is also a lack of information on how serum LDH contributes to cancer-specific survival in long-term follow-up. In a prospective cohort with up to 25 years of follow-up, we sought to investigate the association of prediagnostic serum LDH with overall and cancer-specific deaths among 7895 individuals diagnosed with cancer. We assessed serum LDH measured within 3 years before cancer diagnosis, during which the tumour is likely to be preclinically present, and within 3 months before diagnosis, which represented its levels at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, we investigated temporal associations between LDH and survival using LDH measured in different interval periods before cancer diagnosis.

### Elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase in patients with pectus excavatum [^1125QY32]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

To find out the definite causes of LDH elevation, it is important to know from what tissue the LDH was released into the bloodstream, and isoenzyme pattern differences from normal. However, because the routine preoperative laboratory test did not include the isoenzyme of LDH test, the definite causes for LDH elevation are not discovered yet. Further studies on LDH, including isoenzyme pattern analysis, will be needed to investigate the definite causes of LDH elevation.

To our best knowledge, the present study is the first and the systemic study on routine laboratory evaluations. But there were a few limitations in this study. Firstly, the present study is a retrospective, a small size, and a single center study. The larger studies from multi-centers will be needed. Secondly, because the routine preoperative laboratory test did not include the isoenzyme of LDH test, we do not still know the definite causes for LDH elevation. Further studies on LDH, including isoenzyme pattern analysis, will be needed to find out the exact causes of LDH elevation.

### Increased lactate dehydrogenase activity is dispensable in squamous carcinoma cells of origin [^116fmRkB]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Although numerous therapeutic strategies have attempted to target aerobic glycolysis to inhibit tumor progression, these approaches have not resulted in effective clinical outcomes. Murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be initiated by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). HFSCs utilize aerobic glycolysis, and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) is essential for HFSC activation. We sought to determine whether Ldh activity in SCC is critical for tumorigenesis or simply a marker of the cell type of origin. Genetic abrogation or induction of Ldh activity in HFSC-mediated tumorigenesis shows no effect on tumorigenesis as measured by number, time to formation, proliferation, volume, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, gene expression, or immune response. Ldha-null tumors show dramatically reduced levels of glycolytic metabolites by metabolomics, and significantly reduced glucose uptake by FDG-PET live animal imaging. These results suggest that squamous cancer cells of origin do not require increased glycolytic activity to generate cancers.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase is a predictive biomarker in patients with oropharyngeal cancer undergoing radiotherapy: retrospective study on predictive factors [^111Vaffk]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, the prognostic factors for patients with OPC were evaluated. Our study suggested that poor survival might be independently associated with high LDH levels in patients with OPC, regardless of HPV status. It is noteworthy that high LDH levels may be a stronger poor prognostic factor than HPV status and TNM stage (both 7th and 8th editions) in this study. Moreover, as is well‐known from previous studies, tobacco smoking affects treatment response and negatively affects patients with OPC.

Elevated LDH levels have been identified as a negative prognostic indicator for many solid tumors, including non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma, germ cell tumors, and small‐cell lung cancer. The prognostic significance of serum LDH levels in NPC has been investigated in several retrospective studies. High levels of serum LDH were found to be correlated with a larger tumor burden in NPC. In addition, a high LDH level was associated with the extent of locoregional control and/or distant metastasis events and could predict a poor prognosis. However, there are limited data regarding the use of pretreatment serum LDH to predict the prognosis of patients with OPC. In both HPV‐positive and HPV‐negative OPC, OS was considerably worse in patients with higher LDH levels than in those with lower levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that LDH levels are associated with poor prognosis and that they can be an independent prognostic marker for patients with OPC regardless of HPV status. In addition, the results would imply that potentially LDH could be a biomarker for nonoropharyngeal head and neck cancers.

### Lactate dehydrogenase and susceptibility to deterioration of mild COVID-19 patients: a multicenter nested case-control study [^111xZYtp]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 4 million people within 4 months. There is an urgent need to properly identify high-risk cases that are more likely to deteriorate even if they present mild diseases on admission.

Methods

A multicenter nested case-control study was conducted in four designated hospitals in China enrolling confirmed COVID-19 patients who were mild on admission. Baseline clinical characteristics were compared between patients with stable mild illness (stable mild group) and those who deteriorated from mild to severe illness (progression group).

Results

From Jan 17, 2020, to Feb 1, 2020, 85 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 16 in the progression group and 69 in the stable mild group. Compared to stable mild group (n = 69), patients in the progression group (n = 16) were more likely to be older, male, presented with dyspnea, with hypertension, and with higher levels of lactase dehydrogenase and c-reactive protein. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 1.012; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.020–1.166; P = 0.011) and the higher level of lactase dehydrogenase (OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.001–1.024; P = 0.038) were independently associated with exacerbation in mild COVID-19 patients.

Conclusion

Advanced age and high LDH level are independent risk factors for exacerbation in mild COVID-19 patients. Among the mild patients, clinicians should pay more attention to the elderly patients or those with high LDH levels.

### Lactate dehydrogenase levels predict coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality: a pooled analysis [^112hbMuZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has now reached a pandemic state, affecting more than a million patients worldwide. Predictors of disease outcomes in these patients need to be urgently assessed to decrease morbidity and societal burden. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with viral infections. In this pooled analysis of 9 published studies (n = 1532 COVID-19 patients), we evaluated the association between elevated LDH levels measured at earliest time point in hospitalization and disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Elevated LDH levels were associated with a ~6-fold increase in odds of developing severe disease and a ~16-fold increase in odds of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Conclusions

Lactate dehydrogenase, as a screening tool, plays a significant role in the diagnosis of various diseases, such as liver diseases, myocardial infarction, blood system disorders, and other diseases. Its utility in clinical diagnosis and prognostic evaluation is extremely essential. Our research showed a strong association between log-transformed LDH levels and AHF, highlighting that longitudinal monitoring of the changes in LDH levels may provide valuable insights into evaluating the status of NAFLD and AHF.

### Early intervention for lactate dehydrogenase elevation improves clinical outcomes in patients with the heartMate II left ventricular assist device: insights from the PREVENT study [^111NkgaH]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolysis, assessed by elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is strongly associated with HeartMate II pump thrombosis (PT). However, it is unknown whether early intervention for elevated LDH circumvents the risk of serious PT requiring pump exchange. We sought to evaluate the relationship between elevated LDH and clinical outcomes, the effectiveness of early medical intervention, and risk factors for elevated LDH.

Methods

We studied 268 patients in the prospective, multicenter PREVENT study who had 2 or more LDH measurements at ≥ 30 days post-implant. Elevated LDH was defined as LDH ≥ 2.5× upper limit of normal (ULN) for 2 consecutive measurements.

Results

Fourteen percent of patients had elevated LDH. Stroke-free survival at 6 months was lower in patients with elevated LDH vs patients with normal LDH (83 ± 6% vs 93 ± 2%, p = 0.035). Elevated LDH resolved without intervention in 19% of patients, with intensified medical therapy in 43% and required surgical intervention in 38%. For patients receiving only medical therapy, survival was 94 ± 6% at 6 months post-treatment. In this subgroup, resolution of symptoms with intensified medical therapy was sustained in 15 of 16 patients, with PT occurring in 1 patient at 171 days after initial treatment for elevated LDH (202 days post-implant). Early medical intervention at moderately elevated LDH (2.5× to 3.2× ULN), as compared with higher levels (> 3.2× ULN), led to more sustained resolution of symptoms without subsequent PT or need for surgical intervention (91% vs 26% at 6 months post-treatment, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Early medical intervention can successfully resolve moderate LDH elevations (2.5× to 3.2× ULN) with a low incidence of death or PT at 6 months post-treatment.

### Demystifying lactate in the emergency department [^115G8oLL]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of lactic acid and its conjugate base, lactate, has evolved during the past decade in the care of patients in the emergency department (ED). A recent national sepsis quality measure has led to increased use of serum lactate in the ED, but many causes for hyperlactatemia exist outside of sepsis. We provide a review of the biology of lactate production and metabolism, the many causes of hyperlactatemia, and evidence on its use as a marker in prognosis and resuscitation. Additionally, we review the evolving role of lactate in sepsis care. We provide recommendations to aid lactate interpretation in the ED and highlight areas for future research.

### Circulating biomarkers for therapeutic monitoring of anti-cancer agents [^111NqonS]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-Specific Markers of Disease Burden

Many of the earliest discovered circulating tumor biomarkers were non-specific indicators of disease burden. These surrogates largely consist of naturally occurring macromolecules that are aberrantly upregulated by rapidly dividing cancer cells, or that are released into circulation by loss of cell membrane integrity.

Lactate Dehydrogenase

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is one of the most commonly expressed enzymes in nature and plays a physiologic role in anerobic metabolism. The rather ubiquitous expression of LDH across tissue types has led to broad clinical applications in detecting cellular damage across pathologies which include myopathies, myocardial infarction, hemolytic anemias, hepatocellular damage, and cancer.

LDH has been known to correlate with cancer disease burden in pre-clinical and clinical studies for decades, although recent nuances have been described. Indeed, LDH is a frequently used stratification factor in clinical trials and has been integrated into prognostic scoring systems (eg, Royal Marsden Hospital score, Gustave Roussy immune score). Notably, the predictive value of LDH in melanoma is so robust that it has been incorporated into TNM staging to differentiate M1a/b/c/d (0) from M1a/b/c/d (1) disease.

In terms of dynamic monitoring, LDH is a fairly useful indicator for disease relapse in lymphoma and is included in guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology for post-treatment monitoring.LDH changes through therapy have been associated with survival outcomes in advanced breast, non–small cell lung, hepatocellular, and testicular cancers. In some cases, changes of LDH through therapy have proven superior to baseline LDH values in predicting treatment responses. Although compelling, these observations have been challenged. In certain cohorts, LDH levels through treatment have been found to not be correlated with response. Others have argued that LDH does not add much to clinical decision making, as patients with increased LDH prior to relapse or progression often have overt clinical symptoms that would have prompted further investigations regardless.

### Association between lactate dehydrogenase and ventilator-associated pneumonia risk: an analysis of the MIMIC database 2001–2019 [^113NjQEC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The effect of LDH levels on VAP risk may be related to the function of LDH. Elevated LDH levels reflect tissue or cellular damage and are considered a common sign of tissue or cellular injury, suggestive of viral infection or lung injury. Severe infections may result in cytokine-mediated tissue damage and LDH release. Park et al. showed that pulmonary LDH released during infection is an important target for streptococcus pneumoniae binding via pneumococcal surface protein A and pneumococcal surface protein C, and that pneumococci benefit in vivo by utilizing LDH-A-derived lactic acid. Moreover, serum LDH is a prognostic biomarker for metabolism and immunomonitoring, and elevated serum LDH is associated with immunocompromise. LDH promotes lactate synthesis, which enhances immunosuppressive cells such as macrophages, and suppresses cytolytic cells such as NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Low LDH activity provides anti-inflammatory effects by down-regulating various inflammatory mediators (e.g. cytokines, NO) as well as lactate fluctuations that modulate macrophage inflammatory responses. Elevated LDH may lead to hyperactivation of lung tissue inflammation and reduced immune response, all of which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with severe infections. These roles of LDH may explain the association between elevated LDH levels and increased risk of VAP. However, additional mechanisms of the effect of serum LDH levels on VAP may need to be explored in more studies.

We analyzed the relationship between LDH levels and the risk of VAP in ICU patients, which may provide additional evidence for the recognition of VAP risk factors. Nevertheless, several limitations should be considered. First, the data in the MIMIC database are from a single center, and future studies need multicenter prospective data. Second, we only analyzed the relationship between LDH levels at initial ICU admission and the risk of VAP, whereas the effect of changes in LDH levels after admission to ICU on the risk of VAP is still unclear. Third, the effect of LDH levels on the risk of different types of VAPs is unclear due to database limitations. Fourth, we can only obtain whether patients have VAP after admission to the ICU, but cannot obtain the specific time of VAP occurrence due to the limitations of the MIMIC database.

### Clinical evaluation of potential usefulness of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia [^114iuQSP]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The fast-growing outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which originated from Wuhan in central China, reached multiple continents in merely a month. Cross person-to-person transmission of this new virus can result in severe and fatal respiratory disease like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans. With the gradual recognition of COVID-19 pneumonia, professional consensus, guidelines and criteria were steadily established with the aim of preventing transmission and facilitating diagnosis and treatment.

Although COVID-19 pneumonia was considered as a low lethal disease, recognition of disease progression was an important decision point concerning intensive therapies. Accordingly, chest CT has been preferentially used as a stable marker of COVID-19 pneumonia, but clinical experiences have revealed the decrease of its availability in critical cases. Therefore, a more sensitive and specific disease-progression marker of COVID-19 pneumonia has been required.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme implicated in the conversion of lactate to pyruvate in the cells of most body tissues and increased following tissue breakdown. Consequently, elevated serum LDH is present in numerous clinical conditions, such as hemolysis, cancer, severe infections and sepsis, liver diseases, hematologic malignancies, and many others. Nowadays, there was much evidence suggesting that the serum LDH levels serve as a non-specific indicator of cellular death in many diseases. However, the current information about dynamic change of LDH in COVID-19 pneumonia was very still.

Here, we hypothesized that certain LDH change might be correlated to the time course of COVID-19 pneumonia. We therefore measured LDH levels and related them to disease's severity and status. It was aimed to establish serum LDH as a potential marker for monitoring treatment response in COVID-19 pneumonia.

### Clinical significance of pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase / adenosine deaminase ratio in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion [^11586mHA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

LDH, crucial in sugar metabolism and prevalent in tumor tissues, is often elevated in MPE due to tumor cells favoring the LDH-driven anaerobic glycolytic pathway for energy production. Higher CRP levels in patients with lung cancer than in healthy individuals have also been reported. However, CRP elevation could not be attributed to cancer in the present study because patients with lung cancer may also have inflammation such as cancer-related lung infection. In MPE patients, CRP and ESR levels were raised but lower than in PPE and TPE cases. Moreover, pfLDH levels were notably higher in PPE patients. These findings align with prior research. However, some studies have found that there is no significant difference in pfLDH level between UPPE and TPE patients, so it is challenging to use pleural effusion LDH to completely distinguish TPE from PPE, especially different PPE subtypes. Therefore, utilizing parameters such as ADA, LDH, CRP, and ESR together could enhance the accuracy of distinguishing between TPE and pleural effusions of other origins. Saraya T et al. first proposed the use of pfLDH/pfADA as a method with good sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing pleural effusions of different etiologies in clinical practice. The results of this study also showed that the ratio of pfLDH/pfADA in TPE patients was significantly lower than that in PPE patients, and this difference was also statistically significant among different PPE subtypes (UPPE, CPPE and empyema) and TPE patients (P < 0.001).

### Real-world testing of serum lactate dehydrogenase among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the United States [^112811BC]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Although lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is not currently considered as a routine biomarker for treatment selection in oncology clinical practice guidelines, several studies have evaluated its prognostic and predictive role as a nonspecific marker of tissue damage in several cancers, including mCRC. Increased serum LDH reflects metabolic changes in cancer cells and therefore acts as an indirect marker of tumor hypoxia, neoangiogenesis, and metastasis. A meta-analysis of 68 clinical studies involving 31 857 patients between 1978 and 2014 found that high levels of pretreatment LDH were associated with worse overall survival (OS). The hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.48 for all cancers and 1.52 among patients with CRC (the median cutoff for high LDH was 250 IU/L [range of 200–1000 IU/L]). Studies in patients with mCRC have suggested that LDH levels that are at or exceed the upper limit of normal (ULN) are both potential prognostic biomarkers and predictors of efficacy of antiangiogenic-based treatments. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 1219 patients with mCRC, pretreatment LDH values exceeding the ULN were associated with a lack of therapeutic effect from bevacizumab-based first-line chemotherapy and from continued second-line chemotherapy that includes the antiangiogenic component. Therefore, LDH levels may also be a relevant factor for evaluating treatment efficacy and may help inform a more timely change in treatment approach.

Despite the established predictive and prognostic significance of LDH in several malignancies, little is understood about real-world testing patterns in mCRC. To the best of our knowledge, no US-based studies have quantified and characterized LDH testing or the potential relationship between LDH value and OS in a real-world setting. This study aimed to evaluate real-world LDH testing patterns in patients receiving chemotherapy-containing regimens for mCRC in the United States.

### S100B and LDH as early prognostic markers for response and overall survival in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 or combined anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibodies [^117Ghjm1]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Immunotherapy with PD-1 antibodies has greatly increased prognosis of patients with advanced melanoma. Identifying biomarkers that predict overall survival (OS) and response to immunotherapy is important.

Methods

OS and best overall response according to RECIST version 1.1 were analysed, and S100B and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels were assessed retrospectively in 152 patients treated with anti-PD-1, and in 86 patients treated with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibodies at University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany.

Results

In the pembrolizumab group, patients with elevated baseline S100B or LDH exhibited significantly impaired OS compared with patients with normal S100B (1-year OS: 51.1% vs 83.1%, log-rank P < .0001) and normal LDH (1-year OS: 44.4% vs 80.8%, P = 0.00022), respectively. LDH increases of > 25% and S100B increases of > 145% compared to baseline were significantly associated with impaired OS (both P < .0001). In patients treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab, baseline S100B and increasing S100B levels of > 145% as well as baseline LDH were associated with impaired OS (P < .0001, P = 0.00060, and P = 0.0050, respectively), whereas increasing LDH of > 25% was not (P = 0.64).

Conclusions

S100B could serve as a strong baseline marker for OS in melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Rising S100B levels during the first weeks of therapy could help guide treatment decisions.

### Lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio and prognosis in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study [^111K5k3E]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The metabolic characteristics of AECOPD are related to various factors including abnormalities in energy production pathways, and an imbalance between oxidation and antioxidation. Disorders of these metabolic pathways may activate inflammatory signaling pathways, release inflammatory cytokines, activate oxidative stress, and thus promote the development and exacerbation of COPD. Lactic acid metabolism plays an important role in AECOPD, and the accumulation of lactic acid may be related to tissue hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which together promote the pathological process of AECOPD. LDH is a key enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, acting as a catalyst for the conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid. It is widely distributed in various tissues and cells and is a diagnostic marker of diseases and tissue damage. A cohort study found that patients with a poor prognosis of AECOPD had higher serum LDH levels. When a tissue is severely hypoxic or cell damage occurs, LDH is released from cells into the blood, and a significant increase in serum LDH levels can be detected.

Inflammation markers play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of COPD, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which not only reflect disease severity but are also closely related to smoking status. Smoking, a major risk factor for COPD, induces inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, thereby exacerbating the disease process. Therefore, levels of inflammation markers may be influenced by both the severity of COPD and the patient's smoking status. Notably, LAR, which combines metabolic and inflammatory characteristics, may also play a role in reflecting the inflammatory burden in COPD patients.

Several studies have confirmed that increased LDH levels are associated with disease severity and poor prognosis. In sepsis, one study found that high levels of LDH were associated with increased 28-day mortality. Another study confirmed that LDH was related to 1-year all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis and was an important component in the model predicting 1-year all-cause mortality, which can significantly improve the accuracy of the model's prediction. In a retrospective cohort study involving 8,436 patients with acute kidney injury, in-hospital mortality increased with increased LDH and was almost linearly related.

### Association of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and advanced hepatic fibrosis in the United States: a cross-sectional study using NHANES data from 2007 to 2018 [^113fFuD9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a group of chronic liver diseases that are mainly characterized by hepatic fat accumulation, without the presence of alcohol consumption and other identified factors affecting the liver, which is currently one of the most common chronic liver diseases globally. NAFLD can be divided into two primary subtypes: simple fatty liver (SFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), possibly accompanied by varying degrees of liver inflammation and fibrosis. LDH, as discussed in this article, is an enzymatic protein with five isoenzymes ranging from LDH-1 to LDH-5, with elevated concentrations particularly observed in the myocardium, liver, and skeletal muscle, as well as in erythrocytes. LDH is one of the crucial enzymes in intracellular glycolysis by catalyzing the reversible conversion of lactate to pyruvate, accompanied by the interconversion of NADH and NAD +. The prognosis drastically worsens upon the onset of cirrhosis, underscoring the importance of ongoing monitoring and follow-up in the management of NAFLD. Presently, methods for diagnosing NAFLD include clinical diagnostic criteria, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and pathological examinations. Liver biopsy histology, also referred to as pathological examination, considered the gold standard for diagnosing NAFLD, determines the degree of fatty liver and detects inflammation and fibrosis. However, it also poses certain risks of complications such as pain, bleeding, infection, damage to adjacent organs, tumor rupture, metastasis, pleural reaction, and bile leakage. Given the increasing use of serological markers in clinical practice and their lower contraindication, the exploration of serological screening indicators for NAFLD and AHF holds significant value for clinical applications. LDH serves as an important adjunctive value in the assessment of various diseases for the purposes of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in clinical practice. Elevated LDH levels are commonly linked to cellular injury or inflammatory reactions, including myocardial infarction, skeletal muscle diseases, melanoma, hemolytic anemia, and malignances, indicating that LDH is a commonly used biomarker for disease in clinical settings, crucial for detecting and monitoring a wide array of illnesses. Additionally, studies on liver diseases demonstrate a significant elevation of LDH in patients with acute liver failure and hepatitis, and the magnitude of change in LDH levels corresponds to the degree of liver damage. LDH levels have been demonstrated to have a strong association with unfavorable outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting the importance of LDH as a predictive marker in clinical settings. Moreover, there is evidence that LDH activity is significantly increased in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, resulting in the abnormal metabolism of lactic acid in the brain.

### The utility of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase in current clinical practice [^11554ccX]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Because of its wide tissue distribution, elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LD) is a nonspecific finding. Although serum LD is still included in the prognosis and staging of metastatic melanoma and germ cell tumors, its nonspecificity has led to decreased usefulness.

Methods

In this study, we analyzed the serum LD assays performed in a 726-bed hospital during a 1-year period and reviewed charts of patients with serum LD of > 3 standard deviations (SD).

Results

Of 312 patients with elevated serum LD, only 9 were patients with melanoma and germ cell tumors. The other 303 patients had other malignancies, chronic conditions, and sepsis.

Conclusion

Elevated serum LD (even > 3 SD) is an extremely nonspecific finding that does not contribute to clinical management in a majority of patients. As such, serum LD testing should be retired from routine clinical order sets and restricted in use.

### S100B and LDH as early prognostic markers for response and overall survival in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 or combined anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibodies [^1132k5qq]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Many studies have already shown that in patients treated with ipilimumab, an increased baseline LDH is independently associated with poor survival. – Increased baseline LDH was also reported to be associated with diminished OS and lower objective response rates in patients receiving nivolumab or pembrolizumab. In those patients with elevated baseline LDH, further increasing LDH levels before the first staging have also been shown to be predictive for shortened OS. However, Diem et al. included only 29 patients with elevated baseline LDH for the analysis of increasing LDH levels. Our data support these findings with elevated baseline LDH > 1.5 × ULN and further increasing LDH levels being significantly associated with poor OS in a cohort of 152 patients treated with pembrolizumab. In addition, we show that increasing LDH levels are not only a useful predictor of OS in patients with elevated baseline LDH, but also in patients with normal baseline LDH.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase and survival following cancer diagnosis [^116eQfY1]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we found higher prediagnostic LDH to correspond to lower overall and cancer-specific survival following cancer diagnosis. More specifically, a greater risk of dying from cancer was seen with increasing LDH in those diagnosed with prostate, pulmonary, colorectal, gastro-oesophageal, gynaecological or haematological cancer. Furthermore, we found that the associations between LDH and both all-cause and overall cancer deaths were stronger when LDH was measured closer to cancer diagnosis.

Several plausible mechanisms may underlie the link between LDH and cancer progression. Rapidly proliferating cancer cells requires extreme supplies of energy and chronic hypoxia secondary to tumour growth activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a key regulator of glycolysis and angiogenesis. The HIF-1 drives the metabolic switch to glycolysis by stimulating expression of glycolytic enzymes and directly repressing mitochondrial function through activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK-1). The subsequent accumulation of glycolytic metabolites may promote further HIF-1 activation, resulting in a feed-forward stimulatory loop in cancer cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 also upregulates angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), therefore linking glycolysis and LDH to angiogenesis and cancer progression. However, continuous oxygen availability in glycolytic cancers, such as leukaemia, suggests that other underlying factors may trigger the switch to aerobic glycolysis before hypoxia occurs. In addition, the tumour-promoting role of A and B subunits of LDH has been suggested: increased LDH-A levels are crucial in c-MYC-mediated cell transformation, whereas LDH-B is necessary in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated tumourigenesis. These biological findings imply that LDH may be relevant to tumour growth and severity, and may also play a role in carcinogenesis.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^114jA46a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Lactate — initial ED testing, thresholds, and repeat strategy are specified as follows: We support initially measuring blood lactate levels in the ED (venous or arterial) and repeating lactate measurement after initial resuscitation only if elevated above 4 mmol/L or if there is suspicion of clinical deterioration, and we endorse the use of venous lactate specimens. Convenient thresholds used to note abnormal elevation are more than 2.0 mmol/L and more than 4.0 mmol/L; the most convincing data of benefit from repeat measurements studied those with an initial lactate level of at least 4 mmol/L, with a common practice of measuring lactate in 2-hour intervals and using a 10% relative decline between measurements to indicate improvement. Blood lactate level is not a specific diagnostic test for sepsis, and elevations correlate with a higher risk of short-term mortality.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase profile as a retrospective indicator of uterine preparedness for labor: a prospective, observational study [^114EpweA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of studies measuring LDH levels during pregnancy are from the late 1950s through the 1970s. In myometrial muscle, LDH isoenzymes shift toward a more anaerobic profile as pregnancy advances, speculatively, to better equip the uterus to contend with hypoxic episodes related to labor contractions. As a result, LDH 3 and/or LDH 4 have been reported to be in greatest concentrations in the pregnant myometrium at term. Anaerobic shifting is important because otherwise intermittent hypoxia and resultant acidosis would rapidly reduce contractile force. The pattern and timing of LDH isoenzyme profile shifting throughout late pregnancy and labor remains largely unknown.

LDH is released from its tissue of origin and enters the general circulation when cells are broken down or damaged. Because most tissues have LDH activities that are 500–700 times greater than that found in normal serum, a significant elevation of serum LDH occurs with even small amounts of tissue breakdown. While total serum measurement of LDH provides only a non-specific measure of cellular breakdown/damage, determining specific LDH isoenzyme patterns is useful in the differential diagnosis of certain pathologic states. This is possible because tissue breakdown releases the isoenzymes contained within that particular tissue, leading to a change in the serum profile measured systemically. Isoenzyme measures can assist in diagnosing pathologic processes such as myocardial infarction, liver disease, and pre-eclampsia.

During normal labor, levels of total myometrial LDH decline from levels present before labor with a disproportionate decrease in 'M' dominant chains over 'H' dominant chains. This finding aligns with reports that maternal serum total LDH concentrations are higher in the postpartum period than is normally found during the pre-labor period, peaking approximately 24–48 hours after delivery. Given the tremendous amount of work performed and stress endured by the uterus during labor coupled with rapid uterine involution following delivery, it is likely that serum LDH isoenzyme levels measured after labor, in otherwise healthy women, predominantly reflect the enzymatic profile within the uterine muscle that existed during the labor period. This has been suggested by other research teams. This means that LDH isoenzyme levels measured 24–30 hours after labor may serve as a retrospective indicator of uterine preparedness for labor.

### How to interpret lactate [^115fGPHf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

The association between hyperlactataemia and poorer outcomes in acutely unwell adults and children is well recognised. Blood lactate testing has become readily available in acute settings and is considered a first-line investigation in international guidelines for the management of sepsis. However, while healthcare professionals do appreciate the value of measuring blood lactate in acute severe illness, its clinical significance and interpretation remain less well understood. In this paper, we present the evidence for the use of lactate as a diagnostic test and prognostic marker in acutely unwell children.

Hematologic/biochemical response definition — lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): A CR is considered normalization of LDH and a clinically meaningful PR for LDH is defined as a persistently elevated LDH with a decrease of at least 25% from TA-TMA diagnosis. In patients with LDH just above the reference range at TA-TMA diagnosis, a CR can be obtained if the LDH normalizes, even in the absence of a 25% reduction.

Serum tumor markers — lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are the least relevant and clinically applicable of the serum tumor markers and are elevated in approximately 20% of low-stage germ cell tumor (GCT); of the five isoenzymes of LDH, LDH-1 is the most frequently elevated isoenzyme in GCT, the magnitude of LDH elevation correlates with bulk of disease, and treatment decisions based solely on LDH elevation in the setting of normal AFP and hCG should be discouraged.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase and survival following cancer diagnosis [^113TkD14]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics of study participants by LDH categories are shown in Table 1. Mean age at diagnosis was 62 years. At the end of follow-up (mean: 8.2 years), 5799 participants (73.5%) were deceased. Participants with high levels of baseline LDH (> ULN) were older and had higher comorbidity burden and lower 5-year overall survival rates. Distributions of serum LDH z -score based on characteristics of participants are available in (Supplementary Figure S1). The three most frequent cancers were breast (female), prostate and colorectal cancer.

Overall survival differed by LDH measured within 3 years before diagnosis and within 3 months before date of diagnosis, that is, LDH at the time at diagnosis, with lower survival seen with higher LDH (Figure 1). Correspondingly, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression showed an increased risk of dying from all causes with higher LDH z -score or categories, with the HR of 1.78 (95% CI: 1.64–1.94) comparing LDH levels above and below ULN. Similar findings were found when assessing cancer-specific death, for example, the HR for overall cancer death was 1.85 (95% CI: 1.68–2.03) for high vs low LDH. Associations were slightly attenuated when the models were stratified by cancer site (Table 2). Similar but more evident associations were found in the subanalysis only including serum LDH at the time at diagnosis.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^117XZ4Wp]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Testicular cancer — serum tumor markers overview: The serum tumor markers lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (beta‑hCG) are used to aid in determining stage and prognosis, and AFP and beta‑hCG are also used for assessing treatment outcomes. For risk stratification in metastatic disease, levels of AFP, beta‑hCG, and LDH should all be measured on Day 1 of cycle one of first-line chemotherapy, and AFP and beta‑hCG should be determined before and after treatment and throughout the follow-up period. Elevated markers after orchiectomy may indicate occult metastatic disease (stage IS) and are often the earliest sign of relapse during surveillance. LDH is not generally used to monitor for relapse or response because false positives are common, but it is useful for risk stratification when starting first-line chemotherapy. Caution should be taken when only one marker is mildly elevated due to the occurrence of false positives.

### Real-world testing of serum lactate dehydrogenase among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the United States [^111SHmac]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a potential prognostic biomarker of outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This retrospective, observational study assessed real-world LDH testing patterns and LDH as a prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in US patients receiving chemotherapy for mCRC. Patients and methods: Patients with mCRC who initiated first-line chemotherapy between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2022, were selected from a nationwide de-identified Electronic Health Record-derived database. LDH value was categorized based on laboratory reference ranges. The prognostic relationship between pretreatment LDH value and OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models.

Results

Of 15 329 adult patients (median age 64 years), 3379 (22%) had LDH testing at or post-index; 21% had abnormal baseline values, while 40% had normal values. Patients with abnormal LDH levels were more likely to be female (47% abnormal LDH vs 41% normal LDH), age ≥ 65 years (52% vs 49%), African American or Black (12% vs 7%), or reside in the Northeast (30% vs 21%). The median OS (95% CI) in patients with normal baseline LDH was 29.9 (28.3–31.7) vs 16.8 (14.8–18.2) months for those with abnormal LDH. In a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model, patients with abnormal baseline LDH had higher risk of death (HR 1.91, P < .0001) after adjustment for demographic/clinical characteristics.

Conclusion

Abnormal baseline LDH levels were associated with shorter OS; however, only one-fifth of patients receiving chemotherapy underwent LDH testing. Efforts to increase LDH testing could be valuable in helping guide treatment decisions.

### Evaluating prognostic value of dynamics of circulating lactate dehydrogenase in colorectal cancer using modeling and machine learning [^114d1ZAV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have been associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer, including metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, very few models link survival to longitudinal LDH measured repeatedly over time during treatment. We investigated the prognostic value of on-treatment LDH dynamics in mCRC. Using data from two large phase III studies (2L and 3L+ mCRC settings, n = 824 and 210, respectively), we found that integrating longitudinal LDH data with baseline risk factors significantly improved survival prediction. Current LDH values performed best, enhancing discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) by 4.5~15.4% and prediction accuracy (Brier score) by 3.9~15.0% compared with baseline variables. Combining all longitudinal LDH markers further improved predictive performance. After controlling for baseline covariates and other longitudinal LDH indicators, current LDH levels remained a significant risk factor in mCRC, increasing mortality risk by over 90% (P < 0.001) in 2L patients and 60–70% (P < 0.01) in 3L+ patients per unit increment in current log (LDH). Machine-learning techniques, like functional principal component analysis (FPCA), extracted informative features from longitudinal LDH data, capturing over 99% of variability and allowing prediction of survival. Unsupervised clustering based on the extracted FPCA features stratified patients into three groups with distinct LDH dynamics and survival outcomes. Hence, our approaches offer a valuable and cost-effective way for risk stratification and improves survival prediction in mCRC using LDH trajectories.

### The ratio of key metabolic transcripts is a predictive biomarker of breast cancer metastasis to the lung [^115J4DEd]. Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding the rewired metabolism underlying organ-specific metastasis in breast cancer could help identify strategies to improve the treatment and prevention of metastatic disease. Here, we used a systems biology approach to compare metabolic fluxes used by parental breast cancer cells and their brain- and lung-homing derivatives. Divergent lineages had distinct, heritable metabolic fluxes. Lung-homing cells maintained high glycolytic flux despite low levels of glycolytic intermediates, constitutively activating a pathway sink into lactate. This strong Warburg effect was associated with a high ratio of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) expression, which correlated with lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Although feature classification models trained on clinical characteristics alone were unable to predict tropism, the LDH/PDH ratio was a significant predictor of metastasis to the lung but not to other organs, independent of other transcriptomic signatures. High lactate efflux was also a trait in lung-homing metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that lactate production may be a convergent phenotype in lung metastasis. Together, these analyses highlight the essential role that metabolism plays in organ-specific cancer metastasis and identify a putative biomarker for predicting lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer.

Significance

Lung-homing metastatic breast cancer cells express an elevated ratio of lactate dehydrogenase to pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicating that ratios of specific metabolic gene transcripts have potential as metabolic biomarkers for predicting organ-specific metastasis.

### Elevated liver biochemistries in hospitalized Chinese patients with severe COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1165WDom]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Several recent studies have reported an abnormal liver chemistry profile among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although its clinical significance remains unknown.

Approach and Results

This systematic review and meta-analysis identified six studies of 586 patients delineating liver chemistries among patients with severe/critical illness versus mild cases of COVID-19 infection. Patients with severe/critical illness with COVID-19 infection have increased prevalence of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as compared with mild cases. A significant association between severe/critical COVID-19 infections with elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (pooled mean difference [MD], 11.70 U/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.97, 20.43; P = 0.009), elevated total bilirubin (pooled MD, 0.14 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.06, 0.22; P = 0.0005), and decreased albumin (pooled MD, -0.68 g/L; 95% CI, -0.81, -0.55; P < 0.00001) was noted. There was also a trend toward elevated alanine aminotransferase levels among these severe cases (pooled MD, 8.84 U/L; 95% CI, -2.28, 19.97; P = 0.12); however, this did not reach statistical significance. More severe/critically ill cases were associated with leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, elevated creatinine kinase, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated prothrombin time (PT).

Conclusions

Comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are more prevalent in hospitalized Chinese patients with severe/critical illness from COVID-19, and these patients are more likely to manifest with abnormal liver chemistries. Further prospective studies are crucial to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the hepatic manifestations of the novel COVID-19 infection and its clinical significance.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase as an early marker for outcome in patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic melanoma [^112mAWFj]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibodies is associated with high response rates in patients with advanced melanoma. Reliable markers for early response and outcome are still sparse.

Methods

We evaluated 66 consecutive patients with advanced/metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab between 2013 and 2014. The main objectives of this study were to investigate whether, first, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline (normal vs above the upper limit of normal) correlates with overall survival (OS), and, second, whether the change of LDH during treatment predicts response before the first scan and OS in patients with an elevated baseline LDH.

Results

After a median follow-up of 9 months, patients with an elevated baseline LDH (N = 34) had a significantly shorter OS compared with patients with normal LDH (N = 32; 6-month OS: 60.8% vs 81.6% and 12-month OS: 44.2% vs 71.5% (log-rank P = 0.0292). In those 34 patients with elevated baseline LDH, the relative change during treatment was significantly associated with an objective response on the first scan: the 11 (32%) patients with partial remission had a mean reduction of -27.3% from elevated baseline LDH. In contrast, patients with progressive disease (N = 15) had a mean increase of +39%. Patients with a relative increase over 10% from elevated baseline LDH had a significantly shorter OS compared with patients with ≤ 10% change (4.3 vs 15.7 months, log-rank P < 0.00623).

Conclusions

LDH could be a useful marker at baseline and during treatment to predict early response or progression in patients with advanced melanoma who receive anti-PD-1 therapy.

### Can elevated lactate and LDH produce a false positive enzymatic ethanol result in live patients presenting to the emergency department? [^117LmT3B]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There have been allegations in the courtroom that elevated serum lactic acid in trauma victims can yield a falsely elevated serum ethanol assay. Most hospitals utilize an indirect method of ethanol measurement where a serum sample is added to a mix of alcohol dehydrogenase and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This allows any ethanol in the patient's serum to be metabolized to acetaldehyde, and in the process results in the reduction of NAD+to NADH. NADH is then measured using spectrophotometry. The courtroom allegation stems from the concept that oxidation of lactate to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) results in the same molar-for-molar reduction of NAD+to NADH, and could therefore theoretically cause patients with elevated lactate and LDH to have a falsely elevated ethanol concentration.

Methods

Patients with elevated lactic acid and LDH concentrations who presented to a university hospital from 20 April 2015 to 13 December 2015 were identified to provide possible test specimens. If a sufficient amount of serum was available, the sample was used to re-run the lactate and LDH concentration simultaneously with an enzymatic ethanol assay. Any samples that had elevated lactic acid and LDH concentrations on this retesting, and also yielded a positive ethanol concentration, were sent for confirmatory gas chromatography testing of ethanol concentrations. A control group of 20 samples with normal lactate and LDH were included.

Results

A total of 37 samples were included in the final analysis. Only 4 patients had an elevated enzymatic ethanol concentration, and all 4 also had a measurable GC ethanol concentration. The lactate in this dataset ranged from 2.4 to 24.2mmol/L, with a mean of 6.53mmol/L (normal value 0.5–2.2). The LDH ranged from 242 to 8838U/L with a mean of 1695U/L (normal value 122–225U/L). Twenty control samples were run on patients with normal lactate and LDH, none of which yielded a positive enzymatic ethanol result.

Conclusions

This data does not support the contention that an elevated LDH and lactate can yield a false positive serum ethanol result as run by enzymatic ethanol assay in live patients presenting to the emergency department.

### The elevated lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio is a risk factor for developing sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: a single-center retrospective study [^114n1Sza]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have investigated the clinical value of LDH in combination with albumin. Lee BK et al. reported that an increased LAR was independently positively associated with hospital mortality in patients with lower respiratory tract infection, with good prognostic value (AUC = 0.808). In a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cohort, an LAR greater than 4.04 was associated with a 1.71-fold increased risk of death compared to those with a lower LAR. Two recent studies have investigated the potential association between LAR and mortality in patients with sepsis. Deng YH et al. demonstrated a positive nonlinear relationship between LAR and mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. A similar trend of LAR on mortality was demonstrated in the AKI subgroup in patients with sepsis. To date, the predictive value of LAR for SAKI remains unclear. Our results suggested a clear positive linear correlation between LAR and the risk of developing SAKI. LAR had a higher clinical prognostic value for SAKI than LDH alone and albumin alone in both crude and adjusted models.

To mitigate the effects of heart and liver tissue injuries on the predictive accuracy of LAR, we controlled for several variables including coronary heart disease, heart failure, liver disease, as well as levels of lactate, transaminase, and bilirubin in our multi-factor logistic regression analysis. Despite controlling for these potential confounders, LAR's predictive significance for the development of SAKI remained substantial. However, caution is still warranted as our subgroup analysis revealed that an elevated LAR does not independently predict SAKI in patients suffering from liver disease or heart failure. This might be attributed to LDH being a non-specific indicator of tissue and cellular damage. Consequently, the diagnostic utility of LAR for SAKI could be compromised by increased LDH levels originating from cardiac and liver injuries. This highlights the necessity of considering the impact of these conditions when utilizing LAR as a predictor for SAKI.

### Lactate dehydrogenase is not a useful marker for relapse in patients on surveillance for stage I germ cell tumours [^114RMZzw]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The level of serum LDH has independent prognostic significance in patients with advanced germ cell tumours, reflected within the IGCCCG grouping. Increases in the serum concentration are a reflection of tumour burden, growth rate and cellular proliferation.

Lactate dehydrogenase is comprised of multiple isoenzymes, but in practice, the combined isoenzyme value is used for clinical decision making. Increased serum LDH concentrations are observed in approximately 60% of NSGCTs with advanced disease and in 80% of patients with advanced seminoma.

In a paper published in Cancer, LDH in 80 patients with testicular germ cell tumours was reviewed. Serum LDH was found to be elevated more frequently with increasing tumour bulk (78% of patients with stage III disease and only 26% of stage II patients). It may therefore be that with vigilant surveillance, relapses are detected at a very early stage and tumour bulk may be minimal. Hence a rise in LDH is less commonly seen.

### Clinical evaluation of potential usefulness of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia [^112K4zAH]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COVID-19 is an emerging viral illness that has rapidly transmitted throughout the world. From the early published literature, it has shown that the disease could induce symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea and fatigue in infected patients. Clinically, some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia consistently demonstrated progress during the course of hospitalization, recognition of disease progression was an important decision point concerning intensive therapies.

The dynamic profile of laboratory findings has been tracked in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In the nonsurvivors, the neutrophil count, D-dimer, blood urea, and creatinine levels continued to increase, and the lymphocyte counts continued to decrease until death occurred. The risk factors indicated the importance of taking into account the disease severity, laboratory findings, chest imaging findings in practice. Under the circumstances, studies of the association between objective disease status and the laboratory findings may produce more interesting findings.

LDH can be released during tissue damage and is involved in various pathophysiological processes and serve as a non-specific indicator of cellular death in many diseases. A number of previous studies have shown that an elevated serum LDH is associated with a poor prognosis in malignancy. In most scoring systems presented so far, prognostic variables including LDH were used as static variables determined at the time of diagnosis. The dynamics of the disease, however, may also be of great importance, especially when considering 'decision points' in treatment algorithms such as stem-cell transplantation.

For this reason, there was an urgent need to verify and update dynamic variables including LDH as the number of COVID-19 pneumonia accumulates. In the present study, serum LDH was validated for its potential usefulness as markers for evaluating clinical severity and monitoring treatment response in COVID-19 pneumonia. It was demonstrated that increase or decrease of LDH was indicative of radiographic progress or improvement. An increase in LDH by 62.5 U/L has an acceptable sensitivity and high specificity for a significantly higher probability of disease progression, when chest CT scan was employed to confirm the prediction. In support, during the whole observation period, normalization of serum LDH titer was consistently accurate in predicting treatment success in the patients.

### Lactate dehydrogenase is associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis: a retrospective observational study [^1168PDZD]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a major health care problem, which affects millions of people around the world. Glucose metabolic reprogramming of immune cells plays a crucial role during advancement of sepsis. However, the association between glucose metabolic reprogramming and mortality in patients with sepsis is unclear. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis. Investigating the relationship between LDH and mortality is important to understand the effect of metabolic reprogramming on prognosis of patients with sepsis.

Methods

A total of 192 patients with sepsis were included in our study. Data on characteristics of patients, biochemical variables, and inflammatory mediator were collected. Association between the level of serum LDH and 28-day mortality was also analyzed. The correlations between serum LDH, interleukin-1β, creatinine, PaO 2 /FiO 2, and lactate were also observed. The association between LDH and the risk of death was further analyzed. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic curve was depicted to compare the accuracy in prediction of LDH and other variables.

Results

There were statistic difference in 28-day mortality between elevated LDH group and normal LDH group (P = 0.021). Level of serum LDH was an independent risk factor for death of patients with sepsis (hazard ratio 1.005, 95% confidence interval 1.002–1.007, P = 0.001). There were significant correlations between LDH, interleukin-1β (r = 0.514, P = 0.000), creatinine (r = 0.368, P = 0.000), PaO 2 /FiO 2 (r = -0.304, P = 0.000), and lactate (r = 0.560, P = 0.000). The receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the area under the LDH curve for prediction for mortality was 0.783.

Conclusions

Serum LDH is probably associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is used in dermatology practice, particularly as a prognostic marker for cutaneous lymphoma. LDH is an intracellular enzyme involved in anaerobic glycolysis, and is found at low concentrations in the blood. LDH is produced in every tissue, thus cell damage releases LDH into the circulation, so the causes of elevated LDH levels are multiple. The utility of LDH in dermatology practice is reviewed, alongside current diagnostic and staging guidelines.

Dear Editor,

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become one of the most serious pandemics of the recent times. It is crucial and necessary to identify laboratory markers which could provide predictions for the severity as well as the prognosis of the disease in order to guarantee proper clinical care for the patients. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis is to explore the unclear association of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevations and the severity of COVID-19.

We gained access to relevant literature by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library through June 3, 2020. We used the following terms: "Lactate Dehydrogenase", "2019 novel coronavirus", "2019-nCoV", and "COVID-19". Articles which provide data about patients with COVID-19 whether of severity or not (including either respiratory distress, ICU admission, and/or death) were selected. LDH elevations were reported based on reference laboratory parameters for each study. Two investigators (X.Y. Chen, M.Y. Huang) independently extracted the data by discussing with the corresponding authors about any different opinions until they reach a mutual agreement. We applied the exact binomial method to extract the odds ratios (OR) in forest plots with 95% confidence interval (CI). The presumption of homogeneity was not accepted as a valid statement when P < 0.1 and I 2 > 50%. All data were processed in the Stata version12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

After reviewing titles as well as abstracts, we continued to read the whole texts of the remaining articles. At last, a total of 6 articles were selected by this meta-analysis as shown in Table 1. Figure 1 summarizes the OR pooled by the selected studies, showing that elevated LDH values are related to an almost 12-times increase in the risks for severe COVID-19 with low heterogeneity being observed (OR, 12.43; 95% CI, 7.23–21.38; P < 0.001; I 2, 8.2%). Therefore, the fixed-effects model was used for the meta-analysis.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase as an early marker for outcome in patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic melanoma [^112yxY7H]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Serum LDH is a standardised and simple marker, which is easy to use in the clinic. High LDH is a well-known marker for poor outcome in the era of chemotherapy. We have recently shown that in patients treated with ipilimumab, an increasing baseline LDH — as part of a prognostic score with ECOG performance status and number of involved organs — was independently associated with poor survival. Two other studies confirmed this inverse correlation. Only one trial with an anti-PD-1 agent evaluated the predictive value of LDH; however, there was no difference regarding efficacy between patients with normal LDH or elevated LDH.

About half of all patients in our real world cohort had an elevated LDH at baseline. We are not aware of any study that investigates the role of monitoring LDH during treatment in patients who receive anti-PD-1 treatment. We have shown that LDH could provide helpful information to guide decision-making during treatment even before the first scan. For example, in patients who already have an increased LDH at baseline, further increase during the first 2 weeks likely reflects progression of disease under treatment with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. In this case, combination immunotherapy or a change to MAPK-targeted agents could be considered. In an era of increasing choice and expensive treatment, determination of biomarkers is paramount. However, we cannot say whether an early switch to, for example, combination immunotherapy would improve prognosis. A randomised setting would be needed to answer this question. An optimal sequencing of immunotherapy with MAPK inhibitors also needs to be determined prospectively.

We are aware of limitations of our study. Owing to the retrospective design, there may be a risk of patient selection bias; however, we included all consecutive patients at our centre. Another limitation is the relatively small number of patients, and we had to reduce the number even further in our landmark analysis to maintain methodological rigour. A third point is the lack of information about the PD-L1 status in the tumour, which may be a potential predictor for efficacy. We cannot exclude that PD-L1-positive tumours may be over-represented in the group with low LDH who have a favourable diagnosis in our population.

We conclude that LDH could be a very useful marker at baseline and during treatment in patients treated with PD-1 antibodies for advanced melanoma. In daily practice, this would be helpful for counselling patients before initiating therapy and guiding treatment decisions during the course of treatment. Further prospective evaluation is required to confirm our results.

### Prognostic significance of serial determinations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the follow-up of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [^114zarkZ]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Early recognition of disease progression in low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is an important decision point concerning intensive therapies. In a screen program searching for dynamic prognostic determinants, we have identified lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a most suitable follow-up parameter.

Patients and Methods

LDH levels were serially determined in 221 patients with de novo MDS (median age 70 years, range 24–94). The increase in LDH was correlated with survival and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolution.

Results

Confirming previous data, an elevated LDH at diagnosis was found to be associated with an increased probability of AML evolution and decreased probability of survival (P < 0.05). In the follow-up, we found that in patients who progressed (to higher IPSS category or AML), LDH levels were significantly higher in the two 3-month period preceding progression compared with the initial two 3-month period (P < 0.005). In a subgroup of patients, the increase in LDH was accompanied or followed by other signs of disease progression, such as occurrence of thrombocytopenia or appearance of circulating blasts. In multivariate analyses, the LDH increase was found to be an independent prognostic variable.

Conclusions

LDH is an interesting follow-up parameter in MDS, which may assist in early recognition of disease progression and thus help in risk stratification and patient selection for interventional therapies.

### Association of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and advanced hepatic fibrosis in the United States: a cross-sectional study using NHANES data from 2007 to 2018 [^1114Qn2Y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the fatty liver disease and AHF studied in this article, we could conclude from Tables 3 and 4 that in Model 3, which was constructed by adjusting for all variables, there was a positive association between log-transformed LDH elevation and increased FLI, NFS, and the prevalence of AHF. The results indicated that for each 1-unit increase in log-transformed LDH, the NFS increased by an average of 0.669 units and the odds of AHF by 3.087. And if LDH is separated into tertiles, participants in Tertile 2 had a 0.159-unit higher NFS and participants in Tertile 3 had a 0.338-unit higher FLI compared to the Tertile 1. Similarly, individuals in Tertile 3 had 1.937 times greater odds of AHF than those in Tertile 1. It had been demonstrated that LDH was shown to be significantly elevated in mice with alcoholic fatty liver disease following alcohol treatment compared to controls. Furthermore, LDH levels correspondingly decreased in the suppressive model established for alcoholic liver disease. Experiments conducted to establish NAFLD models in mice found a notable rise in serum LDH levels in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHF). As illustrated in Fig. 3, elevated log-transformed LDH levels in males were associated with higher AHF prevalence. Previous studies have indicated that females exhibit a reduced likelihood of liver fibrosis compared to males, a phenomenon that may be attributed to hormonal and genetic factors. Sex hormones play an important role in the progression of liver disease, with estrogens offering protection against hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, while androgens may exacerbate the condition. It is imperative to acknowledge these warnings and focus on gender-based differences in clinical practice for early detection and treatment of the disease. Non-Hispanic blacks and those with lower income levels are more likely to have advanced liver fibrosis. This phenomenon may be attributed to the genetic variations present within diverse populations and the poor economic status observed in non-Hispanic blacks and in individuals with lower income levels, which may lead to a reduced level of physical health and ultimately an increased risk of AHF. Furthermore, physical inactivity and obesity were associated with elevated AHF prevalence, paralleling patterns seen in individuals with hypertension and diabetes. Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes have been identified as major risk factors for the progression of NAFLD and AHF. The findings of the stratified analysis demonstrated that obese patients exhibited an heightened AHF prevalence, which is consistent with previous studies. A clinical study found elevated serum LDH activity in obese children with steatosis. The presence of obesity has been demonstrated to exacerbate the degree of lipid accumulation in the liver, which leads to inflammation and hepatocyte damage. Hypertension leads to increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver, which promotes the activation of hepatic stellate cells and subsequent hepatic injury. In diabetes, chronic abnormalities in blood glucose lead to the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which cause inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby promoting the prevalence of AHF. Physical inactivity is often accompanied by adverse health consequences, including obesity, hypertension, and glucose abnormalities that affect the liver through multiple mechanisms. Lack of exercise also results in a diminished immune system, which hurts health and increases the risk of liver diseases. Subgroup analyses indicated that individuals with poor dietary quality exhibited an increased prevalence of AHF. Previous research showed that the Mediterranean diet would have an improvement in liver stiffness and that a high-quality diet exerted a considerable influence on the association between advanced liver fibrosis and mortality. The interaction analysis further revealed that a high-quality diet was protective in hypertensive and diabetic populations. Therefore, it is important to emphasize diet quality in clinical practice to reduce the risk of AHF in high-risk populations. While the relationship between log-transformed LDH and AHF was not statistically significant in other Hispanic, the interaction analysis revealed a protective effect of other Hispanic on the relationship between log-transformed LDH and AHF in different populations, which may be related to genetics, living environment, diet, and other factors. The study further demonstrated that a significant association between PNPLA3 rs738409[G] and the risk of liver fibrosis, while Hispanic individuals carried the gene at a lower frequency. The analysis of covariance for the included covariates in the study indicated that the majority of the variables had variance inflation factors (VIFs) ranging from 1.616 to 5.295, except for the variables age (40–64 and ≥ 65 years old), ALT, and AST. This finding suggested the presence of collinearity among these covariates, which may be attributable to the fact that ALT and AST are both sensitive indicators of liver damage and may be elevated at the same time in the presence of a liver abnormality. In the elderly population, the presence of some chronic diseases, health impairments, metabolic abnormalities, and certain causes of liver injury can lead to elevated liver enzymes. However, age and liver enzymes serve as critical indicators in investigating liver diseases, especially NAFLD and AHF. Consequently, caution should be taken when removing these highly correlated indicators. Addressing this issue necessitates larger sample sizes in subsequent studies and the exploration of more accurate methods to minimize the effects of covariance and enhance the reliability of the study.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase and survival following cancer diagnosis [^116drygZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Based on prospectively collected serum LDH, our study demonstrated an inverse association between LDH and survival following cancer diagnosis, adding to the current evidence on the role of LDH in cancer progression. Future mechanistic studies are therefore necessary to establish whether serum LDH is a proxy of tumour growth and severity, which explains its association to cancer survival, or whether it is also involved in early carcinogenesis.

### Lactate dehydrogenase as a biomarker of hemolysis-associated nitric oxide resistance, priapism, leg ulceration, pulmonary hypertension, and death in patients with sickle cell disease [^114Bw26b]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is prevalent in adult patients with sickle cell disease and is strongly associated with early mortality and markers of hemolysis, in particular, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Intravascular hemolysis leads to impaired bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), mediated by NO scavenging by plasma oxyhemoglobin and by arginine degradation by plasma arginase. We hypothesized that serum LDH may represent a convenient biomarker of intravascular hemolysis and NO bioavailability, characterizing a clinical subphenotype of hemolysis-associated vasculopathy. In a cohort of 213 patients with sickle cell disease, we found statistically significant associations of steady-state LDH with low levels of hemoglobin and haptoglobin and high levels of reticulocytes, bilirubin, plasma hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, arginase, and soluble adhesion molecules. LDH isoenzyme fractionation confirmed predominance of LD1 and LD2, the principal isoforms within erythrocytes. In a subgroup, LDH levels closely correlated with plasma cell-free hemoglobin, accelerated NO consumption by plasma, and impaired vasodilatory responses to an NO donor. Remarkably, this simple biomarker was associated with a clinical subphenotype of pulmonary hypertension, leg ulceration, priapism, and risk of death in patients with sickle cell disease. We propose that LDH elevation identifies patients with a syndrome of hemolysis-associated NO resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and end-organ vasculopathy.

### Identification of human D lactate dehydrogenase deficiency [^114sLSvf]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Phenotypic and biochemical categorization of humans with detrimental variants can provide valuable information on gene function. We illustrate this with the identification of two different homozygous variants resulting in enzymatic loss-of-function in LDHD, encoding lactate dehydrogenase D, in two unrelated patients with elevated D-lactate urinary excretion and plasma concentrations. We establish the role of LDHD by demonstrating that LDHD loss-of-function in zebrafish results in increased concentrations of D-lactate. D-lactate levels are rescued by wildtype LDHD but not by patients' variant LDHD, confirming these variants' loss-of-function effect. This work provides the first in vivo evidence that LDHD is responsible for human D-lactate metabolism. This broadens the differential diagnosis of D-lactic acidosis, an increasingly recognized complication of short bowel syndrome with unpredictable onset and severity. With the expanding incidence of intestinal resection for disease or obesity, the elucidation of this metabolic pathway may have relevance for those patients with D-lactic acidosis.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) consensus statement on essential biomarkers for immunotherapy clinical protocols [^115d2Xq9]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Lactate dehydrogenase

Data across tumor types and global patient populations consistently confirm an association between elevated serum LDH and poor survival outcomesincluding in those treated with ICB therapy. A recent review of 22,882 patients found elevated LDH levels (median serum LDH of 245 units per liter (U/L) in these studies with adult LDH levels ranging from 140 to 280 (U/L)) that were associated with an HR for OS of 1.7 (95% CI 1.62 to 1.79; p < 0.00001). The effect was most prominent in patients with renal cell, melanoma, gastric, prostate, nasopharyngeal and lung cancers.

Potential biological impacts of elevated LDH include metabolic alterations associated with tumor necrosis, lactic acidosis within the tumor bed, and other measures of debris released from the tumor including HMGB1 and ATP.LDH is a tumor marker associated with so-called Warburg metabolism with aerobic glycolysis. Multiple studies suggest LDH levels may correlate with other prognostic biomarkers, including NLR and C-reactive protein (CRP). An intriguing study of 418 patients with solid tumors treated with ICB with PD-1/PD-L1 found a correlation between post-treatment LDH and more severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Thus, we recommend including a baseline and post-treatment LDH level in all patients with advanced disease on immunotherapy trials as essential. Although a majority (> 75% of those polled) considered it essential it was deemed "less" essential than N/L ratio and MSI status.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^112fEYSZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Serum lactate for suspected sepsis — diagnostic performance and adjunctive use: Lactate cutoffs for an elevated level ranged from 1.6–2.5 mmol/L, with sensitivities 66–83% and specificities 80–85%, and pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios 4.75 and 0.29, respectively; lactate alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule-in or rule-out sepsis, and a weak recommendation favors using serum lactate as an adjunctive test to modify pretest probability in suspected but not confirmed sepsis. Lactate is part of the Sepsis-3 definition of septic shock.

### Clinical evaluation of potential usefulness of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia [^114c7NGY]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

It was known that kinds of disorders can raise LDH levels, such as infectious disease, heart failure, hypothyroidism and cancer. The inflammatory responses reflected the nonspecific responses to hypoxia, tissue injury, and necrosis, indicating a correlation between infectious cells, immune system and inflammatory response. Neutrophilia may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasion, coagulation activation could have been related to sustained inflammatory response. In this study, complications of COVID-19 pneumonia included respiratory failure and liver injury. It is believed that the complication was signs of progression of disease, in turn produced influence on disease.

There are several limitations to our study. Firstly, almost all patients may have received medical intervention (antimicrobial therapy, fluid administration, mechanical ventilation, or steroid therapy), which may affect serum LDH titer. In addition, there may have been a selection bias in one medical institution. Moreover, a decrease in LDH by cut-off value has a poor sensitivity and specificity to predicting of image improvement, which might due to secondary organ dysfunction in late-term of diseases, not the direct the effect of pulmonary abnormality.

Taken together, our data suggested that LDH is a potentially useful follow-up parameter in COVID-19 pneumonia, which might assist in recognition of disease progression and thus help in risk stratification and early intervention.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase predicts for overall survival benefit in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin [^115tUGKW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme involved in anaerobic glycolysis and regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-containing complex 1 (PI3K/Akt/TORC1) pathway as well as tumor hypoxia/necrosis. High serum LDH levels are associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We tested whether serum LDH is prognostic and has predictive value in patients with metastatic RCC receiving an mTOR inhibitor.

Patients and Methods

We evaluated pretreatment and post-treatment serum LDH in 404 poor-risk patients with RCC treated with the TORC1 inhibitor temsirolimus or interferon alfa in an international phase III randomized trial. The proportional hazards model was used to test for the prognostic and predictive association of LDH in predicting overall survival (OS).

Results

Mean baseline serum normalized LDH was 1.23 times the upper limit of normal (ULN; range, 0.05 to 28.5 × ULN). The multivariable hazard ratio for death was 2.81 (95% CI, 2.01 to 3.94; P < .001) for patients with LDH more than 1 × ULN versus patients with LDH ≤ 1 × ULN. The LDH-treatment interaction term was statistically significant for OS (P = 0.016). Among 140 patients with LDH above the ULN, OS was significantly improved with temsirolimus (6.9 v 4.2 months; P < .002). Among 264 patients with normal LDH, OS was not significantly improved with temsirolimus as compared with interferon therapy (11.7 v 10.4 months; p = 0.514).

Conclusion

Serum LDH is a prognostic and a predictive biomarker for the survival benefit conferred by TORC1 inhibition in poor-risk RCC. Further investigation of the predictive role of LDH as a measure of benefit with PI3K/TORC1 pathway inhibition in other RCC risk groups and other tumor types is warranted.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase and survival following cancer diagnosis [^113Myk5H]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

We further visualised the association between LDH and cancer with cumulative incidence functions (Figure 3) and found higher cumulative risks of dying from overall, prostate, pulmonary, colorectal, gastro-oesophageal, kidney, gynaecological and haematological cancer with high LDH levels. Interestingly, an inverse association was observed for head and neck cancer that approached statistical significance (Gray's test P = 0.05).

In our secondary analysis, LDH levels measured within 6-month time intervals before cancer diagnosis were found to be increasing in interval times closer to diagnosis for overall and several types of cancer such as hepatobiliary and haematological cancer (Supplementary Figure S2). The LDH measurements taken within different interval times were highly correlated (r > 0.5 and P < 0.0001; Supplementary Table S2). When risk of overall death in all participants was assessed for every interval time, a stronger association was observed with mean LDH measured closer to diagnosis, that is, within 1 year before diagnosis. However, we found an increased risk of early death in those with high LDH measured 30 to 36 months before diagnosis (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.15–1.86). For cancer-specific death, associations were also stronger when LDH was measured closer to diagnosis (Table 3). Similarly, in patients with stage I to II breast cancer, we found a positive association between LDH measured 30 to 36 months before diagnosis and overall death (HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.38–6.39), and between LDH measured 6 to 12 months before diagnosis and breast cancer death (HR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.24–16.00). Results in advanced stage of disease were hampered by a low number of events (results not shown).

### Lactate dehydrogenase contribution to symptom persistence in long COVID: a pooled analysis [^112Wh2tb]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

There's critical need for risk predictors in long COVID. This meta-analysis evaluates the evidence for an association between plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and long COVID and explores the contribution of LDH to symptoms persistent across the distinct post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) domains. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published up to 20 March 2023 for studies that reported data on LDH levels in COVID-19 survivors with and without PASC. Random-effect meta-analysis was employed to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence interval of each outcome. There were a total of 8289 study participants (3338 PASC vs. 4951 controls) from 46 studies. Our meta-analysis compared to the controls showed a significant association between LDH elevation and Resp-PASC [SMD = 1.07, 95%CI = 0.72, 1.41, p = 0.01] but not Cardio-PASC [SMD = 1.79, 95%CI = -0.02, 3.61, p = 0.05], Neuro-PASC [SMD = 0.19, 95%CI = -0.24, 0.61, p = 0.40], and Gastrointestinal-PASC [SMD = 0.45, 95%CI = -1.08, 1.98, p = 0.56]. This meta-analysis suggests elevated LDH can be used for predicting Resp-PASC, but not Cardio-PASC, Neuro-PASC or gastrointestinal-PASC. Thus, elevated plasma LDH following COVID infection may be considered as a disease biomarker.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase level predicts the prognosis in bladder cancer patients [^114kwxNL]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Totally, this study observes that a higher pretreatment serum LDH level is associated with adverse prognosis in BC patients. In addition, serum LDH level may predict the occurrence of BC patients. Thus, LDH level could be served as a prognostic biomarker for BC patients.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase and survival following cancer diagnosis [^1159KP2W]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence that high level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is associated with poorer overall survival in several malignancies, but its link to cancer-specific survival is unclear.

Methods

A total of 7895 individuals diagnosed with cancer between 1986 and 1999 were selected for this study. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess overall and cancer-specific death by the z-score and clinical categories of serum LDH prospectively collected within 3 years before diagnosis. Site-specific analysis was performed for major cancers. Analysis was repeated by different lag times between LDH measurements and diagnosis.

Results

At the end of follow-up, 5799 participants were deceased. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall and cancer-specific death in the multivariable model were 1.43 (1.31–1.56) and 1.46 (1.32–1.61), respectively, for high compared with low prediagnostic LDH. Site-specific analysis showed high LDH to correlate with an increased risk of death from prostate, pulmonary, colorectal, gastro-oesophageal, gynaecological and haematological cancers. Serum LDH assessed within intervals closer to diagnosis was more strongly associated with overall and cancer-specific death.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrated an inverse association of baseline serum LDH with cancer-specific survival, corroborating its role in cancer progression.

### Serum lactate dehydrogenase level predicts the prognosis in bladder cancer patients [^1121A9RT]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently, several studies investigated the association between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and the prognosis of urothelial carcinoma. However, no studies explored the role of serum LDH level in the survival of overall bladder cancer (BC). In this study, we intended to address the association of LDH level with the prognosis of BC.

Methods

206 patients with BC were included in this study. The clinical data and blood samples of patients were collected. The overall survival and progression-free survival were used. Kaplan-Meier method and Log rank test were used to evaluate the effects of LDH level on the survival of BC. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to identify prognosis predictors of BC.

Results

Data indicated that serum LDH level in the BC patients was significantly higher than those in controls. In addition, this study suggested that serum LDH level was associated with T stage, N stage, tumor size, M stage, pathological type, and lymphovascular invasion. The Kaplan-Meier analysis found significant differences in the OS and PFS rate between lower and higher serum LDH level groups (LDH ≥ 225 U/L and < 225 U/L). Multivariate Cox regression indicated that pathological type, T2–3, and higher level of LDH were independently associated with adverse prognosis in BC patients.

Conclusion

The higher serum LDH level (≥ 225 U/L) is associated with poor prognosis in patients with BC. Serum LDH level could be used as a novel predictive biomarker for BC patients.

### Lactate dehydrogenase-5 (LDH-5) overexpression in non-small-cell lung cancer tissues is linked to tumour hypoxia, angiogenic factor production and poor prognosis [^114nU66a]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Serum levels, however, are unlikely to reflect adequately the intratumoral LDH activity, as the bulk of the neoplastic disease or individual variations of LDH clearance are strong confounding factors. On the other hand, biochemical assessment of LDH from tumour tissue extracts give measurements that strongly vary with the amount of the nonmalignant cellular component (stromal and reactive cells) or even with the extent of necrotic tissue that composes the tumour sample used to obtain tissue extracts. In the present study, we showed that immunohistochemical assessment of LDH-5 allows (i) the differential assessment of LDH-5 production by cancer and noncancerous cells of the tumours, (ii) the intensity of LDH-5 activity within cancer cells and (iii) the identification of subcellular patterns of LDH-5 localisation that could be of biological relevance. Immunohistochemistry, therefore, allows the characterisation of the individual cancer cell LDH activity, which cannot be adequately predicted by serum LDH levels or tissue LDH biochemistry. Indeed, comparative analysis of serum LDH levels and immunohistochemistry showed a positive trend and the results between the two methods were not overlapping.

The patterns of LDH-5 subcellular expression by cancer cells were cytoplasmic with a varying degree of nuclear localisation. Lactate dehydrogenase is well known to reside in both the cytoplasm and nuclei. In the majority of cases, the tumoral stroma (fibroblasts, vessels and reactive cells) was unreactive for LDH-5, while in a minority of cases extensive cytoplasmic expression of LDH-5 in stromal cells accompanied LDH-5 overexpression by cancer cells. This finding, together with the observation that serum LDH levels correlated positively with cancer cell LDH-5 reactivity but not with stroma reactivity, strongly suggests that high LDH levels found in the sera of cancer patients are mainly of cancer cell origin, while the contribution of stroma cells is minimal. The rapid drop of LDH serum levels 8 days following surgery further confirms that the excess serum LDH levels found in a subset of NSCLC patients is of tumour origin.
