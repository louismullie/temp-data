## Question

Stop cordarone in qt prolongation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to stop amiodarone (Cordarone) in the setting of QT prolongation and how to manage that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risk profile of amiodarone for torsades de pointes (TdP). Then, I should verify the specific QTc thresholds and relative increases that trigger action. Next, I will consider patient-specific risk modifiers and concurrent QT-prolonging drugs. After that, I need to outline immediate management steps if thresholds are exceeded, including electrolyte correction and monitoring. Finally, I will address special scenarios such as life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias where amiodarone may still be necessary, and I should confirm the pharmacokinetic implications of stopping amiodarone given its long half-life.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk profile. Amiodarone commonly prolongs the QT interval, but it is only very rarely associated with TdP, with estimates generally less than 0.5% in clinical use, which is substantially lower than many other QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics; this lower TdP risk is reflected in both guideline statements and consensus documents, though rare cases do occur, so I should not be complacent [^113tL3XX] [^1165yWc8] [^113Lw4u7].

> Now, I should verify the specific thresholds that warrant stopping amiodarone. The clearest directive is from the EHRA/ESC consensus, which recommends discontinuing amiodarone if excessive QT prolongation occurs, specifically when QTc exceeds 500 ms. This aligns with broader hospital safety guidance that marked QTc prolongation to more than 500 ms or a rise of at least 60 ms from baseline should prompt prompt action, including removal of the offending agent, even though amiodarone itself has a relatively low TdP incidence compared with other QT-prolonging drugs [^113tL3XX] [^113m8FBf] [^1139UEzN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check patient-specific risk modifiers that lower my threshold for action. Female sex, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, structural heart disease, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant QT-prolonging medications all increase TdP risk. In such patients, I should have a lower threshold to discontinue amiodarone and be more aggressive with monitoring and correction of modifiable risks, especially if the QTc approaches or exceeds 500 ms or increases by more than 60 ms from baseline [^113m8FBf] [^1122HasY] [^115SpkAn].

> I will now examine immediate management steps when QTc thresholds are exceeded. I should confirm that the first priority is to stop the offending agent — in this case amiodarone — then promptly correct electrolytes, targeting potassium around 4.5–5.0 mEq/L and repleting magnesium, and institute continuous ECG monitoring in a setting where rapid defibrillation is available. If TdP occurs or is imminent, administer intravenous magnesium and consider temporary overdrive pacing or isoproterenol to increase heart rate and suppress pause-dependent triggers, while avoiding QT-prolonging drugs and bradycardia-promoting combinations [^113m8FBf] [^112qnTUo] [^114XKEJe].

> But wait, what if the patient has life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias refractory to other therapies. I should double-check the indication context: amiodarone is indicated for recurrent ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia when other agents fail or are not tolerated; in such high-stakes scenarios, the benefit of amiodarone may outweigh the risk of QT prolongation, and guidelines allow continuation with vigilant monitoring and correction of risk factors, recognizing that amiodarone's TdP risk is low but not zero [^111tNzSz] [^115VW199] [^117Tahde].

> Next, I should review the pharmacokinetic implications of stopping amiodarone. Let me verify the half-life: amiodarone has a very long and variable half-life, with antiarrhythmic effects persisting for weeks to months after discontinuation. Therefore, even after stopping, residual QT-prolonging effect and drug interactions can continue, so I need to plan ongoing monitoring and account for interactions with newly introduced agents during this washout period [^111bf2wS] [^116FNwa9].

> I need to ensure I am not conflating amiodarone with other QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics. Unlike sotalol or dofetilide, which carry higher and more immediate TdP risk and often require in-hospital initiation with strict QT monitoring, amiodarone's lower TdP incidence shapes a somewhat different risk–benefit calculus. Nonetheless, when QTc exceeds 500 ms or rises by more than 60 ms, the balance still favors discontinuation unless the clinical indication is compelling and no safer alternative exists [^113m8FBf] [^116vKSoU] [^113tL3XX].

> Putting this together, my decision algorithm is as follows: if QTc is 500 ms or greater or increases by 60 ms or more from baseline, I should stop amiodarone, correct potassium and magnesium, and monitor on telemetry. If the patient is in a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia scenario where amiodarone is indispensable and alternatives are inadequate, I may continue with enhanced monitoring and risk mitigation, documenting the rationale. If QTc is less than 500 ms and the patient is low risk, I may continue with close follow-up and repeat ECGs, adjusting the dose or discontinuing if the interval continues to lengthen toward the threshold [^113tL3XX] [^113m8FBf] [^117Tahde].

Stop amiodarone when **QTc > 500 ms** or when **QTc increases > 60 ms from baseline** [^113m8FBf] [^112qnTUo], as these thresholds confer increased torsades risk [^114mPDSR]. Immediate action is required if **QTc ≥ 500 ms** or if **QTc increases by ≥ 60 ms** — stop amiodarone, correct electrolytes, and monitor on telemetry [^113m8FBf] [^112qnTUo]. For QTc 450–499 ms, reassess within 24–48 hours and reduce or stop amiodarone if QTc approaches 500 ms or symptoms occur. Continue with close monitoring if QTc < 450 ms, but stop if it rises to ≥ 500 ms or increases by ≥ 60 ms [^113tL3XX].

## Clinical thresholds for stopping amiodarone due to QT prolongation

| **Qtc interval** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 500 ms or increase ≥ 60 ms from baseline | Immediately stop amiodarone; correct electrolytes; monitor on telemetry [^113m8FBf] [^113tL3XX] |
| 450–499 ms | Reassess within 24–48 hours; reduce dose or stop if approaching 500 ms or if symptoms occur |
| < 450 ms | Continue with close monitoring; stop if QTc rises to ≥ 500 ms or increases by ≥ 60 ms [^113tL3XX] [^113m8FBf] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting these thresholds

- **QTc ≥ 500 ms**: Strongly associated with torsades de pointes (TdP); stopping amiodarone is recommended when QTc reaches or exceeds this threshold [^114jAiSn] [^113m8FBf].
- **Increase ≥ 60 ms from baseline**: A rise of this magnitude significantly increases TdP risk and warrants stopping amiodarone [^113m8FBf] [^114mPDSR].
- **QTc 450–499 ms**: Considered moderate risk; close monitoring and dose adjustment are advised [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring immediate cessation of amiodarone

- **QTc ≥ 500 ms or increase ≥ 60 ms from baseline**: Immediate cessation and correction of electrolytes are required [^113m8FBf].
- **Symptomatic patients**: Syncope, palpitations, or documented arrhythmias necessitate immediate cessation and monitoring [^114mPDSR].
- **Concurrent QT-prolonging drugs**: Increased risk of TdP; consider stopping amiodarone if QTc prolongs significantly [^112TXuvw].

---

## Clinical scenarios where amiodarone may be continued with caution

- **QTc < 450 ms**: May continue with close monitoring and regular ECGs [^notfound].
- **Life-threatening arrhythmias**: In refractory ventricular arrhythmias, continuation may be justified with vigilant monitoring and risk mitigation [^115VW199].
- **No suitable alternatives**: When alternatives are contraindicated or ineffective, cautious continuation with close monitoring may be appropriate [^113suJBX].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Regular ECG monitoring**: Baseline and periodic ECGs to track QTc changes [^116YPiry].
- **Electrolyte management**: Maintain potassium ≥ 4.5 mEq/L and magnesium ≥ 2.0 mEq/L [^114XKEJe].
- **Patient education**: Teach patients to report palpitations, syncope, or dizziness promptly [^116vKSoU].
- **Alternative therapies**: Consider beta-blockers or non-QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics when QTc prolongs [^1133V421].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Stop amiodarone**: QTc ≥ 500 ms or increase ≥ 60 ms from baseline [^113m8FBf].
- **Monitor closely**: QTc 450–499 ms; reduce dose or stop if approaching 500 ms [^notfound].
- **Continue cautiously**: QTc < 450 ms with regular ECG monitoring [^1164ezHJ].
- **Immediate action**: Correct electrolytes and monitor on telemetry when QTc is significantly prolonged [^112qnTUo].

Amiodarone should be stopped when **QTc ≥ 500 ms or when QTc increases by ≥ 60 ms from baseline** due to the increased risk of torsades de pointes. For QTc 450–499 ms, reassess within 24–48 hours and reduce or stop amiodarone if QTc approaches 500 ms or symptoms occur. Continue with close monitoring if QTc < 450 ms, but stop if QTc rises to ≥ 500 ms or increases by ≥ 60 ms.

ICH E14 3 describes the clinical evaluation of QTc prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for nonantiarrhythmic drugs, the TQT study (Figure 1 c). The goal of the TQT study is not to classify drugs as being proarrhythmic per se. The primary goal is to determine whether a drug prolongs the QTc beyond a certain threshold that informs the necessary intensity of ECG monitoring in late‐stage clinical trials in patients and to cover the supratherapeutic concentration that would be obtained due to inhibition of metabolism or excretion. TQT studies are typically conducted in healthy volunteers and include dose levels that result in drug concentrations exceeding those expected in patients. The ICH E14 Questions & Answers (Q&A) document was revised in 2015 to allow exposure–response (concentration‐QTc) modeling to be used as a primary analysis for assessing the QTc interval prolongation risk of new drugs. 4 The use of exposure–response analysis in early‐phase studies can serve as an alternative pathway to assess QTc prolongation of new drugs in lieu of a dedicated TQT study. 5

The ICH S7B and E14 guidelines have been successful in that no new marketed drugs have been associated with unexpected QTc prolongation or unacceptable risk of TdP. However, this has had unintended effects on drug development. While these two biomarkers (hERG block and QTc prolongation) are sensitive for identifying drugs with TdP risk, they are not specific, as multiple drugs block hERG and/or prolong QTc but do not cause TdP. Drug developers routinely perform early screening for hERG potassium channel activity and may discontinue compounds from development if they block hERG. 6 They could then select compounds to advance that may not have optimal on‐target or other pharmacological profile effects. 7 Furthermore, the finding of QTc prolongation during clinical development can result in the termination of a drug despite the fact that QTc prolongation does not necessarily predict a significant proarrhythmic liability. In addition, numerous drugs contain labeling information about QTc prolongation (often quite moderate prolongation) but have an unclear risk of TdP. This may influence a physician's prescribing behavior, such as discouraging the use of certain drugs.

### Amiodarone-induced T-U fusion [^1164UXYF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrythmic drug for various atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It has the potential to cause prolongation of the QT interval, which, in turn, can increases the incidence of torsade de pointes. Amiodarone is also one of the causes of prominent U waves. The presented case exemplifies the phenomenon of amiodarone-induced T-U fusion and QT prolongation. Other causes of QT prolongation as electrolyte abnormalities or administration of other drugs that prolong the QT interval were excluded. Awareness of this phenomenon and method of calculation of QT interval in this scenario is of utmost importance.

Class III antiarrhythmic agent — amiodarone dosing, adverse effects, and precautions are detailed as follows: initial dosing is 400–600 mg QD in divided doses (loading dose), followed by 100–200 mg QD (maintenance dose); up to 1200 mg QD may be considered in an inpatient monitoring setting (loading dose), and up to 200 mg QD maintenance is noted. Reported adverse effects include bradycardia, QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes (rare), with additional noncardiac toxicities listed. Use with caution in sinus or AV conduction disease (in absence of pacemaker) and other listed conditions, and avoid drugs with SA and/or AV nodal–blocking properties. Interactions include the need to reduce warfarin dose by 50% and reduce digoxin dose by 30%–50%, and to avoid other QT‑prolonging drugs.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome — clinical features and risks include that marked QT prolongation with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsades de pointes occurs in 1% to 10% of patients receiving QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs and most cases display a "short-long-short" sequence before tachycardia. QT intervals, uncorrected for rate, are generally greater than 500 ms, prominent U waves are common, and marked QTU prolongation may be evident only on postpause beats. Genetic susceptibility may contribute, with commoner DNA variants having frequencies ranging up to 15% of some populations. Presentations include incidental detection, palpitations, syncope due to prolonged episodes of torsades de pointes, or sudden cardiac death. The QT-prolonging agent d-sotalol increased mortality in a large randomized clinical trial, and in the DIAMOND trial, 3.3% of patients with severe heart failure (HF) had torsades de pointes during the first 72 h of dofetilide therapy.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Nonselective ion channel–blocking drugs for atrial fibrillation — azimilide, dronedarone, and tedisamil: Azimilide has a long elimination half-life (114 h), allowing for once-daily administration, and in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia trials at doses of 100 and 125 mg daily it prolonged time to recurrence of AF and atrial flutter and reduced symptoms associated with recurrence; in a placebo-controlled trial involving 3717 survivors of MI with LV systolic dysfunction, azimilide, 100 mg daily, was associated with a 1-y mortality rate similar to placebo, with major adverse effects of severe neutropenia (less than 500 cells per microliter) in 0.9% and torsades de pointes in 0.5%. Dronedarone is a noniodinated amiodarone derivative that, in a randomized placebo-controlled study involving 204 patients undergoing cardioversion of persistent AF, at 800 mg daily delayed first recurrence from 5.3 to 60 d; higher doses (1200 and 1600 mg daily) were no more effective and were associated with gastrointestinal side effects, and to date neither organ toxicity nor proarrhythmia has been reported; in EURIDIS and ADONIS, dronedarone prolonged the time to first documented AF/atrial flutter recurrence and helped control the ventricular rate. Tedisamil blocks several potassium channels and causes a reverse rate-dependent QT-interval prolongation, and Tedisamil (4.0 and 0.6 mg/kg) was superior to placebo for rapid conversion (within 35 min) of recent-onset AF or atrial flutter, with main side effects of pain at the injection site and ventricular tachycardia.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^111SLjpo]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment of recurrent VA in patients with ischemic heart disease or NICM — algorithm highlights: Under the polymorphic VT/VF branch, the algorithm advises to consider reversible causes and lists drug or electrolyte induced management with "Treat for QT prolongation, discontinue offending medication, correct electrolytes (Class I)" and ischemia management with "Revascularize (Class I)". If there are no reversible causes, it shows "Amiodarone (Class I)" or "Beta blockers or lidocaine (Class IIa)". When arrhythmia is not controlled and there are "Identifiable PVC triggers (Class IIa)", it directs "Catheter ablation (Class I)", while absence of such triggers leads to "Autonomic modulation (Class IIb)". For sustained monomorphic VT, the algorithm includes "Amiodarone or sotalol (Class I)", allows "Catheter ablation as first-line therapy (Class IIb)", and for "Arrhythmia not controlled" proceeds to "Catheter ablation (Class I)".

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias guideline — amiodarone, lidocaine, and procainamide for VT: In 1 study, amiodarone was more effective than lidocaine in terminating incessant VT with improved survival at 24 hours. For patients with recurrent, stable VT not in the setting of an AMI, intravenous procainamide has been shown to be superior to lidocaine for terminating the arrhythmia, and one randomized trial of 62 patients found procainamide superior to amiodarone for termination of stable VT. Adverse events, including hypotension were more common with amiodarone, but the difference was not statistically significant. Procainamide and its metabolite n-acetylprocainamide have potassium channel blocking properties that may prolong the QT interval, and in patients who already have QT prolongation, administration of procainamide may further prolong the QT interval and lead to torsades de pointes.

### Prevalence of the QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in hospitalized geriatric patients: findings of a single center cross-sectional study in Pakistan [^116epRay]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients taking QT combinations or potential QT DDIs should be provided appropriate attention because when there are other additional risk factors present, these drugs and their combinations may have catastrophic consequences. Another significant problem that contributed to the high frequency of QT-prolonging drugs in hospitalized elderly individuals was polypharmacy. Due to the administration of various medications and their comorbidities, elderly individuals were more susceptible to QT-prolonging drugs and potential QT Drug-Drug Interactions. Patients who are more likely to experience deadly arrhythmias should have their QT interval monitored. The antiarrhythmic medication amiodarone, which is known to extend the QT interval as well as TdP, was widely used. A similar trend was also seen in other literature as well. To prevent any potentially negative outcomes, it is therefore advised to thoroughly examine patients who are at risk for QT prolongation and to closely monitor them. This is especially important for patients who are receiving QT-prolonging medications or their combinations in the presence of other risk factors. Effective patient care requires routine practice using risk assessment tools, such as those developed by Vandal et al.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone versus amiodarone in persistent AF: In a short-term, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of 504 patients with persistent AF, dronedarone was less effective than amiodarone in decreasing AF recurrence but was better tolerated; the primary composite endpoint of recurrence of AF or premature study discontinuation occurred in 75.1% with dronedarone versus 58.8% with amiodarone at 12 months (HR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.98; P < 0.0001), premature discontinuation occurred in 10.4% versus 13.3%, and main safety endpoints were 39.3% versus 44.5% (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.07; P = 0.129).

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^115itXSz]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) drug cautions and alternatives in the fetus indicate that antiarrhythmic drugs that lengthen the QTc — especially sotalol, procainamide, and amiodarone — can be proarrhythmic and harmful to the fetus with TdP. In a symptomatic fetus with an SCN5A mutation, an alternative option is mexiletine as second-line therapy in conjunction with a beta-blocker. Combination therapies may be considered in situations where delivery is contraindicated and maternal risk is low, and where the parents wish to proceed following counseling on risk. Fetal pacing at this time is not an option.

### Cardiac arrhythmias in oncological patients-epidemiology, risk factors, and management within the context of the new ESC 2022 guidelines [^114sKYGa]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Ventricular Arrhythmias

Patients to be treated with drugs that have a high risk of QTc prolongation should have baseline 12-lead ECG performed and also modifiable risk factors of VA should be corrected. If the baseline QTc interval is ≤ 480ms, the therapy can be started under ECG monitoring. The ECG should be performed once the blood level of the anticancer drug is achieved, after every modification in the treatment, and once a month for the first 3 months. According to current ESC guidelines on cardio-oncology, QTc interval changes above 60ms, with QTc still < 500ms, should not affect oncological treatment.

Patients with QTc > 480ms require closer monitoring. Reversible causes of long QT interval should be corrected, ECGs performed weekly, the risk of VA evaluated during the treatment, and an alternative treatment considered. In patients with abnormalities in baseline QTc interval, patients with symptoms of arrhythmia or treated with QTc prolonging drugs cardiology consultation are advised.

The treatment of anticancer therapy-induced VA should follow general guidelines for the management of VA. Asymptomatic episodes of VA that are self-terminating should not be a reason to terminate the oncological treatment, unless patients have persisting ECG abnormalities. The intervention is required in case of recurrent VA. However, the usage of anti-arrhythmic drugs is limited, due to drug-drug interactions and possible further QTc prolongation. Current ESC guidelines recommend beta-blockers and class IB antiarrhythmics as the safest option in the VA treatment, because they are less likely to interact with other drugs. Beta-blockers are the drugs of choice when cancer drug is known to cause cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction. Amiodarone is preferred in patients, who have a structural cardiac disease or that are hemodynamically unstable. Decisions on the type of therapy should be made on an individual basis and should take into account factors, like complication risk or predicted life expectancy.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^1139UEzN]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) prevention in hospital settings — among patients who receive QT-prolonging drugs in hospital units with continuous ECG monitoring, TdP should be avoidable if there is an awareness of individual risk factors and the ECG signs of drug-induced LQTS. Key ECG risk factors include marked QT prolongation to > 500 ms (with the exception of amiodarone- or verapamil-induced QT prolongation), marked QT-U prolongation and distortion after a pause, onset of ventricular ectopy and couplets, macroscopic T-wave alternans, or episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that are initiated with a short-long-short R-R cycle sequence (typically, PVC–compensatory pause–PVC). Recognition of these ECG harbingers of TdP allows for treatment with intravenous magnesium, removal of the offending agent, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities and other exacerbating factors, including the prevention of bradycardia and long pauses with temporary pacing if necessary.

Such drugs include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, bepridil, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain oral macrolides. Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic agents should be withheld for at least three half-lives prior to dosing with Sotalol AF. In clinical trials, Sotalol AF was not administered to patients previously treated with oral amiodarone for > 1 month in the previous three months. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, quinidine and procainamide and other Class III drugs (e.g., amiodarone) are not recommended as concomitant therapy with Sotalol AF because of their potential to prolong refractoriness (see WARNINGS). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class Ib or Ic antiarrhythmics.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome — QTc thresholds and medication precautions: The risk of adverse events increases with QTc > 500 ms, especially with long QT syndrome type 2. QT-prolonging medications (www.crediblemeds.org) should not be used in patients with long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative; careful QTc monitoring is recommended with consideration for discontinuation if QTc is markedly prolonged. Concurrent use of stimulant or nonstimulant attention deficit/hyperactivity medications was associated with an increased risk of syncope/cardiac arrest in 1 study but not in another retrospective study, and episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by QT-prolonging medication or hypokalemia induced by diuretics or gastrointestinal illnesses.

Acute, centrolobular confluent hepatocellular necrosis leading to hepatic coma, acute renal failure, and death has been associated with the administration of intravenous amiodarone [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

In patients with life-threatening arrhythmias, the potential risk of hepatic injury should be weighed against the potential benefit of NEXTERONE therapy. Carefully monitor patients receiving NEXTERONE for evidence of progressive hepatic injury. In such cases, consider reducing the rate of administration or withdrawing NEXTERONE.

5.4 Proarrhythmia

Like all antiarrhythmic agents, NEXTERONE may cause a worsening of existing arrhythmias or precipitate a new arrhythmia, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6–6.2)]. Proarrhythmia, primarily torsade de pointes (TdP), has been associated with prolongation, by intravenous amiodarone, of the QTc interval to 500 ms or greater. Although QTc prolongation occurred frequently in patients receiving intravenous amiodarone, TdP or new-onset VF occurred infrequently (less than 2%). Monitor patients for QTc prolongation during infusion with NEXTERONE. Reserve the combination of amiodarone with other antiarrhythmic therapies that prolong the QTc to patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent.

As the thorough QT/QTc study is designed to examine the propensity of a drug to prolong the QTc interval, it is appropriate to perform the. detect such QT prolongation by the control, then a finding of no QT effect of that size for the test drug will constitute evidence that the test drug does not, in fact, prolong the QT interval by the amount of regulatory concern. There are two conditions required for ensuring such assay sensitivity:

1.

The positive control should show a significant increase in QTc, i.e., the lower bound of. the one-sided 95% confidence interval must be above 0 ms. This shows that the trial is capable of detecting an increase in QTc, a conclusion that is essential to concluding that a negative finding for the test drug is meaningful.
2. The study should be able to detect an effect of about 5 ms if it is present. Therefore, the size of the effect of the positive control is of particular relevance. With this aim, there are at least two approaches: a. To use a positive control showing an effect of greater than 5 ms. This approach has proven to be useful in many. regulatory cases. However, if the positive control has too large an effect, the study's ability to detect a 5 ms QTc prolongation might be questioned.

In this situation, the effect of the positive control could be examined at times other than the peak effect to determine whether an effect close to the threshold of regulatory concern can be detected. b. To use a positive control with an effect close to 5 ms (point estimate of the maximum mean difference with placebo close to 5 ms, with a one-sided 95% CI.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^111bf2wS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

There is no well-established relationship between plasma concentration and effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed. Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low, and who might benefit from a dose increase, or unusually high, and who might have dosage reduction in the hope of minimizing side effects.

Effects on abnormal rhythms are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used. There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still. There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.

Consistent with the slow rate of elimination, antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after amiodarone hydrochloride is discontinued, but the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable. In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the arrhythmia, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted.

In-hospital vs out-of-hospital antiarrhythmic drug initiation — patients at higher risk for proarrhythmias should be closely monitored in the hospital; for Class IC AADs, predictors of increased ventricular proarrhythmia risk at initiation or during treatment include bundle branch block or wide QRS at baseline (> 120 ms), structural heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 0.40), tachyarrhythmia with a rapid ventricular response, high drug dose or rapid dose increase, history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and concurrent negative inotrope therapy; for Class IA and Class III AADs, predictors include long-QT interval (QTc > 460 ms) and excessive QT/QTc lengthening during treatment (> 550 ms or > 25% over baseline) alongside additional listed comorbidities; proarrhythmic events tend to cluster shortly after drug initiation, and in-hospital initiation with continuous telemetry and resuscitation facilities can be recommended and arguably constitutes the gold standard for proarrhythmia detection, though it is limited to selected high-risk cases and is not indicated for amiodarone; patient education on symptoms with a 12-lead ECG for several days after initiation is a strategy that can be applied to the majority of patients, and these safety rules apply even more strictly in patients with risk factors for TdP or with concomitant non-antiarrhythmic torsadogenic medication with close QTc monitoring.

Dronedarone shares similar pharmacokinetics with amiodarone 38; however, its use is contraindicated in patients with CHF or left ventricular dysfunction. 55 Dronedarone is contraindicated with lopinavir/ritonavir because of dependence on CYP3A4 for clearance and risk of life‐threatening arrhythmia. 47 Therefore, the utility of dronedarone may be limited for AF in COVID‐19 patients.

Amiodarone and dronedarone may cause QT prolongation, particularly when used with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or macrolides. Plasma concentration of amiodarone and dronedarone can be decreased when administered with tocilizumab or sarilumab (CYP3A4 inducers) (Figure 4).

Dofetilide is an I Kr blocker and predominantly excreted by the kidney (Figure 2). Hospitalization for ECG monitoring is required for the 3‐day loading period. 38 Dofetilide is more effective than cardioversion in maintaining sinus rhythm 56 and proved to be safe in patients with underlying CHF and myocardial infarction. 57 Information is not available on any long‐term use of dofetilide in patients on COVID‐19 pharmacotherapy.

### Lack of a hypotensive effect with rapid administration of a new aqueous formulation of intravenous amiodarone [^116psZJ9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Hypotension is the most frequent adverse event reported with intravenous amiodarone. Hypotension has been attributed to the vasoactive solvents of the standard formulation (Cordarone IV) and is not dose related, but related to the rate of infusion. Drug labeling calls for intravenous amiodarone to be administered over 10 minutes. A new aqueous formulation of amiodarone (Amio-Aqueous) does not contain vasoactive excipients and may be administered safely by rapid administration without hypotension. This hypothesis was tested using combined data of 4 clinical trials; each assessed the development of hypotension prospectively. Hypotension was defined as a 25% decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP), with the development of a systolic BP of < 90 mm Hg or a systolic BP that decreased to < 80 mm Hg. In all, 358 Amio-Aqueous and 225 lidocaine boluses were administered to 278 patients; 246 had ventricular tachycardia (VT) during drug administration. Hypotension developed in 11% of patients on Amio-Aqueous versus 19% on lidocaine (p = NS), all during VT; most resolved spontaneously with VT termination. With both drugs, hypotension persisted after VT termination in 1% of patients; the incidence of drug-related hypotension occurred in 2% of patients (1% had hypotension requiring treatment). The Amio-Aqueous was discontinued in 1% of patients, and lidocaine was discontinued in 2% of patients because of hypotension. We conclude that Amio-Aqueous is at least as safe as lidocaine in terms of causing hypotension when administered rapidly. This is a significant advantage over the standard amiodarone formulation, because Cordarone cannot be administered by rapid bolus owing to excipient-related hypotension.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — general antiarrhythmic drug therapy and monitoring: Before administering any antiarrhythmic agent, reversible precipitants of AF should be identified and corrected, and patients who develop HF in association with alcohol intake should abstain from alcohol consumption. When treatment with a single antiarrhythmic drug fails, combinations may be tried; useful combinations include a beta blocker, sotalol, or amiodarone with a class IC agent, and the combination of a calcium channel blocker, such as diltiazem, with a class IC agent, such as flecainide or propafenone, is advantageous in some patients. A drug that is initially safe may become proarrhythmic if coronary disease or HF develops or with interacting medications; thus, the patient should be alerted to the potential significance of such symptoms as syncope, angina, or dyspnea and warned about the use of noncardiac drugs that might prolong the QT interval. With class IC drugs, prolongation of the QRS interval should not exceed 50%, and for class IA or class III drugs, with the possible exception of amiodarone, the corrected QT interval in sinus rhythm should be kept below 520 ms; exercise testing may help detect QRS widening that occurs only at rapid heart rates. During follow-up, plasma potassium and magnesium levels and renal function should be checked periodically, and in individual patients, serial noninvasive assessment of LV function is indicated, especially when clinical HF develops during treatment of AF.

### Amiodarone and dronedarone: an update [^114eqdRj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article provides a contemporary review of the current role of amiodarone and dronedarone in patients with atrial fibrillation who need to undergo rhythm control therapy for relief of symptoms. Amiodarone is the most widely prescribed antiarrhythmic drug for this indication. Recent findings show that its use is not associated with increased mortality even in patients with advanced structural heart disease. However, its extracardiac side effect profile may limit its widespread use. Dronedarone appears to be a useful drug in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. However, the compound cannot be used in patients with heart failure. In permanent atrial fibrillation, dronedarone is likewise contraindicated based on findings from the PALLAS trial.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation — recommendations for pharmacological cardioversion state that administration of flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, or ibutilide is recommended for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). Administration of amiodarone is a reasonable option for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). A single oral bolus dose of propafenone or flecainide (pill-in-the-pocket) can be administered to terminate persistent AF outside the hospital once treatment has proved safe in hospital for selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, and before antiarrhythmic medication is initiated, a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist should be given to prevent rapid AV conduction in the event atrial flutter occurs (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of amiodarone can be beneficial on an outpatient basis in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF when rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is not deemed necessary (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of quinidine or procainamide might be considered for pharmacological cardioversion of AF, but the usefulness of these agents is not well established (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin and sotalol may be harmful when used for pharmacological cardioversion of AF and are not recommended (Level of Evidence: A). Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and dofetilide should not be started out of hospital for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm (Level of Evidence: B).

### Drug-induced proarrhythmia and use of QTc-prolonging agents: clues for clinicians [^115SpkAn]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Use of drugs with the potential for prolongation of the QTc interval and proarrhythmia is a growing challenge facing clinicians. Many pharmaceutical agents have been denied approval for human use, approved with restrictions and warnings regarding proarrhythmia, or withdrawn from the market based upon arrhythmic risk. Despite known risk factors for QTc prolongation and drug-induced arrhythmia, precise prediction of the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) in an individual patient remains difficult. The mechanism of drug-induced TdP typically involves use of an agent that blocks the I(Kr) cardiac potassium current, often in combination with risk-amplifying factors such as high drug levels, reduced drug metabolism, polypharmacy, and patient-specific factors such as gender, age, and genetic polymorphism. For the clinician, an integrated approach involving appreciation of the risk factors for proarrhythmia combined with computer-based risk assessment is the best method for reducing the risk of drug-induced proarrhythmia in clinical practice.

### Amiodarone hci [^111iT1U7]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Proarrhythmia

Like all antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone HCl injection may cause a worsening of existing arrhythmias or precipitate a new arrhythmia. Proarrhythmia, primarily torsade de pointes (TdP), has been associated with prolongation by amiodarone HCl injection of the QTc interval to 500 ms or greater. Although QTc prolongation occurred frequently in patients receiving amiodarone HCl injection, torsade de pointes or new-onset VF occurred infrequently (less than 2%). Patients should be monitored for QTc prolongation during infusion with amiodarone HCl injection. Combination of amiodarone with other antiarrhythmic therapy that prolongs the QTc should be reserved for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent.

Fluoroquinolones, macrolide antibiotics, and azoles are known to cause QTc prolongation. There have been reports of QTc prolongation, with or without TdP, in patients taking amiodarone when fluoroquinolones, macrolide antibiotics, or azoles were administered concomitantly (see Drug Interactions, Other reported interactions with amiodarone).

The need to coadminister amiodarone with any other drug known to prolong the QTc interval must be based on a careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits of doing so for each patient.

Management of torsades de pointes with QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics — monitoring high-risk patients during initiation and recognizing the syndrome early are emphasized; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 and 5 mEq/L shortens QT, although no specific data are available on the efficacy of potassium repletion to prevent torsades de pointes; intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes even when serum magnesium is normal; magnesium toxicity can occur when concentrations reach 6 to 8 mEq/L but is a very small risk with doses usually used, 1 to 2 g intravenously; temporary pacing is highly effective for recurrent torsades after potassium repletion and magnesium supplementation, and isoproterenol can also be used to increase heart rate and abolish postectopic pauses; anecdotes have reported that lidocaine, verapamil, and even occasionally amiodarone have been effective, although amiodarone may itself cause torsades de pointes, albeit much less commonly than with other QT‑prolonging antiarrhythmics.

Atrial fibrillation — treatment algorithm for pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm lists options by left ventricular (LV) function and setting. In patients with normal LV function, IV amiodarone or ibutilide (2a) are listed, and procainamide may be considered when amiodarone and ibutilide are not optimal; recommend avoidance of IV procainamide after amiodarone or ibutilide. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 40%), IV amiodarone (2a) is listed. For AF occurring outside the hospital in patients with normal LV function ("pill‑in‑the‑pocket"), flecainide or propafenone (2a) are listed. Use is "in the absence of preexcitation", the first dose is administered in a monitored facility, and IV amiodarone requires several hours for efficacy whereas ibutilide is generally effective in 30 to 90 min but carries higher risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.

### The impact of drug-induced QT interval prolongation on drug discovery and development [^112NJENC]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

During the past decade, a number of non-cardiovascular drugs have had their label revised or have been withdrawn from the market because of unexpected post-marketing reports of sudden cardiac death associated with a prolongation of the QT interval, and an increased propensity to develop a ventricular tachyarrhythmia called Torsades de Pointes. Although a direct link between QT interval prolongation and arrhythmogenesis is still unclear, QT prolongation is now the subject of increased regulatory review and is considered a significant risk factor for predicting human safety of New Chemical Entities. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies are striving to improve the drug discovery and development process to identify, as early as possible, the risk of novel agents, or their metabolites, of causing QT interval prolongation and to make appropriate go/no-go decisions or modify their development programme accordingly.

Women with HF or pathological left ventricular hypertrophy should be offered amiodarone. Other AAD should be avoided. AF clinicians must offer effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic management to women and men equally to prevent stroke and death. In women ECG monitoring during initiation of AAD should be considered to monitor heart rate and QT prolongation and 1–2 weeks after dosage increase. In women with long-term AAD ECG should be monitored every year to monitor heart rate and QT prolongation. Class IA or III AAD should not be instituted in women with a prolonged QT interval (> 500 ms), those with a significant sinoatrial node disease or AV node disease without a functioning permanent pacemaker.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^115ZRH51]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Monitoring and dose adjustment when initiating antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation — trans-telephonic monitoring or other methods of ECG surveillance may be used to monitor rhythm and conduction; the PR interval (when flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone are used), QRS duration (with flecainide or propafenone), and QT interval (with dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone) should be measured; antiarrhythmic drugs should be started at a relatively low dose and titrated based on response with the ECG reassessed after each dose change; heart rate should be monitored at approximately weekly intervals; the dose of other rate-control medication should be reduced when the rate slows after initiation of amiodarone and stopped if it slows excessively; concomitant drug therapies should be monitored closely, and the doses of digoxin and warfarin should usually be reduced upon initiation of amiodarone due to anticipated rises in serum digoxin levels and INR.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^114mPDSR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Management of QTc Prolongation

When a prolonged QTc interval is detected (> 500 ms or an increase of > 60 ms longer than baseline), the patient should be evaluated carefully, with discontinuation of all offending drugs immediately (if appropriate). Strategies previously discussed to identify causes of QTc prolongation should be considered. Patients who experience associated syncope or presyncope, palpitations, or QTc > 500 ms and/or bradycardia (HR, < 60 bpm) should be evaluated immediately in a monitored setting. An ECG should be repeated every 24 hours until resolution of QTc prolongation is confirmed. A prolonged QTc increases the risk of a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia called TdP (Figure 4 A). Most of the data on the risk of TdP in relation to QTc prolongation are from large registries of patients with congenital long QT syndromes. 193, 194 These data show that each 10‐ms increase in QTc contributes approximately a 5% to 7% increase in risk for cardiac events, including syncope, cardiac arrest, and/or death. Other risk factors for TdP beyond QTc have been described in settings outside of cancer therapy (Table 5) and, thus, the extrapolation to the cancer population is less clear. 195 Although some medications are associated with QTc prolongation, not all drugs that prolong the QTc cause TdP. Therefore, the risk assessment of TdP attributable to drugs should not only be based on QTc alone but considered in the context of other predisposing TdP risk factors. 196 Recurrence of TdP is frequent and, hence, the occurrence of a single event mandates urgent clinical evaluation and monitoring.

### Amiodarone hci [^115qDpmF]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Amiodarone HCl injection is indicated for initiation of treatment and prophylaxis of frequently recurring ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia in patients refractory to other therapy. Amiodarone HCl injection also can be used to treat patients with VT/VF for whom oral amiodarone is indicated, but who are unable to take oral medication. During or after treatment with amiodarone HCl injection, patients may be transferred to oral amiodarone therapy (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION).

Amiodarone HCl injection should be used for acute treatment until the patient's ventricular arrhythmias are stabilized. Most patients will require this therapy for 48 to 96 hours, but amiodarone HCl injection may be safely administered for longer periods if necessary.

### Safety of rapid switching from amiodarone to dofetilide in atrial fibrillation patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [^111UTwFE]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug commonly used for treatment of atrial fibrillation. Drug guidelines mandate a 3-month waiting period before initiating dofetilide after amiodarone use. Whether patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) can be rapidly switched from amiodarone to dofetilide is not known.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether rapid switching from amiodarone to dofetilide is safe in atrial fibrillation patients with an ICD.

Methods

In this retrospective observational study, we assessed the feasibility and the short- and long-term safety of rapid switching from amiodarone to dofetilide in hospitalized atrial fibrillation with an ICD.

Results

The study included a total of 179 patients who were followed for 12.6 ± 2.2 months. All patients had drug initiation during hospitalization. Dofetilide resulted in successful cardioversion in 66% (118/179). Twenty percent of patients (36/179) required dofetilide dose adjustments in the initiation phase because of QT prolongation and decreased creatinine clearance. A total of 6.1% of patients (11/179) required drug discontinuation. The incidence of torsades de pointes was 1.1% (2/179) during initiation. One patient (0.5%) had self-terminating ventricular tachycardia at follow-up. No other significant adverse events were noted during follow-up.

Conclusion

Atrial fibrillation patients with an ICD can be rapidly switched to dofetilide after 7 days of discontinuation of amiodarone without significant arrhythmia-related complications. Prospective studies with large sample sizes, especially of women, should be performed to further validate these findings.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^112ce4FK]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride PO (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):
- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

### Amiodarone in the new AHA guidelines for ventricular tachyarrhythmias [^115MCmUC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To delineate amiodarone's role in the new American Heart Association guidelines for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, review the literature that supports the use of amiodarone in ventricular tachyarrhythmias, describe the pharmaceutical properties of amiodarone and elucidate their clinical implications, and discuss the dosing, preparation, and administration of amiodarone.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-October 2000) database and EMBASE Drugs and Pharmacology database (1980-October 2000) was performed. References from published articles and tertiary references were used to gather additional data.

Data Extraction

All articles were screened, and pertinent studies were identified and evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Recent trials have demonstrated amiodarone's usefulness in the setting of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Based on these investigations and contrary to past guidelines, amiodarone is included in the 2000 advanced cardiovascular life support guidelines as a possible agent for hemodynamically stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), non-QT prolonged polymorphic VT, and ventricular fibrillation (VF)/pulseless VT. Although not specifically evaluated in the setting of hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT and non-QT prolonged polymorphic VT, investigations by the intravenous Amiodarone Multicenter Trial Group and other clinical trials make amiodarone an acceptable choice for these arrythmia categories. The results of the ARREST (Resuscitation of Refractory Sustained Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias) trial prove amiodarone to be the antiarrhythmic of choice for VF/pulseless VT.

Conclusions

Amiodarone is classified as a IIb therapeutic intervention for all three arrhythmia categories, which makes it an acceptable, safe, and useful agent with fair to good evidence to support its use. In addition, amiodarone requires careful preparation and delivery to achieve safe and effective outcomes.

### Dronedarone for prevention of atrial fibrillation: a dose-ranging study [^115Agiqk]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Dronedarone, a benzofurane derivative without iodine substituents, shares the electrophysiologic properties of amiodarone. This study was designed to determine the most appropriate dose of dronedarone for prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardioversion.

Methods and Results

Patients with persistent AF were randomly allocated to 800, 1200, 1600 mg daily doses of dronedarone or placebo. The main analysis was conducted on 199/270 patients, who entered the maintenance phase following pharmacological cardioversion or, if unsuccessful, DC cardioversion. Within 6-month follow-up, the time to AF relapse increased on dronedarone 800 mg, with a median of 60 days vs 5.3 days in the placebo group (relative risk reduction 55% [95% CI, 28 to 72%] P = 0.001). No significant effect was seen at higher doses. Spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm on dronedarone occurred in 5.8 to 14.8% of patients (P = 0.026). There were no proarrhythmic reactions. Drug-induced QT prolongation was only noticed in the 1600 mg group. Premature drug discontinuations affected 22.6% of subjects given 1600 mg dronedarone versus 3.9% on 800 mg and were mainly due to gastrointestinal side effects. No evidence of thyroid, ocular or pulmonary toxicity was found.

Conclusion

Dronedarone, at a 800 mg daily dose, appears to be effective and safe for the prevention of AF relapses after cardioversion. The absence of thyroid side effects and of proarrhythmia are important features of the drug. Further studies are needed to better delineate the antiarrhythmic profile of the drug.

### Amiodarone – avoid the danger of torsade de pointes [^113sussL]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

We present two patients who had life-threatening arrhythmias, which are highly likely to be secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, occasionally its use can transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions and contra-indications of amiodarone as well as the need for vigilance following initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.

### HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS / ACC / AHA worldwide practice update for telehealth and arrhythmia monitoring during and after a pandemic [^115iNKnd]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Therapy for COVID-19 and potential electrical effects — hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been used off-label and may exert QT-prolonging effects, and combination therapy may have synergistic QT prolongation. In a retrospective cohort of 1438 hospitalized patients in metropolitan New York, cardiac arrest was more frequent with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin than with neither drug, and adjusted in-hospital mortality hazard ratios were 1.08 for hydroxychloroquine alone, 0.56 for azithromycin alone, and 1.35 for the combination; none of these hazard ratios were statistically significant. In COVID-19 patients receiving prior antiarrhythmic therapy, there should be a thorough consideration of risk vs benefit before initiating any QT-prolonging COVID-19 therapies, and if one of these drugs is judged to be critical, monitoring should be initiated. If life-threatening arrhythmias (VT/VF) occur, the benefit of antiarrhythmic drugs, notably amiodarone, outweighs potential harm and antiarrhythmic drugs should be prioritized and used as deemed necessary. Modifiable predisposing factors for QTc prolongation should be corrected, individuals with congenital long QT syndrome should be identified because QTc-prolonging medications are contraindicated, and caution must be exercised in subclinical or manifest myocarditis that may increase vulnerability to proarrhythmias associated with QT-prolonging drugs.

Atrial fibrillation rhythm control — amiodarone dosing, cautions, and adverse-effect monitoring: Amiodarone is dosed as 3 x 200 mg daily over 4 weeks, 2 x 200 mg another 4 weeks, then 200 mg daily, and should be discontinued in case of excessive QT prolongation (> 500 ms). Concomitant drug cautions include concomitant use with VKAs or digitalis (their dose should be reduced) and increased risk of myopathy when used with statins. The drug requires regular surveillance for liver, lung and thyroid toxicity, has AV nodal slowing properties, but should not be used as monotherapy for rate control, and QT prolongation is common, but very rarely associated with TdP (< 0.5%).

### Fluoxetine [^1153c1Qv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.11 QT Prolongation

Post-marketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome; a previous history of QT prolongation; a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death; and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias; and conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure (overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs). Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Contraindications (4.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8), Overdosage (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with fluoxetine. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol,); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Consider ECG assessment and periodic ECG monitoring if initiating treatment with fluoxetine in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Consider discontinuing fluoxetine and obtaining a cardiac evaluation if patients develop signs or symptoms consistent with ventricular arrhythmia.

### Sotalol [^114VRwmo]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Use with Drugs that Prolong QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents

The use of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been studied and is not recommended. Such drugs include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, bepridil, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain oral macrolides. Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic agents should be withheld for at least three half-lives prior to dosing with sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF). In clinical trials, sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) was not administered to patients previously treated with oral amiodarone for > 1 month in the previous three months. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, quinidine and procainamide and other Class III drugs (e.g., amiodarone) are not recommended as concomitant therapy with sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF), because of their potential to prolong refractoriness (see WARNINGS). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class Ib or Ic antiarrhythmics.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Drug‑induced QT prolongation and management — many marketed cardiac and noncardiac drugs prolong ventricular repolarization and can precipitate life‑threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias; susceptibility may relate to genetic propensity or female gender and more commonly to elevated drug blood levels from excessive dosage, renal disease, or drug interactions. If ventricular arrhythmia may be due to QT prolongation from prescribed medications, the possible offending therapies should be discontinued and follow‑up monitoring of ventricular repolarization and cardiac rhythm should be carried out.

### How to diagnose and manage QT Prolongation in cancer patients [^113PDn3E]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

How do we manage QT prolongation in TdP?

Once QTc prolongation is identified, serum electrolyte levels should be obtained and abnormalities should be corrected. If a patient develops TdP, intravenous magnesium sulfate should be administered immediately. In patients without congenital long-QT syndrome, mexiletine, a Class Ib antiarrhythmic, has been shown to shorten the QT interval, halt episodes of TdP, and prevent recurrence of refractory TdP. If signs of electrical instability persist, transfer to the intensive care unit is recommended with initiation of beta-adrenergic agents such as isoproterenol or temporary pacing to increase the heart rate.

The European Society of Cardiology has offered an expert consensus on cancer treatments and cardiotoxicity. However, there are no generally accepted consistent criteria regarding discontinuation of cancer therapeutics for patients who develop QT prolongation. Oncologists and cardiologists must make case-by-case decisions of continuing potentially life-prolonging cancer therapy balanced by the risk for lethal arrhythmias.

LEARNING POINTS
- When QTc is elevated, check and correct electrolyte imbalances and perform a medication reconciliation to discontinue QT-prolonging agents.
- Patients who develop TdP should be treated as per advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) protocol with intravenous magnesium sulfate and transfer to an intensive care unit for closer monitoring.

Case Continued

Before discharge, the patient had resolution of ventricular ectopy on telemetry. She was started on guideline-directed anti-remodeling medications.

### Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval… [^1127uEuT]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The most common reason for removing a prescription drug from the U. S. market in the past decade has been prolongation of the QT interval. There is an increased risk for the development of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia, when the QT interval is prolonged. Roden reviewed the drugs most commonly implicated in QT prolongation and the clinical factors that increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Use of these medications, especially when a congenital QT prolongation syndrome or other clinical risk factor is present, increases the chance that torsades de pointes may develop. Because the risk of torsades de pointes is sufficiently high at typical clinical dosages of sotalol, dofetilide, and ibutilide, the review author recommends in-hospital cardiac monitoring when therapy with these agents is initiated.

QT prolongation occurs when a drug or congenital syndrome affects ion channels in cardiac cells and leads to prolongation of the action potential during depolarization. This step may lead to a reduced reserve for normal repolarization, which then increases the risk of developing torsades de pointes. However, these known links do not explain completely the risk of torsades de pointes. Amiodarone often causes QT prolongation beyond 500 msec, yet rarely causes torsades de pointes. Terfenadine was removed from the market because of associated episodes of torsades de pointes, yet therapeutic dosages only extended the QT interval by 6 msec. The degree of QT prolongation caused by a given medication can be influenced by the concomitant use of other agents that inhibit drug elimination. Examples cited by Roden include erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, amiodarone, quinidine, and a number of antidepressants and antiretrovirals.

The author concludes that when physicians need to use a medication known to have the effect of prolonging the QT interval, a review of other risk factors that may increase the likelihood that torsades de pointes will develop is recommended. Therefore, an elderly woman with heart failure who also takes medications that might indirectly lead to increased risk would be a particularly risky candidate for use of a drug that prolongs the QT interval. Close clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring would be prudent during treatment.

### QT interval and drug therapy [^111dBbWc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

The QT interval is an important component of the electrocardiogram, which when prolonged can predict the risk of developing the potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia, torsades de pointes. There is growing understanding of the genetics associated with cardiac arrhythmias and an increasing number of drugs that can prolong the QT interval. Consequently, assessment of the effect of drugs on the QT interval has become a significant aspect of drug development, regulatory assessment and clinical care. Here, we review the QT interval and the risks associated with drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval.

Atrial fibrillation — amiodarone superiority and adverse effects: Multiple randomized trials show amiodarone is effective for maintenance of sinus rhythm and superior to other agents. In SAFE‑T, amiodarone was superior to sotalol and placebo for median time to AF recurrence (487 versus 74 versus 6 days, respectively; P < 0.001). In CTAF, AF recurrence at 16 months was 35% with amiodarone versus 63% with combined propafenone or sotalol (P < 0.001). The adverse‑effect profile is described as onerous, including pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid dysfunction, elevated transaminases, hepatotoxicity, photosensitivity, skin pigmentation changes, peripheral neuropathy, sinus bradycardia, QT prolongation with torsades de pointes, corneal microdeposits, and rarely optic neuropathy, with many clinically relevant drug interactions; therefore, amiodarone is best reserved for patients who do not respond to other recommended antiarrhythmic agents or for whom other antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.

Unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia — if recurrent VT is monomorphic and the EF is normal, either procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone or lidocaine can be used; if the EF is low, amiodarone or lidocaine is recommended (amiodarone 150 mg intravenously over 10 min or lidocaine 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg intravenous push). For polymorphic VT with normal baseline QT, correct ischemia and electrolyte abnormalities and then consider administration of a beta blocker or lidocaine or amiodarone or procainamide or sotalol; if the EF is low, treatment with amiodarone 150 mg intravenously over 10 min or lidocaine 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg intravenous push is recommended, and if the baseline QT is prolonged, other treatments may include magnesium, overdrive pacing, isoproterenol, phenytoin, or lidocaine.

Hospital prevention of torsade de pointes (TdP) — QTc monitoring thresholds, risk signs, and protocol: The guidelines "do recommend removal of the offending agent in patients with drug-induced LQTS (Class I, Level of Evidence: A); however, they do not define what QTc value should prompt discontinuation". After administration of an at‑risk drug, "if the QTc exceeds 500 ms or there has been an increase of at least 60 ms compared with the predrug baseline value… prompt action is indicated". ECG signs of risk "include an increase in QTc from predrug baseline of 60 ms, marked QTc interval prolongation > 500 ms", with additional features listed. For serial measurements, "a consistent method should be used (ie, same recording device, ECG lead, measurement tool [automated or manual], and heart rate-correction formula)". When impending signs develop, recommended actions are to "discontinue the offending drug, replace potassium, administer magnesium, consider temporary pacing… and transfer the patient to a hospital unit with the highest level of ECG monitoring surveillance where immediate defibrillation is available". Additionally, "Patients should not be transported from the unit… and they should be in a unit with the highest possible ECG monitoring surveillance".

### Hemodynamic and surface electrocardiographic effects of a new aqueous formulation of intravenous amiodarone [^116ufsm5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Intravenous amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent. However, the standard formulation (Cordarone IV) frequently causes hypotension. Hemodynamic studies have attributed this adverse effect to the solvents employed. A newly developed aqueous formulation (Amio-Aqueous) lacks solvents and thus may not causes hypotension. This study evaluated the hemodynamic effects in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Two boluses of 150-mg aqueous amiodarone were administered via a peripheral vein to 32 hemodynamically stable patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Boluses were administered initially over 2 to 5 minutes and in the last 9 patients over 2 minutes. Hemodynamic evaluation was performed and 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained at baseline, immediately after each bolus, and following 30 minutes of observation. No patient developed hypotension. There were no significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) following the boluses. Compared with baseline, heart rate (HR) significantly decreased 5 minutes after the second bolus (73 ± 12 vs 67 ± 11 beats/min, p < 0.05). Mean arterial BP increased (90 ± 14 vs 100 ± 16 mm Hg, p < 0.05) and dp/dt decreased (1,599 ± 645 vs 1,294 ± 531 mm Hg/s p < 0.05), whereas the PR, QT, and JT intervals increased (174 ± 30 vs 182 ± 33; 402 ± 32 vs 424 ± 35; 317 ± 37 vs 336 ± 32 ms, p < 0.05, respectively) by the end of the 30-minute observation period. Amio-Aqueous possesses pharmacodynamic effects that have been attributed to amiodarone, whereas it lacks the hypotensive effect of the standard intravenous amiodarone formulation. Amio-Aqueous appears to be a safer alternative to Cordarone IV when rapid administration is indicated.

Algorithm — polymorphic VT/VF with ICD and recurrent arrhythmia: Management should start with ensuring that the ICD is programmed appropriately and that potential precipitating causes, including heart failure exacerbation, are addressed. For polymorphic VT/VF, consider reversible causes and treat for QT prolongation, discontinue offending medication, correct electrolytes (Class I), and revascularize (Class I) when indicated; if no reversible causes, options include Amiodarone (Class I) or Beta blockers or lidocaine (Class IIa). If arrhythmia is not controlled, the presence of identifiable PVC triggers leads to Catheter ablation (Class I), whereas absent triggers lead to Autonomic modulation (Class IIb).

Atrial fibrillation pharmacological cardioversion — drug selection and monitoring notes that vernakalant "allows the rapid restoration of SR in patients with AF (but not in atrial flutter)" and may be administered in mild to moderate heart failure and stable ischaemic heart disease; intravenous flecainide and propafenone are "restricted to patients without altered cardiac substrate". Ibutilide is an alternative but "is torsadogenic and should be avoided in patients with long QT", with the "QTc interval… carefully monitored during and immediately after the infusion". Intravenous amiodarone "was not shown to convert AF acutely in placebo controlled studies", but in heart failure patients it "slows significantly the heart rate in less than 12 h" and is "superior to intravenous sotalol concerning overall conversions". Selected outpatients may self-administer an oral bolus of flecainide or propafenone once safety is confirmed in-hospital; this "pill-in-the-pocket" strategy is "marginally less effective than in-hospital cardioversion or continuous AAD therapy" yet "may be preferred by eligible patients". Pre-treatment with oral antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, sotalol or ibutilide "may improve the efficacy of electrical cardioversion of AF and/or prevent early AF recurrences", and SR "may be restored (e.g., during a 3–4 weeks of pre-treatment…)".

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^113suJBX]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Drugs that cause TdP: incidence interpretation and prescribing guidance indicate uncertainty in attribution and emphasize individualized risk–benefit decisions. The proportion of sudden arrhythmic deaths that are due to TdP is unclear because few individuals are being monitored at the time of death, and when TdP occurs in outpatient settings first responders are likely to observe ventricular fibrillation, making it impossible to determine whether ventricular fibrillation was preceded by QT prolongation and then TdP. Use of a QT-prolonging drug must be based on risk-benefit analysis in individual patients, and where efficacy of alternatives is equivalent, the non–QT-prolonging agent should be preferred; where benefit clearly outweighs risk, QT prolongation should not limit necessary therapy. The only class of drugs for which reasonable TdP incidence data are available is the antiarrhythmic agents.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) — pharmacological therapy of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): In CHD with atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation (AT/AF), rhythm control is recommended as the preferred initial strategy, and catheter ablation is recommended as first line therapy and preferred to long‑term pharmacological treatment when substrates are amenable and circumscribed. If conversion or stabilization of sinus rhythm fails, pharmacological atrioventricular (AV) blockade using β‑blocker or calcium channel blocker in patients with normal systemic ventricular function and absent preexcitation should be considered to prevent rapid AV conduction, and combination therapy may be needed in selected patients. Amiodarone may be considered for AT/AF recurrence prevention in CHD in whom catheter ablation fails or is otherwise no option; side effects are frequent and may require discontinuation; long‑term amiodarone therapy is not advised in young CHD patients, and it should be used with caution in cyanotic CHD, low body weight, hepatic, thyroid, or pulmonary disease or prolonged QT interval. Dofetilide can be used as an alternative to amiodarone for AT/AF recurrence prevention in CHD and should be considered as first line therapy with normal systemic ventricular function and as second line therapy with systemic ventricular dysfunction, with close monitoring of renal function, concomitant medications, and corrected QT interval required.

### What clinicians should know about the QT interval [^114jAiSn]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Of the several factors implicated in causing QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, errors in the use of medications that may prolong this interval deserve special attention.

Objective

To systematically summarize the available clinical data on the QT interval and to offer improved recommendations for the use of QT-prolonging medications.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE from 1966 through 2002 for all English-language articles related to the QT interval. Additional data sources included bibliographies of articles identified on MEDLINE, a survey of experts, and data presented at a meeting of experts on long QT syndrome.

Study Selection

We selected for review registries and case series examining clinical outcomes of patients with prolonged QT interval and the effect of different methods of measurement of the QT interval on patient outcomes. Ten studies were identified, of which 6 were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Data quality was determined by publication in the peer-reviewed literature.

Data Synthesis

Optimal measurement of the QT interval is problematic because of lack of standardization and lack of data regarding the best way to adjust for heart rate. Reliable information on the proper use of QT-prolonging medications is scarce. Although a QT interval of at least 500 milliseconds generally has been shown to correlate with a higher risk of torsades de pointes, there is no established threshold below which prolongation of the QT interval is considered free of proarrhythmic risk. The risk of torsades de pointes should be assessed in patients who are about to begin taking a QT-prolonging medication. Although inadequate clinical studies preclude prediction of absolute risk for individual patients, particularly high-risk situations can be defined based on clinical variables. We propose recommendations on proper monitoring of the QT interval in patients receiving QT-prolonging medications.

Conclusion

Although the use of QT-prolonging medications can predispose to torsades de pointes, there is a relative paucity of information that can help clinicians and patients make optimal informed decisions about how best to minimize the risk of this serious complication.

### Using oral amiodarone safely [^111wLztb]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is licensed for the treatment of severe cardiac rhythm disorders where other treatments either cannot be used or have failed. Because of safety concerns, the summary of product characteristics (SPC) recommends that amiodarone "should be initiated and normally monitored only under hospital or specialist supervision". However, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring maintenance therapy often falls to non-specialists. Here, we discuss safety issues relating to the long-term use of oral amiodarone in adults.

Table 3.
Effect on QTc and Proarrhythmia of Experimental Pharmacological Therapies for COVID-19

In COVID-19 patients receiving prior antiarrhythmic therapy, there should be a thorough consideration of risk versus benefit before initiating any QT-prolonging COVID-19 therapies, especially considering their unproven value. For instance, although some recent observational studies highlight adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine in treating this infectious disease, its use is likely to persist outside of randomized trials because of its affordability and global availability compared with, for example, remdesivir. If one of these drugs is judged to be critical, monitoring should be initiated. If life-threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation) occur, the benefit of antiarrhythmic drugs, notably amiodarone, outweighs the potential harm of hydroxychloroquine or other QT-prolonging drugs targeting COVID-19, and in these cases antiarrhythmic drugs should be prioritized and used as deemed necessary. Most importantly, all modifiable predisposing factors for QTc prolongation (electrolyte disturbances, drug-to-drug interaction) that may enhance arrhythmia susceptibility should be corrected, and the small subset of individuals with an underlying genetic predisposition such as congenital long QT syndrome (in whom QTc-prolonging medications are contraindicated) should be identified. Additionally, caution must be exercised in case of subclinical or manifest myocarditis that may increase the vulnerability to proarrhythmias associated with QT-prolonging drugs.

### QT prolongation is an unreliable predictor of ventricular arrhythmia [^113gnaZS]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Not all drugs that prolong the QT interval are proarrhythmic, and absence of QT prolongation is no guarantee for lack of proarrhythmia. Thus, QT prolongation is an unreliable predictor of ventricular arrhythmia. Development of drugs based on the absence of QT prolongation may stop development of some of the safest agents (with respect to arrhythmias). Conversely, drug-induced shortening of the QT interval may facilitate reentry, which might have lethal consequences in vulnerable patients. If QT prolongation and QT shortening must be avoided, then the pharmaceutical industry faces a mission impossible. Cardiac safety is better evaluated in terms of lambda, TRIaD (Triangulation, Reverse use dependence, Instability, and Dispersion), and disturbances of automaticity.

Proarrhythmia monitoring and acute management — among patients at risk for torsades de pointes (TdP), "the QTc monitoring is recommended using the same ECG recording device and the same QTc formula before and after drug administration", and "This monitoring is appropriate in hospital settings". ECG indicators of TdP risk include "QT prolongation with more than 60 ms from baseline, QTc prolongation > 500 ms, T–U wave distortion exaggerated after a pause, macroscopic T wave alternans, new-onset ventricular ectopy and non-sustained VT initiated by the beat after a pause". For drug-related proarrhythmia, "the first-line of management is to stop the offending drug; however, in selected cases, the implantation of ICD needs be considered". Treatment of drug-induced TdP (noted as associated with Class IA or Class III AAD) includes "intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate… (i.e. 2 g bolus followed by another 2 g bolus and by continuous infusion in case of arrhythmia persistence)"; "increasing heart rate… by means of isoproterenol or overdrive pacing at rates > 70 beats per minute"; and "correction of hypokalaemia, replenishing serum potassium to the high-normal range (i.e. 4.5–5.0 mEq/L) although the evidence to support this practice is limited".

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Pharmacodynamic Interactions

Drugs prolonging the QT interval: Co-administration of drugs prolonging the QT interval (such as class I and III antiarrhythmics, lithium, certain phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, certain fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungals, halogenated inhalation anesthetic agents) increases the risk of Torsade de Pointes. In general, avoid concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5–5.4)].

Drugs that slow heart rate: Concomitant use of drugs with depressant effects on the sinus and AV node (e.g., digoxin, beta blockers, verapamil, diltiazem, ivabradine, clonidine) can potentiate the electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of amiodarone, resulting in bradycardia, sinus arrest, and AV block. Monitor heart rate in patients on amiodarone and concomitant drugs that slow heart rate.

7.2 Pharmacokinetic Interactions

Effect of other drugs on amiodarone

Amiodarone is metabolized to the active metabolite desethylamiodarone (DEA) by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme group, specifically CYP3A and CYP2C8. Amiodarone has the potential for interactions with drugs or substances that may be substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzymes (e.g., inhibitors such as protease inhibitors, grapefruit juice, certain fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungals and inducers such as St. John's Wort) or P-glycoprotein. In view of the long and variable half-life of amiodarone, potential for drug interactions exists not only with concomitant medication but also with drugs administered after discontinuation of amiodarone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12–12.3)].
