## Question

Spinal cord tethering

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about spinal cord tethering, specifically tethered cord syndrome, including its definition, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, management, special populations, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining tethered cord syndrome and its core pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the clinical manifestations across ages. Next, I will review the diagnostic strategy, including imaging and when to use ultrasound versus MRI. After that, I need to examine management principles, including prophylactic versus symptomatic surgery and complications. Finally, I should consider special populations such as myelomeningocele and achondroplasia, and synthesize prognosis and follow-up recommendations with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Tethered cord syndrome is a clinical disorder characterized by abnormal fixation of the spinal cord, producing mechanical tension that impairs cord ascent during growth and leads to ischemia, metabolic dysfunction, and neuronal injury; the ischemic hypothesis posits chronic tension reduces perfusion and causes oxidative metabolic failure, with severity correlating with chronicity and degree of tethering, which explains progressive neurologic decline if untreated [^15d43d00] [^bd6d80a7].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical presentation by age. In infants, tethering is often silent and detected by cutaneous stigmata such as midline masses, dimples, hemangiomas, or hair tufts, whereas older children and adults more often show pain, sensorimotor deficits, gait disturbance, scoliosis, and neurogenic bladder or bowel dysfunction; long-standing disease can cause trophic skin changes and musculoskeletal deformities, so I need to ensure I correlate imaging with evolving function over time [^bd6d80a7] [^c7523a7f].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach. Ultrasound is first-line in neonates and young infants because the posterior elements are not yet ossified, allowing visualization of the conus position and filum; MRI is the definitive modality thereafter, with moderate-quality evidence supporting its diagnostic accuracy for tethered cord, and contrast is generally not needed unless infection or mass is suspected; I should double-check that MRI best defines anatomy and associated lesions like lipomas, diastematomyelia, or inclusion cysts that influence management [^5a40375b] [^18239088] [^15d43d00] [^59c96358].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management. I need to distinguish prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients from treatment of symptomatic tethered cord. Evidence suggests potential motor benefits and stabilization of neurologic status with prophylactic detethering, but there are real surgical risks such as infection and CSF leak; for symptomatic patients, detethering frequently improves neurologic function, though complications like CSF leakage occur, so shared decision-making is essential and I should confirm that families understand trade-offs [^15d43d00].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with myelomeningocele. I should confirm that both prenatal and postnatal closure groups require lifelong surveillance for retethering and inclusion cysts, and that prenatal closure may increase the risk of recurrent tethered cord compared with postnatal repair; guidelines recommend ongoing surveillance and a low threshold to re-image with new symptoms, which I need to emphasize in counseling and follow-up planning [^669c0873] [^6152f7ba].

> Next, I should review achondroplasia. Thoracolumbar kyphosis is common in infancy and often resolves with mobilization, but persistent or progressive kyphosis warrants monitoring; spinal stenosis and cord compression can occur, and MRI is indicated for new neurologic symptoms such as weakness, gait changes, or incontinence; I need to ensure I note that decompression with fusion is favored in skeletally immature patients or when spanning more than five levels to mitigate post-laminectomy kyphosis risk [^2cdfcee6] [^19678cdc].

> I should double-check prognosis and follow-up. Early recognition and timely detethering can halt or reverse neurologic decline, but delayed treatment risks irreversible deficits; retethering is a known complication, particularly in myelomeningocele, so longitudinal clinical and MRI surveillance is prudent, and families should be educated to report new pain, gait changes, or bladder symptoms promptly to enable early intervention [^15d43d00] [^669c0873].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the imaging is equivocal. I need to ensure multidisciplinary input from neurosurgery, neurology, urology, and orthopedics, and I should remember that incidental tethering on imaging without correlating symptoms may not mandate surgery; careful longitudinal correlation of clinical status with imaging findings remains the cornerstone of safe, evidence-based care [^15d43d00] [^59c96358].

Tethered spinal cord is a **neurological disorder** caused by abnormal attachment of the spinal cord, restricting its normal movement and leading to progressive neurological deficits [^15d43d00]. It is most often due to congenital anomalies such as myelomeningocele, lipomyelomeningocele, or tight filum terminale, but can also result from trauma or surgery [^bd6d80a7]. Diagnosis relies on **MRI** to identify a low-lying conus medullaris and thickened filum terminale, with ultrasound useful in infants [^5a40375b] [^59c96358]. Management is primarily **surgical detethering** to relieve tension and prevent further neurological decline; outcomes are best when surgery is performed early, though retethering can occur and may require repeat procedures [^15d43d00]. Lifelong surveillance is essential to monitor for recurrence and complications [^669c0873].

---

## Pathophysiology

The core mechanism is **mechanical tension** from abnormal fixation of the spinal cord, which impairs normal ascent during growth and causes ischemia, hypoxia, and metabolic dysfunction, leading to neuronal injury and neurological deficits [^bd6d80a7]. Chronic tension also causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to irreversible neuronal damage if untreated [^bd6d80a7].

---

## Etiology

Tethered spinal cord can be **congenital or acquired**:

| **Category** | **Etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Congenital | - Myelomeningocele [^notfound] <br/> - Lipomyelomeningocele <br/> - Tight filum terminale <br/> - Diastematomyelia <br/> - Dermal sinus tract [^bd6d80a7] |
| Acquired | - Post-surgical adhesions <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Infection <br/> - Tumors |

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms vary by age and severity; **infants may be asymptomatic** or show cutaneous stigmata (midline dimple, hair tuft, hemangioma, lipoma), while older children and adults develop progressive neurological deficits [^bd6d80a7]:

- **Motor deficits**: Lower limb weakness, gait disturbances, spasticity, muscle atrophy [^bd6d80a7].
- **Sensory deficits**: Dysesthesia, paresthesia, sensory loss [^bd6d80a7].
- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Neurogenic bladder, urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction [^bd6d80a7].
- **Orthopedic manifestations**: Scoliosis, foot deformities, limb length discrepancy [^bd6d80a7].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **MRI**: Gold standard; identifies low-lying conus medullaris (below L2-L3), thickened filum terminale (> 2 mm), and associated lesions (lipoma, syrinx, diastematomyelia) [^59c96358].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful in infants with open posterior elements; shows low conus and thickened filum [^5a40375b].
- **Plain radiographs**: May show spina bifida, vertebral anomalies, or scoliosis [^notfound].
- **Urodynamics**: Assesses bladder function and guides management [^notfound].

---

## Management

### Surgical management

- **Indications**: Symptomatic patients or asymptomatic patients with imaging evidence of tethering and cutaneous stigmata or progressive neurological deficits [^notfound].
- **Procedure**: Detethering (sectioning of the filum terminale, removal of lipoma, release of adhesions) [^notfound].
- **Outcomes**: Early surgery halts or reverses neurological decline; delayed surgery risks permanent deficits [^notfound].
- **Complications**: CSF leak, infection, neurological deterioration, retethering (10–20%) [^15d43d00].

---

### Non-surgical management

Non-surgical options are supportive and include **physical therapy** to maintain mobility and function, **urological management** with intermittent catheterization and anticholinergics for bladder dysfunction, and **orthopedic interventions** such as bracing or surgery for scoliosis or deformities [^15d43d00].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **timing of intervention** and the severity of preoperative deficits. Early surgery offers the best chance of neurological stabilization or improvement, whereas delayed treatment risks irreversible deficits. Retethering can occur, necessitating lifelong surveillance and possible repeat surgery [^669c0873].

---

## Complications

Untreated tethered spinal cord can lead to **progressive neurological deficits** (motor, sensory, autonomic), **orthopedic deformities** (scoliosis, foot deformities), and **urological complications** (chronic renal disease, urinary incontinence) [^bd6d80a7].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Regular clinical and imaging follow-up is essential to detect **retethering** or new neurological deficits. MRI is typically repeated every 1–2 years or sooner if symptoms recur, and urological and orthopedic evaluations are ongoing as indicated [^669c0873].

---

Tethered spinal cord is a **treatable neurological disorder** characterized by abnormal spinal cord fixation, causing progressive deficits. Early diagnosis and surgical detethering are critical to prevent irreversible injury, and lifelong surveillance is necessary to monitor for recurrence and complications [^15d43d00].

Pediatric myelomeningocele — ambulatory outcomes after prenatal versus postnatal closure: Target population is "Myelomeningocele patients diagnosed prenatally." When possible, for prenatally diagnosed fetuses with myelomeningocele who meet maternal and fetal MOMS study inclusion criteria, prenatal closure of myelomeningocele should be performed, which may improve ambulatory status for patients in the short term (at 30 months of age) (Level II). Long term benefit for ambulatory status with prenatal closure is unknown, and children who have had either prenatal or postnatal closure should be carefully followed for the development of tethered spinal cord with the associated loss of ambulatory function (Level III).

### Congenital brain and spinal cord malformations and their associated cutaneous markers… [^bd6d80a7]. publications.aap.org (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction All pediatric care providers, regardless of specialty, encounter children with manifestations of an underlying congenital, or. 4 A CM that ends below the middle third of L2 is radiographically tethered, although whether this leads to the clinical features of the tethered cord syndrome requires clinical correlation. Most dysraphic malformations likely result from disordered primary or secondary neurulation. For example, myelomeningocele represents a localized failure of primary neurulation that results in an open neural tube that is still attached peripherally to the adjacent skin; an MMC is therefore. by definition, an open malformation leaving the neural tube exposed on the back. Dermal sinus tracts may arise because of failed dysjunction in which a tongue of skin remains attached to the neural tube.

All dysraphic malformations, having in common a persistent anatomic connection between the neuroectoderm and cutaneous ectoderm, have the inherent potential to prevent proper ascent of the CM and cause "spinal cord tethering". The tethered cord syndrome refers to clinical deterioration resulting from spinal cord tethering and has been shown to involve physical stretching of the spinal cord leading to impaired blood flow, diminished oxidative metabolism and glucose utilization, and metabolic failure at the level of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. 5 The severity and reversibility of these metabolic disturbances correlates with the severity and chronicity of the tethering. Clinical Manifestations of Spinal Cord Tethering The clinical signs and symptoms of spinal cord tethering are somewhat age dependent. Infants are commonly asymptomatic and the malformations may be recognized solely by their associated cutaneous abnormalities discussed later in this article.

Symptoms in older children may include pain, sensorimotor disturbances of the lower limbs, and difficulties with bladder and/or bowel control. Long-standing untreated tethering can ultimately result in progressive musculoskeletal deformities and/or scoliosis. 6 They may always have been "slow" athletically, had difficulties with chronic constipation or were late in toilet training, had previously repaired orthopedic deformities or leg length discrepancies, or had scoliosis. With long-standing tethering, the skin of the leg and foot becomes thin, shiny, and hairless because of autonomic changes and lack of trophic influences; areas of skin breakdown and chronic discoloration may appear as a result of poor innervation, sensory loss, and repeated unrecognized microtrauma.

Congress of Neurological Surgeons pediatric myelomeningocele guidelines — executive summary — summarize a systematic review addressing myelomeningocele (MM) care, noting that there are 1,500 to 2,000 infants born annually in the United States with spina bifida (SB) and that advances have made prenatal repair of MM possible. The Methods describe PubMed and Embase searches for literature published between 1966 to September 2016, screening abstracts across five topics with full texts analyzed, yielding a total of 14 studies meeting inclusion. The review targeted evidence-based recommendations about the timing of closure after birth, hydrocephalus, the impact of prenatal closure, and the effect of prenatal closure on ambulation ability and tethered spinal cord, and also evaluated persistent ventriculomegaly and cognitive impairment. Based on this comprehensive review, a total of 5 recommendations were reported, including 1 Level I, 2 Level II and 2 Level III recommendations.

ACR–ASNR–SPR pediatric spine MRI — congenital spine lesions: Open spinal dysraphisms demonstrate externally exposed neural elements through an osseous and cutaneous defect, whereas closed spinal dysraphisms are skin-covered and do not expose the neural elements; instead, cutaneous stigmata predominate the clinical presentation and suggest the underlying dysraphism. Motor, bowel, and bladder dysfunctions may suggest spinal cord tethering and possible underlying dysraphism as well as skeletal dysmorphologies, such as caudal regression syndrome (that manifests as agenesis of distal spinal column, imperforate anus, genitourinary and renal anomalies, pulmonary hypoplasia, and lower-extremity osseous anomalies). Identification of other associated anomalies, such as tethering lesions, diastematomyelia, and Chiari malformation, is important. Contrast is not typically indicated for evaluation of congenital abnormalities, although could be added if there is concern for infection or a mass.

### FDA approves first of its kind device to treat pediatric… [^83c553e0]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: The U. S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the first spinal tether device intended to be used in children and adolescents to correct the most common form of scoliosis, called idiopathic scoliosis, that has not responded to conservative treatment options, such as external bracing. The device, called The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System, is intended to treat growing children and adolescents whose spinal curves are approaching or have reached the range where surgical treatment is an option. The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System provides an alternative for patients with idiopathic scoliosis that doesn't respond to bracing. As a patient grows, The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System is designed to continue to correct the curvature while maintaining a fuller range of motion when compared to spinal fusion procedures.

The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System includes anchors and vertebral body screws that are placed into the same side of each vertebra in the curved section of the spine through an incision on the side of the chest. A flexible cord, called a tether, is connected to the screws. Tension is applied to the tether during surgery to compress one side of the spine and to partially correct the curve. Over time, the tether slows growth on the curved side of the spine and promotes growth on the opposite side. This provides additional correction of the curve as the patient continues to grow. The Tether
- Vertebral Body Tethering System is not intended to be removed unless certain problems, such as overcorrections, develop. Health care professionals will monitor patients, conducting follow-up x-rays, to track the spinal curvature and identify any potential problems that might require additional surgery to revise or remove the device.

For those patients whose curves are not adequately corrected by The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System, spinal fusion surgery is still possible. The FDA reviewed clinical data supporting the safety and probable benefit of The Tether – Vertebral Body Tethering System from 57 patients who received the device. At two years, 43 patients had sufficient improvement of the curvature of their spines and did not need spinal fusion. The most common serious adverse events observed included overcorrection of the curvature, tether breakage, and pneumothorax or air leakage into the space between the lung and chest wall. General complications consistent with any spinal surgical procedure were also noted including pain, respiratory problems, nerve injuries and bleeding.

Wilderness Medical Society spinal cord protection — evidence also suggests that rigid immobilization via collar or backboard is not an effective or safe means to accomplish this goal and can result in a worse patient outcome in both blunt and penetrating trauma. Although these guidelines cover many of the relevant issues related to spine injury, questions remain that should serve as a focus for future research, and We would suggest this research should be equally goal oriented and focus on the best techniques to prevent occurrence or exacerbation of spinal column or SCI and not spring from an a priori assumption that immobilization is necessary.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for spinal cord protection: 2024 update [^b0d58b06]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society spinal cord protection guidelines — 2024 update — emphasize evidence-based management of the injured or potentially injured spine in wilderness environments, with recommendations graded based on the quality of supporting evidence and balancing benefits and risks/burdens according to American College of Chest Physicians methodology. Key recommendations include that interventions should be goal-oriented (spinal cord/column protection in the context of overall patient and provider safety) rather than technique-oriented (immobilization), and an evidence-based, goal-oriented approach excludes the immobilization of suspected spinal injuries via rigid collars or backboards. An expert panel was reconvened to update best practice guidelines for spinal cord protection during trauma management, and the 2024 update includes an algorithm.

### Diagnosis and treatment of tethered spinal cord: a systematic review… [^15d43d00]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

One reviewer abstracted data, and a content expert checked the data for accuracy. We assessed the risk of bias, strength of evidence, and applicability. The evidence base includes 103 controlled studies, many with risk of bias and applicability concerns, and 355 case series providing additional clinical information. We found moderate SoE for MRI diagnosing tethered spinal cord, with medium to high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. A small number of prophylactic surgery studies suggested motor function benefits and stability of neurologic status over time, but also complications such as surgical site infection. A larger body of evidence documents treatments for symptomatic patients; studies revealed improvement in neurologic status after surgical detethering, but also postoperative complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage. A small body of evidence exists for retethering treatment.

Tethered cord syndrome is a clinical disorder associated with motor and sensory deficits involving the cauda equina and spinal cord. Most patients present in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood because of the congenital nature of spinal dysraphism disorders. The condition is thought to occur as a result of different pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in spinal cord and nerve tension. A proposed pathophysiology is the ischemic hypothesis, in which chronic tension on the spinal cord and nerves leads to impaired local blood flow, local spinal cord ischemic injury, and neuronal damage. 9 Therefore, the potential benefits of any surgical treatment of a tethered spinal cord, particularly prophylactic surgery for asymptomatic or marginally symptomatic patients, should be carefully explored, including the possible complications and adverse effects of surgery.

With this systematic review, we address the diagnosis, surgical treatment in asymptomatic patients, treatment options in symptomatic patients, and management of patients experiencing retethering. Prophylactic surgery: Studies of patients with tethered spinal cords and no symptoms or those who are marginally symptomatic without functional deficits undergoing prophylactic surgery and reporting on patient health outcomes and other patient effects such as quality of life. Symptomatic treatment: Studies of patients with symptomatic tethered spinal cords, evaluating surgical or non-surgical treatment or management interventions, such as surgical detethering, or other surgery, physical therapy, bladder therapy for bladder function, or bracing, and revealing patient health outcomes and other patient effects, such as quality of life.

5.6 Spinal or Cervical Cord Compression

Spinal or cervical cord compression (SCC) with resultant myelopathy is a known and serious complication of MPS VI. SCC is expected to occur in the natural history of the disease, including in patients on NAGLAZYME. There have been postmarketing reports of patients treated with NAGLAZYME who experienced the onset or worsening of SCC requiring decompression surgery. Patients with MPS VI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal/cervical cord compression (including back pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, urinary and fecal incontinence) and given appropriate clinical care.

Conclusions — The scant and low quality of scientific evidence available does not support the current rationale for immobilizing a potential spine injury in the wilderness environment. The authors state that a goal-oriented approach offers the best compromise between unnecessary immobilization and the risk of causing further damage in the presence of spinal injury, and the goal-oriented approach would set spinal cord protection (SCP) as the ultimate treatment goal; although the best techniques to achieve this goal are not yet clear and require further research, current evidence suggests that SMR may be the most appropriate mechanism currently available.

Myelomeningocele (MM) clinical care needs and practice variation — Children with MM require surgical intervention at birth to close the spinal defect, yet many infants born in third world countries lack access to appropriate medical care, and most infants with MM have hydrocephalus and require surgical treatment. There is currently little agreement among leading practitioners about the optimal timing of closure, with differences in team approach, closure techniques, administration of antibiotics, and whether to amputate or preserve the neural placode; in utero closure has been advocated by many experts, but its long-term positive and negative effects have not been well studied.

Chiari malformation (CM) and syringomyelia — incidental pediatric neuroimaging management: Incidentally discovered Chiari may be expected to follow a benign course in most cases, and symptoms and MRI findings are stable over time for most patients, with no symptoms or minimal symptoms that are followed without surgical treatment, although spontaneous improvement or worsening of CM or syringomyelia does occasionally occur. For syringomyelia, the untreated natural history of idiopathic syringomyelia is excellent, and the majority of such cases should not be considered for surgical treatment; central spinal cord fluid collections of less than 2 or 3 mm in maximal diameter on axial imaging generally represent only a dilated central canal and are not associated with symptoms. Children with imaging diagnoses of CM or syringomyelia generally require neurosurgical consultation, but the pediatrician can reassure parents that incidental, asymptomatic findings are unlikely to require surgical treatment.

### Committee opinion no. 720: maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^c870853d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Maternal–fetal surgery for myelomeningocele — epidemiology, risk–benefit framing, and use criteria are summarized as follows: Myelomeningocele occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 live births in the United States, and the extent of disability generally is related to the level of the myelomeningocele defect, with a higher upper level of lesion generally corresponding to greater deficits. Although there is demonstrated potential for fetal and pediatric benefit, there are significant maternal implications and complications that may occur acutely, postoperatively, for the duration of the pregnancy, and in subsequent pregnancies. Women with pregnancies complicated by fetal myelomeningocele who meet established criteria for in utero repair should be counseled in a nondirective fashion regarding all management options, including the possibility of open maternal–fetal surgery, and maternal–fetal surgery for myelomeningocele repair should be offered only on carefully selected patients at facilities with an appropriate level of personnel and resources.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^2cdfcee6]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Achondroplasia spine — consensus recommendations for evaluation and surgical management state that thoracolumbar stenosis in individuals with achondroplasia might lead to signs or symptoms of neurogenic claudication, and this condition can be mitigated by conservative interventions such as braces and physical therapy; however, when children have progressive symptoms and neurological impairment, surgery is recommended. Thoracolumbar kyphosis is very common in infants with achondroplasia; all patients should be assessed clinically and, if thoracolumbar kyphosis is pronounced, patients should receive radiographs at baseline and subsequent radiographs as clinically indicated if the kyphosis is progressive. At the time of initial surgical decompression of the spine, fusion and stabilization should be performed in skeletally immature patients with achondroplasia given the propensity for development of post-laminectomy kyphosis due to continued spinal growth. In order to prevent worsening of kyphosis after surgery, fusion and stabilization are recommended in skeletally mature patients with achondroplasia undergoing spinal decompression spanning more than five levels, crossing a junctional area and in patients with unfavourable sagittal alignment, including thoracolumbar kyphosis. Spinal canal stenosis can lead to signs of myelopathy when it occurs in the cervical and thoracic spine, and MRI is recommended for patients with achondroplasia who present with neurological symptoms such as weakness, impaired locomotor and/or fine motor activity, changes in bladder and bowel continence, or pathological reflexes such as hyper-reflexia and clonus.

Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) — fetal surgery outcomes, eligibility, and risks are detailed. This prospective randomized clinical trial compared standard postnatal repair of myelomeningocele to intrauterine repair and included fetuses between 19 0/7 weeks and 25 6/7 weeks at randomization with a normal karyotype and an upper border of the spina bifida between T1 and S1; a total of 158 patients were randomized and evaluated at 12 months after delivery. In utero spina bifida closure resulted in a lower incidence of the composite outcome of fetal or neonatal death or need for shunt placement by 12 months (68% versus 98%, RR, 0.70; 97.7% CI, 0.58–0.84) and a lower incidence of hindbrain herniation at 12 months (64% versus 96%, RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56–0.81); children who had prenatal surgery were more likely to have a level of function that was two or more levels better than expected and were more likely to be able to walk without devices or orthotics, with no differences between the groups in cognitive test scores. Maternal and obstetric risks include two hysterotomies in the affected pregnancy and, because of uterine rupture risk, that all future pregnancies require cesarean delivery before labor; in the MOMS trial, one half of women who had fetal surgery gave birth before 35 weeks, 11% delivered before 30 weeks, 44% had spontaneous rupture of membranes, 20% had oligohydramnios, more than 11% had partial or complete dehiscence of their hysterotomies, 9% required transfusion at delivery, and 5% developed pulmonary edema. Counseling should be nondirective and include all options with full disclosure of potential benefits and risks, and fetal repair of myelomeningocele should be performed only in an established fetal therapy center with the required expertise, multidisciplinary team, facilities, services, and adequate volume, and should follow standard procedures derived from the MOMS trial.

### Practice bulletin no. 187: neural tube defects [^f584c9c0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) — screening, diagnostic ultrasound, and care planning (Level B) are summarized as follows: Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B), ultrasonography in the second trimester is recommended for all pregnant women; the optimal time for a single ultrasound examination is 18–22 weeks, allowing for confirmation of gestational age and screening for anomalies, including NTDs. Although it is possible to detect some NTDs in the first trimester, the detection rate appears to be much lower than with second-trimester ultrasonography; therefore, a normal first-trimester ultrasound examination should not be substituted for a screening ultrasonography at 18–22 weeks. A patient with a fetus with an NTD should be offered the management options of pregnancy termination, expectant management with neonatal surgical repair, and in utero fetal repair for appropriate candidates. For the patient who elects to continue the pregnancy, genetic evaluation by amniocentesis for chromosomal microarray should be recommended to inform prognosis, management, and candidacy for in utero NTD repair. Pregnant women with an ongoing, nonlethal fetal NTD should be referred to a tertiary center for full spectrum care, including maternal–fetal medicine in collaboration with neonatology, pediatric neurosurgery, and genetics. Delivery of a fetus with nonlethal spina bifida should be planned to occur in a hospital that provides tertiary neonatal care and has personnel capable of managing the spinal defect and any immediate complications.

Foramen magnum stenosis in achondroplasia — neurological evaluation and imaging — includes clinic screening patterns and consensus recommendations: Many skeletal dysplasia management clinics now screen routinely in the first year with MRI for this complication; if the complication is not present, then high clinical suspicion is still maintained with careful, close monitoring at least up to age 3 years. Regular neurological evaluation is recommended for all infants and children with achondroplasia. MRI is the preferred imaging modality to investigate cervicomedullary compression in infants and children with achondroplasia. In asymptomatic infants with achondroplasia, MRI scanning to evaluate the cervicomedullary junction and foramen magnum size should be considered during the first months of life. If a cranio-cervical MRI is being performed in infants and children with achondroplasia, imaging of the whole brain should be included. Asymptomatic ventriculomegaly does not require treatment in patients with achondroplasia. An abnormality on neurological evaluation of a patient with achondroplasia, which might indicate cervicomedullary compression, should be evaluated further with MRI.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^2ef3dd88]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Special consideration in pediatric patients — cervical spine imaging states that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated in the neurologically compromised/symptomatic pediatric patient, though disadvantages include length of the exam, need for sedation, not available emergently, and "too sensitive" for clinically significant ligamentous injuries. In intubated patients, imaging is required to exclude injury and can usually be performed in conjunction with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) or MRI brain imaging. For intentional injury in this population, the incidence of C-spine injury approaches 15 percent. SCIWORA, formerly spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality, is used to describe neurologic deficit in the absence of findings on plain radiographs or MDCT; MRI is recommended next, but up to 40 percent of affected patients do not have an injury detected by MRI. SCIWORA may be further classified by whether or not abnormalities are detectable; when present they are described as "extraneural" or "intraneural," and treatment strategies are not standardized.

Interpretation of immobilization literature and harms — guideline focus: Many articles have been repeatedly quoted as case evidence of neurologic deterioration in the presence of SCI secondary to inadequate out‑of‑hospital immobilization, but careful review reveals that virtually all represent missed or late diagnoses after hospital admission or deterioration that occurred while under treatment; the focus of these guidelines is to present an evidence‑based approach to out‑of‑hospital care in wilderness environments that minimizes the possibility of neurologic deterioration or injury exacerbation. Spinal immobilization itself is not a benign procedure and is associated with documented risks and rather extreme discomfort; although the expert panel was unable to identify a single well‑documented case of out‑of‑hospital neurologic deterioration as a direct consequence of improper or inadequate immobilization, many cases have documented severe morbidity, and even mortality, secondary to immobilization itself.

### Committee opinion no. 720: maternal-fetal surgery for myelomeningocele [^82babe10]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evidence supporting fetal myelomeningocele repair — randomized trial eligibility, outcomes, risks, and evidence limitations are summarized as follows: Inclusion required a singleton gestation with an upper boundary located between T1 and S1, evidence of hindbrain herniation on fetal magnetic resonance imaging, gestational age between 19 0/7 weeks and 25 6/7 weeks at randomization, and a normal karyotype, and major exclusions included a maternal body mass index of 35 or more. Compared with standard postnatal repair, prenatal surgery reduced the rate of death or cerebrospinal shunt requirement at 12 months of age, decreased the rate of hindbrain herniation at 12 months of age, doubled the rate of independent ambulation at 30 months of age, improved 30-month neuromotor outcomes, and produced a level of function that was more often better than expected according to anatomical levels, but it was associated with higher rates of obstetric and maternal complications including preterm birth, chorion–amnion separation, spontaneous membrane rupture, oligohydramnios, placental abruption, pulmonary edema, maternal transfusion at delivery, and an increased incidence of uterine thinning or dehiscence of the uterine scar at delivery. Long-term follow-up from the trial of children ages 5–8 years is ongoing; a Cochrane review concluded that high-quality data are limited to this single small trial, while a single-center posttrial experience involving 100 cases reported short-term outcomes comparable with the original trial.

### Tethered spinal cord: a mother's experience… [^c7523a7f]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

"We will do one more MRI to confirm, " she said, "but it looks like your daughter has something called tethered spinal cord syndrome. " She scribbled a few words on a bright pink square of paper and then said, "Here, you can go home and google this. Start doing some of your own research and our team will be in touch soon to schedule the surgery and answer any questions you have". And just like that, I became a TCS Mama, the name we gave ourselves in the online group I promptly joined that night. There is not one clear path forward when it comes to tethered cord, and no shortage of information to wade through, either. This month's Pediatrics highlights this abundance of research in an article entitled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Tethered Spinal Cord: A Systematic Review". What is tethered spinal cord syndrome.

Tethered spinal cord syndrome is a disorder in which the spinal cord attaches to the spinal canal, causing too much stretching and tension in the cord. This can lead to pain, motor impairments, sensory issues, and trouble with bladder and bowel function. Not all children have symptoms at first, but if not managed properly, a tethered cord can lead to irreversible nerve damage and permanent dysfunction. Often a tethered cord is first suspected due to an external marker on the lower back. This could be a tuft of hair, a fatty lump, a small indentation, or, as was the case with my daughter, a patch of blood vessels called a hemangioma. A diagnosis is then made through clinical evaluations, nerve function tests, and images like ultrasounds and MRIs. What were the main features of the article.

This review looked at four main aspects of the research:

- Diagnosis of tethered cord
- Treatment if a patient is already showing symptoms
- Surgery before symptoms arise to prevent future damage
- The possibility of the spine becoming tethered again The authors also asked 4 key questions of the research:

- How accurate were the images and criteria used to diagnose tethered cord.
- How effective is surgery for patients who are already experiencing symptoms.
- What are the benefits and harms of surgery for patients who are not showing symptoms.
- If a person retethers, what are the risks, rewards, and long-term outcomes of repeating surgery.

Several authors have proposed that development of a fixed thoracolumbar kyphosis might be exacerbated by prolonged periods of positioning with full spinal flexion, and the effects of trunk hypotonia, increased head weight and increased ligamentous laxity combine with the effect of gravity to promote a slumped sitting position, which might contribute to increased anterior wedging of the vertebral bodies and narrowing of the spinal canal. In the great majority of patients, the kyphotic deformity resolves spontaneously; however, brace therapy can be considered for children with marked hypotonia and/or motor delay to prevent progression, and this author panel agrees that the thoracolumbar kyphosis is often seen during infancy in individuals with achondroplasia but resolves without intervention or treatment in the majority of infants when they start to walk. In situations where fusion and stabilization of the spine are being considered after decompression spanning more than five spinal levels, the effect of the consequent reduction in lumbar spine mobility on activities of daily living in these patients must be considered.

Neonatal and infant spine ultrasound — documentation of fluid collections and diastematomyelia should identify lesion level and use transverse and off-center scanning as appropriate, and evaluation includes the subarachnoid, dural, and epidural spaces. Areas of abnormal fluid accumulation within the spinal cord and canal should be documented with level identified, including hydromyelia/syringomyelia, meningoceles or pseudomeningoceles, and arachnoid cysts; transverse images are essential to identify and document diastematomyelia; off-center scanning may avoid a refraction artifact that resembles diastematomyelia; the subarachnoid space is normally anechoic, and the subarachnoid space, dura, and epidural space should be evaluated for abnormalities such as hematoma, lipoma, or other masses.

### Dantrolene sodium (Dantrium) [^2d8c204e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

In Chronic Spasticity:

Dantrium is indicated in controlling the manifestations of clinical spasticity resulting from upper motor neuron disorders (e.g., spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis). It is of particular benefit to the patient whose functional rehabilitation has been retarded by the sequelae of spasticity. Such patients must have presumably reversible spasticity where relief of spasticity will aid in restoring residual function. Dantrium is not indicated in the treatment of skeletal muscle spasm resulting from rheumatic disorders.

If improvement occurs, it will ordinarily occur within the dosage titration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), and will be manifested by a decrease in the severity of spasticity and the ability to resume a daily function not quite attainable without Dantrium.

Occasionally, subtle but meaningful improvement in spasticity may occur with Dantrium therapy. In such instances, information regarding improvement should be solicited from the patient and those who are in constant daily contact and attendance with him. Brief withdrawal of Dantrium for a period of 2 to 4 days will frequently demonstrate exacerbation of the manifestations of spasticity and may serve to confirm a clinical impression.

A decision to continue the administration of Dantrium on a long-term basis is justified if introduction of the drug into the patient's regimen:

produces a significant reduction in painful and/or disabling spasticity such as clonus, or

permits a significant reduction in the intensity and/or degree of nursing care required, or

rids the patient of any annoying manifestation of spasticity considered important by the patient himself.

In Malignant Hyperthermia:

Oral Dantrium is also indicated preoperatively to prevent or attenuate the development of signs of malignant hyperthermia in known, or strongly suspect, malignant hyperthermia susceptible patients who require anesthesia and/or surgery. Currently accepted clinical practices in the management of such patients must still be adhered to (careful monitoring for early signs of malignant hyperthermia, minimizing exposure to triggering mechanisms and prompt use of intravenous dantrolene sodium and indicated supportive measures should signs of malignant hyperthermia appear); see also the package insert for Dantrium ®(dantrolene sodium) Intravenous.

Oral Dantrium should be administered following a malignant hyperthermic crisis to prevent recurrence of the signs of malignant hyperthermia.

14.3 Pediatric Detrusor Overactivity Associated with a Neurologic Condition

Study 191622–120 (NCT01852045) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical study conducted in patients 5 to 17 years of age with urinary incontinence due to detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and using clean intermittent catheterization. A total of 113 patients (including 99 with spinal dysraphism such as spina bifida, 13 with spinal cord injury and 1 with transverse myelitis) who had an inadequate response to or were intolerant of at least one anticholinergic medication were enrolled. The median age was 11 years (range: 5 to 17 years), 49% were female; 75% were White, 10% were Black. These patients were randomized to 50 Units, 100 Units or 200 Units, not to exceed 6 Units/kg body weight. Patients receiving less than the randomized dose due to the 6 Units/kg maximum, were assigned to the nearest dose group for analysis. The sample size for BOTOX 50 Units, 100 Units, and 200 Units were 38, 45 and 30, respectively. Prior to treatment administration, patients received anesthesia based on age and local site practice. One hundred and nine patients (97.3%) received general anesthesia or conscious sedation and 3 patients (2.7%) received local anesthesia.

### Oxybutynin chloride [^4614b3be]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor over activity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters.

At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets, USP was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H2O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H2O) from 39% to 20%.

As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours.2,3,4In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Goserelin (Zoladex) [^b53699ba]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Stage B2-C Prostatic Carcinoma

Treatment with ZOLADEX and flutamide did not add substantially to the toxicity of radiation treatment alone. The following adverse experiences were reported during a multicenter clinical trial comparing ZOLADEX + flutamide + radiation versus radiation alone. The most frequently reported (greater than 5%) adverse experiences are listed below:

Additional adverse event data was collected for the combination therapy with radiation group over both the hormonal treatment and hormonal treatment plus radiation phases of the study. Adverse experiences occurring in more than 5% of patients in this group, over both parts of the study, were hot flashes (46%), diarrhea (40%), nausea (9%), and skin rash (8%).

6.2 Prostatic Carcinoma

ZOLADEX has been found to be generally well tolerated in clinical trials. Adverse reactions reported in these trials were rarely severe enough to result in the patients' withdrawal from ZOLADEX treatment. As seen with other hormonal therapies, the most commonly observed adverse events during ZOLADEX therapy were due to the expected physiological effects from decreased testosterone levels. These included hot flashes, sexual dysfunction and decreased erections.

Tumor Flare Phenomenon: Initially, ZOLADEX, like other GnRH agonists, causes transient increases in serum levels of testosterone. A small percentage of patients experienced a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in cancer-related pain which was managed symptomatically. Isolated cases of exacerbation of disease symptoms, either ureteral obstruction or spinal cord compression, occurred at similar rates in controlled clinical trials with both ZOLADEX and orchiectomy. The relationship of these events to therapy is uncertain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In the controlled clinical trials of ZOLADEX versus orchiectomy, the following events were reported as adverse reactions in greater than 5% of the patients.

The following additional adverse reactions were reported in greater than 1% but less than 5% of the patients treated with ZOLADEX: CARDIOVASCULAR – arrhythmia, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disorder, chest pain; CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM – anxiety, depression, headache; GASTROINTESTINAL – constipation, diarrhea, ulcer, vomiting; HEMATOLOGIC – anemia; METABOLIC/NUTRITIONAL – gout, hyperglycemia, weight increase; MISCELLANEOUS – chills, fever; UROGENITAL – renal insufficiency, urinary obstruction, urinary tract infection, breast swelling and tenderness.

### Baclofen — baclofen — intrathecal [^99f58a38]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients: After the first 24 hours, the daily dose should be increased slowly by 5 to 15% only once every 24 hours, until the desired clinical effect is achieved. If there is not a substantive clinical response to increases in the daily dose, check for proper pump function and catheter patency. Patients must be monitored closely in a fully equipped and staffed environment during the screening phase and dose-titration period immediately following implant. Resuscitative equipment should be immediately available for use in case of life-threatening or intolerable side effects.

Maintenance Therapy:

Spasticity of Spinal Cord Origin Patients: The clinical goal is to maintain muscle tone as close to normal as possible, and to minimize the frequency and severity of spasms to the extent possible, without inducing intolerable side effects. Very often, the maintenance dose needs to be adjusted during the first few months of therapy while patients adjust to changes in life style due to the alleviation of spasticity. During periodic refills of the pump, the daily dose may be increased by 10 to 40%, but no more than 40%, to maintain adequate symptom control. The daily dose may be reduced by 10 to 20% if patients experience side effects. Most patients require gradual increases in dose over time to maintain optimal response during chronic therapy. A sudden large requirement for dose escalation suggests a catheter complication (i.e., catheter kink or dislodgement).

### Tazarotene (Tazorac) [^1119c487]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 2 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% [see Data].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm2over a 20% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies.

### Carbamazepine (Carbatrol) [^13334b26]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Administration of carbamazepine to Sprague-Dawley rats for two years in the diet at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day (low dose approximately 0.2 times the maximum human daily dose of 1200 mg on a mg/m2basis), resulted in a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors in females and of benign interstitial cell adenomas in the testes of males.

Carbamazepine must, therefore, be considered to be carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats. Bacterial and mammalian mutagenicity studies using carbamazepine produced negative results. The significance of these findings relative to the use of carbamazepine in humans is, at present, unknown.

Labor and Delivery

The effect of carbamazepine on human labor and delivery is unknown.

Nursing Mothers

Carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite are transferred to breast milk and during lactation. The concentrations of carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite are approximately 50% of the maternal plasma concentration. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from carbamazepine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Pediatric Use

Substantial evidence of carbamazepine effectiveness for use in the management of children with epilepsy (see INDICATIONS for specific seizure types) is derived from clinical investigations performed in adults and from studies in several in vitro systems which support the conclusion that (1) the pathogenic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation are essentially identical in adults and children, and (2) the mechanism of action of carbamazepine in treating seizures is essentially identical in adults and children.

Taken as a whole, this information supports a conclusion that the generally acceptable therapeutic range of total carbamazepine in plasma (i.e., 4–12 μg/mL) is the same in children and adults.

The evidence assembled was primarily obtained from short-term use of carbamazepine. The safety of carbamazepine in children has been systematically studied up to 6 months. No longer term data from clinical trials is available.

Geriatric Use

No systematic studies in geriatric patients have been conducted.

### Tazarotene [^34fc5c93]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, tazarotene cream may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from tazarotene cream during pregnancy; therefore, tazarotene cream should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for tazarotene cream have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown.

In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 26 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1%, there was a single incident of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies.

In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 2 and 52 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 7 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene cream, 0.1% [see Data].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

In the paragraphs that follow, the adverse reactions, other than those in the preceding tables or text, that occurred in a total of 565 children and 1574 adults exposed to TRILEPTAL and that are reasonably likely to be related to drug use are presented. Events common in the population, events reflecting chronic illness and events likely to reflect concomitant illness are omitted particularly if minor. They are listed in order of decreasing frequency. Because the reports cite events observed in open label and uncontrolled trials, the role of TRILEPTAL in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (Jalyn) [^ad96e42d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome

Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha-adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of JALYN.

Most reports were in patients taking the alpha-adrenergic antagonist when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patients had been off the alpha-adrenergic antagonist for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances.

IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation.

The benefit of stopping alpha-adrenergic antagonist therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended.

5.10 Sulfa Allergy

In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin has been rarely reported.

If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN.

### Incidental findings on brain and spine imaging in children [^446547a2]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Choroid plexus cysts — Choroid plexus cysts are common findings on antenatal ultrasonography in the second trimester, with prevalence rates between 0.6% and 2.3% reported; in the fetus they are generally believed to regress before or shortly after birth, and the literature cited here notes only a single example in print of a cyst detected in the second trimester that persisted to term and progressed postnatally to become a clinical problem. There seems to be little cause for concern about postnatal neurosurgical complications of antenatally detected choroid plexus cysts, but incidentally detected choroid plexus cysts associated with mass effect or hydrocephalus certainly require neurosurgical referral.

### Baclofen injection (Gablofen) [^13cc4927]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Maintenance dosage for long term continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen has ranged from 22 mcg/day to 1,400 mcg/day, with most patients adequately maintained on 90 micrograms to 703 micrograms per day. In clinical trials, only 3 of 150 patients required daily doses greater than 1,000 mcg/day.

Pediatric Patients

Use same dosing recommendations for patients with spasticity of cerebral origin. Pediatric patients under 12 years seemed to require a lower daily dose in clinical trials. Average daily dose for patients under 12 years was 274 mcg/day, with a range of 24 mcg/day to 1,199 mcg/day. Dosage requirement for pediatric patients over 12 years does not seem to be different from that of adult patients. Determination of the optimal GABLOFEN dose requires individual titration. The lowest dose with an optimal response should be used.

Potential Need for Dose Adjustments in Chronic Use

During long term treatment, approximately 5% (28/627) of patients become refractory to increasing doses. There is not sufficient experience to make firm recommendations for tolerance treatment; however, this "tolerance" has been treated on occasion, in hospital, by a "drug holiday" consisting of the gradual reduction of intrathecal baclofen over a 2 to 4 week period and switching to alternative methods of spasticity management. After the "drug holiday," intrathecal baclofen may be restarted at the initial continuous infusion dose.

GABLOFEN is intended for use by the intrathecal route in single bolus test doses (via spinal catheter or lumbar puncture) and, for chronic use in the Medtronic SynchroMed®Programmable Pump or other pumps labeled for intrathecal administration of GABLOFEN; Refer to the pump manufacturer's manual and follow the specific instructions and precautions for programming the pump and/or refilling the reservoir. (2.1)
Screening: Patients who do not respond to a 100 mcg intrathecal bolus should not be considered for an implanted pump for chronic infusion. (2.2)
Dose Titration: Spasticity may be necessary to sustain upright posture and balance in locomotion or may be useful to obtain optimal function and care. (2.5)
Maintenance Therapy: Titrate patients individually; Lowest dose with an optimal response should be used, generally 300 mcg/day to 800 mcg/day for spasticity of spinal cord origin and 90 mcg/day to 700 mcg/day for spasticity of cerebral origin; Titrate GABLOFEN to maintain some degree of muscle tone and allow occasional spasms.

Table 6 displays a comparison of paired images (pre-and post-contrast) to pre-contrast images with respect to the proportion of patients who had paired image scores that were greater "better", or same/worse "not better" than the pre-contrast scores and with respect to the difference in the mean patient level visualization score. Across the three readers 56% to 94% of patients had improved lesion visualization for paired images compared to pre-contrast images. DOTAREM provided a statistically significant improvement for all three primary visualization components. More lesions were seen on the paired images than the pre-contrast images.

(a) Better: number of patients with paired (pre-and post-contrast) score greater than the pre-contrast score

Not better: number of patients with paired score same as or worse than the pre-contrast score

Missing: number of patients with missing score

(b) Difference = paired mean score minus pre-contrast mean score

*Statistically significant improvement by paired t-test

In secondary analyses, post-contrast images were improved in comparison to pre-contrast images. DOTAREM lesion visualization scores were similar to those for gadopentetate dimeglumine. DOTAREM imaging results in the pediatric patients were also similar to those seen in adults.

In a second clinical trial (Study B), MR images were reread from 150 adult patients with known CNS lesions who had participated in previously conducted clinical trial. DOTAREM administration and image interpretation was performed in the same manner as in Study A. Similar to Study A, this trial also demonstrated improved lesion visualization with DOTAREM.

CNS Imaging in the Sub-population of Pediatric Patients < 2 years old

A non-randomized study (Study C) with 28 pediatric patients under 2 years of age who were referred for contrast MRI of the CNS supported extrapolation of CNS efficacy findings from adults and older children. CNS lesions were identified in 16 of these 28 patients on paired pre- and post-contrast images compared to 15 patients on pre-contrast images alone. In the 16 patients who had identifiable lesions, the scores for the co-endpoints of lesion visualization were improved for at least one lesion on paired pre- and post-contrast images compared to pre-contrast images in 8 out of 16 (50%) patients for lesion border delineation, 8 out of 16 (50%) patients for lesion internal morphology, and 14 out of 16 (88%) patients for lesion contrast enhancement.

### Tazarotene (arazlo) [^2b7b6a2e]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of major birth defects, loss, and other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

In an embryofetal development study in rats, a tazarotene gel formulation, 0.5% (0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene) was topically administered to pregnant rats during gestation days 6 through 17. Reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification occurred at this dose (equivalent to the MRHD based on AUC comparison). In an embryofetal development study in rabbits, a tazarotene gel formulation, 0.5% (0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene) was topically administered to pregnant rabbits during gestation days 6 through 18. Single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies were noted at this dose (15 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison).

When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats; malformations and post- implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 1 and 30 times, respectively, the MRHD (based on AUC comparison).

In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, classic developmental effects of retinoids including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights were observed at this dose (6 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at this dose.

In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of a tazarotene gel formulation (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at this dose would be equivalent to the MRHD (based on AUC comparison).

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules (dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride) [^9517ad86]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.8 Blood Donation

Men being treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of dutasteride to a pregnant female transfusion recipient.

5.9 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome

Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha-adrenergic-antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.

Most reports were in patients taking the alpha-adrenergic-antagonist when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patients had been off the alpha-adrenergic antagonist for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances.

IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha-adrenergic antagonist therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended.

5.10 Sulfa Allergy

In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride [^d3f61ce4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In postmarketing experience, overdose with venlafaxine has occurred predominantly in combination with alcohol and/or other drugs. The most commonly reported events in overdosage include tachycardia, changes in level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), mydriasis, seizures, and vomiting. Electrocardiogram changes (e.g., prolongation of QT interval, bundle branch block, QRS prolongation), ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, vertigo, liver necrosis, serotonin syndrome, and death have been reported.

Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcomes compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Epidemiological studies have shown that venlafaxine-treated patients have a higher preexisting burden of suicide risk factors than SSRI-treated patients. The extent to which the finding of an increased risk of fatal outcomes can be attributed to the toxicity of venlafaxine in overdosage, as opposed to some characteristic(s) of venlafaxine-treated patients, is not clear. Prescriptions for venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

 Management of Overdosage

No specific antidotes for venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are known. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for overdosage management recommendations for venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^4da02c6e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Valproic Acid (val-proé-ik-as íd) Capsules

Read this Medication Guide before you start taking Valproic Acid Capsules and each time you get a refill. There may be new information.

This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about Valproic Acid Capsules? Do not stop taking Valproic Acid Capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping valproic acid suddenly can cause serious problems.

Valproic Acid Capsules can cause serious side effects, including:

1. Serious liver damage that can cause death, especially in children younger than 2 years old. The risk of getting this serious liver damage is more likely to happen within the first 6 months of treatment. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms:

nausea or vomiting that does not go away
loss of appetite
pain on the right side of your stomach (abdomen)
dark urine
swelling of your face
yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes

In some cases, liver damage may continue despite stopping the drug.

2. Valproic Acid Capsules may harm your unborn baby.

If you take Valproic Acid Capsules during pregnancy for any medical condition, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects that affect the brain and spinal cord and are called spina bifida or neural tube defects. These defects occur in 1 to 2 out of every 100 babies born to mothers who use this medicine during pregnancy. These defects can begin in the first month, even before you know you are pregnant. Other birth defects that affect the structures of the heart, head, arms, legs, and the opening where the urine comes out (urethra) on the bottom of the penis can also happen. Decreased hearing or hearing loss can also happen.

### Iobenguane I-123 (Adreview) [^df3ef506]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1	Pheochromocytoma and Neuroblastoma

The safety and efficacy of AdreView were assessed in an open-label, multicenter, multinational trial of 251 subjects with known or suspected neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma. Diagnostic efficacy for the detection of metabolically active neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma was determined by comparison of focal increased radionuclide uptake on planar scintigraphy at 24 ± 6 hours post-administration of AdreView against the definitive diagnosis (standard of truth). Anterior and posterior planar whole-body images, or alternatively whole-body overlapping spot images, were acquired from the head to below the knees. Additional spot images were performed as deemed appropriate at the discretion of the clinical image reviewer. SPECT imaging of the thorax and abdomen was then obtained when possible.

Of the 251 subjects dosed with AdreView, 100 had known or suspected neuroblastoma and 151 had known or suspected pheochromocytoma. The population included 154 adults and 97 pediatric patients; the majority of adults were female (59%), the majority of pediatric subjects were male (58%). The adult subjects had a mean age of 49 years (range 17 to 88 years). The pediatric patients (56 males and 41 females) consisted of 32 infants (1 month up to 2 years of age), 62 children (2 years up to 12 years) and three adolescents (12 years up to 16 years).

The definitive diagnosis (standard of truth) for the presence or absence of metabolically active pheochromocytoma or neuroblastoma was determined by histopathology or, when histopathology was unavailable, a composite of imaging (i.e. CT, MRI, [131I]- m IBG scintigraphy), plasma/urine catecholamine and/or catecholamine metabolite measurements, and clinical follow-up.

A standard of truth was available for 211 subjects (127 with pheochromocytoma, 84 with neuroblastoma) and this group comprised the diagnostic efficacy population. For 93 of these subjects, the standard of truth was based solely upon histopathology. Of 211 subjects in the efficacy population, all had planar scintigraphy and 167 subjects had SPECT in addition to planar imaging. All images were assessed independently by three readers blinded to all clinical data. Table 5 summarizes the AdreView performance characteristics, by reader.

Performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of AdreView planar imaging in patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma were similar to those in patients with known or suspected pheochromocytoma. Among the selected patients who also underwent SPECT imaging, similar performance characteristics of AdreView scintigraphy were observed when SPECT plus planar imaging was compared to planar imaging alone.

### Ferumoxides (feridex) [^80c47906]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

CLINICAL TRIALS

Two clinical studies evaluated a total of 211 patients,(107 men and 104 women, 22–83 years of age) with a variety of known or suspected liver lesions. Of these patients, efficacy evaluations were completed on 96 patients in Study A, and 112 patients in Study B. At baseline, patients had a CECT (contrast enhanced computerized tomography) scan with any iodinated contrast agent and a noncontrast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) within 24 hours before Feridex I.V. administration. Feridex I.V. (0.56 mg/kg) was administered intravenously over 30 minutes. Images were acquired up to 3.5 hours after the end of the infusion. The CECT, unenhanced MRI, and Feridex I.V. enhanced MRI images were read blindly (i.e., by radiologists who were not told of the patient's medical history or the presence of image contrast enhancing drugs). Results from blindly read images were compared to the final clinical diagnosis. The final clinical diagnoses were confirmed with histopathologic, surgical, or biopsy findings in 86 (41%) of patients. MRI scans were evaluated for the quantitative analysis of signal intensity in liver lesion(s), and by blinded evaluations of the resulting images for changes in number and location of lesions, delineation of lesion margins, presence or absence of lesions, and characterization of lesions.
