## Question

For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I buy dog food to feed my neighbors children. Scenario 2 | I threw my food at the bear to distract it.

Answer Choices:
A. Wrong, Wrong
B. Wrong, Not wrong
C. Not wrong, Wrong
D. Not wrong, Not wrong

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and to choose among A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; or D. Not wrong, Not wrong. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the moral framework and what "ordinary moral standards" imply. Then, I should analyze Scenario 1 about feeding dog food to children. Next, I will examine Scenario 2 about throwing food to distract a bear. Finally, I will compare the two and select the option that best matches the moral assessment, making sure I verify any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the moral framework. Ordinary moral standards in the US generally hinge on foreseeability of harm, consent, and reasonable alternatives; actions are morally problematic when they knowingly expose others to foreseeable harm without a compelling justification or when they violate widely accepted norms of care, especially toward vulnerable parties like children [^e0c92ff1].

> Now, Scenario 1: I buy dog food to feed my neighbor's children. Wait, let me verify the key issues. First, there is a foreseeable risk of harm from feeding children food formulated for dogs, including nutritional deficiency and potential contamination or allergen exposure, which is not mitigated by any emergency justification here. Second, there is a violation of the duty of care owed to children, who cannot consent and are especially vulnerable. Third, there are obvious, reasonable alternatives such as seeking human food assistance, which makes this choice avoidable and therefore morally culpable under ordinary standards. So, this is clearly morally wrong [^e0c92ff1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intent. Even if the actor's intent is to prevent immediate hunger, the foreseeable harm and the availability of better alternatives still render the action morally wrong by ordinary standards; intent does not erase foreseeable harm when reasonable alternatives exist, particularly in non-emergency contexts [^e0c92ff1].

> Next, Scenario 2: I threw my food at the bear to distract it. I need to check the moral calculus here. The key elements are imminent danger, proportionality, and the absence of reasonable alternatives. Throwing food to distract a bear is a proportionate, low-harm response to a high-stakes threat, and it is widely accepted as a reasonable defensive tactic in bear encounters. The harm caused is minimal (loss of food) compared with the potential harm averted, and there is no clear, safer alternative in the moment. Thus, this is not morally wrong under ordinary standards [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the bear becomes habituated to human food because of this act? Could that make it morally wrong? Hmm, wait a minute, that would be a different scenario involving repeated or preventable feeding that increases future risk; in a one-off, life-threatening moment, the immediate moral imperative is to prevent harm to persons, and the distal ecological or wildlife-management consequences, while real, do not convert the defensive act into a morally wrong choice by ordinary standards in that context [^notfound].

> Comparing the two, I should double-check that I'm not conflating emergency justification with ordinary wrongness. Scenario 1 is wrong because it knowingly exposes children to foreseeable harm without necessity and when better options exist, whereas Scenario 2 is not wrong because it is a proportionate, necessary response to imminent danger with no safer alternative in the moment. Therefore, the correct mapping is Scenario 1 wrong, Scenario 2 not wrong [^e0c92ff1].

> Final answer: B. Wrong, Not wrong.

---

The correct answer is **B. Wrong, Not wrong**. Feeding dog food to children is morally wrong because it is nutritionally inadequate and potentially harmful, violating the duty to provide safe, appropriate nutrition [^notfound]. Throwing food at a bear to distract it is **not morally wrong** because it is a reasonable, proportionate response to an immediate threat, prioritizing human safety in an emergency [^notfound].

---

## Scenario 1: feeding dog food to neighbor's children

### Moral analysis

- **Nutritional inadequacy**: Dog food is formulated for canines, not humans, and lacks essential nutrients for children, risking malnutrition and health problems [^notfound].
- **Potential harm**: Dog food may contain ingredients unsafe or harmful to children, including contaminants or allergens.
- **Duty of care**: Adults have a moral obligation to provide safe, appropriate nutrition; using dog food violates this duty and is negligent.
- **Social norms**: Ordinary moral standards in the US condemn feeding children inappropriate or unsafe food, especially when alternatives exist.

---

### Conclusion for scenario 1

This action is **clearly morally wrong** according to ordinary US standards, as it knowingly exposes children to harm and violates basic caregiving duties [^notfound].

---

## Scenario 2: throwing food at a bear to distract it

### Moral analysis

- **Immediate threat**: Bears pose significant danger; distracting the bear is a reasonable, proportionate response to protect human life.
- **Proportionality**: The harm (loss of food) is minimal compared to the potential harm from a bear attack.
- **Lack of alternatives**: In the moment, there is no safer, more effective alternative to quickly neutralize the threat.
- **Social norms**: Ordinary moral standards accept proportionate, emergency responses that prioritize human safety.

---

### Conclusion for scenario 2

This action is **not morally wrong** under ordinary US standards, as it is a justified emergency response to an imminent threat [^notfound].

## Final answer

B. Wrong, Not wrong

### Development of a model-inference system for estimating epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern [^c78b6f29]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To support COVID-19 pandemic planning, we develop a model-inference system to estimate epidemiological properties of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern using case and mortality data while accounting for under-ascertainment, disease seasonality, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and mass-vaccination. Applying this system to study three variants of concern, we estimate that B.1.1.7 has a 46.6% (95% CI: 32.3–54.6%) transmissibility increase but nominal immune escape from protection induced by prior wild-type infection; B.1.351 has a 32.4% (95% CI: 14.6–48.0%) transmissibility increase and 61.3% (95% CI: 42.6–85.8%) immune escape; and P.1 has a 43.3% (95% CI: 30.3–65.3%) transmissibility increase and 52.5% (95% CI: 0–75.8%) immune escape. Model simulations indicate that B.1.351 and P.1 could outcompete B.1.1.7 and lead to increased infections. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing the spread of variants of concern, via continued preventive measures, prompt mass-vaccination, continued vaccine efficacy monitoring, and possible updating of vaccine formulations to ensure high efficacy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Estimating COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths following the US vaccination campaigns during the pandemic [^2a6fc7f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

This decision analytic model adheres to Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards reporting guideline. The institutional review of this study was waived by York University for the use of publicly available, deidentified data of the COVID-19 infections, deaths, and vaccination. Informed consent was not required to access the data.

We expanded our previous agent-based modelto include transmission dynamics of the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants in addition to the original strain (eMethods in the Supplement). The model was parameterized with the US demographics and age-specific risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). A 2-dose vaccination strategy was implemented based on the daily vaccines administered in different age groups. Vaccine efficacies against infection, symptomatic disease and severe disease after each dose and for each variant were derived from published estimates (eTable 3 in the Supplement). The model was calibrated and fitted to reported national level incidence from October 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021 (eMethods in the Supplement).

We simulated pandemic trajectory under 2 counterfactuals: a no vaccination scenario and a program that achieved only half the daily vaccination rate of actual rollout. For each scenario, cumulative infections, hospitalizations, and deaths were compared with the simulated trends under the US vaccination program.

Credible intervals (CrIs) were generated from simulation outputs using the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method (with 500 replications) in June 2021. The model was implemented in Julia Language Programming, version 1.6 (Julia), and outputs were analyzed in MATLAB, version 2017a (MathWorks). No significance tests were performed for this simulation study.

### A continuous-time maxSAT solver with high analog performance [^87d3d16d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Algorithm description

Here, we give a simple, nonoptimized variant of the algorithm (see flowchart in Supplementary Fig. 2). Better implementations can be devised, for example with better fitting routines, however the description below is easier to follow and works well. Given a SAT problem, we first determine the b parameter as described previously. Step 1: initially we set, Γ min, = and t max. Unless specified otherwise, in our simulations we used Γ min = 100, Γ max = 2 × 10 6, t max = 50. Step 2: to initialize our statistics, we run Γ min trajectories up to t max, each from a random initial condition. For every such trajectory ω we update the p (E, t) distributions as function of the energies of the orthants visited by ω. We record the lowest energy value found. Step 3: starting from Γ = Γ min + 1 and up to Γ max, we continue running trajectories in the same way and for each one of them check: (a) If, set, update p (E, t) and go to Step 4. (b) If Γ just reached, go to Step 4. (c) If Γ = Γ max, output "Maximum number of steps reached, increase Γ max ", output the lowest energy value found, the predictedand the quality of fit for, then halt. Step 4: using the p (E, t) distributions, estimate the escape rates κ (E) as described in the corresponding Methods section. Step 5: the κ (E) curve is extrapolated to the E − 1 value obtaining κ (E − 1) and then using this we predict(as described in another Methods section). Further extrapolating the κ (E) curve to κ = 0 we obtain(see the corresponding Methods section). Step 6: we check the consistency of the prediction defined here as saturation of the predicted values. We call it consistent, ifhas not changed during the last 5 predictions. If it is not consistent yet, we continue running new trajectories (Step 4). If the prediction is consistent, we check for the following halting conditions: (i) Ifthen we decide the global optimum has been found:and skip to Step 7. (ii) If the fitting is consistently predicting(usually it is very close,) we check the number of trajectories that has attained states with, i.e. = . If it is large enough (e.g. > 100), we decide to stop running new trajectories and setand go to Step 7. (iii) Ifthen we most probably have not found the global optimum yet and we go to Step 4. We added additional stopping conditions that can shorten the algorithm in case of easy problems, see Methods corresponding section, but these are not so relevant. Step 7: the algorithm ends and outputs, values, the Boolean variables corresponding to the optimal state found, along with the quality of fit.

### Evaluating intervention strategies in controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread in care homes: an agent-based model [^76a787dd]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Spread of COVID-19

In all scenarios, the mean prevalence of infected residents peaked ~30 days after the first infection in the care home, decreased, then stabilized after around ~90 days (Fig. 2 A). The distribution of prevalence at peak (mean, 34; standard deviation [SD], 4.9; range, 19–47) in the no intervention scenario is illustrated in Figure 2 B. Relatively large variations in prevalence values are due to stochastic uncertainty of interactions within the care home and disease progression.

Fig. 2.
Time series of COVID-19 prevalence among residents in care home with capacity of 80 residents across all scenarios using the base case parameters (means of 300 simulations for each scenario) (A) and distribution of the prevalence at peak for no intervention scenario (Inter0) using the base case parameters for 300 simulations (B). (Inter0: No intervention; Inter1: Reference intervention (isolation of symptomatic/confirmed residents, testing of new admissions, closed to visitors, social distancing); Inter2: Inter 1 + isolation upon admission; Inter3: Inter1 + adaptive testing strategy; Inter4: Inter3 + isolation upon admission; Inter5: Inter1 + Weekly testing for residents; Inter6: Inter1 + weekly testing for staff; Inter7: Inter1 + weekly testing for staff and residents; Inter8: Inter6 + isolation upon admission; Inter9: Inter7 + isolation upon admission).

In the absence of any control measures and spontaneous changes in the behaviors of individuals, the introduction of a single infected resident resulted in an outbreak (ie, at least 2 residents are infected) in 99.7% of simulations (299 of 300); in 1 simulation, transmission died out quickly. By the time that any infected residents manifested COVID-19 symptoms, an average of 6 residents (SD, 4.2; range, 1–23) had acquired the infection but may not (yet) have shown symptoms. Infected cases that did not (yet) display symptoms made up approximately half of all infections among residents (Fig. 3), which aligns with reported data. Additionally, the proportion of asymptomatic cases among infected residents in our study (7%; range, 4%–10%) shows a good approximation of observed data for long-term aged care (8%; range, 3%–18%). -

Figure 7B — titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) outlines trajectory-based inpatient actions: Patients with decompensated HFrEF "should be diuresed and started on SGLT inhibitor unless contraindicated or cost prohibitive", while those "with an improving trajectory… should have optimization of GDMT". For a new diagnosis, "initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted", and for chronic HF on partial therapy, care "should have personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI if appropriate". In chronic Class IV HF with decompensation, "caution is required…; these patients may not tolerate even low doses of beta blockers and RAS, although an attempt at titration may be made". If the short-term course is "stalled or worsening", patients "should have re-evaluation of comorbidities and consideration of other diagnoses". Long-term course "should be reevaluated, with consideration of goals of care, candidacy for advanced therapies, and experimental treatments". The "ideal goal is initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT… in the hospital on a baseline of diuretic therapy", with "a plan for ongoing addition and titration of GDMT after discharge", including a "Loop diuretic plan on discharge". The figure lists the GDMT pillars as "SGLT inhibitors ARNI or ACEI/ARB beta-blockers MRA".

Study C: TRESIBA Administered at the Same Time Each Day or at Any Time Each Day in Combination with a Rapid-Acting Insulin Analog at Mealtimes in Adult Patients

The efficacy of TRESIBA was evaluated in a 26-week randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in 493 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized to TRESIBA injected once-daily at the same time each day (with the main evening meal), to TRESIBA injected once daily at any time each day or to insulin glargine U-100 injected once-daily according to the approved labeling. The any time each day TRESIBA arm was designed to simulate a worst-case scenario injection schedule of alternating short and long, once daily, dosing intervals (i.e., alternating intervals of 8 to 40 hours between doses). TRESIBA in this arm was dosed in the morning on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and in the evening on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Insulin aspart was administered before each meal in all treatment arms.

### Assessing the influence of climate on wintertime SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks [^9cdbd363]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In Fig. 1 a (lower plots) we show the proportion infected over time using the climate-driven and constant R₀ values. We also vary the reporting rate of observed cases relative to modeled cases; while this accounts for under-reporting it also allows us to vary the proportion susceptible over a feasible range (see "Methods"). In the middle figure, the reporting rate is 10% (estimates for US reporting rates are < 10%), which implies a relatively small reduction in susceptibility based on case data pre-July. In this case, a small boost to transmission, driven by low specific humidity in the winter months, results in a relatively large secondary outbreak in the climate scenario. In the constant scenario, R₀ stays below 1 and there is no outbreak in the winter months. We also consider a scenario where the reporting rate is 3% (Fig. 1 a, lower plot). In this case the lower reporting rate means more cases (relative to the observed case counts) and a greater reduction in susceptibility. This results in a smaller wintertime outbreak in the climate scenario.

In Fig. 1 b we consider a scenario where NPI measures are relaxed further such that R₀ is reduced 15% below non-control values as of the last week in July. In this case R₀ > 1 for both the climate and constant scenario and case numbers begin to grow exponentially. With a 10% reporting rate a large secondary outbreak is observed in both the constant and climate scenarios (Fig. 1 b, middle plot). With a 3% reporting rate, meaning a larger depletion of susceptibles, the secondary outbreak appears much larger in the climate scenario: this supports the hypothesis that the disease will become more sensitive to climate as the susceptible proportion declines, much like the seasonal endemic diseases.

In Fig. 1 c–h we simulate model outcomes across a broad range of parameter space varying the proportion susceptible (in July) and the reduction in R₀ due to NPIs. The proportion susceptible is varied by initializing the epidemic with different sizes of the infected population (initializing with a large number results in a relatively larger outbreak and initializing with a small number results in a smaller outbreak). We vary this starting number over a feasible range given the case data, i.e. such that observed cases never exceed modeled cases or that the reporting rate never drops below 1%. Over this range, the model plausibly tracks the observed case data.

### National and subnational short-term forecasting of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland during early 2021 [^7b8e7eba]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a strong interest in forecasts of the short-term development of epidemiological indicators to inform decision makers. In this study we evaluate probabilistic real-time predictions of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland for the period from January through April 2021.

Methods

We evaluate probabilistic real-time predictions of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland. These were issued by 15 different forecasting models, run by independent research teams. Moreover, we study the performance of combined ensemble forecasts. Evaluation of probabilistic forecasts is based on proper scoring rules, along with interval coverage proportions to assess calibration. The presented work is part of a pre-registered evaluation study.

Results

We find that many, though not all, models outperform a simple baseline model up to four weeks ahead for the considered targets. Ensemble methods show very good relative performance. The addressed time period is characterized by rather stable non-pharmaceutical interventions in both countries, making short-term predictions more straightforward than in previous periods. However, major trend changes in reported cases, like the rebound in cases due to the rise of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant in March 2021, prove challenging to predict.

Conclusions

Multi-model approaches can help to improve the performance of epidemiological forecasts. However, while death numbers can be predicted with some success based on current case and hospitalization data, predictability of case numbers remains low beyond quite short time horizons. Additional data sources including sequencing and mobility data, which were not extensively used in the present study, may help to improve performance.

b Period II: for China, it was the time period from the week when Wuhan was "locked down" on January 23 to the week ending on March 29, 2020; for the US, it was the time period from the week when the national emergency was declared on March 13 to the week ending on March 29, 2020.

Impact of NPIs and timing on influenza in the US

We used ARIMA models to analyze variation in influenza activity in the US during the same epidemic weeks that we used in our Southern China analysis. Prior to March 13, 2020 — the US declaration of a state of emergency (epidemic week 17), there were no significant changes in the intensity of influenza activity in the 2019–2020 winter–spring season when compared to the seasonal levels of influenza determined from the US historical data (Fig. 1c and 4c). Influenza test positivity during the 3 weeks following epidemic week 17 decreased by 67.2% (lower and upper bounds: 11.5–80.5%) from predicted levels under the counterfactual scenario, and declined by only 6.0% (0–23.9%) during epidemic weeks 10–16 (Figs. 2c, 3c, f and Table 1).

### Simulation-based estimates and projections of global, regional and country-level maternal mortality by cause, 1990–2050 [^f2f6daa6]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Model projections

Using the calibrated model, we made projections for each country from 1990 to 2050. Projected indicators are driven both by trends in demographic composition and parameter-specific secular trends. We model demographic trends (including uncertainty) within each country, accounting for factors such as age structure, urbanization and educational attainment, and many model parameters are conditional on these demographic factors (see Table 2 for parameters that vary by 'age' or 'subgroup'). In addition, some parameters are modeled with an independent coefficient to account for time trends (see Table 2 for parameters that vary by 'year'). For these parameters, predicted values vary over time as a function of the calibrated coefficients for the trend term. To account for potential nonlinear trends in these parameter values, we also include an exponential trend modifier (α ≤ 1) to allow for (weakly) monotonic trends while helping to guard against extrapolating to unreasonable levels (Appendix A.2.2.2).

Ethics and inclusion statement

All data for this study, including from LMICs, were obtained from publicly available sources. One colleague (B.S.D.) is from an LMIC and the corresponding author (Z.J.W.) is originally from an LMIC and is now based in a high-income country. We fully endorse the Nature Portfolio journals' guidance on LMIC authorship and inclusion. Because this work builds on previous modeling work, authorship was based, in part, on prior participation and collaboration. However, we are strongly committed to collaboration with researchers from LMICs in future work, especially for analyses focused on specific contexts or countries.

This research is locally relevant to all countries included because we report findings by country, providing local policy-makers with important data on maternal health outcomes.

Because our modeling approach employed only publicly available data, as well as published data from the medical literature for each country, ethics review was not required. The data collection and analysis techniques employed raised no risks pertaining to stigmatization, incrimination, discrimination, animal welfare, the environment, health, safety, security or other personal risks. No biological materials, cultural artifacts or associated traditional knowledge has been transferred out of any country. In preparing the manuscript, the authors reviewed relevant studies from all countries for which data were available, as described in Appendix A.

### Modeling of future COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, by vaccination rates and nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios-United States, April-September 2021 [^db9165f5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

TABLE
COVID-19 projection scenarios * — United States, March 27 – September 25, 2021

Abbreviations: M = million; NPI = nonpharmaceutical interventions; VE = vaccine effectiveness.

* **Scenarios were defined to control for uncertainty in two specific factors**: vaccination and adherence to NPIs with high/moderate and low levels for each. All scenarios included the B.1.1.7 variant and assumed that it was 50% more transmissible than previously circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. All other transmission and outcome assumptions were decided by the six modeling teams.

† VE is defined as vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease 2 weeks after administration, based on clinical trials. For 2-dose vaccines, the first VE represents protection 2 weeks after the 1st dose. Assumptions about effectiveness and affects on other outcomes (e.g. infection, hospitalization, and death) were left to the discretion of individual teams. Five teams assumed that VE against infection was the same as VE against symptomatic disease, and one team assumed lower VE against infection; details on model structure and assumptions are available at MIDAS Network COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub. Accessed April 19, 2021.

§ Vaccine doses reflect published manufacturing capacity estimates in the high vaccination scenarios and a continuation of the pace of vaccination observed at the end of March 2021 in the low vaccination scenarios.

¶ If the maximum level of vaccination specified (e.g. 75% or 90%) was reached in a population group during the projection period, models assume that no more vaccination occurs in that group. Past reported vaccine coverage up to March 27, 2021, can exceed these levels.

In all four scenarios, COVID-19 cases were projected to increase through May 2021 at the national level because of increased prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant and decreased NPI mandates and compliance (Figure 1). A sharp decline in cases was projected by July 2021, with a faster decline in the high-vaccination scenarios. Increases in hospitalizations and deaths (Figure 1), although more moderate, were also projected. A peak of 7,000–11,100 weekly deaths nationwide was projected in May (range = 5,382–15,677, which includes the central 50% of the projected distributions for all scenarios in the ensemble). The larger increases in cases relative to hospitalizations and deaths were attributable to higher vaccination coverage among groups with higher risk for severe COVID-19.

### Key design considerations for adaptive clinical trials: a primer for clinicians [^6bfafe77]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical trial simulations

Simulations can be used for any type of study design but are customarily used in adaptive designs owing to the multitude of trajectories. They are used to establish statistical and practical properties of adaptive trial designs. The risks of false positives (type I error) and false negatives (type II error) in adaptive trials are difficult (if not impossible) to evaluate with conventional methods. Regulatory agencies commonly require control of these errors, so they should be decision-rules, using metrics such as expected reduction in required sample size, time to completion, number of treatment failures avoided, risk of biased interim effect estimates, and robustness of the planned statistical analysis at trial termination. These can be particularly helpful for planning a realistic budget and timeline.

Because simulation is an iterative process (fig 2), we recommend starting with few"best case" and "worst case" scenarios based on current evidence or opinion, such as the two dose-response models in the case study (box 2). Exploring several scenarios can help quickly establish the likely efficiency gain from applying an adaptive design over a conventional design. Further, starting group discussions with only simple simulations can be important for engaging the clinical expertise of the investigators and help them to become more familiar with interpreting trial simulations. Then more comprehensive simulations extended to other scenarios can be shared for feedback. Statisticians should be engaged early in the planning phase. Trial simulations can be time consuming. Regulatory agencies should also be involved early in the planning phase.

Behavioral results — PE directly determines the degree of learning from feedback and adoption of false memories. a Subsequent accuracy in the recall study. For incorrectly answered Test1 questions (green), the greater the PE elicited by feedback, the more likely it was for that information to be incorporated into memory, as shown by average Test2 accuracy (left). Similarly, for correct Test1 answers (blue), false-feedback information was more likely to supplant an accurate memory recalled with medium confidence (medium PE) relative to one recalled with low confidence (low PE), as shown by the average percentage of false-feedback answers subsequently supplied in Test2 (right). b Subsequent confidence of updated memories in the recall study. PE also determined the confidence expressed in correct Test2 recollections, for questions initially answered erroneously in Test1. Thus, when successfully learning from feedback, incorrect Test1 answers stated with high confidence (high PE feedback) were associated with high-confidence correct answers in Test2 and vice versa (average Test2 confidence for incorrect-to-correct answers on the left). Similarly, for the subset of questions answered correctly and supplanted with false feedback, average Test2 confidence in the false memory was greater when initial confidence in the correct answer was higher (medium vs. low PE, on the right). c Summary of behavioral results in the recognition fMRI study. A strong positive relationship was observed between the degree of overall memory updating and PE arising from feedback, for questions answered incorrectly in Test1. This measure of learning combines both subsequent accuracy and confidence (see Supplementary Figure 3 for separate measures). Error bars represent SEM

### Key design considerations for adaptive clinical trials: a primer for clinicians [^af59780d]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Given the expected efficacy from phase I evidence (model 2), our sample size calculation showed that this could be achieved at a 20% one-sided alpha level with 40 patients to each arm. So the first interim analysis was planned after 80 patients with a decision-rule of stopping the trial if 90 mg did not show an effect at this time.

Phase IIb needed to tell us which two of the three remaining doses should be used. If model 1 was the most accurate, then efficacy increments would predominantly occur between 0 and 30 mg, so enrolling patients to 10 mg and 30 mg would be optimal for estimating dose-response (fig 3b). If efficacy increments predominantly occurred between 30 and 90 mg (model 2, enrolling patients to 30 mg and 60 mg would be optimal (fig 3c). Both models have 30 mg in common, so the second stage was designed to randomise an additional 100 patients in a ratio of 1:3:1 to receive 0, 30, and 90 mg, respectively. The decision rule implemented at the end of this stage was to pick 10 mg or 60 mg as a fourth arm depending on whether the efficacy of 30 mg efficacy was < 50% of the 90 mg efficacy.

At the start of the third stage a total of 180 patients had been randomised, with 60 patients randomised to each of the three arms (0 mg, 30 mg, and 90 mg). As the trial aim was to randomise 100 patients to each of the four final arms, an additional 40 patients would be randomised to the existing three arms and a 100 patients would be randomised to the fourth arm (either 10 mg or 60 mg)'. hus, at the third stage patients were randomised at 2:5:2:2 for model 1 or 2:2:5:2 for model 2 (fig 3d). The final analysis of 400 patients, as per preliminary simulations, be powered by > 80% to establish the median effective dose.

### Survival analysis part IV: further concepts and methods in survival analysis [^44d10549]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Where multiple events of the same type occur, it is common practice to use the first event only, but this ignores information. Three approaches to use this extra information are demonstrated using artificial patient data in Table 1

Table 1
Data layout under four recurrent event models with patient 1 having three events (at times 8, 12 and 26) and patient 2 having two events (at times 10, 18). In a conditional model, follow-up time is broken up into segments defined by events, with each patient being at risk for an i th event once the (i −1)th has occurred. Patient 1 in Table 1 is therefore assumed not to be at risk of a second event until the first has occurred, and so is at risk of experiencing this from time 8 until time 12. This model comes in two types: using either the time since the beginning of the study (type A) or the time since the previous event (type B). The marginal model, on the other hand, considers each event to be a separate process and, by definition, the time for each event starts at the beginning of follow-up for each patient. Here, all patients are considered to be at risk for all events, regardless of how many events they have previously had, and so patient 2, for example, was considered at risk of events 3 and 4 despite being lost to follow-up at the second. A third approach, called the independent increment model, is closest in spirit to a conditional model but takes no account of the number of previous events experienced by a patient, and for this reason the conditional and marginal models are often preferable. For each model, the data should be entered in the form of one patient record per event number as illustrated in Table 1.

### Does egg donation for mitochondrial replacement techniques generate parental responsibilities? [^e0c92ff1]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

Candidate parenthood

Giuliana Fuscaldo has proposed an amended causal account of parenthood that she calls 'candidate parenthood'. According to her, 'an account of how moral responsibility for children is generated should be consistent with at least the standard views about causation, consequences and moral responsibility'. Such an account seems reasonable as it is true that we are not morally responsible for everything we are causally connected to.

There are two commonly accepted conditions for establishing moral responsibility: foreseeability and freedom. Freedom: 'we are not responsible for actions that are unavoidable, or in situations where we are not free to do otherwise'. Foreseeability: we can be held accountable for the consequences of our actions 'if a reasonable person would have reason to expect that they might occur'. But, what does 'free' mean and who is a 'reasonable person'? Fuscaldo asserts that for an action to be free either an agent could have done otherwise or, if no alternative was possible, she reflectively sanctioned or appropriated her actions. Defining who is a reasonable person, on the other hand, is more complicated and would divert us from the present discussion. Nonetheless, we can confidently assert that all reasonable people understand a) that the creation of a child might be a consequence of us providing gametes for a reproductive endeavour and that b) a child might be created by an heterosexual couple having unprotected vaginal sex. At this point, we can assert that: ' we are morally accountable for the intended and unintended reasonably foreseeable consequences of our free actions '. When we apply these two conditions of moral responsibility to reproductive scenarios, we have what Fuscaldo calls candidate parenthood: 'any (free) action that reasonably foreseeably results in the birth of a child generates responsibilities for that child'. On this account, 'standard' gamete donation, where there is informed consent, generates parental responsibilities. It does so in that the creation of a child is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the donation of sperm or eggs.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^4483eea4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^3d475008]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The Puzzle of Missing Values

Missing items are common in questionnaires, resulting from different reasons. Typical examples are made by subjects who may inadvertently skip over some questions or may not have enough time to complete the test. Subjects would prefer not to answer if higher penalties are assigned to wrong than missing answers. Sometimes, some items are reserved to some respondents, for example, those who attempted in the past a given activity or have other characteristics such as sex or language.

When missing answers are found, the easiest and most practiced solution would be to transform scores into the percentage of the total score given by the answered items. For example, if a subject misses two items and totals seven on a questionnaire of 10 dichotomous items, the subject's "total score" is 87.5% (7/8). Note that this procedure is equivalent to the common "mean substitution" procedure, assigning the missing items the average score observed in the other items. This method relies on the (strong and unlikely) assumption that questionnaires' items are all indicators of the same quantity of the latent variable of interest and thus exchangeable (i.e. they all share the same difficulty level).

Table 2 provides an example showing why this solution does not work. Suppose 10 items again, each scored 0 or 1, aligned from left to right for increasing difficulty. The "x" symbol flags a missing response. According to traditional psychometrics, subjects A and B are assigned the same score. Subject C, providing two missing answers, is assigned a lower score. However, it seems that subject A's missing response should be given a higher score estimate, given that the subject passed five more difficult items. In contrast, subject B failed three items easier than the missed one. It is doubtful that subject C deserves a lower score than subject B: he/she passed four items more difficult than the missed items.

TABLE 2
Estimation of missing values, based on average scores across answered items

Presumably, subjects A and C were careless in their answers or had not enough time to complete the test.

This example is intentionally simplistic. The treatment of missing data is a complex research field, faced by the whole field of statistics. As far as psychometric statistics is concerned, RA provides a satisfactory answer to this problem.

### Evaluation of the US COVID-19 scenario modeling hub for informing pandemic response under uncertainty [^c4f2a818]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In each round, 4–9 modeling teams provided 12 to 52 weeks (depending on the round's goals) of probabilistic projections for each scenario for weekly cases, hospitalizations, and deaths at the state and national level. Projections were aggregated using the linear opinion pool method, which preserves variation between model projections. Open calls for projections have yielded participation from thirteen teams overall, with some teams providing projections only for certain rounds or states.

To assess the performance and added value of this large effort we compared SMH projections to real world epidemic trajectories. Whether scenario projections accurately matched those trajectories depends on both how well scenario definitions matched reality, and the calibration of the projections made conditional on those scenarios. Here we attempt to evaluate SMH performance on both criteria (Fig. 2), while acknowledging that there may be complementary evaluations more specific to the many ways SMH projections were used, ranging from informing national vaccine recommendations, to planning for future COVID-19 surges. We present performance results summarized across all SMH rounds, then synthesize these results to discuss performance of SMH projections across different phases of the pandemic.

Fig. 2
COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) process.

(top) Prospective SMH process: The SMH coordination team takes input from public health partners on key questions to design scenarios. Scenarios have a 2 × 2 structure (with the exception of Round 1), where two levels are specified along each of two axes of uncertainty or interventions, and all four combinations of these possibilities are considered (scenarios A-D). Scenarios are refined in discussion with modeling teams, after which teams each fit their model and make projections independently. Then, after quality checks, individual model projections are aggregated using linear opinion pool (i.e. probability averaging), and in discussion with the teams, key messages are determined. A report is shared with public health partners and projections are released on the public SMH website. (bottom) Retrospective evaluation: Evaluating the SMH effort involves comparing SMH scenario assumptions to reality, and comparing SMH projections to observations. Comparing scenarios to reality is used to identify the most plausible scenario-weeks, namely the set of "plausible" scenarios in projection weeks where scenario specifications about variants did not diverge from actual variant prevalence. Horizontal dotted lines represent emergence of an unanticipated variant.

### Lung ultrasound findings in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [^ddaf3a9c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Although chest CT is the standard imaging modality in early diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the use of lung ultrasound (US) presents some advantages over the use of chest CT and may play a complementary role in the workup of COVID-19. The objective of our study was to investigate US findings in patients with COVID-19 and the relationship of the US findings with the duration of symptoms and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From March 3, 2020, to March 30, 2020, consecutive patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test result for the virus that causes COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Lung US was performed, and the imaging features were analyzed. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the percentages of patients with each US finding between groups with different symptom durations and disease severity. RESULTS. Our study population comprised 28 patients (14 men and 14 women; mean age ± SD, 59.8 ± 18.3 years; age range, 21–92 years). All 28 patients (100.0%, 28/28) had positive lung US findings. The most common findings were the following: B-lines (100.0%, 28/28), consolidation (67.9%, 19/28), and a thickened pleural line (60.7%, 17/28). A thickened pleural line was observed in a higher percentage of patients with a longer duration of the disease than in those with a shorter duration of the disease, and pulmonary consolidations were more common in severe and critical cases than in moderate cases. CONCLUSION. Typical lung US findings in patients with COVID-19 included B-lines, pulmonary consolidation, and a thickened pleural line. In addition, our results indicate that lung US findings can be be used to reflect both the infection duration and disease severity.

Scenario 3 — moderate to severe features consistent with COVID-19 and high pre-test probability in resource-constrained settings — directs management based on rapid test availability. When a rapid COVID-19 test is available and positive, imaging is indicated with the note "Imaging Indicated * (CXR may be preferred)"; if the rapid test is negative, clinicians should "Monitor for worsening respiratory status", proceeding to "Imaging Indicated" when present and "Continued monitoring" when absent. If a rapid test is not available, "Imaging Indicated" with subsequent pathways including "Per Existing Guidelines" or, when "Alt Dx not suggested or features of COVID-19", proceeding to "Medical Triage" for "Decisions on disposition (monitoring environment), infection control, and management (positioning, ventilator)". The figure clarifies that moderate-to-severe features are "evidence of significant pulmonary dysfunction or damage", that high pretest probability reflects "high background prevalence of disease associated with community transmission", that the rapid test is "a point-of-care test with a turnaround time of less than 1 hour", and that the starred imaging step is "Lower priority if severely resource constrained, relative to question 10 or 11".

### Recommendations for measuring pulmonary nodules at CT: a statement from the Fleischner society [^e116a08d]. Radiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fleischner Society recommendations — measurement of the size of pulmonary nodules at computed tomography (CT) emphasize that accurate measurement is crucial to determine the risk for malignancy at baseline CT, to correctly allocate patients with nodules to available management algorithms, and to detect any change in size on follow-up CT images, and will mainly focus on manual diameter measurements, which are the most widely used technique. Size and growth can be determined by measuring diameter or volume; measurement of the nodule diameter with electronic calipers is currently the most widely used routine clinical approach, whereas volumetric nodule determination typically requires specialized software and is currently not widely used in routine clinical practice. The recommendations are organized around specific questions that are often raised in clinical practice and are presented together with corresponding answers, and they describe technical factors — such as section thickness, reconstruction algorithms, and display window settings — that affect measurements, along with observer-related factors and the variability introduced when serial follow-up examinations are performed with different CT units, different radiologists, and different technical acquisition and reconstruction parameters. The evidence grades for the recommendations are based on those developed by the American College of Chest Physicians.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 guideline — treatment of HFrEF stages C and D outlines a stepwise algorithm beginning with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): for HFrEF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% (Stage C), initiate ARNI in NYHA II–III (1), ACEI or ARB in NYHA I–IV (1), beta blocker (1), MRA (1), SGLT2i (1), and diuretics as needed (1); Step 1 medications "may be started simultaneously at initial (low) doses", or "may be started sequentially" "without need to achieve target dosing before initiating next medication", and doses "should be increased to target as tolerated". Patient scenarios guide additional therapy: NYHA III–IV in African American patients → hydral-nitrates (1); NYHA II–III; LVEF ≤ 35%; > 1 y survival → ICD (1); NYHA II–III, ambulatory IV; LVEF ≤ 35%; NSR and QRS ≥ 150 ms with LBBB → CRT-D (1). Reassessment follows to "Reassess symptoms, labs, health status, and LVEF"; if refractory HF (Stage D), proceed to referral for HF specialty care with options including, in select patients, durable MCS (1), cardiac transplant (1), palliative care (can be initiated before Stage D) (1), and investigational studies; continue GDMT with serial reassessment and optimize dosing, adherence and patient education, and address goals of care.

### Recommendations for tumor mutational burden assay validation and reporting: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology, college of American pathologists, and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer [^eb954e51]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2024). High credibility.

Tumor mutational burden (TMB) — definition, clinical associations, and need for standardization — is defined as the total number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations per megabase (Mb) of coding DNA sequenced and has been associated with a higher rate of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment response and longer survival in multiple cancer types. Currently, there exists variation in how TMB is calculated, reported, and interpreted, and there is no established standard for interpreting TMB values, including what values should be considered high or actionable and whether cutoffs should depend on tumor type, therapy, or assay. Although the US Food and Drug Administration approved pembrolizumab for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with TMB ≥ 10 mutations/Mb in 2020, standardization of TMB is expected to benefit clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories and should facilitate its implementation into routine clinical use; to date, PD-L1 protein expression, microsatellite instability/defective mismatch repair, and TMB have been approved as predictive biomarkers for ICIs in patients with cancer.

Study risk of bias assessment

Item 11. Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and whether they worked independently, and, if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process

Explanation: Users of reviews need to know the risk of bias in the included studies to appropriately interpret the evidence. Numerous tools have been developed to assess study limitations for various designs. However, many tools have been criticised because of their content (which may extend beyond assessing study limitations that have the potential to bias findings) and the way in which the items are combined (such as scales where items are combined to yield a numerical score) (see box 4). Reporting details of the selected tool enables readers to assess whether the tool focuses solely on items that have the potential to bias findings. Reporting details of how studies were assessed (such as by one or two authors) allows readers to assess the potential for errors in the assessments. Reporting how risk of bias assessments were incorporated into the analysis is addressed in Items #13e and #13f.

Box 4
Assessment of risk of bias in studies and bias due to missing results

Essential elements

Specify the tool(s) (and version) used to assess risk of bias in the included studies.
Specify the methodological domains/components/items of the risk of bias tool(s) used.
Report whether an overall risk of bias judgment that summarised across domains/components/items was made, and if so, what rules were used to reach an overall judgment.
If any adaptations to an existing tool to assess risk of bias in studies were made (such as omitting or modifying items), specify the adaptations.
If a new risk of bias tool was developed for use in the review, describe the content of the tool and make it publicly accessible.
Report how many reviewers assessed risk of bias in each study, whether multiple reviewers worked independently (such as assessments performed by one reviewer and checked by another), and any processes used to resolve disagreements between assessors.
Report any processes used to obtain or confirm relevant information from study investigators.
If an automation tool was used to assess risk of bias in studies, report how the automation tool was used (such as machine learning models to extract sentences from articles relevant to risk of bias), how the tool was trained, and details on the tool's performance and internal validation.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence quality assessment — Under GRADE, the quality of evidence is influenced by "study design, risk of bias, consistency, precision, directness, and publication bias", with randomized trials "presumed to be high in quality, unless compromised", and observational studies "considered to be low in quality by default but can be 'rated up' by demonstrating a large magnitude of effect, a dose–response, or results that would be even more compelling if plausible confounders are taken into account". Table factors for rating down include "Risk of bias", "Heterogeneity", "Imprecision", "Indirectness", and "Publication bias", and for rating up include "Magnitude of effect", "Dose–response", and "Plausible confounding effect", with example comments such as "Unclear allocation concealment, incomplete blinding, selective reporting of results, incomplete accounting of outcomes", "Inconsistent results across studies", "Confidence intervals range from substantial benefit to little or no benefit", and "Studies showing negative or conflicting results may exist but are missing from the literature".

### Assessment of chatGPT's performance on neurology written board examination questions [^f8b2c51d]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Figure 1
Neurology question stems. (A) Example of a question input followed by a correct answer response from the ChatGPT. (B) Example of a question input followed by an incorrect answer response from the AI (the correct answer is B). AI, artificial intelligence.

As question stems are multiple choice and accompanied by lettered options (eg, answer A, B, C, etc), if ChatGPT provided a written answer without referencing a specific alphabetic answer choice, the answer was read in full to determine if it was reflective of any of the multiple-choice options and scored accordingly. As these are multiple-choice questions, ChatGPT was asked to provide a single best answer.

Image-based questions from the question bank were deemed ineligible and not included in the assessment as ChatGPT only accepts text input.

The percentage of questions correctly answered was compiled and compared with an expected percentage of correct answers. For each question, BV provides a summary of the percentage of learners who answered that specific question correctly. The expected percentage was the average of the percentage of learners (neurology residents) who correctly answered each question averaged over all eligible questions. The expected number of correct answers by learners was calculated by multiplying the expected percentage of correct answers by the number of eligible questions. BV does not report the experience level of the neurology residents answering that specific question (ie, Post Graduate Year).

The overall performance percentile of ChatGPT's first attempt was calculated by the question bank, as compared with other BV learners, and recorded. The percentages of questions correctly answered by ChatGPT on the first attempt and over three attempts were compared with the performance quartiles as provided by BV. Percentages correct were also compiled by subject matter (ie, neuro-oncology, critical care, etc). This analysis aimed to provide an alternate way to compare ChatGPT's performance in relation to other learners using the question bank.

### The American Society of Addiction Medicine clinical practice guideline development methodology [^da9a9513]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

GRADE methodology in practice — weak recommendation categories — includes the following definitions and implications. "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence" has "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burdens", with interpretation "Weak recommendation; best action may differ depending on patient values", and implications that "For patients, most would want the recommended course of action but some would not depending on their circumstances and values. For clinicians, different choices will be appropriate for different patients and patient-centered decision making should be the goal based on patient values, preferences and circumstances. For policy makers, policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders". "Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence" may be supported by "RCTs with important limitations or strong evidence from observational studies" and shares the interpretation "Weak recommendation; best action may differ depending on patient values". "Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence" reflects "Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risks and burden may be closely balanced", is supported by "Observational studies or case series", and has the interpretation "Very weak recommendations; other alternatives may be equally reasonable".

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^2f33fbd5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Step diagrams for asthma management — Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group; Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years, Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years, and Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older. Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments, and a lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options. In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy. The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams; instead, these options are listed in Table IF, and the guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient management and the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^32a698ea]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline methodology — evidence selection prioritized acceptable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effectiveness, with prophylaxis populations excluding those who had reported COVID-19 infection; if acceptable RCTs were found, no additional non-randomized or non-comparative single-arm evidence was sought, while single-arm data were included only when a historical control event rate could be estimated and conflicts were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Reviewers used a standardized form to extract data, calculating risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous outcomes calculated either mean and standard deviation or standard mean difference; where applicable, data were pooled using a random effects model, with a fixed effects model for two or fewer trials or pooling of rates, and results were presented in RevMan forest plots. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; within GRADE, certainty could be reduced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias, and could be strengthened by large or very large effects, a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Outcomes used for decision-making may change as higher-quality direct evidence becomes available; for example, at the time of the first guideline clinical improvement outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation were not reported, only radiographic findings.

with childhood outcomes involve relatively historical cohorts selected from specific neonatal centers or networks and many do not adequately account for the myriad of confounders that tend to accompany prematurity. 5–7 Neonatal studies tend to focus heavily on neurodevelopmental assessment scores, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. The primary outcome was survival without severe NDI at 2 years' corrected age including severe developmental delay; inability to understand words or signs; inability to use more than 5 words or signs; being unable to walk, sit, or use hands; blindness; or uncorrectable hearing impairment. 22, 25 Secondary outcomes included gross and fine motor function, receptive and expressive communication, overall developmental progression, visual impairment, and hearing impairment.

Multiple logistic regression models estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs, adjusting for DAG-specified covariates. There are 12 neonatal operational delivery networks in England that coordinate care among tertiary and nontertiary neonatal units in each geographic region. Neonatal operational delivery network was included as a random effect in our regression models to account for heterogeneity between networks. 27 The threshold for statistical significance was a 2-sided P <.
05. Predictors of missing follow-up data were tested using forward selection. Independent predictors of missing follow-up data and covariates from regression models were included in the multiple imputation models.

These included brain injury presence, gestation, birthweight z score, birth year, maternal smoking in pregnancy, Index of Multiple Deprivation quintile, multimorbidity presence, maternal age, level of discharging unit, number of unit admissions, number of previous pregnancies, sex, receipt of breastmilk at discharge, and admitting neonatal operational delivery network. Increased risks of both receptive and expressive communication impairments across the spectrum of severity were seen after high-grade IVH. Infants with low-grade IVH had increased risks of some expressive communication impairments but not receptive impairments; however, the absolute risk difference between those with low-grade IVH and controls was small. Assessment of outcomes at 2 years has limitations; these are not long-term outcomes and are not necessarily fixed or predictive of later outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Reference case for high-quality cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) specifies that the reference case should adopt a health care sector perspective, with societal or modified societal perspectives reported when relevant data are available. The analytic horizon should be long enough to capture meaningful differences, and the reference case should consider adopting a lifetime analytic horizon with exceptions accompanied by a clear rationale. Comparators should include all appropriate comparator(s), and it is not appropriate to exclusively compare with high-cost or low-effectiveness options ("comparator gaming") because this would artificially lower the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costing should reflect actual amounts paid including out-of-pocket costs, and cost of drugs should reflect price after discounts or rebates in the base-case analysis, preferably the price available to the entirety or majority of the treatment-eligible population. Outcomes should be reported as life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Effectiveness and safety inputs may be drawn from high-quality randomized trials or high-quality observational studies that support causal inference, and effect sizes should be adjusted for adherence if there is substantial cross-over between the 2 groups. Future costs and benefits should be discounted at a rate of 3% per year, with a range of 2%-9% examined in sensitivity analyses. Results reporting should include the point estimate of the ICER and the probability of being cost-effective at the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold, and negative ICERs should not be reported; instead interventions should be reported as inferior/dominated or cost-saving/dominant as appropriate.

A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^19e247c8]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of results of hypothesis-generating interviews — Good judgment is required and a general approach assumes that a sufficient number of cases have been interviewed (e.g., at least eight); if none of the persons interviewed report a specific exposure, the hypothesis is no longer viable and most likely can be dropped from subsequent study; if more than 50% of persons interviewed report an exposure, that exposure should be studied further; if fewer than 50% of persons report an exposure, that exposure still might be of interest, particularly if it is difficult to recognize or unusual; implicated food items should have been eaten by most of the cases, but previously identified risk factors should not be ruled out just because fewer than half of cases reported the exposure, particularly if the exposure is unusual or difficult to recognize.

Noninvasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing — objectives and target population are defined: the primary role of subsequent testing is for evaluation of patients classified as intermediate risk according to the initial CDP evaluation; low-risk patients have a very low event rate and can usually be discharged without in-hospital testing, whereas high-risk patients should usually be admitted and initiated on guideline-based therapies if type 1 MI is considered; goals are accurate diagnosis or exclusion of clinically significant CAD or other cardiovascular conditions, risk-stratification to determine which patients require immediate treatment versus those for whom it can be delayed or deferred, and identification of abnormalities such as nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy requiring follow-up, underscoring the importance of consistent post-test reporting.

### Reply to: false conflict and false confirmation errors are crucial components of AI accuracy in medical decision making [^f5e9a0d3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, it is of critical importance to investigate the different errors when physicians make decisions with AI support especially with respect to the human expertise level. But besides the different error types, it is also important to take the correctly classified cases into account to get a complete picture of the situation. Further research is needed to investigate why those errors occur, whether certain subgroups of clinicians are at particular risk of committing certain error scenarios, and how this can be prevented. One potential approach is taking AI uncertainty into account by giving clinicians AI advice. Of special interest are furthermore cases, where AI and clinician are initially correct, but the clinician overwrites both, his original diagnosis and the XAI's advice (Table 1C; scenario iv), which need to be investigated carefully.
