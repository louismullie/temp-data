## Question

Should low tsh of 0.1 be treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a TSH of 0.1 mIU/L should be treated, and how to approach its management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical pattern and ruling out transient or non-thyroidal causes. Then, I should assess severity by whether the TSH is suppressed below 0.1 versus merely low, and verify that free T4 and free T3 are truly normal. Next, I will consider patient-specific risk factors such as age, cardiac disease, osteoporosis, menopausal status, and symptoms. After that, I should outline treatment options and when they are indicated versus observation. Finally, I need to plan monitoring and special-population exceptions like thyroid cancer or exogenous therapy, making sure the plan aligns with guidelines and the patient's preferences.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis before I anchor on treatment decisions. A TSH of 0.1 mIU/L fits subclinical hyperthyroidism only if free T4 and free T3 are normal, and only if this suppression is persistent rather than a single aberrant value, so I should repeat TSH in 3–6 months to verify persistence and exclude non-thyroidal illness, assay interference, or medication effects, because transient causes are common and TSH is highly variable in population samples [^112MTEEc] [^111kErfz] [^114fiaqB].

> Hold on, I should verify severity next, because the management hinges on it. TSH suppression to less than 0.1 mIU/L is more clinically significant than a low but detectable value of 0.1–0.4 mIU/L; progression to overt hyperthyroidism is more likely with fully suppressed TSH, and the cardiovascular and skeletal risks rise with lower TSH, so documenting where 0.1 sits in the lab's assay and in repeat testing matters for risk stratification [^115tmv2A] [^115XH3rG] [^114Zketr].

> I will now examine risk modifiers that shift the threshold toward treatment. Older age, particularly 65 years and above, increases risks of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and mortality in subclinical hyperthyroidism, so guidelines favor treatment when TSH is persistently less than 0.1 mIU/L in this group. Cardiac disease, osteoporosis, and postmenopausal status without bone-protective therapy further strengthen the case for therapy, and hyperthyroid symptoms, even mild, also support intervention in older adults [^112mMkjF] [^117McmWv] [^115XH3rG] [^113dZPzQ].

> Wait, let me verify the younger, asymptomatic scenario before jumping to treatment. In patients under 65 years with TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L, observation with periodic reassessment is acceptable, and for TSH less than 0.1 mIU/L, treatment may be considered but remains a weak recommendation with moderate-quality evidence; thus, shared decision-making is key, balancing uncertain benefit against potential harms from therapy and the possibility of spontaneous reversion to euthyroidism [^114Zketr] [^1111b4h5] [^111yYVBa].

> Next, I should review the concrete risks that make me cautious. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with a 24% increase in overall mortality, higher cardiovascular mortality, and increased atrial fibrillation risk, with stronger associations when TSH is less than 0.1 mIU/L; postmenopausal women face higher fracture risk and accelerated bone loss, and these risks are more pronounced with endogenous rather than exogenous causes, which reinforces the need to treat high-risk phenotypes [^115XH3rG] [^113dZPzQ] [^1135nS8E].

> Let me consider treatment options and how to match them to etiology. If treatment is indicated, the modality should mirror overt hyperthyroidism: radioactive iodine for toxic nodular disease, antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease, and surgery for compressive goiter or when malignancy is suspected; beta-blockers can palliate adrenergic symptoms while definitive therapy is planned, and the therapeutic goal is restoration of euthyroidism with normalization of TSH when feasible [^112SS3Re] [^112PqCVC] [^117PTwm9].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on levothyroxine or another thyroid hormone preparation. I should double-check for iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, because overtreatment is common and carries meaningful cardiovascular and skeletal harms, especially in older adults. In that case, dose reduction or temporary holding of thyroid hormone is the correct intervention rather than adding antithyroid drugs or ablation, and I should recheck TSH 6–8 weeks after any dose change to confirm correction [^114VB87i] [^112fJshf].

> I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit. For low-risk patients managed conservatively, repeating TSH every 6–12 months is reasonable, with earlier reassessment if symptoms or new comorbidities arise. For treated patients, I should follow thyroid function tests every 4–6 weeks until stable, then every 6–12 months, and I should also monitor for atrial fibrillation and bone health in those with ongoing suppression or high-risk profiles [^114Zketr] [^111CMEpL] [^113dZPzQ].

> Hold on, I should verify special contexts that change targets. In differentiated thyroid cancer, intentional TSH suppression is guideline-directed and risk-stratified, with targets below 0.1 mIU/L for high-risk disease and 0.1–0.5 mIU/L for intermediate risk, but this is a different risk–benefit calculus and does not apply to non-cancer subclinical hyperthyroidism. Likewise, pregnancy and pediatrics have distinct thresholds and management pathways that should not be conflated with adult nonpregnant care [^114ubHJu] [^116H8aa4] [^116S6YTF].

> Putting this together for a TSH of 0.1 mIU/L, I should first confirm persistence and exclude transient causes, then stratify by age, comorbidities, and symptoms. In patients 65 years or older, or in anyone with cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or hyperthyroid symptoms, I would favor treatment based on etiology; in younger, asymptomatic patients without risk factors, observation with periodic reassessment is reasonable, with a lower threshold to treat if TSH remains suppressed or drifts lower, and beta-blockers can be used symptomatically while the plan is finalized [^112mMkjF] [^114Zketr] [^1111b4h5].

A TSH of 0.1 mIU/L with normal free T4/T3 is subclinical hyperthyroidism. Treatment is **recommended for patients aged ≥ 65 years** [^112mMkjF] or those with cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms [^112mMkjF], as suppression at this level increases risks of atrial fibrillation [^1135nS8E], cardiovascular events [^115XH3rG], and fractures [^113dZPzQ]. For **asymptomatic patients < 65 years without risk factors**, observation with repeat TSH in 6–12 months is reasonable [^114Zketr], but treatment should be considered if TSH remains < 0.1 mIU/L or symptoms develop [^112mMkjF]. Management should be individualized, with etiologic workup (Graves', nodular disease, medication effects) [^115eGybG] and therapy tailored to cause and patient risk profile [^112SS3Re].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a **TSH below the reference range** with normal free T4 and T3 [^115nFvNi]. A TSH of 0.1 mIU/L represents **severe suppression** and is associated with increased risks of atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular mortality, and bone loss, particularly in older adults or those with comorbidities [^115XH3rG] [^113dZPzQ].

---

## Risks associated with persistently suppressed TSH

Persistent TSH suppression at 0.1 mIU/L carries **clinically meaningful risks**:

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure, especially in older adults [^1135nS8E] [^115XH3rG].

- **Skeletal risks**: Higher fracture risk and bone loss, particularly in postmenopausal women [^113dZPzQ].

- **Progression risk**: Higher likelihood of progression to overt hyperthyroidism compared to milder TSH suppression [^115tmv2A].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide clear recommendations on **when to treat** subclinical hyperthyroidism:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Age ≥ 65 years | Strongly recommend treatment [^112mMkjF] |
| Cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis | Strongly recommend treatment [^112mMkjF] |
| Symptoms of hyperthyroidism | Strongly recommend treatment [^112mMkjF] |
| Asymptomatic, age < 65 years, no risk factors | Observation with repeat TSH in 6–12 months [^114Zketr] |

---

Treatment options include antithyroid drugs (methimazole), radioactive iodine, or surgery, selected based on etiology, patient preference, and comorbidities [^112SS3Re].

---

## Factors influencing treatment decisions

Several factors **influence whether to treat** a TSH of 0.1 mIU/L:

- **Age**: Older patients have higher risks and benefit more from treatment [^117McmWv].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and atrial fibrillation favor treatment [^117McmWv] [^1135nS8E].

- **Symptoms**: Palpitations, anxiety, insomnia, or weight loss support treatment [^117McmWv].

- **Etiology**: Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease, or medication-induced suppression guide therapy choice [^112SS3Re] [^113Ak8pJ].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential given potential benefits and risks [^111trvZ4].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of treatment

Treatment can **normalize thyroid function**, reduce cardiovascular and skeletal risks, and alleviate symptoms [^1135nS8E] [^113dZPzQ]. However, it also carries risks — such as hypothyroidism, medication side effects, or procedural complications — that must be balanced against benefits [^112SS3Re].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential. For patients managed conservatively, **repeat TSH every 6–12 months** [^114Zketr]; for those treated, monitor thyroid function every 3–6 months initially, then annually, with periodic assessment of cardiovascular and skeletal health [^notfound].

---

A TSH of 0.1 mIU/L warrants **individualized management**: treat when age ≥ 65, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms are present [^117McmWv]; observe younger, asymptomatic, low-risk patients with repeat testing, but treat if suppression persists or symptoms develop [^114Zketr].

Clinical significance of SH — since SH is a mild form of hyperthyroidism, deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system and the skeleton might be expected in some patients. Regarding cardiac complications, one study found a 2.8-fold risk of atrial fibrillation in persons over age 60 years with SH, which has been confirmed in another population over age 65 years. Postmenopausal women with SH may have increased fracture rates even with only mildly suppressed serum TSH levels, with improvement in bone mineral density with therapy of SH with antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine in controlled but nonrandomized intervention studies, and preliminary data suggest an increase in bone turnover and lower bone density in premenopausal women with SH.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: joint British thyroid association / society for endocrinology consensus statement [^1155V2B7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focussed on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasises several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimised aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, a trial of liothyronine/levothyroxine combined therapy may be warranted. The decision to start treatment with liothyronine should be a shared decision between patient and clinician. However, individual clinicians should not feel obliged to start liothyronine or to continue liothyronine medication provided by other health care practitioners or accessed without medical advice, if they judge this not to be in the patient's best interest.

### A stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^115eGybG]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Methods

English-language articles regarding clinical management of subclinical hyperthyroidism published between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed.

Results

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is encountered on a daily basis in clinical practice. When evaluating patients with a suppressed serum thyrotropin value, it is important to exclude other potential etiologies such as overt triiodothyronine toxicosis, drug effect, nonthyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism. In younger patients with mild thyrotropin suppression, it is acceptable to perform testing again in 3 to 6 months to assess for persistence before performing further diagnostic testing. In older patients or patients with thyrotropin values less than 0.1 mIU/L, diagnostic testing should proceed without delay. Persistence of thyrotropin suppression is more typical of nodular thyroid autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild Graves disease frequently resolve spontaneously. The clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism, such as atrial dysrhythmia, accelerated bone loss, increased fracture rate, and higher rates of cardiovascular mortality, are dependent on age and severity. The decision to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism is directly tied to an assessment of the potential for clinical consequences in untreated disease. Definitive therapy is generally selected for patients with nodular autonomous function, whereas antithyroid drug therapy is more appropriate for mild, persistent Graves disease.

Conclusion

The presented stepwise approach to the care of patients presenting with an isolated suppression of serum thyrotropin focuses on the differential diagnosis, a prediction of the likelihood of persistence, an assessment of potential risks posed to the patient, and, finally, a personalized choice of therapy.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### Graves' disease: moving forwards [^113EvYYB]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Management

Key considerations when managing a young person with GD are summarised in box 1. The general approach involves a course of ATD medication. If this is not possible or if this fails to result in remission, definitive treatment (RAI or thyroidectomy) needs to be considered. Ultimately, the main objectives when treating GD are restoration of euthyroidism in the short term and preservation of endogenous thyroid function in the long term without the need for medication. Unfortunately, with the currently available therapies, this is not a realistic prospect for many children.

Box 1
Key points when managing paediatric Graves' disease

Use CBZ or MMI, avoid PTU.
CBZ is commenced in a dose of 0.25–0.75 mg/kg/day (0.15–0.5 mg/kg/day MMI).
A dose at the lower end of this range will be appropriate if thyroid hormone excess is at the less profound end of the spectrum.
DT is the preferred method of ATD treatment, although BR may be helpful if there is persistent relapse on small-dose ATD.
Beta-blockade is recommended in patients presenting with signs of marked thyroid hormone excess.
An FBC and LFTs should be checked at baseline.
Be guided by thyroid hormone concentrations (not TSH) in first few months to alter dosage.
Counsel families about the risk of excessive weight gain when ATD is commenced.
A TRAb level should be checked before antithyroid medication is stopped — remission is much more likely in the context of a normal value.
ATD is normally administered for at least 3 years. Longer courses (≥ 5 years) should be considered if the likelihood of remission is low.
Patients who relapse after a course of ATD can return to ATD or choose definitive treatment (RAI/surgery).
If there are academic concerns, then consider liaising with the child's school to ensure specific support is provided as required.

Upper limit of normal TSH determination — The reference range of a given laboratory should determine the upper limit of normal for a third generation TSH assay; the normal TSH reference range changes with age; and if an age-based upper limit is not available in an iodine sufficient area, an upper limit of normal of 4.12 should be considered (Grade A, BEL 1).

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^114ubHJu]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115nFvNi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^116H8aa4]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in children — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets and risks: Some experts recommend initial TSH suppression to < 0.1 mIU/L followed by relaxation to 0.5 mIU/L following remission of DTC, but the panel concludes that the initial TSH goal should be tied to an ATA Pediatric Risk level and current disease status, and in children without evidence of disease the TSH can be maintained at the low-normal range after an appropriate period of surveillance. The actual risks of TSH suppression in children have been poorly studied; extrapolating from Graves' disease, potential risks include growth acceleration, advanced bone age, early onset puberty, and reduced bone mineral content.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^113zpjp4]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 63 — TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) testing: In ATA low-risk and intermediate-risk patients who have had remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy and negative cervical ultrasound (US), serum Tg should be measured at 6–18 months on thyroxine therapy with a sensitive Tg assay (< 0.2 ng/mL), or after TSH stimulation to verify absence of disease (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Repeat TSH-stimulated Tg testing is not recommended for low- and intermediate-risk patients with an excellent response to therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent TSH-stimulated Tg testing may be considered in patients with an indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, or structural incomplete response following additional therapies or a spontaneous decline in Tg on thyroid hormone therapy over time in order to reassess response to therapy and disease status (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent stimulated testing is rarely needed for those with NED, and the use of sensitive Tg assays may obviate TSH stimulation when Tg on LT4 treatment is below 0.1–0.2 ng/mL.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism in children [^112Hx6Qi]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) below the lower limit of the reference range in the presence of normal free T4 and free T3 levels. Depending on the degree of TSH suppression, SH could be defined as mild (TSH, 0.1–0.45 mU/L) or severe (TSH < 0.1 mU/L). Patients with SH are often asymptomatic when symptoms are present, they are similar to the symptoms in patients with overt hyperthyroidism, although they are usually milder. The management of the SH is uncertain and should be individualized. We present this review after an extensive literature search and long-standing clinical experience. This review provides the prevalence, causes, clinical presentation, investigation, and therapeutic approach of SH in children.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules – 2016 update [^116ux6ng]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Medium credibility.

Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) prestimulation with radioiodine for nontoxic goiter — the use of rhTSH is currently off-label; radioiodine uptake is doubled with rhTSH doses as small as 0.03 to 0.1 mg, and an interval of at least 24 hours between rhTSH stimulation and radioiodine administration seems optimal. In combination with radioiodine, rhTSH decreases goiter volume 50 to 56% more than nonstimulated therapy and can improve respiratory function, though patient satisfaction effects are unclear. The main adverse effect is transient, dose-dependent hyperthyroidism starting 4 to 8 hours after injection, peaking after 24 to 48 hours, and normalizing within 3 weeks; with rhTSH doses of ≥ 0.1 mg, thyroid hormone levels are maintained within the reference range in most patients. Acute dose-related thyroid swelling has been shown, with an increase in mean thyroid volume of 35% with 0.9 mg rhTSH, 24% with 0.3 mg rhTSH, and 10% with 0.1 mg rhTSH; therefore, the optimal rhTSH dose seems to be ≤ 0.1 mg.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^111sVXcR]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspeciality physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Thyroid Association in association with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to develop the text and a series of specific recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis.

Conclusions

One hundred evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^115ZzzzT]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

### Association of thyrotropin suppression with survival outcomes in patients with intermediate-and high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer [^114Mbsro]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Currently accepted therapy for patients with intermediate- or high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is surgery followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. Radioactive iodine therapy is performed under either endogenous or exogenous stimulation of thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH), aimed at achieving a thyrotropin level exceeding 30 mIU/L. Thyrotropin stimulation leads to overexpression of thyroid differentiation genes such as sodium-iodide symporter, resulting in increased RAI uptake, enhancing the tumoricidal effect. The long-term management of DTC includes levothyroxine therapy aimed not only at appropriate physiologic thyroid hormone replacement in thyroidectomized patients, but also at suppressing thyrotropin release from the pituitary gland by supraphysiologic levothyroxine doses. A recommended thyrotropin suppression goal in patients with locally advanced or metastatic DTC is less than 0.1 mIU/L as some preclinical evidence suggests that thyrotropin is a growth stimulus for DTC cells.

Table 9 — response criteria after initial therapy based on type of intervention categorize differentiated thyroid cancer response and specify thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) goals as follows: Excellent response after radioiodine (RAI) ablation requires thyroglobulin (Tg) thresholds with "Nonstimulated Tg < 0.2 or stimulated Tg < 1 and negative imaging", while without RAI ablation it is "Nonstimulated Tg < 2.5"; after hemithyroidectomy, an excellent response is defined by imaging/biopsy findings ("Normal or low-risk nodules… AND no abnormal lymph nodes on imaging"). Indeterminate response after RAI ablation allows "nonstimulated Tg 0.2–1 or stimulated Tg 1–10 or stable/ declining TgAb levels", and without RAI ablation allows "nonstimulated Tg 2.5–5, or stable/ declining TgAb levels"; after hemithyroidectomy this column is listed as "N/A". Biochemically incomplete response after RAI ablation is "Non-stimulated Tg > 1 or stimulated Tg > 10 or increasing TgAb levels and negative imaging", and without RAI ablation is "Nonstimulated Tg > 5 or increasing TgAb levels and negative imaging"; after hemithyroidectomy this column is "N/A". Structurally incomplete response in all intervention types requires "Structural evidence of disease (suspicious imaging or biopsy proven local or distant metastatic disease)". TSH goals are "TSH within normal reference range" for excellent and "TSH within normal reference range" (footnote b) for indeterminate, and "TSH below normal reference range" (footnote c) for biochemically and structurally incomplete responses, respectively, with footnotes noting uncertainty about optimal targets.

### Optimal thyrotropin level: normal ranges and reference intervals are not equivalent [^111fnSEQ]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

This paper marshals arguments in support of a narrower, optimal or true normal range for thyrotropin (TSH) of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L, based on clinical results and recent information on the relatively stable and narrow range of values in patients without thyroid disease. The terminology used for TSH results is clarified in an attempt to help physicians interpret, explain, and respond to TSH test results for their patients.

Postoperative thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement — Good Practice Statement and kinetics: "Measurement of serum Tg on one occasion 6–12 weeks after lobectomy while on a normal TSH may be helpful to ensure that it is not unexpectedly elevated; however, a specific cut off value is uncertain". Tg is described as "a fundamental tool for evaluating thyroid cancer tumor burden, assessing response to treatment, and monitoring for cancer recurrence", and "A serum Tg level is recommended in the postoperative period to inform treatment decisions". Initial testing timing was informed by data "at multiple time points up to 1 year after surgery", with the "median time to reach the nadir serum Tg… was 12 weeks". Tg can be assessed as basal or TSH-stimulated, the latter achieved by withdrawal or rhTSH "allowing the endogenous TSH to increase (usually > 30 mIU/mL) or administering exogenous recombinant human TSH (rhTSH)", and "a benefit of stimulated over basal Tg has not been consistently shown".

### Thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression in low-risk papillary thyroid cancer: a large-scale retrospective analysis of real-world data [^111uEr1X]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with a very fast-growing incidence worldwide, with approximately 600,000 cases newly diagnosed per year, among whom over 500,000 (> 95%) are papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). In 2009, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines proposed a widely-used risk stratification system for differentiated thyroid cancer to predict the risk of disease recurrence and/or persistence, which was further modified in the 2015 updated version. With the widespread use of ultrasonography, the vast majority of newly diagnosed thyroid cancer cases are actually low-risk PTC, especially papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC, refers to PTC ≤ 1 cm in diameter). Therefore, the management of low-risk PTC concerns millions of survivors and is therefore of great clinical importance.

Experimental and clinical data have demonstrated that thyroid follicular cell proliferation is dependent on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, or thyrotropin), thereby providing the rationale of TSH suppression in the management of PTC. Traditionally, TSH suppression is recommended for all PTC patients following surgery with the goal varying from different guidelines. The 2015 ATA guidelines recommended that low-risk patients should be maintained with a low-normal TSH level between 0.5 and 2.0 mU/L, and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines held the same view. On the other hand, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines had a different opinion, they recommended a TSH level of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for low-risk patients with biochemical evidence (Tg-positive), while a normal range is allowed for Tg-negative low-risk patients. However, relevant recommendations of all these guidelines are based on historical, small-size, and indirect evidence, making TSH suppression highly empirical and controversial in these patients. It is well recognized that TSH suppression may cause harms related with iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, anxiety, depression and even poor sleep function. Therefore, the use of TSH suppressive therapy in low-risk PTC must be weighed against pros and cons.

Currently, there is still a lack of direct large-scale research evaluating the prognostic impact of TSH suppression in low-risk PTC. Here, we established a large retrospective cohort of PTC patients with high-quality follow-up in two Chinese large-volume hospitals. Based on this resource, we aim to provide a convincing evidence for this clinical controversy with real-world data of more than 10,000 patients.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — how to treat if chosen (Recommendation 77): If SH is to be treated, the treatment should be based on the etiology of the thyroid dysfunction and follow the same principles as outlined for the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Supporting text notes that the treatment of SH is similar to overt hyperthyroidism, that RAI is appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, and that there are no data to inform whether elderly patients would benefit from pretreatment with ATDs before RAI, with the risks of ATD therapy potentially outweighing any small benefit.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Management aspects of medical therapy in Grave's disease [^114mrL9g]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Subclinical Hyperthyroidism

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is defined with TSH levels below normal range with normal FT4 and FT3. Prevalence of SCH globally is 0.7% to 1.4%. SCH can progress to overt hyperthyroidism in 8% of patients by 1 year and 26% of patients by 5 year. In populations with sufficient iodine intake, GD is the cause of 40% of cases of SCH. Baseline serum level of TSH, not cause of disease, is the best predictor of progression of subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism.

Treatment of SCH is recommended when serum thyrotropin levels are < 0.1 mU/L, in persons aged > 65 years and postmenopausal women due to association with adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, bone loss, fractures, and dementia.MMI remains an effective and safe choice for SCH due to GD. For asymptomatic individuals aged < 65 years and a TSH level between 0.1 mIU/L and the lower limit of normal, observation is generally appropriate.

Thyroid Storm

Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism that presents with multisystem involvement and is associated with a significant mortality rate of 8% to 25%. Goals of treatment are to control increased adrenergic tone, achieve euthyroidism quickly and safely by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, block thyroid hormone release, inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormone (Table 4).–

Although all ATDs decrease thyroid hormone synthesis, the current ATA guidelines recommend initiating PTU in patients with thyroid storm as it blocks T4 to T3 conversion. However, recent data suggest no difference in cost, mortality, and adverse events for those treated with PTU versus MMI.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1111mzom]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 59 — initial thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets after initial therapy: For high-risk thyroid cancer patients, initial TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For intermediate-risk patients, initial TSH suppression to 0.1–0.5 mU/L is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For low-risk patients after remnant ablation with undetectable serum thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH may be maintained at the lower end of the reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) while continuing surveillance for recurrence, with similar recommendations for those without remnant ablation and undetectable Tg (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). For low-risk patients after remnant ablation with low-level serum Tg, TSH may be maintained at or slightly below the lower limit of normal (0.1–0.5 mU/L) while surveillance continues, with similar recommendations for those without remnant ablation (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). For low-risk patients who have undergone lobectomy, TSH may be maintained in the mid to lower reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) while surveillance is continued, and thyroid hormone therapy may not be needed if patients can maintain serum TSH in this target range (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111kErfz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — natural history and treatment evidence indicates that subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 2% of the U.S. population, one quarter of persons revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time, and an estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop "overt" hyperthyroidism, whereas persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress; the USPSTF did not identify any studies evaluating benefits of treating subclinical hyperthyroidism on clinical health outcomes, and except for 1 small (n = 67) nonrandomized study of bone mineral density, no evidence was found on effects of treating "overt" hyperthyroidism.

### Difficulties in selecting an appropriate neonatal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) screening threshold [^116eLFuc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The UK Newborn Screening Programme Centre recommends that a blood spot thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) cut-off of 10 mU/l is used to detect congenital hypothyroidism (CHT). As the value used varies from 5 to 10 mU/l, we examined the implications of altering this threshold.

Methods

Our regional blood spot TSH cut-off is 6 mU/l. Positive or suspected cases were defined as a TSH > 6 mU/l throughout the study period (1 April 2005 to 1 March 2007). All term infants (> 35 weeks) whose first TSH was 6–20 mU/l had a second TSH measured. The biochemical details of infants with a TSH between 6.1 and 10.0 mU/l and then > 6 mU/l on second sampling were sent to paediatric endocrinologists to determine approaches to management.

Results

148 of 65 446 infants (0.23%) had a first blood spot TSH > 6.0 mU/l. 120 were term infants with 67 of these (0.1% of all infants tested) having a TSH between 6.1 and 10.0 mU/l and 53 a TSH > 10.0 mU/l. Of the 67 term infants with a TSH between 6.1 and 10.0 mU/l on initial testing, four continued to have a TSH > 6 mU/l. One with a TSH > 10 mU/l and one infant with a TSH < 10 mU/l on the second blood spot have been diagnosed with CHT. The survey of endocrinologists highlighted significant differences in practice.

Conclusions

A reduced threshold of 6 mU/l will increase the number of false positive term infants by 126%, but abnormalities of thyroid function requiring treatment will be detected. We suspect that the additional expense involved in setting a lower threshold is justified.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^117PTwm9]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism management — surgery for TMNG or TA — If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG or TA, patients with overt hyperthyroidism should be rendered euthyroid prior to the procedure with methimazole pretreatment (in the absence of allergy to the medication), with or without beta-adrenergic blockade, and preoperative iodine should not be used in this setting. If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG, near- total or total thyroidectomy should be performed, and surgery for TMNG should be performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon. If surgery is chosen as the treatment for TA, an ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy, or isthmusectomy if the adenoma is in the thyroid isthmus, should be performed, and we suggest that surgery for TA be performed by a high-volume surgeon. Following thyroidectomy for TMNG, we suggest that serum calcium or intact parathyroid hormone levels be measured, and that oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation be administered based on these results. Methimazole should be stopped at the time of surgery for TMNG or TA, and Betaadrenergic blockade should be slowly discontinued following surgery. Following surgery for TMNG, thyroid hormone replacement should be started at a dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 mcg/lb or 1.7 mcg/kg) and age, with elderly patients needing somewhat less, and TSH should be measured every 1–2 months until stable, and then annually. Following surgery for TA, TSH and estimated free T4 levels should be obtained 4–6 weeks after surgery, and thyroid hormone supplementation started if there is a persistent rise in TSH above the normal range.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1114h4Xn]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma (ATA) — risk-stratified initial staging, TSH suppression targets, and surveillance for patients with no evidence of disease: Low risk (disease grossly confined to the thyroid with N0/Nx or incidental N1a) uses Tg for initial postoperative staging, has a TSH goal of 0.5–1.0 mIU/L, and surveillance with ultrasound (US) at 6 months postoperatively and then annually × 5 years plus Tg on levothyroxine (LT4) every 3–6 months for 2 years and then annually. Intermediate risk specifies TSH-stimulated Tg and diagnostic 123I scan in most patients, a TSH goal of 0.1–0.5 mIU/L, US at 6 months postoperatively then every 6–12 months for 5 years and less frequently thereafter, Tg on LT4 every 3–6 months for 3 years and then annually, and to consider TSH-stimulated Tg ± diagnostic 123I scan in 1–2 years in patients treated with 131I. High risk includes regionally extensive or locally invasive disease and uses TSH-stimulated Tg and diagnostic 123I scan in all patients, targets TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, and surveillance with US at 6 months postoperatively then every 6–12 months for 5 years and less frequently thereafter, with Tg on LT4 every 3–6 months for 3 years and then annually, and TSH-stimulated Tg ± diagnostic 123I scan in 1–2 years in patients treated with 131I. These TSH goals are initial targets for TSH suppression and should be adapted to the patient's known or suspected disease status, and in ATA Pediatric Intermediate- and High-risk patients who have no evidence of disease after 3–5 years of follow-up, the TSH can be allowed to rise to the low normal range.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112JaoNb]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy — outcome evidence and degree of suppression: A meta-analysis supported efficacy of TSH suppression therapy in preventing major adverse clinical events with RR = 0.73 (CI 0.60–0.88), p < 0.05. A large RCT from Japan showed disease-free survival was equivalent with normal TSH (0.4–5 mU/L) compared with LT4 suppression therapy (TSH < 0.01 mU/L). Retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L may improve outcomes in high-risk patients, with no such evidence of benefit in low-risk patients, and higher degrees of suppression to < 0.03 mU/L may offer no additional benefit. In a prospective, nonrandomized cohort study of 2936 patients, overall survival improved significantly when TSH was suppressed to undetectable levels in NTCTCSG stage III or IV disease and to the subnormal to undetectable range in stage II disease; however, there was no incremental benefit from suppressing to undetectable levels in stage II and suppression of TSH was not beneficial in NTCTCSG stage I disease.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — mortality and cardiovascular outcomes show increased risks associated with SH. An individual-level meta-analysis concluded that SH confers a 24% increased risk of overall mortality. Cardiovascular mortality is increased, with hazard ratios of 1.52 and 1.29 from two meta-analyses, and the risk was greater with TSH < 0.1 mU/L compared with 0.1–0.4 mU/L. A large cohort of 26,707 people followed for 12 years also reported increased cardiovascular mortality with SH, and SH subjects appear to be at particular risk for heart failure, especially older subjects and those with lower TSH levels.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^114oaquZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — Postoperative levothyroxine to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is considered optimal for higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, and the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring suppression to individual risk. For known residual carcinoma or high risk of recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mIU/L; for disease-free, low-risk patients, TSH should be maintained at the normal range; and for low-risk patients with imaging negative but concerning Tg, TSH should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mIU/L. Potential toxicities include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis; therefore, an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended when TSH is chronically suppressed, and reports do not suggest altered bone mineral density in patients receiving levothyroxine.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^115DjnDr]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently < 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be strongly considered in all individuals ≥ 65 years of age, in postmenopausal women not on estrogens or bisphosphonates, in patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis, and in individuals with hyperthyroid symptoms (2/++0). Persistent SH is defined as a TSH level of < 0.1 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period, and the underlying thyroid disorder should be diagnosed and is most commonly TMNG, GD, or TA. The task force elected to recommend treatment of all SH patients younger than 65 years of age with persistent TSH < 0.1 mU/L and hyperthyroid symptoms, while noting insufficient data for or against treatment of younger persons or premenopausal women with serum TSH < 0.1 mU/L.

### Thyroid hormone suppression therapy [^1174Uefr]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression therapy is designed to lower serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels using doses of thyroid hormone in excess of what would normally be required to maintain a euthyroid state. The basis of this therapy is the knowledge that TSH is a growth factor for thyroid cancer, so that lower serum TSH levels might be associated with decreased disease activity. However, clinical studies have not documented improved outcomes with TSH suppression, except in patients with the most advanced disease. Furthermore, there are a number of negative outcomes related to aggressive thyroid hormone therapy, including osteoporosis, fracture, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a graded approach to TSH suppression is recommended by the American Thyroid Association, based on initial risk and ongoing risk assessment.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

The authors propose that the first assessment following initial therapy should occur within 3 months after resection, with an example that a patient at high risk of recurrence may be treated with a lower dose if the serum Tg is not detectable on a highly sensitive assay (e.g., lower limit of detection 0.1 ng/mL), in the absence of TgAb during levothyroxine (LT4) administration, and if neck ultrasonography does not reveal residual disease after operation; conversely, an elevated Tg level might prompt chest imaging to identify metastases.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

Graves' disease persistent hyperthyroidism after radioactive iodine (RAI) — When hyperthyroidism due to GD persists after 6 months following RAI therapy, retreatment with RAI is suggested, and in selected patients with minimal response 3 months after therapy additional RAI may be considered (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Response to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland, thyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms; the goal of retreatment is to control hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid, patients with persistent, suppressed TSH with normal total T3 and free T4 may not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely, and in the small percentage refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be considered.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112uyPJK]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

Active monitoring during TSH suppressive therapy

Question 7. The indication for active monitoring under TSH suppressive therapy

Active monitoring under TSH suppressive therapy is commonly suitable for the following situations: asymptomatic unresectable metastatic disease; low tumor burden; stable or minimally progressive disease; low likelihood of developing rapidly progressive disease in a short term; and no adverse impact of the disease burden. A retrospective study revealed that patients with non-RAI-avid pulmonary metastatic PTC had a median Tg change rate of 0.03 ng/mL/month during TSH suppressive therapy alone, and median progression-free survival (PFS) reached 54.4 months. Meanwhile, some studies argued that excessive TSH suppression may not be necessary in improving outcomes in patients with high-risk DTC and could potentially increase cardiac and bone-related risks. Sub-suppressive TSH therapy (0.1 to 0.5 mIU/L) may be more appropriate in such case.

Recommendation 9

For patients with RAIR-DTC whose disease is stable or minimally progressive, active monitoring under TSH suppressive therapy is recommended (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Question 8. Degree of TSH suppression and adjustment of the thyroid hormone dosage

In patients with RAIR-DTC, initial TSH suppression to below 0.1 mIU/L is recommended, particularly for those with residual RAI-avid lesions. However, treatment adjustment is allowed considering the potential adverse effects of TSH suppression. Furthermore, regular monitoring of TSH is recommended for patients receiving TKIs. Potential mechanisms include TKI-induced diarrhea leading to poor absorption of thyroid hormones and inhibition of monocarboxylate transporter 8-mediated thyroid hormones uptake, thereby diminishing their suppressive effect on the pituitary gland.

Recommendation 10

For patients with RAIR-DTC, TSH levels should be maintained below 0.1 mIU/L (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 11

Surveillance and close monitoring during TSH suppressive therapy are recommended for patients with RAIR-DTC, and timely adjustments of the thyroid hormone dosage are essential to maintain appropriate TSH levels (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression and outcomes in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) — evidence synthesis: A meta-analysis from 2002 described 4714 patients, including 2880 on TSH suppression defined as below 0.4–0.5 mIU/L, and reported reduced major adverse clinical events with suppression (RR = 0.73 [CI 0.60–0.88]; p < 0.05). In a single-center study of 366 consecutive patients with a median follow-up of 8.85 years, a threshold of 2 mIU/L differentiated disease-free survival from recurrence or death. In 141 patients followed a mean of 95 months, constantly suppressed TSH (TSH ≤ 0.05 mIU/L) was associated with longer recurrence-free survival than when TSH levels were always ≥ 1 mIU/L. In 157 patients with distant metastases, improved thyroid cancer-specific survival occurred with mean TSH ≤ 0.1 mIU/L versus non-suppressed, with no further improvement with < 0.03 mIU/L compared with ≤ 0.1 mIU/L. Countervailing data include a cohort of 867 intermediate- and high-risk patients showing no association with progression-free survival at 5 years and a series of 166 patients with pre-ablation Tg < 1 ng/mL in whom recurrence risk did not differ across TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, 0.1–0.5 mIU/L, 0.5–2.0 mIU/L, or > 2.0 mIU/L during a median follow-up of 0.5–8.5 years. A 32-study literature review and meta-analysis also found that progression-free, disease-free, and relapse-free survival were not significantly different between TSH suppression and non-suppression groups.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults [^112oPhzR]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Thyroid dysfunction is common in older adults and poses diagnostic and management challenges for clinicians. In this narrative review, we present published data focusing on special considerations in the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in older adults. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted from January 2000 to December 2024 to identify pertinent articles in English for this narrative review. Results: Due to significant cardiovascular risk if untreated, both overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism should be treated in older adults. Findings from observational studies do not support treating older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with a thyrotropin (TSH) < 7 mIU/L. However, observational data have demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and stroke in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 7.0–9.9 mIU/L and of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure in those with TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, suggesting levothyroxine treatment in these individuals should be considered. Data from clinical trials failed to show improvement with levothyroxine in hypothyroidism symptoms or fatigue in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with placebo. Over- and under-replacement with thyroid hormone is common and should be avoided, as population-based studies have shown associations with adverse cardiovascular and skeletal events. Subclinical hyperthyroidism with a TSH < 0.1 mIU/L should be treated in older individuals as it has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and bone density loss based on observational data. Randomized controlled trials have shown that long-term low-dose methimazole is a viable alternative to radioactive iodine in older adults with hyperthyroidism. Conclusions: A personalized approach should be undertaken in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults. Multiple factors should be considered, including physiological age-related changes in thyroid function, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. Care should be taken to maintain euthyroidism in order to avoid adverse events.

### The management of subclinical hyperthyroidism by thyroid specialists [^1126fhy5]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a relatively common condition for which prospectively derived evidenced-based management guidelines do not exist. We have conducted a case-based mail survey to solicit opinions from members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) about various issues that arise in the management of patients with this disorder. The survey was completed and returned by 185 of 300 (62%) of the original survey recipients. Four hypothetical cases varying in age, thyrotropin (TSH) level and underlying etiology were presented. The majority of respondents recommended further evaluation of all cases, most commonly choosing a radioactive iodine uptake (42%-71%), thyroid scan (39%-68%) and antithyroid (TPO/Tg) antibodies (49%-55%) as the additional tests to be ordered. The large majority (84%) recommended observation rather than active treatment for a young patient with a low but detectable serum TSH level. A small majority also recommended observation alone for a young woman with an undetectable serum TSH level (58%) and for an older woman with a low but detectable serum TSH value (63%). However, the majority (66%) favored treating an older woman with an undetectable serum TSH. When treatment was advised in the patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, the respondents strongly favored anti-thyroid drugs when the etiology was Graves' disease and radioactive iodine when the etiology was toxic nodular thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate evidence-based guidelines, it is hoped that this survey of expert opinions may provide useful guidance for physicians providing care for patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) preparation — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation and randomized protocol: TSH stimulation is required before RAI ablation/therapy or scanning, and it is recommended that a TSH level > 30 mIU/L be established; stimulation can be achieved by either thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant human TSH (rhTSH). In an open-label, single-center study with 291 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer randomized to withdrawal of LT4 for 4 weeks (n = 89), withdrawal of LT4 for 4 weeks with substitution of LT3 for the first 2 weeks (n = 133), or recombinant human TSH (with withdrawal of LT4 for a few days from the time of the first rhTSH injection to radioisotope administration) (n = 69), all patients received 1.1 GBq (30 mCi) RAI with a low-iodine diet pre-ablation for 2 weeks, and the pre-ablation TSH was > 30 in all patients. The primary outcome, the rate of successful remnant ablation at 12 months, did not differ between groups (range, 91.0–91.7%), and questionnaires showed no significant difference in quality of life (QoL) between the two LT4 withdrawal strategies, while QoL in the rhTSH withdrawal groups before ablation was significantly worse than after rhTSH preparation.

Pregnancy — levothyroxine therapy for overt hypothyroidism should be titrated to trimester-specific thyrotropin targets, with serial serum thyrotropin assessed every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and reassessed during the second half; for women already taking levothyroxine, two additional doses per week (one extra dose twice weekly with several days separation) may be started as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Trimester thyrotropin reference ranges are provided as 0.1–2.5 mIU/L (first), 0.2–3.0 mIU/L (second), and 0.3–3.0 mIU/L (third). Thyroid function should be monitored every 4–6 weeks at least for the first and second trimesters and also reassessed during the third trimester, and up to 70% of women will require adjustments of 30% or more from the preconception dose.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — high-sensitivity serum thyroglobulin (Tg) assays and reduced need for stimulation: A Tg assay with a functional sensitivity of 0.1–0.2 ng/mL may reduce the need to perform TSH-stimulated Tg measurements, with one study showing a T4-suppressed serum Tg < 0.1 ng/mL only rarely (2%) associated with an rhTSH-stimulated Tg ≥ 2 ng/mL and, despite 42% having baseline rhTSH-stimulated Tg elevation > 0.1 ng/mL, only one patient with residual tumor; another study found TSH-suppressed Tg > 0.1 ng/mL in 14% but a 35% false-positive rate using an rhTSH-stimulated Tg cutoff of ≥ 2 ng/mL. In low-risk patients not undergoing ablation, an ultrasensitive Tg was < 1 ng/mL in 91% and < 2 ng/mL in 96% at 9 months after thyroidectomy. A second-generation assay cutoff of 0.15 ng/mL yielded a NPV of 98.6% and 91% specificity, and Tg levels on thyroid hormone therapy around 0.2–0.3 ng/mL best combine sensitivity and specificity; it was concluded that annual serum Tg on LT4 with periodic neck US is adequate with no need for rhTSH stimulation testing in those with serum Tg < 0.2–0.3 ng/mL and a stable or indeterminate neck sonogram.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — management options, monitoring, and goals: The treatment of SH is similar to the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism, with radioactive iodine appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, while long-term antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with GD and SH, especially in younger patients. Some patients with SH due to GD may remit spontaneously so observation without therapy is reasonable for younger patients; a small subset of elderly patients with persistently low TSH and no evidence of true thyroid dysfunction can be followed without intervention, particularly when serum FT4 estimate and T3 are in the lower half of normal. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade may be sufficient to control cardiovascular-related morbidity, especially atrial fibrillation. Technical remarks state that some patients with SH due to mild GD may be followed without therapy with frequent (every 3 months) monitoring of thyroid function; in select SH due to TMNG with compressive symptoms or concern for malignancy, surgery is also an option; and the goal of therapy for SH is to render the patient euthyroid with a normal TSH. Data cited note stabilization or improvement in bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with SH treated, and reports of improvement in hyperthyroid symptoms with antithyroid drug therapy and after beta-adrenergic blockade.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111ra852]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — interventions and treatment thresholds: The principal treatment for hypothyroidism is oral monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium). Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (such as methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (for example, radioactive iodine or surgery). Although definitive data are lacking, treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or less than 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease, whereas treatment is typically not recommended for patients with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or when thyroiditis is the cause.

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^112QYPbZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

Excessive levothyroxine (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis) — harms and threshold: "The deleterious health effects of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis include atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis". Accordingly, "we recommend avoiding thyroid hormone excess and subnormal serum thyrotropin values, particularly thyrotropin values below 0.1 mIU/L, especially in older persons and postmenopausal women. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence". Over-treatment is common; "In one study of older individuals taking LT4, 36% of patients over age 65 years had a subnormal serum TSH (233)". Adverse outcomes increase when "serum TSH < 0.1 mIU/L", including atrial fibrillation: "patients older than age 65 years with serum TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L… had a threefold increase in the risk of atrial fibrillation over a 10-year observation period". Skeletal risks are higher in postmenopausal women, "especially if the serum TSH levels are undetectable", and cardiovascular, dysrhythmia, and fracture admissions and deaths "were higher for those with suppressed TSH values".

Different levothyroxine products and serum TSH — Because use of different levothyroxine products may sometimes be associated with altered serum TSH values, a change in an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine (brand name or generic) should be followed by re-evaluation of serum TSH at steady state. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

2.1	Recommended Dosage

THYROGEN should be used by physicians knowledgeable in the management of patients with thyroid cancer.

THYROGEN is indicated as a two-injection regimen. The recommended dosage of THYROGEN is a 0.9 mg intramuscular injection to the buttock followed by a second 0.9 mg intramuscular injection to the buttock 24 hours later.

THYROGEN should be administered intramuscularly only. THYROGEN should not be administered intravenously.

Pretreatment with glucocorticoids should be considered for patients in whom tumor expansion may compromise vital anatomic structures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Routine measurement of serum TSH levels is not recommended after THYROGEN use.

2.2	Reconstitution, Preparation, and Administration of THYROGEN

The supplied lyophilized powder must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP. THYROGEN should be prepared, and administered in the following manner:

Reconstitute each 0.9 mg vial of THYROGEN with 1.2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP to yield a single-dose solution containing 0.9 mg/mL of thyrotropin alfa that delivers 1 mL (0.9 mg).
Gently swirl the contents of the vial until all the material is dissolved. Do not shake the solution.
Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The reconstituted THYROGEN solution should be clear and colorless. Do not use if the solution has particulate matter or is cloudy or discolored.
Withdraw 1 mL of the reconstituted THYROGEN solution (0.9 mg of thyrotropin alfa) and inject intramuscularly in the buttocks. Discard any unused portions.
The reconstituted THYROGEN solution must be injected within 3 hours unless refrigerated.
If necessary, the reconstituted solution can be stored refrigerated at a temperature between 2°C and 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours, while avoiding microbial contamination.
Do not mix with other substances.

2.3	Timing of Serum Thyroglobulin Testing Following THYROGEN Administration

For serum thyroglobulin testing, the serum sample should be obtained 72 hours after the final injection of THYROGEN [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

2.4	Timing for Remnant Ablation and Diagnostic Scanning Following THYROGEN Administration

Oral radioiodine should be given 24 hours after the second injection of THYROGEN in both remnant ablation and diagnostic scanning. The activity of131I is carefully selected at the discretion of the nuclear medicine physician.

Diagnostic scanning should be performed 48 hours after the radioiodine administration.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

American Thyroid Association (ATA) differentiated thyroid cancer — postoperative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) thresholds and outcomes: After total thyroidectomy and RAI remnant ablation, a postoperative TSH-stimulated Tg > 1–2 ng/mL at ablation is associated with increased risk of recurrence; receiver-operator analyses indicate thyroid hormone withdrawal postoperative Tg values between 20 and 30 ng/mL optimize sensitivity/specificity for predicting recurrent or persistent disease; high postoperative stimulated Tg values (> 10–30 ng/mL) are associated with poorer survival, whereas postoperative stimulated Tg values less than 1–2 ng/mL are strong predictors of remission. In ATA low- and intermediate-risk patients managed without RAI, a nonstimulated postoperative Tg < 1 ng/mL was associated with recurrence rates < 1%, with median follow-up 62 months (2–116 months). One prospective study suggested a postoperative Tg threshold of > 5 ng/mL as an indication for RAI treatment, while a retrospective series reported that an unstimulated Tg of ≥ 2 ng/mL with a concomitant median TSH level of 0.48 mIU/L "was reported to detect all patients with disease recurrence (76 patients followed for a median of 2.5 years)". Postoperative Tg also predicts identification of RAI-avid metastasis outside the thyroid bed on posttherapy scans: no uptake outside the bed was identified in 63 low-risk patients with a nonstimulated postoperative Tg of < 0.4 ng/mL or in 132 low-risk patients with a thyroid hormone withdrawal Tg of < 1 ng/mL, whereas RAI-avid metastatic foci were detected in 12% of intermediate-risk patients with a suppressed Tg of < 0.6 ng/mL, 5.6% of intermediate/high-risk patients with a suppressed Tg of < 1 ng/mL, and 6.3% of intermediate/high-risk patients with a thyroid hormone withdrawal stimulated Tg of < 2 ng/mL.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — prevalence and natural history show that in a representative U.S. sample without known thyroid disease, 0.7% had suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/L) and 1.8% had low TSH (< 0.4 mU/L). The natural history is variable, with annualized rates of 0.5%–7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5%–12% reversion to normal TSH levels. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism appears more likely when TSH is suppressed (< 0.01 mIU/L) rather than low but detectable (0.01–0.4 mIU/L).

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^111sQoM3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO-T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVO-T may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVO-T therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVO-T [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.
