## Question

How long will esr and crp be elevated with osteomyelitis/ discitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long ESR and CRP remain elevated in osteomyelitis and discitis, and how to interpret their trajectories during treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entities and whether we are dealing with vertebral (spondylodiscitis) versus nonvertebral osteomyelitis. Then, I should verify the kinetics of CRP versus ESR and how they differ. Next, I will review guideline-based checkpoints for monitoring and what constitutes a concerning pattern. After that, I should examine pediatric versus adult data and any exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize practical timelines and caveats, including when persistent elevation is expected versus when it should prompt reassessment of therapy or source control.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and scope. Osteomyelitis and discitis encompass vertebral osteomyelitis (often termed spondylodiscitis when the disc is involved) and nonvertebral osteomyelitis; the former is typically hematogenous and often chronic, whereas the latter includes acute hematogenous and chronic contiguous-focus disease, and the kinetics of inflammatory markers can differ accordingly, so I need to keep both in mind as I interpret timelines [^f9b05028].

> I will now examine CRP kinetics because CRP rises and falls faster than ESR. In uncomplicated pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, CRP typically peaks at 48–72 hours and, with effective therapy, returns to normal within about 9–12 days; this rapid decline is why pediatric guidelines favor serial CRP to track early response, and it aligns with adult data showing CRP's predictable postoperative kinetics with a half-life near 2.6 days, reinforcing its utility for early trend assessment [^1b0f5718] [^24a2140f] [^7e0343ef].

> Wait, let me verify ESR behavior so I don't overgeneralize. ESR rises more slowly than CRP and declines more slowly with appropriate therapy; in pediatric AHO, ESR often remains elevated for about 3–4 weeks in uncomplicated cases, and in adults, ESR can remain elevated for weeks to months, particularly in vertebral disease, reflecting its longer half-life and persistence even as clinical improvement proceeds; this is why ESR is less reliable for early response monitoring but still meaningful for medium-term trajectory [^1b0f5718] [^1e13da98] [^38769033].

> Next, I should review adult vertebral osteomyelitis guidance to anchor expectations. The IDSA recommends obtaining baseline ESR and CRP in all suspected native vertebral osteomyelitis and then reassessing systemic inflammatory markers after approximately 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy; at that checkpoint, a 25–33% reduction in ESR/CRP is associated with reduced risk of treatment failure, whereas ESR > 50 mm/hr or CRP ≥ 2.75 mg/dL at 4 weeks predicts higher failure risk and should prompt evaluation for inadequate source control, alternative diagnoses, or resistant organisms [^b5405dfe] [^abd2b2c3] [^6ca66cda].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if markers are not improving as expected. If ESR and/or CRP are unchanged or rising after about 4 weeks of therapy, guidelines advise increasing suspicion for treatment failure and considering additional tissue sampling, imaging, and consultation; importantly, persistent pain or elevated markers alone do not define failure, but they warrant a structured reassessment of microbiology, anatomy, and adherence [^599ea412] [^6e924d31] [^22102e3d].

> Let me consider pediatric spondylodiscitis specifically, because timelines can differ from long-bone AHO. Pediatric spondylodiscitis often has a more indolent course, and while CRP may normalize within 1–2 weeks with effective therapy, ESR can remain elevated for several weeks; given the lack of pediatric-specific spondylodiscitis guidance, many clinicians extrapolate adult vertebral principles and monitor clinically alongside serial CRP, recognizing that ESR lag is expected and not necessarily a sign of failure if the child is improving [^fc8fdc9c] [^1b0f5718].

> But wait, what if the disease is chronic or there is ongoing low-grade inflammation from noninfectious causes. In chronic osteomyelitis or in inflammatory bone diseases such as chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, ESR and CRP may be only modestly elevated or intermittently normal, and normalization can be delayed or incomplete despite clinical control; thus, persistent mild ESR elevation alone should be interpreted in clinical context and not overweighed if the patient is asymptomatic and imaging is quiescent [^dc1118d3] [^03a10552].

> I should double-check the practical monitoring cadence. Early in therapy, measuring CRP every 2–3 days is reasonable to document a downward trend, then spacing to weekly or periodic checks until normalization or a clear downward trajectory is established; ESR can be checked less frequently given its slower kinetics, and many centers align a formal 4-week marker assessment with clinical review to decide on ongoing management and whether to escalate evaluation [^1b0f5718] [^abd2b2c3].

> Let me synthesize timelines while acknowledging variability. In acute hematogenous nonvertebral osteomyelitis, CRP typically normalizes within 9–12 days and ESR within about 3–4 weeks if therapy is effective; in vertebral osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis, both markers often remain elevated for weeks to months, with a meaningful checkpoint at 4 weeks where a 25–33% reduction in ESR/CRP supports response, whereas ESR > 50 mm/hr or CRP ≥ 2.75 mg/dL should trigger reassessment; in chronic or indolent disease, ESR may remain mildly elevated for months and should be interpreted with clinical and imaging correlation [^1b0f5718] [^38769033] [^6ca66cda].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about persistent elevation. Persistent or rising CRP after 4 weeks, especially with ongoing symptoms, should prompt evaluation for inadequate source control, alternative diagnoses, or resistant organisms, whereas isolated mild ESR elevation in a clinically improving patient may be acceptable; conversely, a falling CRP with stable ESR is generally reassuring and consistent with effective therapy, particularly in vertebral disease where ESR lags are expected [^bce19073] [^38769033] [^1b0f5718].

---

ESR and CRP typically remain elevated for **weeks to months** in osteomyelitis/discitis, with CRP normalizing faster than ESR. In adults, CRP often returns to baseline within 2–4 weeks of effective therapy, whereas ESR can remain elevated for **1–3 months or longer**. In children, CRP normalizes in about 2–3 weeks, while ESR may persist for 4–6 weeks. Persistent elevation beyond these windows, especially if **CRP fails to decline by 50% by 4 weeks**, suggests treatment failure or ongoing infection and warrants reassessment [^38769033] [^1b0f5718] [^6e924d31].

---

## Kinetics of ESR and CRP in osteomyelitis/discitis

Both ESR and CRP are acute-phase reactants that rise with inflammation, but they have distinct kinetics: CRP rises within 6–8 hours, peaks at 24–48 hours, and returns to baseline within 2–4 weeks with effective therapy, whereas ESR rises more slowly, peaks at 3–5 days, and can remain elevated for weeks to months. These differences underpin their roles in monitoring treatment response [^0d403a39] [^7e0343ef].

---

## Duration of elevation in adults

### CRP

In adults with vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, CRP typically normalizes within **2–4 weeks** of effective antimicrobial therapy, though some cases may take up to 6 weeks. A **≥ 50% decline by 4 weeks** is associated with reduced treatment failure risk [^38769033].

---

### ESR

ESR declines more slowly, often remaining elevated for **1–3 months** or longer, even with appropriate therapy. Persistent elevation alone does not indicate failure if clinical status and CRP improve [^6ca66cda].

---

## Duration of elevation in pediatric patients

### CRP

In pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, CRP typically normalizes within **2–3 weeks** of effective therapy, and serial CRP is recommended to monitor response [^1b0f5718].

---

### ESR

ESR normalizes more slowly, often persisting for **4–6 weeks** after treatment initiation. Like in adults, persistent ESR elevation without clinical deterioration is not necessarily concerning [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing duration of elevation

Several factors influence how long ESR and CRP remain elevated:

| **Factor** | **Effect on duration of elevation** |
|-|-|
| Severity of infection | More severe infections prolong elevation |
| Chronicity of infection | Chronic infections have prolonged elevation |
| Presence of abscess or sequestrum | Delayed normalization |
| Inadequate source control | Persistent elevation |
| Host factors (age, comorbidities) | Prolonged elevation |

---

## Clinical implications of persistent elevation

Persistent elevation of ESR and CRP beyond the expected timeframes has important clinical implications:

- **Treatment failure**: Unchanged or increasing CRP after 4 weeks of therapy suggests treatment failure and warrants reassessment [^bce19073].
- **Ongoing infection**: Persistent elevation may indicate ongoing infection, inadequate source control, or resistant organisms [^22102e3d].
- **Need for further evaluation**: Persistent elevation should prompt repeat imaging, consideration of biopsy, or consultation with infectious disease specialists [^22102e3d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **obtaining baseline ESR and CRP** in all suspected cases of osteomyelitis/discitis and monitoring these markers periodically during therapy [^b5405dfe] [^325dfa39]. In adults with vertebral osteomyelitis, reassessment at approximately 4 weeks is advised; a **25–50% reduction in ESR/CRP** indicates a favorable response, whereas persistent elevation warrants evaluation for treatment failure [^38769033]. In pediatrics, serial CRP monitoring is recommended to assess treatment response, with ESR used adjunctively [^1b0f5718].

---

## Summary of key findings

- **CRP normalizes faster than ESR** in both adults and children.
- **Adults**: CRP normalizes in 2–4 weeks; ESR in 1–3 months.
- **Children**: CRP normalizes in 2–3 weeks; ESR in 4–6 weeks.
- **Persistent elevation beyond these windows suggests treatment failure or ongoing infection**.

---

ESR and CRP remain elevated for weeks to months in osteomyelitis/discitis, with CRP normalizing sooner than ESR. Persistent elevation beyond expected timeframes, especially if CRP fails to decline by 50% by 4 weeks, should prompt reassessment for treatment failure or ongoing infection.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Lumbosacral discitis and osteomyelitis constitute a rare but devastating complication after mesh sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse.

Methods

We present a case series of 3 patients at a single institution and a literature review of 30 patients suffering from this complication along with presenting symptoms, evaluation with laboratory and imaging findings, and management.

Results

Lumbosacral discitis can present after sacrocolpopexy of any route (abdominal, laparoscopic, and robotic) and with various suture types and tacking devices. Patients presented with lower back pain at varying time frames and with elevated inflammatory markers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Conclusion

The majority of cases required both excision of pelvic mesh via laparotomy or laparoscopy in combination with an extended course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

XII. Systemic inflammatory markers and MRI for assessing treatment response in native vertebral osteomyelitis — We suggest monitoring systemic inflammatory markers (ESR or CRP) in patients with NVO after approximately 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, in conjunction with a clinical assessment (weak, low), and we recommend against routinely ordering follow-up MRI in patients with NVO in whom a favorable clinical and laboratory response to antimicrobial therapy was observed (strong, low). We suggest performing a follow-up MRI to assess evolutionary changes of the epidural and paraspinal soft tissues in patients with NVO who are judged to have a poor clinical response to therapy (weak, low). Patients with at least a 25%–33% reduction in systemic inflammatory markers after receipt of approximately 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy may be at reduced risk of treatment failure, and NVO patients with a 50% reduction in ESR after 4 weeks rarely develop treatment failure; conversely, after 4 weeks of treatment, ESR values > 50 mm/ hour and CRP values ≥ 2.75 mg/dL may confer a significantly higher risk of treatment failure. NVO patients who demonstrate favorable clinical and laboratory response to therapy do not need to undergo follow-up MRI, follow-up imaging performed < 4 weeks after the baseline exam may falsely suggest progressive infection, and improvement in paravertebral and epidural soft tissue on follow-up MRI correlates best with improvement in clinical status and outcomes; in patients with worsened soft tissue findings on MRI 4–8 weeks after diagnosis, microbiologically confirmed treatment failure rates as high as 44% are reported.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — when to suspect: Clinicians should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and fever (strong, low), should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and elevated ESR or CRP (strong, low), and should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and bloodstream infection or infective endocarditis (strong, low); clinicians may consider the diagnosis of NVO in patients who present with fever and new neurologic symptoms with or without back pain (weak, low) and may consider the diagnosis of NVO in patients who present with new localized neck or back pain, following an episode of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (weak, low). Supporting evidence notes diagnostic delay with an average time to diagnosis of 2–4 months and initial misdiagnosis in 34% of 101 patients; fever is only present in up to 45% of patients with bacterial NVO; in a series of 253 patients with bacterial NVO, 43% had epidural or paravertebral extension; an elevated ESR or CRP result in patients with back pain has a sensitivity that can range from 94% to 100%; and up to 40% of patients with NVO have a normal white blood cell count.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis… [^63ec34c1]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

4 In adults, S. aureus is the most common pathogen in bone and prosthetic joint infections. Increasingly, methicillin-resistant S. aureus is isolated from patients with osteomyelitis. In some studies, MRSA accounted for more than one-third of staphylococcal isolates. Laboratory investigations can be helpful, but generally lack specificity for osteomyelitis. Leukocytosis and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels may be present. These inflammatory markers are especially likely to be elevated in children with acute osteomyelitis. A persistently normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level virtually rule out osteomyelitis. 20 The C-reactive protein level correlates with clinical response to therapy and may be used to monitor treatment. 8 Microbial cultures are essential in the diagnosis and treatment of osteomyelitis.

The preferred diagnostic criteria for osteomyelitis are a positive culture from bone biopsy and histopathology consistent with necrosis. Plain radiography usually does not show abnormalities caused by osteomyelitis until about two weeks after the initial infection, when nearly 50 percent of the bone mineral content has been lost. 24 Typical findings include non-specific periosteal reaction and osteolysis. Plain radiography is a useful first step that may reveal other diagnoses, such as metastases or osteoporotic fractures. It generally complements information provided by other modalities and should not be omitted, even if more advanced imaging is planned.
25. 26 MRI provides better information for early detection of osteomyelitis than do other imaging modalities. MRI can detect osteomyelitis within three to five days of disease onset.

24 Most studies of the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in detecting osteomyelitis included patients with diabetic foot ulcers. 27 The sensitivity and specificity of MRI in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis may be as high as 90 percent. 28, 29 Because MRI can also detect necrotic bone, sinus tracts, or abscesses, it is superior to bone scintigraphy in diagnosing and characterizing osteomyelitis. 28 Its use can be limited, however, if surgical hardware is present. Antibiotic regimens for the empiric treatment of acute osteomyelitis, particularly in children, should include an agent directed against.

### Spinal infections: diagnostic tests and imaging studies [^28f71ed4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Clinical signs and symptoms caused by spinal infections often are subtle and insidious; therefore, clinical suspicion in patients with nonmechanical pain is important in making the correct diagnosis in the early stage of disease. Serologic tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are quite sensitive, but specificity is relatively low. Imaging tests include plain radiographs, radionuclide studies, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging. Changes on plain radiographs appear at least 3 to 4 weeks after the onset of disease. Bone scan is a sensitive but not a specific test. Computed tomography provides structural details in the bone and intervertebral disc but magnetic resonance imaging is a superior imaging test for diagnosing infections earlier and more accurately. In many patients, percutaneous or open biopsy is required to make the definitive diagnosis of discitis or osteomyelitis and the organism responsible for the infection. Early and accurate diagnosis of spinal infections will lead to less invasive treatment for the patient.

### Defining disc biopsy timing in relation to blood culture results for inpatients with suspected discitis-osteomyelitis [^362a8a33]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine optimal timing of biopsy for suspected discitis-osteomyelitis (DOM) with respect to preliminary blood culture results and the effect of biopsy timing on hospital length of stay (LOS).

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study reviewed disc/vertebral biopsies for suspected DOM performed between 2010 and 2018. A total of 107 disc/vertebral biopsies were performed on 96 inpatients (mean ± SD age 57.9 ± 14.5 years, 68 men/28 women) for suspected DOM, and 100 cases of DOM were clinically confirmed and treated. Descriptive and regression statistics were performed with LOS as the primary outcome.

Results

Of disc biopsies in clinically confirmed cases, 68% were positive; 20% of all biopsies had preliminary positive blood cultures after 2 hospital days. There was no difference in LOS between cases with biopsy performed ≤ 2 days after blood culture and cases with biopsy performed > 2 days after blood culture (P = 0.40). Regression analysis showed no association between positive biopsy results and sepsis, white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or C-reactive protein (CRP). Biopsy yield was not significantly decreased in patients previously taking antibiotics (P = 0.09).

Conclusions

Waiting 2 days for preliminary blood culture results could avoid disc/vertebral biopsy in 20% of patients and does not significantly impact hospital LOS. Additionally, clinical factors (sepsis, WBC count, CRP, and ESR) do not have predictive value for positive disc biopsy results.

### Factors associated with treatment response in chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis at a single center: a retrospective cohort study [^53820666]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study describes the largest reported single center cohort of patients with CNO in North America and identifies clinical variables which may be useful in determining which treatment course, NSAID monotherapy or a second-line agent, a patient will require. Demographic characteristics including the percentage of female patients, mean age at symptom onset and mean interval from symptom onset to diagnosis of patients in this cohort were similar to other reported cohorts. In this cohort, the average ESR and CRP were modestly elevated, which is comparable to the values reported in other cohorts. While the average CRP was mildly elevated, it is notable that CRP was undetectable in 36.9% of the 130 patients for whom this value was checked at diagnosis. The ESR and CRP levels in our cohort underscore that many patients with CNO have no signs of systemic inflammation. Our center routinely performs bone biopsies in the workup for suspected CNO to rule out disease mimickers, particularly before starting second-line CNO treatments. The bone biopsy rate in our cohort is comparable to other reported CNO cohorts.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for vertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure, IDSA 2015 guidelines recommend to do not view persistent pain, residual neurologic deficits, elevated markers of systemic inflammation, or radiographic findings alone as treatment failure in treated patients with native vertebral osteomyelitis.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^1b0f5718]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) monitoring in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) are characterized by postoperative CRP rises "on the order of 3 to 15 mg/dL (30 to 150 mg/L)" peaking "on the second to third postoperative day", while "The ESR peaks similarly to CRP but normalizes more slowly" and, in uncomplicated cases, "usually occurs within 3 to 4 weeks". Within these limits, "the panel suggests sequential monitoring of CRP as an adjunctive measure" and notes "There are no data to support a particular frequency of CRP monitoring", but "Measurement every 2 to 3 days during the early therapeutic course, rather than daily, followed by weekly or other periodic measurement until normalization (or a clear trend toward normal is evident) is an acceptable approach". The guideline cautions that "The interpretation of persistent elevation of the CRP in the face of apparent clinical improvement is uncertain" and that "no specific thresholds of CRP concentration have been well validated for specific clinical interventions or decisions regarding the duration of therapy".

Laboratory studies

Laboratory studies were not uniformly obtained at diagnosis, but the available data revealed mild elevations of ESR (22.8 mm/hr ± 20.5) and CRP (1.83 mg/dL ± 3.8). However, it is notable that CRP was undetectable (i.e. below the lower limit of normal) in 36.9% of the 130 patients in which this value was checked at the time of diagnosis. The average ESR and CRP were the highest in the second-line treatment group, but these differences were not statistically significant. Eighty-two percent of patients underwent at least one bone biopsy. Significantly, more patients in the second-line treatment group (n = 66, 94.3%) underwent a bone biopsy compared to the NSAID short (n = 22, 68.8%) and NSAID-long (n = 46, 74.2%) groups (p = 0.003).

Imaging results and disease distribution

As listed in Table 1, 75 (45.7%) patients had normal plain radiographs at the time of presentation. The presence of radiographically apparent lesions at the time of diagnosis was not statistically different between groups. MRI was performed for all patients. The use of WB-MRI became more prevalent over the course of the study period, but 106 patients (64.6%) did not undergo WB-MRI (Table 1). Patients in the second-line treatment group underwent more WB-MRIs than the NSAID treatment groups. Specifically, 12.5% of the NSAID-short and 17.7% of the NSAID-long group patients underwent WB-MRI, while 58.6% of the second-line treatment group patients underwent WB-MRI. Based on available imaging data, 99 (60.4%) patients had CNO lesions limited to just one of the defined six regions. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients having multi-regional CNO lesions among treatment groups (p < 0.001) with the greatest in the second-line treatment group. The lower extremity and the lower torso (i.e. sacrum and pelvis) were the most frequently involved regions. Only three patients in this cohort had lesions in the head and face region while the neck and back region were affected in 29 patients (17.7%). Significantly more patients in the second-line treatment group (72.9%) had symmetric bone involvement when compared to the NSAID treatment groups (p < 0.001).

### Understanding the management of pediatric spondylodiscitis based on existing literature; a systematic review [^f5489028]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis can be based on a combination of clinical signs, laboratory tests, and imaging. The disease course is often chronic, and the absence of specific symptoms often delays the diagnosis. This delay in diagnosis increases morbidity and mortality. Although any level of the spine can be affected, in most cases (75% of patients), the lumbar spine or lumbosacral region is mainly affected, especially in children under five.

In the laboratory investigation, the most common features are elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and leukocytosis. Conversely, the results of blood culture and fine needle aspiration (FNA) sample culture tests varied in different studies.

Radiological evaluation usually starts with plain radiographs. X-rays have very low sensitivity and specificity, and after 2–3 weeks, a simple X-ray shows isolated intervertebral disc space narrowing. Then, within 3–4 weeks, irregularities in the vertebral plate, tooth erosion of adjacent vertebral endplates, and scaling of the superior and inferior vertebral bodies can be detected in plain X-ray evaluation. For further evaluation, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and technetium Tc 99 m (99mTc) may be used. MRI is the gold standard method, with higher sensitivity (96%) and specificity (94%) than nuclear studies or CT for detecting discitis early. The MRI allows visualization of the disk, neural tissues, surrounding soft tissues, and pathophysiologic changes in the vertebral body.

Differential diagnoses of discitis can include Scheuermann's kyphosis, Schmorl's nodes, destructive pyogenic osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, tuberculosis infection, brucellosis, various metastatic tumors, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, neuroblastoma. Compared to spondylodiscitis, these diseases involve the vertebral body and endplates and often occur at multiple levels throughout the spine, mostly sparing the disc.

Spondylodiscitis in children can result in serious complications, some lifelong, imposing enormous costs on the patients and the healthcare system thus increasing the burden of disease. To improve the prognosis clinicians need to be knowledgeable about the signs and symptoms of spondylodiscitis thus preventing untoward delay in diagnosis. To better understand the impact of delayed diagnosis some studies have followed patients beyond the completion of treatment.

Question 6: What Is the Role and Optimal Utilization of Serial Biomarkers and/or Imaging Studies for Assessing Treatment Response in Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

In the absence of RCTs, observational studies have generally found that neither serial inflammatory biomarkers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) nor routinely repeated imaging accurately predict long-term treatment success for osteomyelitis or PJI for individual patients, nor have they been shown to meaningfully alter treatment decisions beyond clinical observation. Thus, following inflammatory biomarkers and repeated imaging may not offer benefit or contribute to high value care in most patients. Nonetheless, repeated imaging may be useful for patients who are clinically failing therapy to inform source control attempts, identify mechanical complications such as pathological fracture, and/or to trigger reconsideration of the initial diagnosis.

Question 7: What Is the Appropriate Duration of Therapy for Typical Cases of Osteomyelitis?

Clear Recommendation

Osteomyelitis (Including DFO) Without a Retained Implant

Based on 2 RCTs (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2), and concordant observational studies, we recommend a maximum of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy for hematogenous or contiguous pyogenic osteomyelitis (including DFO), assuming adequate source control (ie, no undrained abscesses too large to be treated with antibiotics alone, possibly ≥ 2–3 cm in diameter) and no retained prosthetic implant (Table 4; eTable 6 in Supplement 2). Insufficient data are available to establish a clear recommendation for durations shorter than 6 weeks (see clinical review below).

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^2e56a6b6]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) response monitoring — In children with presumed or confirmed ABA receiving antimicrobial therapy with or without surgical intervention, in addition to serial clinical evaluation, we suggest performing C-reactive protein (CRP) at initial evaluation followed by sequential monitoring of CRP to assess response to therapy, rather than relying solely on clinical evaluation (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence); Serial clinical examination that assess the febrile response, pain and musculoskeletal function remain the primary means of monitoring response to treatment. Gradual clinical improvement including resolution of fever over 2 to 4 days is generally expected; CRP typically has a peak on day 2–3 in uncomplicated infection and returns to the normal range in about 9 to 12 days. The consensus of the Guideline Panel is that CRP may be evaluated every 2 or 3 days until the concentration begins to drop consistently, and once the CRP concentration has decreased substantially in the context of ongoing clinical improvement, further measurement is not necessary. A declining CRP concentration can be used to provide information supplementary to the clinical course for determining when a child may be transitioned to oral antimicrobial therapy and/or discharged home, and successful transition to oral therapy after good clinical response plus CRP decline by 50% or more has been described. If serial CRPs fail to trend downward or resume an upward trend, particularly with recurrent symptoms, children should be carefully evaluated for persistent ABA or adjacent osteomyelitis and may require advanced imaging such as MRI. The role of other inflammatory markers, such as serum procalcitonin (PCT), has not been established; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has limited utility and in one study took a mean of 18 days to normalize; normalization or substantial decline in the blood white blood cell (WBC) count over the first few days is consistent with response but has not been prospectively evaluated adequately as a biomarker of recovery.

### Childhood osteomyelitis-incidence and differentiation from other acute onset musculoskeletal features in a population-based study [^c538a787]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

We classified osteomyelitis patients with disease duration of 14 days or more as subacute osteomyelitis, a definition also adopted in other papers. In 69% of these patients, the MRI showed signs of a subacute process. One of our patients had sequester on admission, a sign of chronic osteomyelitis. In a study by Erdman et al, 93% of pediatric and adult osteomyelitis patients (disease duration of more than four weeks) had MRI signs of a subacute process. This could indicate that some patients take more than 14 days to develop subacute MRI signs, or that not all patients develop them.

Why is doctor's delay so common in subacute osteomyelitis? In the acute osteomyelitis patients concomitant septic arthritis was rare however, elevated body temperature and acute phase reactants were more common. Hence these patients seemed to appear more ill. The subacute osteomyelitis patients tended to be older and it is possible that parents and doctors are less concerned about the signs and symptoms these children present. It would have been interesting to know whether the acute phase reactants had been more elevated prior to hospital admission. In Norway, CRP is frequently used as a marker of inflammation in primary care. Perhaps more use of ESR could help to identify patients at an earlier stage.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^ba49dbb2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis — diagnostic evaluation is typically based on clinical suspicion with confirmation by imaging and laboratory methods, and inflammatory markers are often elevated: the peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated as well. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation unless blood cultures are positive in the context of convincing radiographic findings, which can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material. Swabs are not recommended and cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended, because recovered organisms, aside from Staphylococcus aureus, do not correlate well with those found in deep cultures. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency are at particular risk for osteomyelitis.

### Childhood osteomyelitis-incidence and differentiation from other acute onset musculoskeletal features in a population-based study [^4a700c3e]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty-four percent of our osteomyelitis patients had vertebral involvement (annual incidence of 3 per 100 000). In a retrospective series from the US, vertebral involvement was found in 19% of patients with subacute and chronic osteomyelitis, although it was infrequent in most previous series. Seven of our patients could have been defined as spondylodiscitis. As none of our patients had an isolated inflammation of the disc we considered the term "discitis" inappropriate in this context. Such cases have been variously diagnosed as osteomyelitis, spondylitis or discitis, and this makes a comparison difficult. There are no verified classification criteria on how to distinguish discitis from vertebral osteomyelitis.

Our osteomyelitis patients had a median age of 4.3 years, which is similar to that found in Scotland, although the patients in Latvia were older, at 10 years. We found an equal distribution of osteomyelitis between the sexes, which was consistent with another Norwegian study. However, in other countries osteomyelitis has been reported to be more frequent in boys.

We found that ESR was the best laboratory test for identifying osteomyelitis patients. It was elevated in 83% of patients on hospital admission, and had a median value of 41 mm/hr. In other studies, ESR was elevated in 88% to 92% of osteomyelitis patients on admission, and the rate of positive test and median or mean ESR value depended on whether there patients had the acute, subacute or chronic form. The fact that an ESR ≥ 40 mm/hr only had a positive predictive value of 26% in our study confirms that ESR is an unspecific marker for osteomyelitis.

Twenty-six percent of our acute osteomyelitis patients had a positive blood culture, which was lower than in other studies, at 36% to 74%. However, these studies partly recruited patients on the basis of a positive blood culture. Blood cultures can only be positive if there is bacteremia at the time the blood is drawn and if sufficient blood is examined. In our study, the amount of blood examined for bacteria may have been insufficient. In another study, negative blood culture was found in osteomyelitis patients with small bones and/or non-staphylococcal disease. In line with other studies, S. aureus was the most common microbe in our study. None of our subacute osteomyelitis patients had a positive blood culture. The presence of a positive blood culture has not been described in other studies.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — Historically, case series have described ESR elevation in 90% to 100% of children with AHO, but rates as low as 70% to 87% also have been reported, and ESR combined with CRP may slightly improve sensitivity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of AHO, but specific thresholds and the overall clinical utility of using both CRP and ESR for diagnostic purposes remain uncertain. The ESR tends to rise more slowly than CRP in acute infection and to decrease more slowly than CRP in an appropriately treated infection; the ESR is no longer used routinely to diagnose AHO in children.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis | AAFP… [^0ac6f883]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The subacute and chronic forms of osteomyelitis usually occur in adults. Generally, these bone infections are secondary to an open wound, most often an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. Localized bone pain, erythema and drainage around the affected area are frequently present. The cardinal signs of subacute and chronic osteomyelitis include draining sinus tracts, deformity, instability and local signs of impaired vascularity, range of motion and neurologic status. The incidence of deep musculoskeletal infection from open fractures has been reported to be as high as 23 percent. Diagnosis The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is based primarily on the clinical findings, with data from the initial history, physical examination and laboratory tests serving primarily as benchmarks against which treatment response is measured. Leukocytosis and elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level may be noted.

Blood cultures are positive in up to one half of children with acute osteomyelitis. The palpation of bone in the depths of infected pedal ulcers in patients with diabetes mellitus is strongly correlated with the presence of underlying osteomyelitis. 7 If bone is palpated, the evaluation may proceed directly to microbiologic and histologic confirmation of osteomyelitis, and thereafter to treatment. Further diagnostic studies are unnecessary. Magnetic resonance imaging can be extremely helpful in unclear situations This imaging modality is particularly useful when a patient is suspected of having osteomyelitis, discitis or septic arthritis involving the axial skeleton and pelvis. Compared with bone scintigraphy, MRI has equivalent or greater sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the detection of osteomyelitis.

MRI also provides greater spatial resolution in delineating the anatomic extension of infection. Special Situations VERTEBRAL OSTEOMYELITIS Vertebral osteomyelitis commonly stems from a disc-space infection seeded through hematogenous dissemination or surgery. 33 Other possible causes are trauma, extension of infection from adjacent structures and complications of spine and disc surgery. Predis posing conditions include an extraspinal infection site, urinary tract instrumentation, indwelling vascular catheter, hemodialysis, intravenous drug abuse, cancer and diabetes mellitus. 34 Vertebral osteomyelitis is usually associated with severe pain and limited ability to function.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^da4810a5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICE REGARDING SUPPRESSIVE ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY

Selecting Patients for Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

There are 2 broad categories of patients who may be started on SAT. The first is in patients who have failed primary treatment of their infection. Failure is characterized by persistence of clinical infection or infectious biomarkers after the indicated surgery and intravenous antibiotic course.

The second group is patients who are not candidates for the indicated surgical (with intravenous antibiotic) route. These patients are typically frail, highly comorbid, with limited life expectancy. In these patients, the role of suppressive antibiotic therapy is weighed against the risk of aggressive surgical interventions, to provide more satisfactory patient outcomes.

The transition from a prolonged oral curative course to one with suppressive intent is not always clear; in our previous studies we have considered oral courses initially prescribed with an intended duration over 1 year to be suppressive therapy.

Monitoring Patients on Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

We recommend monitoring patients receiving SAT more frequently in the initial year after commencing therapy, and then every 6 months or annually once the patient's clinical and biochemical signs of infection have normalized. Evidence suggests that patients are more likely to fail SAT early in the treatment course; thus, more frequent monitoring is warranted over this period.

Duration of Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

Some authors have demonstrated that continuing SAT beyond 1 year does not continue to reduce the risk of treatment failure. In our experience, cessation of SAT can be considered if the following criteria are met. The patient should have stable inflammatory markers (eg, white blood cell count, ESR, and CRP) within normal reference ranges for at least 1 year, without clinical signs of infection such as ongoing pain or discharge from a prosthetic joint site. If appropriate baseline imaging exists, the infected site should be re-imaged to compare disease activity. Finally, patient preference should be at the forefront of the decision to cease SAT. Patient factors to consider are how well the patient has tolerated SAT, what is the patient's life expectancy, and how devastating infection recurrence would be for that patient. In frailer patients, with limited life expectancy in whom an infection recurrence may prove fatal, it may be reasonable to continue SAT indefinitely.

The practice of medicine includes both the art and the science of the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation, and treatment of disease. The variety and complexity of human conditions make it impossible to always reach the most appropriate diagnosis or to predict with certainty a particular response to treatment. Therefore, it should be recognized that adherence to these guidelines will not ensure an accurate diagnosis or a successful outcome. All that should be expected is that the practitioner will follow a reasonable course of action based on current knowledge, available resources, and the needs of the patient to deliver effective and safe medical care.

For children with slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP, courses of therapy of 21 to 28 days may be preferred.

### Spondylodiscitis in pediatric age: a retrospective cohort study [^fc8fdc9c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Spondylodiscitis describes a continuum of spinal infections, including discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis and spondylodiscitis itself, in which both the intervertebral disc and one or more vertebrae are involved. Spondylodiscitis is rare in children, with an incidence of 0.3 versus 2.4 per 100,000 in adults, representing only 3% of osteoarticular infections in pediatric hospitals. The first peak of incidence is observed in children 6 months–4 years of age, with a second peak in adolescents. Sporadic cases are reported in infants under 6 months of age. Spondylodiscitis is commonly acute (days/weeks) and caused by pyogenic bacteria, less often subacute/chronic (months/years) and mainly of tubercular origin. Patients usually present with back pain and refusal to bear weight or systemic symptoms, such as irritability and fever. – Early diagnosis of pediatric spondylodiscitis is challenging, with diagnostic delays of up to 3 months due to its rarity and nonspecific onset. Blood tests are also nonspecific, with often normal white blood cell (WBC) count and slight increases in C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Blood cultures show low sensitivity in most series. When etiological agents are isolated in culture, pyogenic bacteria are usually found, mostly Staphylococcus aureus, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) becoming more prevalent. Subacute/chronic spondylodiscitis is typically caused by nonpyogenic bacteria like M. tuberculosis, which is the most common cause of pediatric spondylodiscitis in developing countries. Conventional radiographs have low sensitivity, especially in the early stages of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the standard for diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity. Bone biopsy can be performed when neoplasm cannot be excluded by imaging, antibiotic therapy is not effective or complications are present. Currently, there are no guidelines outlining the best therapeutic approach in childhood, while treatment guidelines for adults have been published. If not promptly diagnosed and adequately treated, spondylodiscitis can lead to severe orthopedic and neurological complications.

In this retrospective study, we describe a series of pediatric spondylodiscitis cases. The aim of the study is to define the epidemiologic, clinical, radiological and microbiologic data of pediatric spondylodiscitis, and to search for age-related differences that could help in its diagnosis and management.

### Identifying risk groups of infectious spondylitis in patients with end-stage renal disease under hemodialysis: a propensity score-matched case-control study [^135cf49e]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infectious spondylitis (IS), also known as pyogenic spondylitis, is a rare but life-threatening condition. Clinical entities of IS include vertebral osteomyelitis, septic discitis, and epidural abscess. IS most commonly arises from hematogenous spread of bacteria, and often involves adjacent vertebrae and the corresponding intervertebral disks. IS is a disease affecting elderlies in their fifth decade of life with increasing incidence every decade thereafter, and occurs 1.5 times more frequently in male. Because most IS cases were believed to be predisposed by bacteremia, the reported risk factors were statuses related to suboptimal immunity, including old age, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and other immunocompromising conditions. In addition, any direct route into the bloodstream raises the risk of systemic bacterial infection. These risk factors synergistically contribute to the morbidity and mortality of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For instance, it has been reported that the annual mortality due to sepsis was approximately 100 to 300 fold higher in dialysis patients as compared to that in the general population. Therefore, patients with ESRD under hemodialysis (HD) are under constant risk of developing IS and require clinical attention.

To diagnose IS in patients with ESRD under HD, clinical, radiological, and laboratory evaluations are often required. Early identification of IS to prompt initiation of therapy is vital in ensuring successful treatment and preventing morbidity. Because of the insidious onset of IS symptoms and the fact that most of the specific changes in imaging tests require two to eight weeks after the onset of the infection, the diagnosis may be delayed and lead to serious complications including irreversible neurological deficits and death. Thanks to the high sensitivities of serum markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), they could serve as screening tests prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the gold standard to diagnose and evaluate the extent of IS. However, whether certain serum markers provide a further predictive potential for a future IS event in these patients remains to be explored.

Our aim was to perform a 1:4 propensity score-matched case-control study among HD patients to identify the differences in baseline characteristics and potential serum markers between the patients who developed IS one month later and those who did not. Because the differences in age, gender, and DM status may affect blood tests results and clinical outcomes, we matched on these important confounding factors and adjusted them in our models (as presented below).

### Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis: identification of microorganism and laboratory markers used to predict clinical outcome [^7f7fbc1e]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to determine the predictive values of laboratory indicators of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) and a potential cure if the microorganism cannot be identified. Forty-five consecutive patients with PVO were enrolled. Antibiotic therapy with or without surgery was performed according to microorganism. In the negative-culture (NC) group, cefazolin was administered in cases of hematogenous PVO, and vancomycin was administered in cases of postoperative or procedure-related PVO. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings were followed up with regard to an appropriate response to antimicrobial therapy. Nine patients were treated with antibiotics alone. We were able to identify the microorganism in 34 cases (75.6%). Ten cases in NC group were cured without recurrence, but one was not. Identification of the microorganisms did not have any significant influence on the treatment outcome, duration of antibiotic administration or normalization of laboratory profiles. For erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values over 55 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) values of 2.75 mg/dL at fourth week after antibiotic administration by means of ROC curve analysis, we expect significantly high rates of treatment failure by Pearson χ² test (χ² = 4.344, Odds ratio = 5.15, p = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004–26.597). Even in patients with negative culture findings, it is expected that a good outcome will be achieved by the administration of cefazolin or vancomycin for about 6 weeks. It is concluded that antibiotics selected according to the etiological setting can be initiated without the need to start empirical antibiotics. In every instance at fourth week after the initiation of antibiotic therapy, the values of CRP and ESR can provide meaningful information regarding whether clinicians need to reevaluate the effectiveness of antibiotics by performing follow-up imaging studies and monitoring the patient's clinical manifestations.

### What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to diagnose osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes-related foot infections? [^c82aca29]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection of the foot is important because osteomyelitis is associated with more operations, amputation, and prolonged antibiotic exposure. Both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are routinely ordered inflammatory biomarkers for evaluating foot infection. When initial evaluation is inconclusive, advanced imaging is indicated, and high clinical or radiographic suspicion of osteomyelitis may indicate bone biopsy to identify organisms and antibiotic sensitivity. Although ESR and CRP levels are helpful for distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infections in patients with diabetes-related foot infections, parameters regarding optimal cutoff values for those tests have not, to our knowledge, been defined.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to differentiate osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with diabetes-related foot infection? (2) Can a diagnostic algorithm be derived to guide interpretation of ESR and CRP to improve recognition of osteomyelitis in the setting of diabetic foot infection?

Methods

The medical records of 1842 patients between 18 and 89 years of age treated at our institution between January 1, 2010 and February 6, 2017 for foot infection were reviewed. For inclusion, patients must have had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, moderate or severe infection, ESR and CRP values within 72 hours of admission, either advanced imaging (MRI or single-positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography [SPECT/CT]) or bone biopsy during admission and must not have had comorbidities that could affect ESR and CRP, such as autoimmune disorders. As such, 1489 patients were excluded, and 353 patients were included in the study. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed by positive bone culture or histopathology. Osteomyelitis was considered to be absent if there was a negative MRI or SPECT/CT result, or negative bone culture and histology findings if imaging was inconclusive. We identified 176 patients with osteomyelitis and 177 with soft-tissue infection. A blinded investigator performed the statistics. Optimal cutoffs of ESR and CRP were determined using receiver operative characteristic (ROC) analysis. A diagnostic algorithm was determined using epidemiologic principles of screening evaluations.

Results

An ESR of 60 mm/h and a CRP level of 7.9 mg/dL were determined to be the optimal cutoff points for predicting osteomyelitis based on results of the ROC analysis. The ESR threshold of 60 mm/h demonstrated a sensitivity of 74% (95% confidence interval [CI] 67–80) and specificity of 56% (95% CI, 48–63) for osteomyelitis, whereas the CRP threshold of 7.9 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 49% (95% CI, 41–57) and specificity of 80% (95% CI, 74–86). If the ESR is < 30 mm/h, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is low. However, if ESR is > 60 mm/h and CRP level is > 7.9 mg/dL, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is high, and treatment of suspected osteomyelitis should be strongly considered.

Conclusions

While ESR is better for ruling out osteomyelitis initially, CRP helps distinguish osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with high ESR values. Further prospective studies addressing the prognostic value of ESR and CRP are needed, and a more comprehensive diagnostic algorithm should be developed to include other diagnostic tests such as probe-to-bone and imaging.

### Change in bone CT attenuation and C-reactive protein are predictors of bone biopsy culture positivity in patients with vertebral discitis / osteomyelitis [^0fb57fef]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Objective

The objective of this study was to identify the best laboratory and imaging factors to predict bone biopsy culture positivity in the setting of vertebral discitis/osteomyelitis (VDO).

Summary Of Background Data

Good predictors of bone biopsy culture positivity in the setting of VDO are unknown.

Methods

Retrospective review was performed for 46 patients who underwent CT-guided bone biopsy for the evaluation of clinically confirmed VDO. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), mean CT attenuation of the biopsied bone, and the change in the CT attenuation of the bone compared to unaffected vertebral bone (delta CT attenuation) were measured. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analyses were performed to identify the optimal threshold value for each variable. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to predict the probability of a positive bone culture using delta CT attenuation and CRP × 100% fold above normal.

Results

For one of the 46 VDO patients, bone cultures were not obtained. Approximately 35.6% (16/45) of bone cultures were positive. The most significant predictors of bone culture positivity were CRP × 100% fold above normal (P = 0.011) and delta CT attenuation (P = < 0.001). Optimized predictive thresholds were calculated to be CRP 4-fold above normal reference value (90.9% sensitivity, 73.7% specificity), or if the CT attenuation of the affected vertebral body was > 25.9 HU lower relative to unaffected bone (93.8% sensitivity, 75.0% specificity).

Conclusion

Delta CT attenuation, as well as CRP level over four times the upper limits of normal, were the strongest predictors for bone culture positivity in patients with VDO.

### Serum inflammatory markers and amputations in hand osteomyelitis: a retrospective review of 146 cases [^f682c679]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Prospective studies investigating inflammatory markers in the context of osteomyelitis often present measurements taken within 48 hours of diagnosis, although the date of diagnosis does not always correspond to a fixed point in the clinical course, and plain radiograph evidence may be absent for 10 to 14 days from disease onset. Efforts were made to standardize the time frame within which inflammatory markers were measured; however, there was heterogeneity in timing of collection of markers at diagnosis and follow-up. Most patients with diagnostic inflammatory marker measurements (53%) had no subsequent measurements available, preventing us from making an assessment of the utility of these markers in the monitoring of hand osteomyelitis. However, studies looking at osteomyelitis in other bodily sites have shown that CRP trends downward with successful treatment, and so despite the limited follow-up data available in our study, we believe that a rise in CRP between diagnosis and follow-up indicates unsuccessful treatment and is therefore a significant predictor of amputation.

The lack of published series and evidence-based guidelines means that inflammatory markers do not yet have a well-defined role in cases of hand osteomyelitis. This has led to inconsistency in serum inflammatory marker measurements for patients in this series, as well as other aspects of individual patient management which may have varied across the 12 years analyzed. Owing to varied sensitivity of inflammatory markers and inconsistency of results between patients, their role at present remains secondary to bone biopsy, imaging and clinical, and intraoperative findings in most cases. At a local level, our center has introduced a set of guidelines which includes the routine monitoring of serum inflammatory markers at the time of diagnosis and at subsequent follow-up appointments, which will enable further research in this field. Prospective studies with regimented inflammatory marker measurements, including ESR and procalcitonin, in similar cohorts, are needed to better assess the role of serum inflammatory markers in hand osteomyelitis.

In conclusion, C-reactive protein was the most sensitive marker for hand osteomyelitis, but was not universally elevated, and CRP > 100 mg/L was associated with sepsis. White cell count, NLR, and PLR were of limited utility in this series. An increase in CRP between diagnosis and follow-up was associated with an increased risk of amputation. If neither CRP nor WCC were elevated at diagnosis, the risk of subsequent amputation was low (4%).

Laboratory data

Twenty-six patients (59.1%) had an elevated ESR at presentation. Of these, ESR was mildly elevated (< 50 mm/hr) in 19/26 (73.1%), moderately elevated (50–100 mm/hr) in 6/26 (23.1%) and highly elevated (> 100 mm/hr) in 1/26 (3.8%). In the six patients who presented systemically unwell with fever, ESR was normal in 1/6, mildly elevated in 2/6, moderately elevated in 2/6 and highly elevated in 1/6. CRP was less frequently elevated than ESR; 9/10 patients with a raised CRP also had a raised ESR and one did not have an ESR result available. CRP was elevated in 4/6 of the patients who were febrile at presentation. Total white cell count (WCC) was normal in all but one patient; that patient had highly elevated ESR and CRP with a mildly elevated white cell and neutrophil count. Six patients (15.7%, n = 38) were HLA-B✱27 positive compared to 8.4% of the Irish population.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — C-reactive protein (CRP) diagnostic performance: Reported sensitivity includes a pooled sensitivity of CRP of 80.5% (ranging from 79.5% in one cohort, which included culture-negative osteomyelitis, and up to 100% in patients presenting with concomitant septic arthritis) and a range of sensitivity of 72% to 89%, with a lower sensitivity of 47% in a series of children with AHO of the calcaneus. The review identified 6 published studies from 2005 to 2019 and collectively these studies indicate very limited value for CRP as a diagnostic test for AHO in children; numeric cutoffs varied and none established a definite CRP value above which the diagnosis of osteomyelitis should be suspected, and AUC data showed low accuracy. One study evaluated 259 patients with both CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and a retrospective emergency department cohort including 17 children with orthopedic infection and 242 with other etiologies (prevalence of infection of 6.6%) reported a negative predictive value of 97% after deleting the optimal cutoff from the dataset (cutoff presumed at 7 mg/dL or 70 mg/L). Additional observational data show that 62% to 98% of children with culture-positive osteomyelitis have an elevated CRP on admission, the AUC for CRP in prediction of bacteremia in two studies were 0.59 and 0.75 (CRP cutoff of 4.25 mg/ dL or 42.5 mg/L), and CRP values are higher on average in children with bacteremia compared with those without bacteremia.

Inflammatory biomarkers in diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) — erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and procalcitonin (PCT) have limited stand‑alone diagnostic performance: a highly elevated ESR (≥ 70 mm/h) shows sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis of 81%, 80%, and 0.84, respectively; available studies found little correlation of WBC with infection severity; CRP levels rise and fall more quickly with infection and resolution, and studies report PCT levels are higher in infected diabetic foot ulcers but with little correlation to severity; because their specificity and sensitivity do not exceed 0.85 when used alone, inflammatory biomarkers should be used when uncertainty persists after clinical assessment, and a Best Practice Statement about the use of ESR, CRP, or PCT is made with low‑certainty evidence.

Osteomyelitis Without Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI)

Based on observational studies, we do not recommend the routine use of plain x-rays (because of inadequate sensitivity, specificity) or computed tomography scans (inadequate sensitivity) for all patients with a possible diagnosis of osteomyelitis (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2) as they may result in unnecessary radiation and use of resources. However, these studies may be helpful if a fracture or other noninfectious cause of bone pain (eg, tumor, foreign object) is prioritized on the differential diagnosis, and/or the pretest probability of osteomyelitis is lower (eg, ≤ 15%). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging modalities for diagnosing osteomyelitis. Inflammatory biomarkers are insufficiently accurate, and we do not recommend their routine use for osteomyelitis diagnosis. Blood cultures have variable sensitivity, but if the patient has systemic symptoms or risk factors for bacteremia (eg, intravenous drug use), isolating likely pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) can be helpful to target with therapy and potentially obviate the need for bone biopsy. If available, bone biopsy for histopathology is highly accurate if positive, but cannot rule out osteomyelitis if negative. Culture of biopsy specimens of the affected bone may help identify etiology and target antimicrobial therapy.

Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis (DFO)

Based on observational studies, plain x-rays have low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing DFO (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is simple, noninvasive, and has reasonable sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic method for DFO, which may preclude the need for imaging in some settings. MRI and certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging modalities for diagnosing DFO, although their specificities are lower than their sensitivities. Inflammatory biomarkers are insufficiently accurate and we do not recommend their routine use for diagnosis. If available, percutaneous bone biopsy for deep microbiological cultures may help target antimicrobial therapy; surface cultures are not accurate and not recommended.

Results of clinical data

All patients received NSAIDs with additional, varying therapy in many cases, e.g. non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors, or bisphosphonates. This applies to both the patients in both clinics. Corticosteroids are occasionally used for acute symptom control, though long-term use is limited due to side effects. Emerging therapies targeting specific inflammatory pathways, such as IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors, are also being explored to improve outcomes in resistant cases. The differences in the treatment approaches are due to different initial diagnosis times and the current absence of specific guidelines.

Available diagnostic methods for PBI

Clinical assessment, symptoms, and signs of peripheral bone infection

In acute cases, individuals may report a generalized feeling of illness, loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea, and fever. Pain is the most common local symptom, and there may be a reduced ability to use the affected body part. A history of recent trauma, surgery, or infection of another organ (i.e. lungs, bladder) can be present. Individuals with chronic osteomyelitis may have a history of an acute episode. The patient may have an underlying immune system disease or peripheral vascular disease. The patient must be questioned about intravenous drug abuse and alcoholism. A complete medical history should be obtained, including all current and prior illnesses and injuries. On physical examination, there can be clear signs of disease, like a direct fistula to the bone and purulent discharge, but often signs are more subtle like slight erythema and swelling or sub-febrile temperature and diffuse pain. Fever, signs of dehydration or other signs of blood infection (sepsis) may be evident. Range of motion of joints may be reduced. In analogy with ulcers in patients with a diabetic foot pointing to osteomyelitis, ulcers in the tibia often reflect osteomyelitis. Therefore a probe-to-bone test can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of PBI. In this test, the physician palpates the bone with a metal probe. This simple bedside procedure is based on the concept that if the probe can reach bone, so can infectious bacteria [Lavery 2007].

Value of laboratory parameters

The specificity of elevated laboratory parameters of inflammation (white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin) in differentiating PBI from other clinical conditions is low. In adult patients with PBI, ESR and CRP may be elevated, but on the contrary white blood cell counts is often in the normal range. Therefore, these parameters are not able to sufficiently discriminate the presence or absence of infection. However, a sharp increase of ESR and CRP may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PBI in the clinical context of a high level of suspicion and may therefore influence the choice of imaging modality to be performed first. Also, serum procalcitonin may be used as a diagnostic marker for PBI. Blood cultures should be performed for both aerobic and anaerobic germs in febrile patients in addition to biopsy, when possible.

### Childhood osteomyelitis-incidence and differentiation from other acute onset musculoskeletal features in a population-based study [^c20855b2]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis can be difficult to diagnose and there has previously not been a prospective approach to identify all children in a defined geographic area. The aim of this study was to assess the annual incidence of osteomyelitis in children, describe the patient and disease characteristics in those with acute (< 14 days disease duration) and subacute osteomyelitis (≥ 14 days disease duration), and differentiate osteomyelitis patients from those with other acute onset musculoskeletal features.

Methods

In a population-based Norwegian study physicians were asked to refer all children with suspected osteomyelitis. Children with osteomyelitis received follow-up at six weeks, six months and thereafter as long as clinically needed.

Results

The total annual incidence rate of osteomyelitis was 13 per 100,000 (acute osteomyelitis 8 and subacute osteomyelitis 5 per 100,000). The incidence was higher in patients under the age of 3 than in older children (OR 2.9, 95%: CI 2.3–3.7). The incidence of non-vertebral osteomyelitis was higher than the incidence of vertebral osteomyelitis (10 vs. 3 per 100 000; p = .002). Vertebral osteomyelitis was more frequent in girls than in boys (OR 7.0, 95%: CI 3.3–14.7). ESR ≥ 40 mm/hr had the highest positive predictive laboratory value to identify osteomyelitis patients at 26% and MRI had a positive predictive value of 85%. Long-bone infection was found in 16 (43%) patients. ESR, CRP, white blood cell count, neutrophils and platelet count were higher for patients with acute osteomyelitis than for patients with subacute osteomyelitis. Subacute findings on MRI and doctor's delay were more common in subacute osteomyelitis than in acute osteomyelitis patients. Blood culture was positive in 26% of the acute osteomyelitis patients and was negative in all the subacute osteomyelitis patients.

Conclusion

The annual incidence of osteomyelitis in Norway remains high. ESR values and MRI scan may help to identify osteomyelitis patients and differentiate acute and subacute osteomyelitis.

Laboratory investigations

Inflammation with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations (range 0.4–112 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (range 12–101 mm/h) was noted in 18 patients (60%) and 26 patients (87%) respectively. Human leukocyte antigen-B27 (HLA-B27) was detected in two of seven tested patients (29%), one patient had associated arthritis and the other involvement of sacroiliac joint. Antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were found in none of the tested patients (20 and 13 respectively).

Blood cultures were performed in 17/30 patients (57%) and synovial fluid was analysed in 4 (13%). Both tests remained sterile in all patients. A bone biopsy was performed in 16 patients (53%), showing a mononuclear cell infiltration, mainly plasmocytes in most patients, which is a typical finding for severe chronic inflammation. In none of the cases there was a suspicion of malignancy. Bone biopsy was especially performed in older patients, at a time era where MRI was less available.

Consensus statements

All performed PICOs for the statements and the papers finally included for the level of evidence are mentioned in Appendix 4.
Patients presenting with clinical and radiological signs of peripheral bone infection or a positive probe-to-bone test may require further diagnostic procedures.

Level of evidence: 5

In case of clinical and radiological suspicion of peripheral bone infection, further diagnostic testing can be indicated to reveal severity and extent of the infection. Patients with acute peripheral bone infection can present with local pain, swelling, erythema, and warmth at the site of infection, and systemic symptoms such as fever and general illness. If a fistula is present, a probe to the bone test can be performed. In diabetic foot, this is indicative of bone infection, however, there is no literature supporting that statement in PBI. In general, in the acute phase with clear clinical signs, advanced imaging is often not necessary.

2 Fistula direct to the bone and purulent discharge are evidence of bone infection.

Level of evidence: 5

There are no articles that provide evidence for this statement. It is based on common medical reasoning; bacteria that normally are present as part of skin flora superficially spread and colonize the exposed bone thereby causing local infection.

3 CRP, ESR, and WBC counts should always be performed in patients suspected of having peripheral bone infection for diagnostic purposes.

Level of evidence: 4

In patients with PBI, raised ESR and CRP can be present, even if inconsistently, and can orientate versus a diagnosis of infection. White blood cell counts are more rarely increased. In patients with contiguous pedal osteomyelitis, the positive predictive value of ESR in diagnosing osteomyelitis in patients without diabetes was 78%, and in those with diabetes was 81%, with a negative predictive value 58 and 31%, respectively. The concentration of CRP might be more reliable for follow-up of the response to treatment. The role of serum procalcitonin was also evaluated in patients with acute PBI and a cut-off of 0.4 ng/ml was found to be a sensitive and specific marker in the diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis.
4 Blood cultures should be considered in patients with fever suspected of having peripheral bone infection for diagnosing the involved bacteria

### Sensitivity of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in childhood bone and joint infections [^24a2140f]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In addition to the examination of clinical signs, several laboratory markers have been measured for diagnostics and monitoring of pediatric septic bone and joint infections. Traditionally erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leukocyte cell count have been used, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP) has gained in popularity. We monitored 265 children at ages 3 months to 15 years with culture-positive osteoarticular infections with a predetermined series of ESR, CRP, and leukocyte count measurements. On admission, ESR exceeded 20 mm/hour in 94% and CRP exceeded 20 mg/L in 95% of the cases, the mean (± standard error of the mean) being 51 ± 2 mm/hour and 87 ± 4 mg/L, respectively. ESR normalized in 24 days and CRP in 10 days. Elevated CRP gave a slightly better sensitivity in diagnostics than ESR, but best sensitivity was gained with the combined use of ESR and CRP (98%). Elevated ESR or CRP was seen in all cases during the first 3 days. Measuring ESR and CRP on admission can help the clinician rule out an acute osteoarticular infection. CRP normalizes faster than ESR, providing a clear advantage in monitoring recovery.

Introduction: Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by sterile bone osteolytic lesions with a remitting and relapsing course.

Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of active disease over time in a multinational large series of CNO/CRMO patients enrolled in the Eurofever registry to help understand the need for transition care into adulthood.

Methods: Children from 19 countries who were < 18 years and diagnosed with CNO/CRMO were studied, and analysis of active disease was conducted in those who had follow-up visits and for whom treatment data was available. Remission was defined by the treating physician(s), and required discontinuation of therapy. Achievement of remission, number of flares, ongoing active disease and medications at final follow-up, were analyzed for patients > 10 years in 4 cohorts: a) 10- < 14 years; b) 14- < 16 years; c) 16- < 18 years and > 18 years.

Results: Complete disease activity information was available for 237 of 573 (41.4%) CNO/CRMO patients (138/237 [58.2%] female). The median [IQ range] age at disease onset for this cohort was 10.07 [7.94–11.81] years. By imaging, (175/237 (73.8%)), monofocal disease was present in 37/175 (21.1%) and multifocal in 138/175 (78.9%) patients at baseline. At disease diagnosis, elevated ESR was present in 166/232 (71.5%) of patients, and elevated CRP in 136/233 (58.4%). The median [IQ range] duration of follow-up was 25.4 [12.4–44.1] months. Eighty seven out of 237 (37%) of patients reached remission at least once during follow-up. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) of flares per patient was 2.3 (1.7) and did not differ between the age cohorts.

Conclusion

The primary laboratory predictor of those who failed with CAS was elevated ESR. Second, elevated PMN% and synovial WBC were determined to be the strongest indicators of PJI in a patient who was treated with antibiotics before diagnosis, whereas CRP and ESR were more likely to normalize. This suggests that patients with strong clinical suspicion for PJI on antibiotics should be aspirated regardless of normalized ESR and CRP.

Results

Demographics and clinical characteristics

The total number of patients with CNO followed in our center, with disease onset before 18 years of age, was 29. We excluded all patients with no vertebral or mandibular lesions and included the remaining 13.

Of the included 13 patients, six were male (46%). The mean age at symptom onset was 12.3 years (± 2.4; range 7–16). The mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 15.2 months (± 14.2; range 1–51). The mean time of follow-up was 5.0 years (± 2.7; range 1.5–11.0). Regarding symptoms presented during the disease course, all the patients with vertebral lesions complained of back pain, and only 18% had accompanying fever; all the patients with mandibular lesions had local pain and tumefaction, with no fever. Table 1 summarizes patient characteristics.

Table 1
Patient characteristics (n = 13)

CRP C-reactive protein, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IQR interquartile range, SD standard deviation

The first-line therapy for all patients consisted of NSAIDs, usually followed by corticosteroids (in 62% of all patients), then followed by more aggressive treatment such as bisphosphonates (in 62% of patients), classic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMRADs), anti-TNF-α agents, and non-anti-TNF-α Biological DMRADs.

Regarding inflammatory markers, CRP level was increased in 62% of patients with a mean value of 16.5 mg/L (± 14.9), and ESR was increased in 85% of patients with a mean value of 34.3 mm/h (± 16.4) (Table 1).

Biopsy was performed in seven patients (54%), with two showing features consistent with chronic osteomyelitis, four showing nonspecific findings, and one being inconclusive.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Antimicrobial duration for primary acute bacterial arthritis without adjacent osteomyelitis — In children with confirmed primary ABA with rapid clinical improvement and consistent, progressive decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) by the end of the first week of treatment, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days for common pathogens (S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae type b), rather than longer courses of 21 to 28 days (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In children with presumed primary ABA without adjacent osteomyelitis meeting the same response criteria, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days rather than for longer courses (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Comment language states that for slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP, courses of therapy of 21 to 28 days may be preferred, that longer durations may be more commonly required for pathogens with relatively less antibiotic susceptibility or greater virulence, and that children with ABA with adjacent osteomyelitis should be treated according to the osteomyelitis guideline.

IDSA 2015 native vertebral osteomyelitis — suspected treatment failure evaluation and management is addressed as follows: In patients with NVO and clinical and radiographic evidence of treatment failure, we suggest obtaining additional tissue samples for microbiologic and histopathologic examination, either by image-guided aspiration biopsy or through surgical sampling (weak, very low), and we suggest consultation with a spine surgeon and an infectious diseases physician (weak, very low). The most consistent finding in NVO treatment failure is persistent or recurrent severe back pain, and patients with persistent or progressive pain, systemic symptoms of infection, undrained or partially drained large epidural abscess, or persistently elevated systemic inflammatory markers may be at highest risk for treatment failure. There are limited data to guide evaluation; obtaining systemic inflammatory markers and a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may confirm the risk of treatment failure, while the frequency and utility of follow-up inflammatory laboratory markers during antimicrobial therapy have not been established. In NVO patients with suspected treatment failure in whom surgical debridement is not planned, one should consider image-guided aspiration biopsy to definitively establish the diagnosis and confirm microbiologic etiology; for culture-negative NVO with suspected treatment failure, we recommend undertaking additional attempts to isolate an etiologic pathogen, including tissue for histopathology; aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures; and fungal, brucellar, and mycobacterial cultures, and in select circumstances, serologic assays for uncommon causes should be considered as well.

### Postoperative prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with surgically treated pyogenic spondylodiscitis: a surrogate endpoint for early postoperative mortality [^f04c005a]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

All consecutive patients with the ICD code diagnosis of discitis or pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis with infection of the intervertebral disc aged ≥ 18 years who had undergone surgical procedures with instrumentation and/or fusion for PSD at the authors' neurosurgical department between 2012 and 2018 were entered into a computerized database (SPSS, version 25, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). Information collected for each patient included sociodemographic characteristics, location of the spinal infectious disease, number of affected spinal levels, and neurological status at admission among others. Indication for an open surgical procedure was given in case of neurological impairment, osseous destruction with spinal instability/deformity or stenosis of spinal canal and compression of neuronal structures, relevant epidural empyema and/or ventral/paravertebral abscess inaccessible for puncture, failure of conservative treatment with progressive disease, or intractable pain.

Depending on the site, extent and severity of the infectious spinal disease dorsolateral as well as ventral approaches were performed. In case of severe instability, a decision for a staged procedure (360° stabilization) was made. Pathogen detection was defined as positive microbiological cultivation out of preoperatively taken blood cultures and/or out of intraoperatively obtained bone or disc samples with pathogen-specific resistograms. In case of unsuccessful germ cultivation, diagnosis of PSD was made by means of histopathological pathogen detection from intraoperative bone and/or disc samples as well as consistent correlation of radiological signs, systemic inflammatory blood values, and intraoperative macroscopic and microscopic tissue appearance. In case of successful germ detection, a specific antimicrobial therapy was started in accordance to pathogen-specific resistograms. In some patients with septic constellations and/or preexisting antibiotic therapy, empirical and broad antibiotic therapy was necessary. Antibiotics were administered intravenously at least in the first 2 weeks with subsequent potential oralization after C-reactive protein (CRP) dropping below 10 mg/L. A minimum of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy was standard. Selection of the antimicrobial therapy according to the pathogen spectrum and resistogram occurred in close consultation with the local Institute of Microbiology.

Osteomyelitis With PJI

There is no established, accurate referent standard diagnostic test for PJI. Certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging studies for PJI (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2); however, given the limitations of individual tests, published algorithms are sometimes recommended to establish the diagnosis. Data are limited and inadequate to compare the relative accuracies of competing algorithms. Practically, the diagnosis is typically made from a combination of history, physical examination, imaging studies to assess alternate causes of pain and instability, inflammatory markers, synovial fluid analysis, and/or operative specimens. Molecular diagnostic testing is a promising approach, but data are mixed and inadequate to recommend for or against its use as of 2022.

Question 2: What Is the Appropriate Management for Osteomyelitis Underlying a Pressure Ulcer?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Observational studies indicate that imaging and inflammatory biomarkers are not diagnostically accurate for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer and we do not recommend their routine use for this purpose. Antibiotics have not been shown to be of benefit (and may be of harm) in the absence of surgical wound closure, but osteomyelitis may increase the risk of surgical flap failure. Therefore, it may be preferable to avoid the routine use of antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer unless deep bone biopsy confirms osteomyelitis and surgical wound closure is planned, or the patient has accompanying sepsis syndrome or local soft tissue infection. Irrespective of antibiotic use, a multimodal therapeutic approach includes nutritional optimization, wound debridement and care, pressure off-loading, and psychosocial management.

Question 3: When Should Empirical Therapy Be Administered in the Treatment of Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Some observational studies suggest that administration of antibiotics prior to bone biopsy or surgical management may modestly decrease yield of bone cultures for patients with osteomyelitis, including DFO and PJI. Thus, presuming other microbiological methods (eg, blood cultures) have not already established a microbial etiology, it is reasonable to consider deferring antimicrobial therapy initiation until bone and/or joint microbiological samples are obtained for clinically stable patients. However, other studies are not concordant, and histopathology results are unlikely to be affected by prior short-term antibiotics. Decisions regarding the delay of empirical therapy therefore balance potential harm due to the risk of progression of life-threatening infection (eg, sepsis) or impending spinal cord compression against the potential benefit of microbiological data.

Question 4: Are There Preferred Antibiotics With Which to Treat Osteomyelitis?

3. CRP and ESR should always be performed in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection. A normal value does not rule out PJI.

Level of evidence: 2.

Patients presenting with clinical signs of prosthetic joint infection (i.e. fever, unexplained pain at the site of arthroplasty, prosthetic loosening, or a sinus tract) should be subjected to screening for inflammatory markers in serum. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are good preliminary tests. Screening of these markers can be performed rapidly, inexpensively, and with minimal inconvenience. Although there is considerable variation in sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for both CRP (SE 21–100%, SP 20–96%) and ESR (SE 58–97%, SP 33–90.9%), in general they show good diagnostic value, and are of relevance particularly for therapy follow-up. A threshold of 10 mg/l for CRP and 30 mm/h for ESR of is recommended for diagnostic purposes. One level 1 study and 32 level 2 studies addressed the diagnostic efficacy of CRP and ESR in serum. However, when testing for CRP and ESR, one should keep in mind that both markers can be influenced by numerous factors (i.e. neoplastic and inflammatory conditions, age, and technical details). Furthermore, CRP is produced in the liver, and especially in low-grade chronic PJI, levels may not be elevated. Therefore, a careful history and physical examination are mandatory. Several studies suggest using the combination of ESR and CRP. In any case, if one of these markers is above the threshold, further diagnostic tests should be performed. Low CRP and ESR do not rule out PJI.

Osteomyelitis patients versus children with other acute onset musculoskeletal features

Figure 2 shows the ROC curves for ESR, CRP, WBC, neutrophils and platelet counts when used to discriminate between patients with and without osteomyelitis. ESR had the highest ROC AUC (.754; 95% CI.680–.828), followed by CRP (.638; 95% CI.545–731).

Figure 2
ROC curves of laboratory tests used during the first visit to discriminate between patients with osteomyelitis (n = 37) and patients without osteomyelitis (n = 392). The curves plot the relationship between the true positive rate (Sensitivity, y-axis) and the false positive rate (1 - Specificity, x-axis) at different cut-off titers. The higher the cut-off titer that is chosen, the lower the sensitivity and the higher the specificity, and visa versa. The diagonal reference line (area under curve (AUC) = .5), indicates no discrimination. The greater the distance of the curve from the diagonal, the higher the overall discriminative ability of the test.

Among the laboratory variables, ESR ≥ 40 mm/hr had the highest positive predictive value at 26% for identifying patients with osteomyelitis (Additional file 1). ESR < 20 mm/hr had the lowest positive predictive value at 3%.

Nineteen (51%) of the 37 osteomyelitis patients were girls. The median age at presentation was 4.3 years (Additional file 3). In addition to clinical signs and symptoms the diagnosis of osteomyelitis was based on bone biopsy and MRI in 11 patients (2 had a negative culture but were positive on histology), on MRI alone in 24 patients and on bone scan alone in 2 patients (MRI and/or bone biopsy not assessed). One of the patients received corticosteroids due to adrenocortical insufficiency, and another child had C2 immunodeficiency.

Patients with osteomyelitis had a longer history of symptoms than patients with septic arthritis or skin infection or non-septic arthritis (p < .001, p = .001). The period between the first physician visit and the first hospital visit was longer for patients with osteomyelitis than for patients with septic arthritis or skin infection or non-septic arthritis (p < .001, p = .001). ESR and CRP were higher in patients with osteomyelitis than in patients with non-septic arthritis or patients with other conditions (p < .001). The presenting symptom, clinical examination and bone involvement in the osteomyelitis patients are presented in Additional file 4.

### Factors associated with treatment response in chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis at a single center: a retrospective cohort study [^bcfb249c]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment protocol

Patients were treated per the algorithm outlined in Fig. 1. Unless a patient had spinal involvement or a comorbidity such as JIA or IBD, patients were initially treated with an NSAID. Response to NSAIDs was defined as resolution of symptoms as well as when applicable, resolution of physical examination findings, elevations in inflammatory markers, and/or imaging changes consistent with active CNO. Typically, a patient needed to fail at least two NSAIDs before a second-line agent was prescribed. Patients who responded to NSAIDs were treated for approximately six months before discontinuing treatment if the patient's disease became inactive while on NSAID treatment. If the patient's symptoms recurred after treatment discontinuation, then the discontinued NSAID was resumed. If the patient's disease became inactive, the NSAID was continued for an additional year and then discontinued again. If the patient experienced a return of CNO symptoms after the second time discontinuing the NSAID, then the NSAID would either be resumed, or a second-line agent was started. If a patient developed comorbidities or active spinal lesions at any point in treatment, then second-line medications were reconsidered. Treatment features noted in this study included medications used, dates of use, as well as the date of and reason for discontinuation when applicable.

Categorization of treatment requirement outcomes

To determine which clinical variables were associated with an increased likelihood of a patient requiring a second-line treatment versus NSAID monotherapy, patients were categorized into three groups. The first group, NSAID-short, was composed of patients who were treated with one or more NSAIDs at routine anti-inflammatory dosing for at least three months, but less than seven months. The second group, NSAID-long, was composed of patients who were treated with NSAIDs for a total of seven months or longer due to persistent disease activity (determined by history and exam, and/or imaging) or because they experienced a return of symptoms following a trial of stopping NSAIDs. The third group of patients were those treated with one or more second-line CNO treatments at any time point. This third group included patients who failed or were intolerant of NSAID-monotherapy as well as those had active spinal involvement or a comorbidity that prompted use of a second-line agent.

### 2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [^f9b05028]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline — native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) in adults — notes that NVO is often the result of hematogenous seeding of the adjacent disc space from a distant focus, as the disc is avascular, and the diagnosis can often be delayed several months and initially misdiagnosed as a degenerative process. NVO is typically diagnosed in the setting of recalcitrant back pain unresponsive to conservative measures and elevated inflammatory markers with or without fever. Radiographs of the spine are not sensitive for the early diagnosis of NVO, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is often required to establish the diagnosis. Except in septic patients or patients with neurologic compromise, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be withheld, when possible, until a microbiologic diagnosis is confirmed; an image-guided or intraoperative aspiration or biopsy of a disc space or vertebral endplate sample submitted for microbiologic and pathologic examination often establishes the microbiologic or pathologic diagnosis of NVO. NVO is commonly monomicrobial and most frequently due to Staphylococcus aureus, and the concomitant presence of S. aureus bloodstream infection within the preceding 3 months and compatible spine MRI changes preclude the need for a disc space aspiration in most patients. Definitive therapy should be based on the results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing, and the majority of patients are cured with a 6-week course of antimicrobial therapy.

### Use of C-reactive protein after spinal surgery: comparison with erythrocyte sedimentation rate as predictor of early postoperative infectious complications [^7e0343ef]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

This is a prospective observational study of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a cohort of patients undergoing spinal surgery.

Objective

We sought to characterize the normal kinetics of ESR and CRP after spinal surgery and compare their usefulness as predictors of infectious complications in the early postoperative period.

Summary Of Background Data

ESR and CRP are nonspecific markers of inflammation used to evaluate postoperative infection. CRP is a quantitative test that exhibits predictable kinetics consisting of a postoperative rise and a peak followed by a decrease toward the normal value. Deviation from normal kinetics may be an indicator of infection.

Methods

ESR and CRP were collected before surgery and daily after surgery in consecutive patients. All infectious complications were recorded.

Results

One hundred forty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Infectious complications occurred in 20 patients. A postoperative peak, which is necessary to apply the test, was observed in 78% of patients for CRP and 48% for ESR. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed preoperative CRP, number of levels, and lumbar region as significant predictors of greater CRP peak value (r = 0.435, P = 0.001). After the peak, CRP showed an exponential decrease with a half-life of 2.6 days (r = 0.701, P < 0.001). No trend could be determined for ESR. A second rise or failure to decrease as expected had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 82%, 48%, 41%, and 86% for infectious complications, respectively. Of 8 cases of deep wound infection, 7 exhibited substantial deviations from expected CRP values.

Conclusion

CRP is more applicable, predictable, and responsive in the early postoperative period compared with ESR. The postoperative kinetics of CRP derived in this study seems to be conserved regardless of operation, magnitude, or region. Knowledge of the kinetics allows assessment of the degree of difference between actual and expected values. Using a second rise or failure to decrease as expected for CRP is sensitive for infection. A negative test is reassuring that infection is unlikely.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^736a9dd9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

WikiGuidelines represent a novel approach to guideline construction, clearly delineating evidenced-based recommendations from opinions based on lower-quality data. Resulting changes in management of pyogenic osteomyelitis include recognizing the low value and high burden that plain x-rays incur if routinely ordered for all patients, reducing the routine ordering of low value, low accuracy blood biomarkers, increasing adoption of oral therapy, and limiting the duration of therapy to the shortest necessary for optimizing cure.

These guidelines are based on published data available as of March 1, 2022. Clinicians who believe other evidence should be considered may contact any of the authors to initiate possible revisions, which the authors intend to complete in close to real-time. The authors understand that no clinical trial can extrapolate to all possible patient care scenarios. Thus, we expect that these guidelines should not establish medicolegal standards of care or replace clinician judgment for individual patients.

### Surgical site infection in spinal surgery: detection and management based on serial C-reactive protein measurements [^3d2ec9c1]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Object

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-known sensitive laboratory parameter that shows an increase within 6 hours after the onset of bacterial infection. In relation to surgery, a normal CRP response is a rapid increase followed by a gradual reduction, eventually returning to the normal range. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic significance of CRP as a detector for early onset surgical site infection in spinal surgery and to discuss effective medical treatment through clinical interpretation and application of the measured CRP values.

Methods

A prospective study was performed in 348 consecutive cases involving patients who underwent spinal surgery under general anesthesia between February and September 2008. Blood samples were obtained preoperatively and on postoperative Days 1, 3, and 5 in patients undergoing single-level decompression surgery. An additional blood specimen was obtained at postoperative Day 7 in patients requiring more extensive surgeries. Recorded laboratory results were compared with the patients' clinical course to determine the diagnostic significance of CRP. All of the patients received intravenous prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Once an abnormal response of CRP, indicated by a tendency toward continuous elevation, was noted on Day 5 or Day 7, the prophylactic antibiotics were replaced with another regimen and administration was resumed along with careful observation for signs of surgical site infection.

Results

Monitoring of CRP revealed a characteristic increase and decrease pattern in 332 of 348 patients (95.4%) showing a normal clinical course with regard to early infectious complications. The mean measured CRP (reference range < 4 mg/L) averaged 14.9 ± 20.3 mg/L on Day 1, 15.4 ± 25.1 mg/L on Day 3, and 7.9 ± 13.3 mg/L on Day 5. In contrast, there were 16 cases (4.6%) of abnormal CRP responses resulting in the resumption of intravenous antibiotic treatment, which included a second rise (in 12 cases) and a steady rise (in 4) in the CRP value. Five (1.4%) of 16 patients experienced infectious complications related to spinal surgery. Three patients (0.9%) received long-term antibiotic therapy for 4–6 weeks; however, all patients recovered with medical treatment alone and did not experience gross wound disruption or subsequent discitis. As a predictor for early wound infection, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for abnormal CRP responses were calculated as 100%, 96.8%, 31.3%, and 100%, respectively.

Conclusions

The above results demonstrate that CRP screening is a simple and reliable test for the detection of early infectious complications after spinal surgery. Close observation and appropriate medical management should be performed in a timely fashion when abnormal CRP responses are observed at 5 or 7 days after surgery.

We used multiple linear regression analysis to test whether rise in inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), time to diagnosis, age or gender significantly predicted the total number of bony sites involved at diagnosis. Preliminary analysis did not reveal any violation of the assumptions of normality, linearity, multicolinearity or homoscedasticity. The results of the regression indicated that the four predictors explained only 11.2% of the variance (R² = 0.11, F (1.692), P = 0.14). Elevation of inflammatory markers significantly predicted the number of sites (β = 0.250, P = 0.045). Neither age (β = 0.186, P = 0.132) nor gender (β = 0.103, P = 0.387) nor disease duration (β = 0.025, P = 0.841) predicted the number of involved bone sites significantly.

### Childhood osteomyelitis: imaging characteristics [^610f2374]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Complications and outcome

A complication of osteomyelitis can be the development of an abscess, typically known as Brodie's abscess. Also the development of sequesters, fistulas and sinus tract lesions can be seen. Although CT and MR imaging is useful in delineating the extension of abnormalities, it is difficult to differentiate between an active or an inactive focus of osteomyelitis. In these cases, PET-CT, which has a high sensitivity for disease activity, might play a role. Other reported complications are septic arthritis, slipped epiphysis, damage of the physis causing early closing of the physis and eventually leading to growth retardation, or angulation deformation in the long bones.

Principles of treatment

Ideally treatment is based on the isolation of the pathogen from the focus of infection or blood. If this is not possible, empirical treatment, consisting of intravenous antibiotics in haematogenous osteomyelitis, should be started. Once the pathogen is known, treatment should be changed if needed. This approach has been shown to be effective, resulting in a cure rate of over 95%. In a systematic review, no significant difference was found between a short (less than 7 days) and a long (1 week or longer) course of intravenous antimicrobial therapy when the clinical cure rate at 6 months was the primary outcome variable.

Surgical intervention is used as an adjunct to antibacterial treatment. The aim of surgery should be to drain intra-osseous abscesses, removal of sequestra and debridement of adjoining infectious foci. Interventional radiology plays a role in percutaneous drainage of soft-tissue abscesses. Duration of therapy depends on the effect of therapy and surgical intervention.

Poly-microbacterial infections give rise to more complications. Response to treatment is often monitored by ESR and CRP. Follow-up imaging may be used to evaluate complications.
