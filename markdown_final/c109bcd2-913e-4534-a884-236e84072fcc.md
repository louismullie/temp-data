## Question

Why doesnt aspirin work as dvt prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why aspirin "doesn't work" for DVT prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic fit between aspirin's antiplatelet action and the fibrin-driven biology of venous thrombosis. Then, I should review historical trial data and early guidelines that recommended against aspirin for broad VTE prophylaxis. Next, I will examine contemporary evidence where aspirin appears effective, especially after joint arthroplasty, and verify any misattributed trials. After that, I should consider cancer and other niche settings. I will also weigh bleeding risk and practicality. Finally, I need to reconcile current guideline positions and synthesize a nuanced, clinically applicable answer with dosing and duration considerations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic issue before drawing conclusions. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and lowers thromboxane A2, reducing platelet aggregation, which is ideal for platelet-rich arterial clots; however, venous thrombi are predominantly fibrin-rich and generated by activation of the coagulation cascade, where anticoagulants targeting factor Xa or thrombin provide more direct suppression of thrombogenesis, so there is an inherent mechanistic mismatch that limits aspirin's effectiveness as universal VTE prophylaxis.

> I need to check the historical recommendations to avoid overstating recent enthusiasm. Early authoritative guidelines from ACCP unequivocally recommended against aspirin alone for any patient group for thromboprophylaxis, reflecting evidence of inferiority to anticoagulants in general medical and surgical populations, and favoring heparins or fondaparinux instead, which established the conservative baseline many clinicians remember today [^111WxCnk] [^117Ad1YL] [^114AzfNr] [^113mZyFL].

> Now, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that "aspirin never works"; I will now examine contexts where it does. Contemporary randomized trials and meta-analyses in hip and knee arthroplasty show that aspirin-based strategies can be noninferior to oral anticoagulants for symptomatic VTE when used in pragmatic, multimodal postoperative pathways, with very low event rates observed in both arms, which challenges the older blanket prohibition in this specific surgical setting [^112ctz3W] [^115qy8Xh] [^116nA1KN] [^114qAEEb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, the reasoning mentioned the EINSTEIN CHOICE trial as if it were an arthroplasty study; I should double-check that. That was a study of extended secondary prevention after prior VTE and actually demonstrated superiority of rivaroxaban over aspirin, not arthroplasty prophylaxis; the arthroplasty trial showing noninferiority after an initial 5 days of rivaroxaban is the 2018 NEJM Anderson study, so I need to correct that attribution to avoid misleading the context [^112ctz3W].

> Next, I should review oncology and other niche indications. In cancer, guidelines endorse aspirin prophylaxis primarily for selected lower-risk multiple myeloma patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy, while recent observational data suggest adjuvant low-dose aspirin atop standard anticoagulation may reduce short-term VTE recurrence, though confounding and bleeding risk warrant caution; outside these niches, routine substitution of aspirin for anticoagulation in cancer-associated VTE is not recommended [^116mH6Cn] [^115LnEHw] [^1158LuUo].

> Let me consider other special populations to ensure completeness. In asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibody positivity, low-dose aspirin is used for arterial and pregnancy-related risk reduction, but for confirmed VTE in antiphospholipid syndrome therapeutic anticoagulation is preferred over DOACs, and aspirin is not a substitute for treatment-phase or most prophylaxis needs in this group, so I should be careful not to overgeneralize its role here [^115iFGzk] [^117JPitE].

> But wait, what if clinicians are thinking about aspirin for acutely ill medical inpatients or for initial VTE treatment? I should verify the guidance. For initial and extended treatment of DVT/PE, anticoagulation is recommended over aspirin; in medically ill inpatients and in COVID-19 guidance for LMICs, heparins are recommended and aspirin is discouraged for inpatient VTE prophylaxis, underscoring that aspirin "fails" in these higher-risk, non-orthopedic medical settings [^114NWYuG] [^114AzfNr] [^111VqFkS].

> I will now examine bleeding risk because safety often drives agent selection postoperatively. Aspirin generally carries lower major bleeding rates than full-dose anticoagulation in extended secondary prevention (e.g. INSPIRE), and arthroplasty meta-analyses show no significant bleeding disadvantage versus LMWH, which helps explain why aspirin carves out a niche when bleeding and wound concerns are paramount; still, I need to acknowledge that absolute differences can be small and setting-dependent [^116L2h36] [^112o5cXP].

> Next, I should review the most recent guideline positions to reconcile perceived inconsistencies. CHEST 2016 and 2021 suggest considering aspirin for extended prevention after unprovoked VTE when anticoagulation is stopped, but they prefer reduced-dose DOACs over aspirin when extended anticoagulation is indicated; ASH 2020 also recommends anticoagulation over aspirin for extended therapy; oncology guidance limits aspirin use to defined lower-risk multiple myeloma scenarios, reflecting a nuanced, context-dependent endorsement rather than a universal approval [^113snL8X] [^113udtMh] [^115z3V86] [^114NWYuG] [^116mH6Cn] [^115LnEHw].

> Hold on, I should verify practical dosing in the orthopedic niche because this often guides real-world use. Low-dose aspirin (typically 81 mg once or twice daily) appears comparable to higher doses for arthroplasty prophylaxis, and 4 weeks of therapy is commonly used with early mobilization and, in some protocols, brief initial anticoagulation or adjunct mechanical compression; the 2018 NEJM trial used 5 days of rivaroxaban before switching to 81 mg aspirin, which mirrors many institutional pathways and may partly explain the favorable outcomes seen with aspirin-based strategies [^11548fEi] [^114YN2Bf] [^116wMnbD] [^11229RTm] [^112ctz3W].

> Let me synthesize and make sure the logic holds against the evidence base. Aspirin "doesn't work" as universal DVT prophylaxis because it targets platelets rather than the coagulation cascade that drives venous thrombosis, and historical trials and guidelines showed inferiority to heparins or DOACs in broad medical and surgical populations; however, aspirin "does work" in specific contexts — most notably after hip or knee arthroplasty within multimodal pathways and for extended secondary prevention after unprovoked VTE when anticoagulation is discontinued — supported by modern trials, meta-analyses, and guideline nuance, though when extended anticoagulation is indicated, reduced-dose DOACs are preferred over aspirin [^117Ad1YL] [^112ctz3W] [^115qy8Xh] [^116nA1KN] [^115KMU44] [^113udtMh] [^115z3V86] [^116L2h36].

> Finally, I should confirm the clinical bottom line to avoid misapplication. Aspirin is not appropriate for initial treatment of acute DVT/PE and is inadequate for prophylaxis in acutely ill medical inpatients; its role is niche, favored when bleeding risk, cost, convenience, and very low absolute VTE rates make it an acceptable trade-off, whereas anticoagulants remain the standard in most other settings, particularly where the thrombotic milieu is strongly coagulation cascade–driven or VTE risk is high [^114NWYuG] [^114AzfNr] [^111VqFkS] [^112ctz3W] [^115qy8Xh].

---

Aspirin is **not recommended for DVT prophylaxis** because it only inhibits platelet aggregation and does not adequately suppress the coagulation cascade, which is the primary driver of venous thrombosis. Clinical trials show aspirin is **less effective than anticoagulants** (LMWH, DOACs) for DVT prevention [^116L2h36], especially in high-risk patients, and guidelines recommend anticoagulants over aspirin for primary prophylaxis [^117Ad1YL]. Aspirin may be considered for low-risk orthopedic patients [^112ctz3W] or for secondary prevention after stopping anticoagulation [^113udtMh] [^113snL8X] [^115KMU44], but it is **not sufficient for primary DVT prevention** in most clinical settings.

---

## Mechanism of action and limitations

For the **mechanism of action**, aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2–mediated platelet aggregation [^112Q278A]. Regarding **limitations**, venous thrombosis is driven by activation of the coagulation cascade (fibrin formation), not platelets; aspirin does not significantly inhibit thrombin or fibrin and therefore does not address the main pathophysiology of DVT.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

In **clinical trials**, aspirin is less effective than anticoagulants (LMWH, DOACs) for DVT prevention, particularly in high-risk patients [^116hy2Ph] [^113Hv5Nx]. Guidelines from ACCP and ASH recommend **anticoagulants over aspirin** for primary DVT prophylaxis [^117Ad1YL]; aspirin may be considered for secondary prevention after stopping anticoagulation in selected patients [^113udtMh] [^115z3V86].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios

In **orthopedic surgery**, aspirin may be considered for low-risk patients after joint arthroplasty [^112ctz3W] [^1136D5sG], but anticoagulants are preferred for high-risk patients [^116hy2Ph]. In **medical patients**, aspirin is **not recommended for primary DVT prophylaxis** in hospitalized patients [^114AzfNr] [^111VqFkS]; anticoagulants are preferred [^111EwY4R].

---

## Conclusion

Aspirin is **not recommended for primary DVT prophylaxis** because it does not adequately inhibit the coagulation cascade and is less effective than anticoagulants in clinical studies [^116hy2Ph] [^116L2h36]. It may be considered for secondary prevention after stopping anticoagulation in selected patients [^115KMU44] [^113udtMh], but **anticoagulants remain the preferred option for primary prophylaxis**.

This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggestions imply that individual patient values may lead to different choices. For a full discussion of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al.

Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following:

- **Hospital strategy**: We recommend that every hospital develop a formal strategy that addresses the prevention of VTE (Grade 1A).

- **Aspirin use**: We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A).

- **Mechanical methods**: Mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis should be used primarily for patients at high bleeding risk (Grade 1A) or possibly as an adjunct to anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2A).

- **Major general surgery**: For patients undergoing major general surgery, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A).

- **Gynecologic/urologic surgery**: We recommend routine thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery or major, open urologic procedures (Grade 1A for both groups) with LMWH, LDUH, fondaparinux, or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC).

- **Elective hip/knee arthroplasty**: For patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist.

### Extended treatment of venous thromboembolism: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116L2h36]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulant regimens and aspirin for the extended treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and conference proceedings for randomized controlled trials studying vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), or aspirin for the secondary prevention of VTE beyond three months. Odds ratios (95% credible intervals) between treatments were estimated using random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Sixteen studies, totaling more than 22,000 patients, were included. Compared with placebo or observation and with aspirin, respectively, the risk of recurrent VTE was lower with standard-intensity VKAs (0.15 [0.08 to 0.24] and 0.23 [0.09 to 0.54]), low-dose factor Xa inhibitors (0.16 [0.06 to 0.38] and 0.25 [0.09 to 0.66]), standard-dose factor Xa inhibitors (0.17 [0.08 to 0.33] and 0.27 [0.11 to 0.65]), and the direct thrombin inhibitor (0.15 [0.04 to 0.37] and 0.23 [0.06 to 0.74]). However, the risk of major bleeding was higher with standard-intensity VKAs (4.42 [1.99 to 12.24] and 4.14 [1.17 to 18.86]). Effect estimates were consistent in male patients and those with index pulmonary embolism or with unprovoked VTE and in sensitivity analyses. In addition, compared with placebo or observation, the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced with standard-intensity VKAs (0.44 [0.20 to 0.87]) and low-dose factor Xa inhibitors (0.38 [0.12 to 0.995]).

- **Conclusions**: Standard-intensity VKAs and DOACs are more efficacious than aspirin for extended VTE treatment. Despite a higher risk of major bleeding, the overall benefits make these treatments preferable.

- **Primary VTE outcomes**: In the entire cohort, the risk of VTE following joint replacement surgery was not significantly different in patients treated with aspirin compared with oral anticoagulants (OACs) (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.32; p = 0.255). There was no heterogeneity among the included studies (I² = 0%, p = 0.455). After excluding the trial with the greatest weight, which contributed most of the data to the analysis and was based on a noninferiority design, the pooled result remained consistent (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.75; I² = 0%; p = 0.202). The pooled risk of DVT among the patients treated with aspirin was not significantly different compared with that of the OAC group (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.40; I² = 4.4%; p = 0.299). Similarly, there was no difference in the risk of PE in the aspirin group compared with the OAC group (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.71; I² = 0%; p = 0.700).

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: Second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113Xpz9Z]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

This is the second update to the ninth edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

- **Methods**: We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

- **Results**: The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations. These cover aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the ninth edition (2012) or first update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the first update.

- **Conclusion**: New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

### Compliance with recommended prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism: Improving the use and rate of uptake of clinical practice guidelines [^114VLniG]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Although several authoritative, evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been published, the use of VTE prophylaxis in routine clinical practice varies markedly. Even in orthopedic surgery, which most often requires prophylaxis, a significant proportion of surgeons do not use routine prophylaxis. When prophylaxis is used, guideline recommendations are often not followed.

A number of factors may contribute to the under-use of guidelines. **Physician-related factors**: Include a lack of awareness of, or familiarity with, the guidelines; a perception that VTE is not a significant problem or that VTE prophylaxis is ineffective; and concern about potential bleeding risks. The guidelines may also be perceived as too complicated or difficult to apply in a routine manner. **Resource-related barriers**: A lack of facilities or resources may also present a barrier to the implementation of guidelines.

A number of strategies are being investigated in an attempt to improve compliance with guidelines for VTE prophylaxis. For example, the Investigators Against Thromboembolism (INATE) initiative has developed a simplified pocket guideline on VTE prophylaxis in orthopedic and trauma surgery to raise awareness of the guideline recommendations.

### Adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aspirin on short-term outcomes of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^1158LuUo]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The primary outcome, which was VTE recurrence, occurred in 13 of 423 patients (3.1%) in the aspirin group and in 55 of 846 patients (6.5%) in the non-aspirin group (HR 0.546, 95% CI [0.298–0.988], P = 0.011). The isolated PE, PE with DVT, and isolated DVT were 4 (30.8%), 2 (15.4%), and 7 (53.8%) in the aspirin group and 13 (23.6%), 16 (29.1%), and 26 (47.3%) in the non-aspirin group, respectively (P = 0.590). Pairwise comparison demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in the proportion of each type of VTE recurrence between the two groups. The time-dependent occurrence of VTE recurrence is shown in Figure 2A (log rank P = 0.046).

### Thromboprophylaxis in nonsurgical patients [^114AzfNr]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in medically ill patients. Randomized controlled trials indicate that pharmacologic prophylaxis reduces deep venous thrombosis (relative risk [RR] = 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.59) and pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33–0.72), with a nonsignificant trend toward more bleeding (RR = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.80–2.33). Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin are equally efficacious in preventing deep venous thrombosis (RR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69–1.06) and pulmonary embolism (RR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.47–2.38), but LMWH is associated with significantly less major bleeding (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23–0.85). LMWH is favored for VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients. New VTE and bleeding risk stratification tools offer the potential to improve the risk-benefit ratio for VTE prophylaxis in medically ill patients.

- **Intermittent pneumatic compression devices**: Should be used for VTE prophylaxis in patients with contraindications to pharmacologic prophylaxis.
- **Graduated compression stockings**: Should be used with caution.

VTE prevention in medically ill patients using extended-duration VTE prophylaxis and new oral anticoagulants warrants further investigation. VTE prophylaxis prescription and administration rates are suboptimal and warrant multidisciplinary performance improvement strategies.

### Aspirin or rivaroxaban for VTE prophylaxis after hip or knee arthroplasty [^112ctz3W]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Clinical trials and meta-analyses have suggested that aspirin may be effective for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) after total hip or total knee arthroplasty. However, comparisons with direct oral anticoagulants are lacking for prophylaxis beyond hospital discharge.

- **Methods**: We performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. All patients received once-daily oral rivaroxaban (10 mg) until postoperative day 5 and were then randomly assigned to either continue rivaroxaban or switch to aspirin (81 mg daily) for an additional 9 days after total knee arthroplasty or for 30 days after total hip arthroplasty. Patients were followed for 90 days for symptomatic venous thromboembolism (the primary effectiveness outcome) and bleeding complications, including major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (the primary safety outcome).

- **Results**: A total of 3424 patients (1804 undergoing total hip arthroplasty and 1620 undergoing total knee arthroplasty) were enrolled in the trial. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 11 of 1707 patients (0.64%) in the aspirin group and in 12 of 1717 patients (0.70%) in the rivaroxaban group (difference, 0.06 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -0.55 to 0.66; P < 0.001 for noninferiority and P = 0.84 for superiority). Major bleeding complications occurred in 8 patients (0.47%) in the aspirin group and in 5 (0.29%) in the rivaroxaban group (difference, 0.18 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.65 to…

### No difference between low- and regular-dose aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after THA [^114YN2Bf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Low credibility.

Aspirin is established as an effective prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip arthroplasty (THA); however, there is no consensus as to whether low- or regular-dose aspirin is more effective at preventing VTE.

- **Questions/purposes**: (1) Is there a difference in the incidence of symptomatic VTE within 90 days of elective THA using low-dose aspirin compared with regular-dose aspirin? (2) Is there a difference in the risk of significant bleeding (gastrointestinal and wound bleeding) and mortality between low- and standard-dose aspirin within 90 days after surgery?

- **Methods**: We retrospectively evaluated 7,488 patients in our database who underwent THA between September 2012 and December 2016. A total of 3,936 (53%) patients received aspirin alone for VTE prophylaxis after THA. During the study period, aspirin was prescribed as a monotherapy for VTE prophylaxis after surgery in low-risk patients (no history of VTE, recent orthopaedic surgery, hypercoagulable state, or history of cardiac arrhythmia requiring anticoagulation, or receiving anticoagulation for any other medical conditions before surgery). Patients were excluded if aspirin use was contraindicated because of peptic ulcer disease, intolerance, or other reasons. Patients received aspirin twice daily (BID) for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery and were grouped into two cohorts: a low-dose (81 mg BID) aspirin group (n = 1,033) and a standard-dose (325 mg BID) aspirin group (n = 2,903). The primary endpoint was symptomatic VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]). Secondary endpoints included significant bleeding.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^117ETBic]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

For patients where the use of heparin products is contraindicated, mechanical prevention with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices or graduated compression stockings (GCS) are non-pharmacologic options for VTE prophylaxis. A systematic review conducted before the era of COVID-19, which included 70 trials (two from Turkey and two from China, both upper-middle-income countries) involving 16,164 patients found that IPC reduced VTE occurrence compared to no IPC prophylaxis, with a reduced risk of bleeding. The same review demonstrated that adding pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC further reduced the risk of DVT compared to IPC alone, emphasizing the importance of transitioning to pharmacologic prophylaxis as soon as the bleeding risk is reduced.

However, the opposite approach — adding mechanical prophylaxis to pharmacological prophylaxis — was not found to be beneficial in a recent randomized control trial involving non–COVID-19 patients. We were unable to identify any study from either high-income countries (HICs) or low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that reported on the use of mechanical prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients. Reports around the world also show that mechanical thromboprophylaxis is not widely used.

Although aspirin may be cheap and widely available in LMIC settings, the safety and efficacy of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis remain unknown. In those with cardiovascular disease, a recent cohort study of 412 COVID-19 patients assessed the use of aspirin within 24 hours of hospital admission or in the 7 days before hospital admission and found that its use was independently associated with a lower risk.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guidelines provide insights into the medical management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with a particular focus on the role of aspirin for extended treatment. The guidelines recommend considering the initiation of anticoagulation therapy over aspirin in patients with DVT and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) who have completed primary treatment and are continuing to receive secondary prevention.

### Low-dose aspirin is safe and effective for prevention of venous thromboembolism after femoral neck fracture [^114K1Vch]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). High credibility.

Although patients who undergo arthroplasty for hip fractures are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), guidelines do not specify the optimal VTE prophylactic agent. Recent evidence demonstrates that aspirin (ASA) may be safe and effective for VTE prevention in these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of low-dose ASA (81 mg) compared to non-ASA agents after arthroplasty for femoral neck fracture.

- **Methods**: A total of 36,576 patients who underwent arthroplasty for femoral neck fracture from January 2012 through December 2023 were identified in a national database. Patients were stratified by baseline VTE risk into high-risk and standard-risk groups and further categorized based on the type of VTE prophylaxis received - low-dose ASA only or non-ASA prophylaxis only. Rates and odds of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and adverse events, including bleeding, blood transfusion requirements, and emergency department visits, were assessed in the 90-day postoperative period for propensity-matched cohorts.

- **Results**: Compared to non-ASA prophylaxis, the use of low-dose ASA only was associated with significantly lower odds of deep vein thrombosis in both high-risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30 to 0.69) and standard-risk (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.76) groups, and lower odds of PE in high-risk patients (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.55). There were no significant differences in the odds of PE in standard-risk patients (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.32 to 1.61).

### Low-dose aspirin versus placebo in postpartum venous thromboembolism: A multi-national, pilot, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115NPNFj]. The Lancet Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Despite the morbidity and mortality of venous thromboembolism, there is little evidence to guide postpartum thromboprophylaxis in patients at moderate risk. We aimed to assess the feasibility of conducting a double-blind, randomised trial of aspirin versus placebo in postpartum individuals with two or more venous thromboembolism risk factors, mild-to-moderate thrombophilia, or both.

- **Methods**: The pilot PARTUM trial, a multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, was conducted in seven centres across Canada, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Postpartum individuals aged 18 years or older with venous thromboembolism risk factors, including mild-to-moderate inherited thrombophilia, antepartum immobilisation, pre-pregnancy BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher, pre-pregnancy smoking, previous superficial vein thrombosis, and other pregnancy-related conditions, were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) within 48 hours of delivery to receive aspirin 81 mg (80 mg in Europe) orally daily (low-dose aspirin group) or placebo orally once daily (placebo group) for 42 days. Follow-up visits occurred at 6 weeks and 90 days postpartum. The primary outcome was the mean recruitment rate (participants per site per month). Additional feasibility metrics were reported, and clinical outcomes were analysed by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: Between Nov 2, 2020, and June 19, 2023, 10,040 patients were assessed for eligibility and 808 met all eligibility criteria.

### Efficacy in deep vein thrombosis prevention with extended mechanical compression device therapy and prophylactic aspirin following total knee arthroplasty: A randomized control trial [^11229RTm]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). High credibility.

Aspirin at 325 mg twice daily is now included as a nationally approved venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis protocol for low-risk total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. The purpose of this study is to examine whether there is a difference in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurrence following a limited tourniquet TKA using aspirin-based prophylaxis with or without extended use of mechanical compression device (MCD) therapy.

- **Methods**: One hundred limited tourniquet TKA patients, whose DVT risk was managed with aspirin 325 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, were randomized to either using an MCD during hospitalization only or extended use at home up to 6 weeks postoperatively. Lower extremity duplex venous ultrasonography (LEDVU) was completed on the second postoperative day, 14 days postoperatively, and at 3 months postoperatively to confirm the absence of DVT after treatment.

- **Results**: The DVT rate for the postdischarge MCD therapy group was 0% and 23.1% for the inpatient MCD group (P < .001). All DVTs resolved by 3 months postoperatively. Patient satisfaction was 9.56 (± 0.82) for postdischarge MCD patients vs 8.50 (± 1.46) for inpatient MCD patients (P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: Limited tourniquet TKA patients who were mobilized early, managed with aspirin for 3 weeks postoperatively, and on MCD therapy for up to 6 weeks postoperatively experienced superior DVT prophylaxis compared to patients receiving MCD therapy only as inpatients (P < .05). The 0% incidence of nonsymptomatic DVTs prevented by aspirin and extended-use MCD further validates this type of prophylaxis in low DVT risk patients.

### VTE prophylaxis for the medical patient: Where do we stand? - A focus on cancer patients [^113mZyFL]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Acutely ill medical patients are at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE); approximately 10–30% of general medical patients may develop deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, with the latter being a leading contributor to deaths in hospitals. Medical conditions associated with a high risk of VTE include cardiac disease, cancer, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatological diseases, and infectious diseases.

Pre-disposing risk factors in medical patients include a history of VTE, history of malignancy, complicating infections, increasing age, thrombophilia, prolonged immobility, and obesity. Active cancer and a history of cancer are both strongly related to VTE in medical (non-surgical) patients. Heparins, both unfractionated (UFH) and low molecular weight (LMWH), and fondaparinux have been shown to be effective agents in the prevention of VTE in this setting. However, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a significant effect on mortality rates in this population.

In medical patients, unfractionated heparin has a higher rate of bleeding complications than low molecular weight heparin. Thromboprophylaxis has been shown to be effective in medical patients with cancer and may have an effect on cancer outcomes. Thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy remains controversial and requires further investigation. There is no evidence for the use of aspirin, warfarin, or mechanical methods. We recommend either low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux as safe and effective agents in the thromboprophylaxis of medical patients.

### Aspirin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism: The INSPIRE collaboration [^115KMU44]. Circulation (2014). High credibility.

In patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), the risk of recurrent VTE remains high after anticoagulant treatment is discontinued. The "Aspirin for the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism" (WARFASA) and the "Aspirin to Prevent Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism" (ASPIRE) trials showed that aspirin reduces this risk; however, they were not individually powered to detect treatment effects for particular outcomes or subgroups.

- **Methods and results**: An individual patient data analysis of these trials was planned before their results were known, to assess the effect of aspirin versus placebo on recurrent VTE, major vascular events (recurrent VTE, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular disease death), and bleeding, overall and within predefined subgroups. The primary analysis for VTE was by intention to treat using time-to-event data. Of 1,224 patients, 193 had recurrent VTE over a median follow-up of 30.4 months. Aspirin reduced recurrent VTE (7.5% per year versus 5.1% per year; hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.90; P = 0.008), including both deep-vein thrombosis (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47–0.92; P = 0.01) and pulmonary embolism (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41–1.06; P = 0.08). Aspirin also reduced major vascular events (8.7% per year versus 5.7% per year; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.86; P = 0.002). The major bleeding rate was low (0.4% per year for placebo and 0.5% per year for aspirin). After adjustment for treatment adherence, recurrent VTE was reduced by 42% (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40–0.85; P = 0.005). Prespecified subgroup analyses indicate similar effects across diverse patient subgroups.

### Evolution of clinical thinking and practice regarding aspirin: What has changed and why [^112Q278A]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) is the original antiplatelet agent. Its routine use, previously unquestioned for both primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease, is coming under increasing scrutiny as the risk-to-benefit balance for ASA becomes less clear and other disease- and risk-modifying approaches are validated. It represents a significant advance in evidence-based medicine that the use of an inexpensive, readily available, and long-validated therapy is being questioned in large, rigorous trials.

In this overview, we present important questions surrounding a more informed approach to ASA therapy: duration of therapy, assessment of net clinical benefit, and timing of start and stop strategies. We also consider potential explanations for "breakthrough" thrombosis when patients are on ASA therapy. Other manuscripts in this supplement address the specifics of primary prevention, secondary prevention, triple oral antithrombotic therapy, and the future of ASA in cardiovascular medicine.

### Duration of primary/secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ke753]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy can prevent recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), though it is associated with an increased risk for major bleeding. This meta-analysis systematically reviewed the evidence regarding the duration of antithrombotic therapy to assess benefits and harms. We conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing shorter (3–6 months) with longer (> 6 months) courses of anticoagulation for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and comparing discontinued with indefinite antithrombotic therapy for the secondary prevention of VTE. Pairs of reviewers screened eligible trials and collected data.

This study included 22 RCTs with 11,617 participants. Pooled estimates indicated that, for the primary treatment of unprovoked VTE, VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, or transient risk factors, a longer course of anticoagulation (> 6 months), as opposed to a shorter course (3–6 months), probably reduced recurrent PE (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–1.02) and DVT (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63–1.14). However, it was associated with increased mortality (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.85–2.41) and a higher risk for major bleeding (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.02–3.98) [high certainty].

For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE and VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, compared with discontinued treatment, indefinite anticoagulation therapy was associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.81) and a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.25).

### The use of aspirin for primary and secondary prevention in venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular disorders [^112Cxm9A]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) includes a number of conditions such as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. CVD is a leading health problem worldwide and a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and disability; it is also associated with high healthcare costs. The incidence of CVD is predicted to increase in the forthcoming years, and thus it is crucial that physicians are aware of the benefits and limitations of the available therapies to ensure patients receive optimized treatment.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelets for both the prevention and treatment of CVD. Aspirin is the most studied antiplatelet agent in this context. The benefits of aspirin are well documented and supported by data from robust clinical trials for CVD conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome and stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.

However, the clinical benefits of aspirin are less clear for other conditions, namely for primary prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopedic surgery, particularly in comparison with newer drugs such as the direct oral anticoagulants. This article provides an outline of the guidelines and a critical assessment of the efficacy and safety data supporting the recommendations for the use of aspirin in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular disorders.

### European guidelines on perioperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: Aspirin [^1136D5sG]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a good rationale for the use of aspirin in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in certain orthopedic procedures, as proposed by the 9th American College of Chest Physicians' guidelines (Grade 1C). We recommend using aspirin, noting it may be less effective than or as effective as low molecular weight heparin for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery (Grade 1C). Aspirin may also be less effective than or as effective as low molecular weight heparins for prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following other orthopedic procedures (Grade 2C).

Aspirin may be associated with a low rate of bleeding after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery (Grade 1B) and may cause less bleeding compared to other pharmacological agents (Grade 1B). There is a lack of data for other orthopedic procedures. We do not recommend aspirin as thromboprophylaxis in general surgery (Grade 1C); however, this prophylaxis could be of interest particularly in low-income countries (Grade 2C). It is suggested that adequate large-scale trials with proper study designs should be conducted (Grade 1C).

### Low-dose aspirin is the safest prophylaxis for prevention of venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty across all patient risk profiles [^11398cT2]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

The International Consensus Meeting on Venous Thromboembolism (ICM-VTE) in 2022 proclaimed low-dose aspirin as the most effective agent in patients across all risk profiles undergoing joint arthroplasty. However, data on large patient populations assessing trends in chemoprophylactic choices and related outcomes following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain scant. The present study was designed to characterize the clinical use of various chemoprophylactic agents in patients undergoing TKA and to determine the efficacy of aspirin compared with other agents in patient groups stratified by VTE risk profiles.

- **Methods**: This study utilized a national database to determine the proportion of patients undergoing TKA who received low-dose aspirin versus other chemoprophylaxis between 2012 and 2022. VTE risk profiles were determined on the basis of comorbidities established in the ICM-VTE. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between various classes of thromboprophylaxis in patients with high and low risk of VTE were calculated. The odds of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE), bleeding events, infections, mortality, and hospitalizations were also assessed in the 90-day postoperative period for propensity-matched cohorts receiving low-dose (81 mg) aspirin only versus other prophylaxis, segregating patients by VTE risk profile.

- **Results**: A total of 126,692 patients undergoing TKA across 60 health-care organizations were included. The proportion of patients receiving low-dose aspirin increased from 7.65% to 55.29% between 2012 and 2022.

### Aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hip fracture, total knee, and hip arthroplasty [^112iQzoq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a complication of major orthopedic surgeries such as hip fracture repair, total knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty. Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism reduces the risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis associated with these procedures. Aspirin is widely prescribed for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery. We review the epidemiology of hip fracture, total knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty, and describe aspirin's mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety.

### Aspirin as thromboprophylaxis in hip and knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11728AMZ]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, is a complication of particular concern in lower limb arthroplasty. In recent years, aspirin has emerged as a potential alternative thromboprophylactic agent, particularly following its acceptance as a recommended agent by the American College of Chest Physicians. Aspirin is favored due to its cost-effectiveness and convenience compared to novel oral anticoagulants and warfarin. However, its efficacy since its inclusion in the guidelines by the American College of Chest Physicians remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to establish the efficacy of aspirin in preventing VTE in total hip and knee arthroplasty.

- **Methods**: Electronic searches were performed using six databases up to June 2015, identifying all relevant studies. Data were extracted and meta-analyzed.

- **Results**: Eleven relevant studies were included in this meta-analysis. The overall rate of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in both hip and knee arthroplasty was 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. The rate of major bleeding was 0.3%, with a pooled mortality rate of 0.2%. All findings demonstrated a high and significant degree of heterogeneity.

- **Conclusion**: Aspirin, used both alone and in multimodal approaches to thromboprophylaxis, confers a low rate of VTE with a low risk of major bleeding complications. However, the evidence for its use is limited by the low quality of studies and variation in dosing regimes. Future randomized controlled trials should investigate the efficacy further.

### The efficacy of aspirin versus low-molecular-weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after knee and hip arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Hv5Nx]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was pre-registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO).

- **Search strategy**: Four online databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar) were searched from inception to 15 June 2024 to identify all studies investigating the outcomes of aspirin versus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) following total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR). The following keywords and their derivatives were included: 'arthroplasty' or 'replacement' and 'hip' or 'knee' and 'venous thromboembolism' or 'VTE' or 'deep venous thrombosis' or 'DVT' or 'pulmonary embolism' or 'PE' and 'aspirin' and 'LMWH' or 'enoxaparin' or 'dalteparin' or 'anticoagulant'. See Supporting Information S1: Appendix for detailed search strategies.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies were considered eligible if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) original randomized controlled trials (RCTs); (2) comparing the outcomes of aspirin to LMWH (enoxaparin or dalteparin); (3) in both knee and hip arthroplasty performed for the treatment of osteoarthritis; (4) no restriction on the type of implants; (5) published in the English language. Exclusion criteria included (1) studies not reporting any of the outcomes of interest (VTE, bleeding, mortality rate); (2) studies comparing combined thromboprophylaxis agents protocol where the standalone effect of aspirin versus LMWH is confounded; (3) observational studies, review articles, preclinical, cadaveric, and anatomical studies, and case reports.

### Adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aspirin on short-term outcomes of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^115tWUgf]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: The investigation was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study that assessed the adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aspirin on the clinical outcomes of patients with acute cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes were employed to identify subjects.

	- We selected consecutive patients with the ICD-10 codes of I26 (I26.0, I26.9), I80 (I80.1, I80.2, I80.3), I82 (I82.2, I82.3, I82.4, I82.6, I82.8, I82.9), and those with ICD-10 codes among C00–C97 concurrently, from the inpatient electronic medical record systems of the participating medical centers.

	- Cancer-associated VTE patients who underwent conventional anticoagulation treatment with and without a low-dose oral aspirin regimen for 6 months following the diagnosis of cancer-associated VTE were collected. Patients who took low-dose aspirin daily were designated as the aspirin group, whereas those who did not take aspirin or took it occasionally were categorized as the non-aspirin group. Low-dose aspirin was defined as 100 mg daily.

	- According to the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism (PE), all patients were further divided into PE and non-PE subgroups. The aspirin prescription was fully at the discretion of the attending physicians for all patients, primarily for the purpose of primary or secondary prophylaxis of cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events in most cases.

### Antiplatelet agents for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis [^115aTjbA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents may be useful for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) when used in addition to best medical practice (BMP), which includes anticoagulation, compression stockings, and clinical care such as physical exercise and skin hydration. Antiplatelet agents could minimize complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and pulmonary embolism (PE). They may also reduce the recurrence of venous thromboembolism (reVTE). However, antiplatelet agents may increase the likelihood of bleeding events.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antiplatelet agents in addition to BMP compared to BMP (with or without placebo) for the treatment of DVT.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 7 December 2021. The review authors searched LILACS and IBECS databases (15 December 2021) and also checked the bibliographies of included trials for further references to relevant trials, and contacted specialists in the field, manufacturers, and authors of the included trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining antiplatelet agents compared to BMP following initial standard anticoagulation treatment for DVT. We included studies where antiplatelet agents were given in addition to BMP compared to BMP (with or without placebo).

### Association of aspirin with prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients after total knee arthroplasty compared with other anticoagulants: A noninferiority analysis [^111YCnZv]. JAMA Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

There has been significant debate in the surgical and medical communities regarding the appropriateness of using aspirin alone for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The objective of this research is to determine the acceptability of aspirin alone versus anticoagulant prophylaxis for reducing the risk of postoperative VTE in patients undergoing TKA.

The study was designed as a noninferiority analysis of a retrospective cohort of TKA cases submitted to the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative. It involved 29 member hospitals, ranging from small community hospitals to large academic and nonacademic medical centers in Michigan. The study included 41,537 patients who underwent primary TKA between April 1, 2013, and October 31, 2015. Clinical events were monitored for 90 days after surgery, and data were analyzed between September and October 2016.

- **Exposures**: The method of pharmacologic prophylaxis included neither aspirin nor anticoagulants for 668 patients (1.6%), aspirin only for 12,831 patients (30.9%), anticoagulant only (e.g. low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, and Xa inhibitors) for 22,620 patients (54.5%), and both aspirin/anticoagulant for 5,418 patients (13.0%). Most patients also used intermittent pneumatic compression stockings.

- **Main outcome and measures**: The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of VTE or death, with a noninferiority margin specified as 0.3. The secondary outcome was bleeding events.

- **Results**: Of the 41,537 patients, 14,966 were men (36%), and the mean age was 65.8 years. A VTE event occurred in…

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^111VqFkS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

In the context of COVID-19, another consideration is the frequency of dosing. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) prophylaxis is often administered twice or thrice daily, whereas low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), especially enoxaparin, is dosed daily. International guidelines also state that once-daily regimens of LMWH may be advantageous over UFH because missed doses may be associated with worse outcomes, will reduce healthcare worker exposure, and conserve personal protective equipment.

- **Recommendations and suggestions**: In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either LMWH or UFH for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (strong recommendation and moderate quality of evidence). If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for VTE prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement). We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence). Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of "enhanced" or "intermediate" prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence). In hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence). If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with IPC devices or GCS for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### Inaccuracies of venous thromboembolism risk assessment and prevention practices among medically ill patients [^113T31sG]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), composed of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common condition among hospitalized patients. When used appropriately, VTE prophylaxis has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and PE, including fatal PE, among hospitalized medically ill patients. Comprehensive, evidence-based VTE risk assessment models exist to help clinicians calculate VTE risk and determine what, if any, VTE prophylaxis is appropriate for each patient.

The Padua VTE risk assessment model was developed and validated for medically ill patients. The Johns Hopkins Hospital implemented Epic as its electronic health record (EHR) system and, expanding upon previous work, included a Padua risk assessment model coupled with computerized clinical decision support. This tool guides providers in prescribing risk-appropriate VTE prophylaxis for medically ill patients during admission. For this risk assessment tool to be valid, it is crucial that risk assessments are completed accurately and consistently for every hospitalized patient.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of VTE risk assessments completed for medically ill patients, the appropriateness of VTE prophylaxis prescription based on each patient's risk profile, and the factors associated with VTE development. We hypothesize that some individual risk factors included in the Padua risk assessment model are not appropriately identified by providers, leading to suboptimal VTE prophylaxis prescription and, ultimately, potentially preventable harm from VTE.

### To prophylax or not, and how much and how long? Controversies in VTE prevention for medical inpatients, including COVID-19 inpatients [^113skEQA]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Low credibility.

The field of thromboprophylaxis for acutely ill medical patients, including those hospitalized for COVID-19, is rapidly evolving both in the inpatient setting and the immediate post-hospital discharge period. Recent data reveal the importance of incorporating holistic thromboembolic outcomes that encompass both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism, as thromboprophylaxis with low-dose direct oral anticoagulants has been shown to reduce major and fatal vascular events, especially against a background of dual pathway inhibition with aspirin.

In addition, recent post hoc analyses from randomized trial data have established five key bleeding-risk factors that, if removed, reveal a low-bleeding-risk medically ill population and, conversely, key individual risk factors, such as advanced age, a past history of cancer or VTE, an elevated D-dimer, or the use of a validated VTE risk score — the IMPROVE VTE score using established cutoffs — to predict a high-VTE-risk medically ill population that benefits from extended postdischarge thromboprophylaxis.

Thromboprophylaxis of a high-thrombotic-risk subset of medically ill patients, specifically those with COVID-19, is rapidly evolving both during hospitalization and post discharge. This article reviews three controversial topics in the thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized acutely ill medical patients:

- **Clinical relevance**: Key efficacy and safety outcomes are incorporated into randomized trials but not incorporated into relevant antithrombotic guidelines.
- **Risk factors**: The use of individual risk factors or risk models of low-bleeding-risk populations is under discussion.

### Prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following stroke: A systematic review of published articles [^1169t9zY]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of the literature on venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following cerebral infarct (CI) and hemorrhagic stroke. MEDLINE, Cochrane, LILACS, and SciELO databases were scanned, and the abstracts from Brazilian, American, and European Neurology and Stroke Congresses were scrutinized for clinical trials. Moreover, the reference lists of articles and reviews were searched.

A pooled analysis of two large studies with aspirin was made. Both unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins/heparinoids (LMWH) are partially effective for VTE prophylaxis after CI and should be routinely used in patients with motor deficits and reduced mobility and no contraindications. Reduction of deep venous thrombosis is better established than the effect on pulmonary embolism or mortality. Some evidence points to a greater efficacy of LMWH.

The available evidence does not support the use of mechanical methods or dextran. Aspirin may have a mild protective effect. Low-dose warfarin might be useful in the rehabilitation setting. Strict recommendations cannot be made in patients with hemorrhagic stroke, but intermittent pneumatic compression merits further study. There are important limitations of VTE preventive strategies following stroke. Additional studies on the combination of methods after CI and of low doses of anticoagulants following cerebral hemorrhage are urgently needed.

### Aspirin is as effective and safe as oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after joint arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111dnBnN]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

Previous studies have been conducted on the use of aspirin for preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), including comparisons of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with aspirin and aspirin with a placebo. However, no meta-analyses have compared aspirin with oral anticoagulants (OACs). Our pooled results showed essentially no heterogeneity, with the highest I² value being 4.4%, and the conclusions were robust in all sensitivity analyses and sub-analyses. The GRADE evidence level was high, indicating that it provides meaningful guidance for clinical practice. We used a thorough and rigorous search strategy encompassing multiple databases without language restrictions. By exclusively including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we eliminated the selection bias associated with observational studies. We also performed a thorough evaluation of the methodological quality of the included studies. We conducted a thorough analysis by systematically investigating the potential sources of heterogeneity across various study-level characteristics and testing for evidence of effect modification. Notably, our analyses included only patients undergoing joint arthroplasty, addressing the limitations noted in previous trials and systematic reviews.

Despite the high level of evidence, however, this study has some limitations, most of which are inherent to meta-analyses. First, only 2 of the included studies reported blinding of both participants and outcome assessors, 5 did not specify the blinding status of at least one of these, and the remaining 4 failed to blind at least one of these, resulting in a notable risk of bias.

### Venous thromboembolism in cancer patients: ESMO clinical practice guideline [^115LnEHw]. Annals of Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for cancer-associated thrombosis, specifically in relation to thromboprophylaxis, patients receiving anticancer therapy are provided guidance. The ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend administering aspirin (100 mg/day) to ambulatory patients with multiple myeloma who are receiving immunomodulatory imide drug treatment combined with low-dose dexamethasone, and who do not have additional risk factors.

### The efficacy of aspirin versus low-molecular-weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after knee and hip arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112o5cXP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). High credibility.

Across four studies and 11,152 observations, there was no significant risk difference between the aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) cohorts in terms of major bleeding (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.40–1.47; p: 0.424). The analysis was devoid of heterogeneity, with an I² of 0%. Similarly, while the risk of minor bleeding was skewed towards the LMWH cohort, it was not significantly different compared to the aspirin cohort (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.40–1.04; p: 0.072). This risk value was accompanied by an insignificant I² of 3% across five studies and 2,148 observations.

### Low-dose aspirin for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism [^115X4xFD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Patients who have experienced a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism have a high risk of recurrence once anticoagulants are discontinued. Aspirin may effectively prevent a recurrence of venous thromboembolism.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 822 patients, who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy following a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism, to receive either aspirin at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo for up to 4 years. The primary outcome was a recurrence of venous thromboembolism.

- **Results**: During a median follow-up period of 37.2 months, venous thromboembolism recurred in 73 of 411 patients assigned to placebo and in 57 of 411 assigned to aspirin (a rate of 6.5% per year vs. 4.8% per year; hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.05; P = 0.09). Aspirin reduced the rate of the two prespecified secondary composite outcomes: the rate of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death was reduced by 34% (a rate of 8.0% per year with placebo vs. 5.2% per year with aspirin; hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.92; P = 0.01), and the rate of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding, or death from any cause was reduced by 33% (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.91; P = 0.01). There was no significant difference between groups in the rates of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding episodes (rate of 0.6% per year with placebo vs. 1.1% per year with aspirin, P = 0.22) or serious adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, aspirin as continued beyond the conclusion is needed.

### Managing selected chronic conditions in hospitalized patients [^111EwY4R]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for deep vein thrombosis, particularly in relation to thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend administering prophylaxis for VTE in hospitalized patients, except for those classified as low risk by a clinical prediction score, to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolic disease.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the medical patient: Controversies and perspectives [^111NDS8A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with venous thromboembolism in hospitalized at-risk medical patients, the publication of large-scale studies demonstrates that prophylaxis is effective in this patient group. However, prophylaxis rates in medically ill patients remain suboptimal, despite the presence of international guidelines. Studies show that low-molecular-weight heparins, given once daily, are at least as effective as unfractionated heparin, which is usually administered thrice daily, with equivalent or improved safety profiles. Moreover, thrice-daily dosing of unfractionated heparin might be more effective than twice-daily dosing.

However, the most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not distinguish between these regimens, and twice-daily unfractionated heparin is still commonly used in the United States. Furthermore, the optimal duration for out-of-hospital and extended prophylaxis for specific patient groups is not established. There are few data on the use of mechanical methods in this patient group, and no established standard of care for prophylaxis of special patient populations, such as obese patients or those with renal insufficiency. Even though prophylaxis entails additional acquisition costs, it can reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism, which can improve care and decrease overall costs.

### Aspirin is as effective as oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116S4b87]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). High credibility.

The purpose of our study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of aspirin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis after knee arthroplasty.

- **Methods**: The review process was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two independent researchers conducted literature searches using databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to locate studies comparing aspirin and oral anticoagulants (OACs) for VTE prophylaxis after knee arthroplasty. Our meta-analysis included seven randomized controlled trials with 2,323 participants.

- **Results**: The relative risk (RR) of VTE following knee arthroplasty was 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 2.14) when comparing aspirin to OACs. Similar results were observed for deep vein thrombosis (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.71 to 2.50) and pulmonary embolism (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.25 to 4.03). No notable differences were found in bleeding, wound complications, or mortality between the two groups. Analyses of subgroups based on factors like region, publication year, VTE type, VTE events, aspirin dose, comparator types, use of mechanical thrombosis prophylaxis, trial quality, and study support revealed no substantial differences in VTE incidence between the two groups. Overall, the quality of evidence for VTE and deep vein thrombosis outcomes was moderate.

- **Conclusions**: Existing randomized controlled trial evidence suggests that aspirin is equally effective and safe as OACs in preventing VTE after knee arthroplasty.

### Aspirin is as effective and safe as oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after joint arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^116nA1KN]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

This study followed the principles outlined in the Handbook of the Cochrane Collaboration, and the guidelines established by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO.

Inclusion criteria included (1) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy and/or safety of aspirin and oral anticoagulants (OACs) for preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adults (≥ 18 years old) undergoing primary and/or revision hip or knee arthroplasty; (2) reporting of outcomes including VTE, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and/or associated complications; (3) use of a combined VTE prevention strategy, which includes aspirin as one of the medications in the aspirin arm (initial treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or an oral anticoagulant followed by a longer course of aspirin), to reflect clinical practice; and (4) administration of the medication for VTE prophylaxis lasting ≥ 14 days.

- **Search strategy**: Two authors performed the search in PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the inception date of each database to May 14, 2024, using the keywords ("hip arthroplasty" or "knee arthroplasty"), "aspirin" and "anticoagulant", and ("venous thromboembolism" or "pulmonary embolism" or "deep vein thrombosis" or "complication") in humans. Detailed search strategies are reported in the Appendix. No language restrictions were applied in the search.

- **Study selection**: After duplicates were removed, two independent researchers reviewed all titles.

### Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: Collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials [^111oBoek]. Lancet (2009). High credibility.

Low-dose aspirin is of definite and substantial net benefit for many people who already have occlusive vascular disease. We have assessed the benefits and risks in primary prevention.

- **Methods**: We undertook meta-analyses of serious vascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death, and major bleeds in six primary prevention trials involving 95,000 individuals at low average risk, 660,000 person-years, and 3,554 serious vascular events. Additionally, we included 16 secondary prevention trials with 17,000 individuals at high average risk, 43,000 person-years, and 3,306 serious vascular events, comparing long-term aspirin versus control. We report intention-to-treat analyses of first events during the scheduled treatment period.

- **Findings**: In the primary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events (0.51% aspirin vs. 0.57% control per year, p = 0.0001), due mainly to a reduction of about a fifth in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.18% vs. 0.23% per year, p < 0.0001). The net effect on stroke was not significant (0.20% vs. 0.21% per year, p = 0.4: haemorrhagic stroke 0.04% vs. 0.03%, p = 0.05; other stroke 0.16% vs. 0.18% per year, p = 0.08). Vascular mortality did not differ significantly (0.19% vs. 0.19% per year, p = 0.7). Aspirin allocation increased major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds (0.10% vs. 0.07% per year, p < 0.0001), and the main risk factors for coronary disease were also risk factors for bleeding. In the secondary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a greater absolute reduction in serious vascular events (6.7% vs. 8.2% per year).

### Adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aspirin on short-term outcomes of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^111pnXVA]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The conclusions of this study indicate for the first time that the adjuvant use of low-dose aspirin based on conventional anticoagulants reduces short-term venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence and pulmonary embolism (PE)-related mortality rates in patients with cancer-associated VTE, compared to using isolated anticoagulants. However, the combined use of low-dose aspirin and conventional anticoagulants does not improve short-term all-cause mortality rate or net clinical benefit. It is important to note that adjuvant low-dose aspirin use is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. These findings may provide a new treatment method for the adjuvant therapy of patients with cancer-associated VTE. Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) could be warranted in the future.

### Aspirin as added prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis in trauma: A retrospective case-control study [^115Go6Ke]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Prophylaxis does not completely prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in trauma patients. Recent data suggest that platelets may be a major contributor to hypercoagulability after trauma, indicating a potential role for antiplatelet medications in prophylaxis for DVT. We sought to determine if preinjury aspirin use was associated with a reduced incidence of lower extremity DVT in trauma patients.

- **Methods**: Using a retrospective case-control design, we matched 110 cases of posttrauma lower extremity DVT one-to-one with controls using seven covariates: age, admission date, probability of death, number of DVT risk factors, sex, mechanism of injury, and presence of head injury. Data collected included 26 risk factors for DVT, prehospital medications, and in-hospital prophylaxis. Logistic regression models were created to examine the relationship between prehospital aspirin use and posttrauma DVT.

- **Results**: Preinjury aspirin was used by 7.3% of cases (patients diagnosed with in-hospital DVT) compared with 13.6% of controls (p = 0.1). Aspirin was associated with a significant protective effect in multivariate analysis, with an odds ratio of 0.17 (95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.68; p = 0.012) in the most complete model. When stratified by other antithrombotic use, aspirin showed a significant effect only when used in combination with heparinoid prophylaxis (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.13–0.93; p = 0.036).

- **Conclusion**: Preinjury aspirin use seems to significantly lower DVT rate following injury. This association is strongest when heparinoid prophylaxis is also used.

### Low-dose aspirin is effective chemoprophylaxis against clinically important venous thromboembolism following total joint arthroplasty: A preliminary analysis [^11548fEi]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume (2017). High credibility.

Aspirin is a safe and effective prophylaxis for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following total joint arthroplasty. The optimal dose of aspirin prophylaxis is unknown. Our hypothesis was that lower-dose aspirin is as effective as higher-dose aspirin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism and is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, crossover study, we analyzed 4,651 primary total joint arthroplasty cases performed from July 2013 to June 2015. For four weeks, 3,192 patients received enteric-coated 325-mg aspirin twice daily (the 325-mg aspirin group), and 1,459 patients received 81-mg aspirin twice daily (the 81-mg aspirin group). There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in sex, body mass index, or Charlson Comorbidity Index between the two patient populations. Recorded complications occurring within 90 days postoperatively included symptomatic venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), gastrointestinal complications, acute periprosthetic joint infection, and death.

- **Results**: The incidence of venous thromboembolism of 0.1% (95% confidence interval, 0% to 0.3%) in the 81-mg aspirin group (one with deep venous thrombosis and one with pulmonary embolism) was not significantly different (p = 0.345) from 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1% to 0.6%) in the 325-mg aspirin group (seven with deep venous thrombosis and five with pulmonary embolism). The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration of 0.3% (95% CI, 0% to 0.5%) in the 81-mg aspirin group was slightly, but not significantly (p = 0.66).

### Heparin sodium [^1152RBbc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, administered just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and clinical pulmonary embolism.

The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma. A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended. Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery.

Patients with bleeding disorders, those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery, or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as well as patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs (see WARNINGS). The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established. The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind. If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate is advisable. If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated.

All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out any contraindicating conditions.

### Aspirin for primary prevention: A challenging decision [^111UC9J5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The findings of Mainous and colleagues suggest that recommendations about aspirin use for primary prevention continue to vary considerably and do not necessarily reflect a clear risk-based approach, at least based on the thresholds examined. Given the lack of consensus in the recommendations about who should be offered aspirin, this is not surprising.

Several limitations preclude a deeper understanding of decision making about aspirin in this sample. First, the investigators did not have access to information about some elements of medical history (e.g. prior gastrointestinal bleeding) or medication use that would help define each person's bleeding risk and potentially affect net benefit determination. Similarly, we do not know whether the risk of adverse effects was discussed; prior work suggests that such information often is not discussed in encounters about preventive care. Second, the decision to create only two risk groups makes it unclear whether aspirin use in the lower risk group is in a range of risk that would be a "close call" (in which case patient preference-based decision making is indicated) or whether they are at such low risk that aspirin use represents "overuse" that should be actively discouraged. Finally, we do not know whether the respondents' use (or nonuse) was informed and preference-concordant; such information is necessary to evaluate the quality of decision making overall.

Despite these limitations, the analysis by Mainous and colleagues presents the most up-to-date analysis of aspirin use for primary prevention and suggests, at least indirectly, that…

### Low-dose aspirin is adequate for venous thromboembolism prevention following total joint arthroplasty: A systematic review [^116wMnbD]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) are at risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) without adequate prophylaxis. Since the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons issued guidelines in 2007 recommending aspirin 325 mg bis in die for 6 weeks, aspirin has been favored as the main VTE prophylaxis. However, the appropriate dose and duration of aspirin are not well-studied. This systematic review aims to identify any differences between high and low doses, as well as duration for aspirin thromboprophylaxis after TJA as outlined by previous studies.

- **Methods**: A search was performed using Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed, including articles up to July 2016. Studies were included if they contained at least one cohort that underwent TJA with aspirin as the sole chemoprophylaxis and reported either (1) symptomatic VTE or (2) secondary outcomes such as major bleeding or 90-day mortality.

- **Results**: Forty-five papers were included. There were no significant differences in symptomatic pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, 90-day mortality, or major bleeding between patients receiving low-dose or high-dose aspirin. Patients treated with aspirin for less than 4 weeks had a higher risk of major bleeding (1.59%) compared to patients treated for 4 weeks (0.15%), which may be attributed to premature cessation or differential reporting. Patients treated with aspirin for less than 4 weeks had a statistically higher 90-day mortality (1.95%) compared to patients treated for 4 weeks (0.07%). There was no significant difference between the incidence of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

### Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis: Better living through chemistry — in opposition [^111sK3Bg]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2005). Low credibility.

The best prophylactic regimens for thromboembolic disease continue to be debated despite years of investigation. The surgeon must balance the clinical risks and benefits. A decision depends on accurate data and our ability to balance the risks of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) against the risk of bleeding.

The risk for fatal PE is 0.1% with most prophylactic regimens. The risk of perioperative bleeding increases from 1.8% to 5.2% with low molecular weight heparins or warfarin and generally is dose-dependent. Most prophylactic recommendations are based on the presence or absence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT); however, the correlation between the presence of a DVT and the risk of PE is low and inconsistent. Therefore, DVT may not be an accurate surrogate marker for patients at risk after total joint surgery.

Our experience with 2,800 consecutive total knee arthroplasty patients, using aspirin as our principal agent, shows a fatal PE risk of 0.1% and a low risk of bleeding. Therefore, our recommendation is aspirin.

### The efficacy of aspirin versus low-molecular-weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after knee and hip arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116hy2Ph]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). High credibility.

Among seven studies with 11,608 observations, there was no significantly different risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) between the aspirin and the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) cohorts (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.48–1.89; p: 0.877) (Figure 3). Significant heterogeneity was observed for the aforementioned OR (I² = 73%). When stratified by specific VTE entities, such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), the risk of DVT was not significantly different between the aspirin and the LMWH cohorts (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.51–1.92; p: 0.965) (Figure 4). Here too, significant heterogeneity was noted (I² = 68%). However, the risk of PE, among four studies and 10,366 observations, was significantly higher for patients in the aspirin cohort compared to the LMWH cohort (OR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.11–2.89; p: 0.017) (Figure 5). Zero heterogeneity was present for this specific risk statistic (I² = 0%).

### Practices to prevent venous thromboembolism: A brief review [^112SNedU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), is estimated to account for 5–10% of all deaths among hospitalized patients. In addition, non-fatal VTE events are associated with significant morbidities. In 2008, the US Surgeon General issued a Call to Action to Prevent DVT and PE, highlighting the vast number of patients afflicted by DVT (350,000–600,000) and those killed by PE (> 100,000) annually in the United States.

Both pharmacological and mechanical prophylactic interventions have been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing many, but not all, VTE. It has been estimated that best practice prophylaxis may reduce the incidence of DVT by up to 70%. The underlying pharmacological mechanism of all prophylaxis medications is to decrease clotting, which may unfortunately increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, it is crucial to weigh the harms and benefits before administering these drugs. Blanket approaches that prescribe the same medication at the same dose and frequency to all patients may not be beneficial and may even cause more harm than good. Individual patient risk assessment is paramount to ensure that all patients receive optimal prophylaxis.

Most hospitalized patients have one or more risk factors for VTE. Evidence-based, best practice prophylaxis varies by individual patient risk factors such as cancer, advanced age, immobility, or a history of VTE, and the primary clinical service, including medicine, surgery, trauma, or orthopedics.
