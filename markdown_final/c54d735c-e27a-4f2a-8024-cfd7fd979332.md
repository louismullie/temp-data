## Question

Antibiotic for suspected pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which empiric antibiotic to choose for suspected community-acquired pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the site of care and severity classification to anchor initial decisions. Then, I should evaluate patient-specific risk factors, including comorbidities and risks for resistant pathogens. Next, I will delineate empiric regimens for outpatient, non-severe inpatient, and severe CAP, while integrating viral testing scenarios. After that, I need to apply stewardship principles on dosing, duration, de-escalation, and biomarkers. Finally, I will plan reassessment at 48–72 hours, transition to oral therapy, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that reconciles 2019 and 2025 guideline nuances.

> Let me first confirm how to determine setting and severity, because that drives everything downstream. For site-of-care, I should combine structured severity scores with clinical judgment and apply the 2007 IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria for inpatients, recognizing severe CAP as either any major criterion (invasive ventilation or septic shock) or at least three minor criteria, and noting that these criteria have been externally validated with strong discrimination for intensive care needs and mortality prediction, supporting ICU admission when major criteria are present or multiple minor criteria accumulate [^115TUqhk] [^111FBSzd] [^112hi12x].

> Hold on, I should verify patient-specific risk factors before jumping to an antibiotic list. I need to check for comorbidities (heart, lung, liver, kidney disease, diabetes, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, asplenia), assess recent healthcare exposure or prior colonization for MRSA or Pseudomonas, consider structural lung disease, and evaluate aspiration risk, while remembering that routine anaerobic coverage is generally unnecessary unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected and that abandoning the HCAP category changed how we think about broad-spectrum triggers [^11724DLT] [^115U4hGg] [^111Vs8ak].

> Next, I should review how viral testing modifies initial empiric decisions, and I need to be careful here because guidance evolved. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline recommended giving standard antibacterial therapy to adults with CAP even when influenza is confirmed, especially for hospitalized patients, but stewardship critiques warned this could increase unnecessary antibiotics, prompting updated 2025 ATS guidance that still supports empiric antibiotics in hospitalized patients with viral-positive CAP due to co-infection risk while allowing outpatient withholding of antibiotics in clinically stable, virus-positive adults without comorbidities, with early reassessment for progression [^115dbbUh] [^116xUUHf] [^116xUUHf] [^113k3zsY] [^112S2QnK] [^115qR2bM].

> For outpatient adults without comorbidities, I should double-check the macrolide resistance threshold before recommending macrolide monotherapy. If local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is below 25%, macrolide monotherapy is reasonable; otherwise doxycycline is an appropriate alternative, and I need to acknowledge that the 25% threshold has been criticized as arbitrary, reinforcing the need to consult the local antibiogram before selecting a macrolide-first strategy [^115Q2y7p] [^111GDt9s] [^115NsVZp].

> For adult outpatients with comorbidities, let me confirm the broadened empiric options. Preferred regimens are a beta-lactam plus a macrolide, or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, with beta-lactam plus doxycycline as an acceptable alternative when macrolides or fluoroquinolones are contraindicated, all chosen with an eye toward local resistance and individual risk factors [^114NQhP1] [^111GDt9s].

> In non-severe inpatient CAP, I will now examine standard empiric regimens. Options include a beta-lactam plus macrolide combination or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, with beta-lactam plus doxycycline as an alternative when macrolides and fluoroquinolones are not suitable, and I should ensure that there are no specific risk factors warranting MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage before proceeding [^116LD2BE] [^1113jsxi].

> In severe CAP, I need to be precise and also ready to self-correct. Initially, I might say beta-lactam plus macrolide or beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone are both acceptable, but wait, let me verify the most current comparative evidence and guideline direction; multiple contemporary analyses and European guidance support beta-lactam plus macrolide as preferred, highlight macrolide's potential immunomodulatory advantages, and advise against the beta-lactam plus fluoroquinolone combination due to inferior outcomes in network meta-analyses, so if macrolides are contraindicated, fluoroquinolone monotherapy is generally favored over the beta-lactam–fluoroquinolone combination in severe CAP [^11724DLT] [^113FgFQ7] [^114pR1bB] [^112SDUK2].

> Regarding aspiration, I should confirm I'm not overextending coverage. Routine anaerobic coverage is not recommended in suspected aspiration pneumonia unless there is clinical or imaging concern for lung abscess or empyema, so I will reserve anaerobic agents for those specific scenarios rather than add them reflexively [^111Vs8ak] [^111TRU1E] [^115Lwwfx].

> Now, stewardship and dosing optimization need attention, because critically ill patients have altered pharmacokinetics. I need to ensure appropriate loading doses, consider extended or continuous infusion for time-dependent beta-lactams to maximize fT > MIC, and verify that drug selection achieves adequate pulmonary penetration while reassessing dose in the setting of augmented renal clearance or organ dysfunction [^112h3oUt].

> For duration and de-escalation, let me reconcile 2019 with 2025 updates. The 2019 guideline advises a minimum of 5 days guided by validated clinical stability criteria, while 2025 ATS guidance allows shorter courses, as brief as 3–5 days, in clinically stable adults with non-severe CAP and recommends at least 5 days for severe CAP, with reassessment at 48–72 hours to stop antibiotics if no bacterial pathogen is identified and stability is achieved, which aligns with stewardship aims [^115BfusZ] [^113DyKsv] [^111e2FjV] [^113Mj7GB].

> On biomarkers, I should double-check the role of procalcitonin. I should not use initial PCT to decide whether to start antibiotics in radiographically confirmed CAP, but serial PCT can support earlier discontinuation in the right clinical context, consistent with RCT data showing reduced antibiotic exposure when PCT guides duration, recognizing that clinical stability remains paramount [^115YVDN7] [^11585mQF].

> At 48–72 hours, I need to verify the trajectory and pivot if needed. If the patient is not improving, I should reconsider the diagnosis, look for complications like parapneumonic effusion or empyema, evaluate for resistant organisms including MRSA or Pseudomonas when risk factors or cultures suggest, and narrow therapy promptly when cultures identify a pathogen, maintaining close communication with microbiology and pharmacy to minimize inappropriate coverage [^112hi12x] [^112h3oUt].

> I should confirm when to switch to oral therapy and consider discharge readiness. Transition to oral agents is appropriate when the patient is hemodynamically stable, improving clinically, able to take and absorb medications, and has a functioning GI tract, and discharge should proceed as soon as the patient is clinically stable with a safe care environment rather than prolonging observation on oral therapy in the hospital [^111CSoYK] [^117RH5fE].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances before concluding. For otherwise healthy children, high-dose amoxicillin is first-line for presumed bacterial CAP, macrolides are reserved for suspected atypical pathogens, courses should be the shortest effective duration, and discharge readiness includes improved activity, adequate oxygenation, stable mental status, caregiver ability to administer medications, and ensured follow-up, which I should document explicitly [^115h6tNF] [^113HibVu] [^111kEy8f] [^1164wCqf] [^114JqMiX] [^111FqauP].

> I should also address immunocompromised adults, because empiric breadth and diagnostics differ. In this group, I need to broaden early evaluation for opportunistic and resistant pathogens, tailor empiric therapy to host and exposure risks, and involve infectious diseases consultation to guide initial strategy and de-escalation given the heterogeneity of risks outside standard CAP pathways [^117F8r49].

> For older adults and nursing home residents, I must resist reverting to the retired HCAP framework. The abandonment of HCAP means I should not extend empiric anti-MRSA or antipseudomonal coverage solely based on residence status; rather, I should anchor decisions in individualized risk factors and local epidemiology [^115U4hGg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I did not explicitly emphasize timing of the first dose earlier, and I should correct that. Administering the first antibiotic dose in the emergency department without delay and within 4–8 hours of arrival has been associated in large observational cohorts with reduced mortality for hospitalized CAP, so I should ensure timely initiation while avoiding arbitrary "time-to-antibiotic" targets that could promote misdiagnosis or overuse [^112fpin1] [^116oDx2e].

> Finally, to synthesize a stewardship-conscious algorithm, I need to ensure the narrowest effective regimen that covers pneumococcus and atypicals when indicated, avoid anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal agents unless risk factors are present, verify local macrolide resistance before macrolide monotherapy, prioritize short-course therapy once stable, and use viral results to discontinue antibiotics early when appropriate, aligning with AWaRe and broader antibiotic stewardship principles advanced in critiques of 2019 recommendations and reflected in 2025 updates [^115ZzQTE] [^116xUUHf] [^115qR2bM].

Empiric antibiotic selection for suspected pneumonia depends on **setting and comorbidities** and **local resistance** [^112hi12x]. Outpatients without comorbidities should receive **amoxicillin or doxycycline** [^111GDt9s]; with comorbidities, use **amoxicillin/clavulanate plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone** [^114NQhP1]. Inpatients with non-severe CAP should get a β-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^116LD2BE]; severe CAP requires a β-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^11724DLT], with MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage if risk factors exist [^111Lpr3T]. Start **antibiotics within 4–8 hours** [^116oDx2e] of presentation [^112fpin1], tailor to local resistance [^115NsVZp], and adjust based on cultures and clinical response [^112h3oUt].

---

## Outpatient antibiotic recommendations

### Outpatients without comorbidities

Outpatients without comorbidities should receive **amoxicillin 1 g PO TID** [^112hi12x] or **doxycycline 100 mg PO BID** as first-line therapy [^111GDt9s]. A **macrolide** (azithromycin 500 mg PO day 1, then 250 mg daily) is an alternative only when local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is **< 25%** [^115Q2y7p].

---

### Outpatients with comorbidities

Outpatients with comorbidities should receive **combination therapy** [^114NQhP1] — either **amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID** [^111GDt9s] or **cefuroxime 500 mg PO BID** — plus a **macrolide** (azithromycin 500 mg PO day 1, then 250 mg daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a **respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily) [^114NQhP1] is acceptable [^111GDt9s].

---

## Inpatient antibiotic recommendations

### Non-severe CAP (no ICU admission)

For non-severe CAP, use a **β-lactam** (ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily or ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5–3 g IV q6h) plus a **macrolide** (azithromycin 500 mg IV/PO daily) [^116LD2BE]. Alternatively, monotherapy with a **respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV/PO daily) [^116oDx2e] may be used [^116LD2BE].

---

### Severe CAP (ICU admission or severe criteria met)

In severe CAP, use a **β-lactam** (ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily or cefotaxime 1–2 g IV q8h) plus a **macrolide** (azithromycin 500 mg IV/PO daily) [^11724DLT] [^113FgFQ7]. Alternatively, use a **β-lactam** plus a **respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV/PO daily) [^11724DLT].

---

## Special considerations

### MRSA or Pseudomonas risk factors

With MRSA risk factors, **add vancomycin or linezolid** [^11724DLT]; with Pseudomonas risk factors, use **piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or meropenem plus levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin** [^111Lpr3T].

---

### Aspiration pneumonia

Add **anaerobic coverage** [^111Vs8ak] with metronidazole or clindamycin if lung abscess or empyema is suspected [^111TRU1E].

---

## Timing and adjustment of antibiotic therapy

Start **antibiotics within 4–8 hours** [^116oDx2e] of presentation to reduce mortality [^112fpin1]. Modify therapy based on **culture results, clinical response, and local resistance patterns** [^112h3oUt] [^112hi12x].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Treat for a **minimum of 5 days** [^115BfusZ], ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before discontinuation. For severe CAP, extend therapy to **7–10 days**, especially if MRSA or Pseudomonas is present.

---

Empiric antibiotic selection for suspected pneumonia should be guided by **patient setting, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns** [^112hi12x]. Early initiation and timely adjustment based on clinical response and microbiological data are essential for optimal outcomes [^116oDx2e].

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment [^112h3oUt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis of pneumonia: Assuming local guidelines are followed, inappropriate antibiotic therapy is seldom the cause of clinical failure in CAP but is more common in HAP/VAP, since the latter is associated with a higher risk of MDR pathogens, particularly in settings with high baseline MDR rates. ATS/IDSA guidelines addressing both CAP and HAP/VAP have identified risk factors for MDR organisms (Fig. 2). Communication between the microbiology lab, pharmacists, and clinicians is very important to promptly identify patients with inappropriate antibiotics.

In addition to the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy, it is crucial to re-evaluate its adequacy. The drug dose should be reassessed as critically ill patients experience marked pharmacokinetic changes in both the volume of distribution and drug clearance rates compared to less sick patients. In addition, antibiotic administration, namely intermittent dosing vs. continuous perfusion in time-dependent drugs, and antibiotic lung penetration should be checked. A thorough history of the present illness can also raise the possibility of uncommon bacterial and fungal causes of severe pneumonia that may not respond to some empiric antibiotic regimens (Fig. 2). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is greater recognition of viral causes of severe pneumonia not responsive to empiric pneumonia therapy, including influenza (with or without bacterial co-infection), RSV, and finally HSV and CMV reactivation, which have uncertain clinical impacts.

Septic complication: Non-response could also be the result of concomitant complications.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering combination therapy. This involves a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily) is recommended in outpatients with CAP who have comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: A systematic review [^116oDx2e]. JAMA (2016).

- **Importance**: Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Objective**: To assess the associations between three key aspects of antibiotic therapy (optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy) and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Evidence review**: Bibliographic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for studies of adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia published from January 1, 1995, until November 5, 2015.

- **Findings**: Twenty studies (17 observational and 3 randomized trials) met eligibility criteria. Among eight observational studies identified, the four largest (study populations of 2878 to 1,170,022) found that antibiotic initiation within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative reductions of 5% to 43% in mortality; the four smallest studies (study populations of 451 to 2076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality. One cluster randomized trial (n = 1737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) vs. β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% (90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%) in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy vs. β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6%.

### New antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia [^114QiZPT]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

This review provides the rationale for the development of new antibiotics to treat community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and offers an overview of the newly approved antibiotics targeting CAP, as well as those in the development pipeline. CAP is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization, carrying significant morbidity and risk of mortality. Increasing antibiotic resistance among common bacterial pathogens associated with CAP, especially staphylococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae, has made the empiric treatment of this infection increasingly problematic. Moreover, the failure of initial empiric therapy to cover the causative agents associated with CAP can be associated with worse clinical outcomes.

Several antibiotics have been newly approved or are in development for the treatment of CAP. These agents include delafloxacin, omadacycline, lefamulin, solithromycin, nemonoxacin, and ceftaroline. Their major advantages include activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.

CAP continues to be an important infection due to its impact on patient outcomes, especially in the elderly and immunocompromised hosts. The availability of new antibiotics offers an opportunity for enhanced empiric treatment of the antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens associated with CAP.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1153KRfw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The medical management of community-acquired pneumonia, specifically regarding empiric antibiotic therapy in an outpatient setting, is addressed within the ATS 2025 guidelines. It is recommended to initiate empiric antibiotics in adult outpatients with comorbidities who present both clinical and imaging evidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and test positive for a respiratory virus. This recommendation is made due to the concern for bacterial-viral co-infection.

---

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qE7Fs]. The Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia causes significant mortality, morbidity, and high costs worldwide. Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of managing patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side effects, an empirical, effective, and individualized antibiotic treatment is necessary. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is crucial. Management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment based on clinical stability criteria.

New approaches for rapid clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising. Community-acquired pneumonia is linked to early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Further studies are needed to focus on the long-term management of pneumonia.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: A critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited due to substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to provide a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States.

An expert panel, composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents (none of whom were involved in producing the 2019 guideline), was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions.

- **Welcomed recommendations**: Recommendations welcomed by most international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", a more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, an increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids.

- **Main criticisms**: Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolone use.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms on how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are aging and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcomes. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalization or ICU admission, and the likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region along with their local susceptibility pattern.

One complicating factor is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients, making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are simultaneously present in patients, fewer treatment options can challenge physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors for poor outcomes in CAP patients.

### Influence of deviation from guidelines on the outcome of community-acquired pneumonia [^111bRUcu]. Chest (2002). High credibility.

Consensus guidelines for the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have been published. We investigated the following factors: (1) the degree of adherence to American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) guidelines; and (2) the influence of adhering to these guidelines on mortality and length of hospitalization.

- **Design**: Prospective, observational study.
- **Setting**: Tertiary-care teaching hospital.
- **Patients**: Two hundred ninety-five patients with CAP who were consecutively admitted to the hospital and treated empirically.
- **Interventions**: Patients were stratified according to the prognostic rule of Fine, and the antibiotic regimen prescribed in the first 24 hours was evaluated as to whether or not it adhered to treatment guidelines.

Results showed adherence to SEPAR and ATS guidelines was 66% and 88%, respectively. There were no significant differences in mortality or duration of hospitalization between adherent and non-adherent regimens. However, mortality in severe CAP (Fine risk class V) was significantly higher in patients with non-adherent treatments (SEPAR: relative risk [RR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 5.6; ATS: RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.8). In a multivariate analysis, adherence to ATS guidelines was independently associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.9) after adjusting for the Fine score.

Adherence was higher to ATS guidelines than to SEPAR guidelines. Severe CAP had a significantly higher mortality when the guidelines (both ATS and SEPAR) were not adhered to.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^117SmUh4]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

To compare specific antibiotic regimens, and monotherapy vs. combination therapy, for the empirical treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a meta-analysis was conducted. The data sources included Medline, Embase, the Cochrane register of controlled trials, study authors, and review articles. Randomized controlled trials were selected that evaluated empirical parenteral antibiotic regimens for adult patients with clinically suspected VAP.

Two independent review groups searched the literature, extracted data, and evaluated trial quality. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, while secondary outcomes included treatment failure. Relative risks were pooled using a random effects model.

A total of 41 trials, randomizing 7,015 patients and comparing 29 unique regimens, were identified. The methodological quality was low, reflecting low rates of complete follow-up (43.9%), use of a double-blinded interventional strategy (14.6%), and randomization concealment (48.6%). Overall mortality was 20.3%; treatment failure occurred in 37.4% of patients who could be evaluated microbiologically. No mortality differences were observed between any of the regimens compared. Only one of three pooled comparisons yielded a significant difference for treatment failure; the combination of ceftazidime/aminoglycoside was inferior to meropenem (two trials, relative risk 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.53–0.93). Rates of mortality and treatment failure for monotherapy compared with combination therapy were similar (11 trials, relative risk for mortality of monotherapy 0.94).

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has led to various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved due to changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens.

- **Guideline establishment**: Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens.

- **Guideline recommendations**: Each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Community-acquired pneumonia guideline recommendations-impact of a consensus-based process versus systematic reviews [^112t2huR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines were developed using systematic reviews to inform every recommendation, as suggested by the Institute of Medicine Standards for Trustworthy Guidelines. Recent studies suggest that an expert consensus-based approach, called the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process, can produce recommendations that are concordant with recommendations informed by systematic reviews.

- **Purpose**: The goal of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the CORE process had it been used to develop the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines.

- **Methods**: Experts in CAP who were not on the guideline panel and had no knowledge of the guideline's systematic reviews or recommendations were recruited to participate in the CORE process, addressing the same questions asked by the guideline panel. Recommendations derived from the CORE process were compared to the guideline recommendations. Concordance of the course of action, strength of recommendation, and quality of evidence were determined.

- **Results**: Using a threshold of 70% of experts selecting the same course of action to make a recommendation, the CORE process yielded a recommendation for 20 of 31 (65%) questions. Among the 20 CORE-derived recommendations, 19 (95%) were concordant with the guideline recommendations (kappa agreement 0.88, 95% CI .64–1.00). There was less agreement among the strength of recommendations (58%) and quality of evidence (42%).

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^112DLpKn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to be based on the site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards due to limited intensive care unit (ICU) beds or because of unrecognized pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside the ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managed in general wards.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a one-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment within the first 24 hours was collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcomes (composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study.

- **Results**: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP, of which 50 (53.2%) were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood cultures than patients with non-severe CAP.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid diseases. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious diseases in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection according to selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Managing community-acquired pneumonia: A European perspective [^112DfDgG]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It imposes a significant burden on medical and economic resources, particularly when hospitalization is required. Initial antibacterial therapy for CAP is typically empirical, as culture and antibacterial sensitivity test results are rarely available at initial diagnosis.

- **Empirical therapy considerations**: Any agent selected for empirical therapy should have good activity against the pathogens commonly associated with CAP, a favorable tolerability profile, and be administered in a simple dosage regimen for good compliance. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common causative pathogen, although its incidence varies widely. Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to penicillin have become increasingly prevalent over the past 30 years and are now a serious problem worldwide. Furthermore, an increase in the prevalence of pneumococci resistant to macrolides has been observed in Europe over recent years.

- **Atypical and less common pathogens**: Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are among the most common atypical pathogens isolated from patients with CAP. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis are less commonly identified as causative organisms.

The emergence and spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics have challenged the management of CAP. Multiple sets of CAP guidelines have been published to address the continued changes in this complex disease.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in terms of the duration of antibiotic therapy, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend basing the duration on validated measures of clinical stability. These measures include resolution of vital sign abnormalities, normal mentation, and the ability to tolerate oral intake. Antibiotics should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for at least five days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Antibiotic therapy, follow-up, and outcomes assessment

Initial empirical antibiotic therapy was administered in the emergency department in accordance with participating hospitals' guidelines, which recommend the administration of a β-lactam agent with or without a macrolide or fluoroquinolone. Initial empirical combination antimicrobial therapy was recommended for patients with severe CAP and/or those without any positive microbiological test. Levofloxacin monotherapy was indicated for Legionella pneumonia and for selected patients, such as those with β-lactam allergy. Carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefipime were considered broad-spectrum antibiotics, while narrow-spectrum antibiotics were generally considered when penicillin or ceftriaxone were used. All decisions regarding empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy, de-escalation, switching from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy, and duration of treatment were made by the attending clinicians. The investigators were not involved in any decisions regarding antibiotic treatment.

All participants were seen daily during their hospital stay by their attending physicians and by at least one of the study investigators. The investigators recorded all outcome measures. Days of therapy (DOTs) were calculated as the days elapsed from the initial dose of antimicrobial until the last dose of antimicrobial therapy for the CAP episode. The DOT for a given patient on multiple antibiotics was the sum of DOT for each antibiotic that the patient received. All antibiotics administered to patients for an episode of CAP and its related complications were accounted for in this assessment.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: What is relevant and what is not [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and it is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria, and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for the management of community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Recent findings**: All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms. Clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

- **Summary**: The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstays of community-acquired pneumonia prevention are influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience. They then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

- **Results**: The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

- **Conclusions**: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114MjWSZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

The optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is uncertain. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of antibiotics for empiric therapy of moderate to severe CAP using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

- **Data sources**: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to July 3, 2024.
- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCT).
- **Participants**: Adults with moderate to severe CAP.
- **Interventions**: Any empiric antibiotic regimen versus another, placebo, or no treatment.
- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Paired reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.
- **Methods of data synthesis**: We conducted frequentist random-effects NMAs addressing patient-important outcomes and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Results from 143 RCTs involving 29,157 participants proved eligible. Effects are in comparison with respiratory fluoroquinolones alone. Penicillins alone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67; RD 33 more per 1000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 88 more), 2nd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.02; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 135 more), and 3rd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77; RD 42 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 102 more) or combined with a macrolide (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.84; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 3 fewer to 111 more) may be inferior in reducing treatment failure (all low certainty). The evidence among other antibiotic regimens is still being evaluated.

### Procalcitonin guidance of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized trial [^11585mQF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for 7 to 21 days. Procalcitonin is elevated in bacterial infections, and its dynamics have prognostic implications.

- **Objective**: To assess procalcitonin guidance for the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Methods**: In a randomized intervention trial, 302 consecutive patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia were included. Data were assessed at baseline, after 4, 6, and 8 days, and after 6 weeks. The control group (n = 151) received antibiotics according to usual practice. In the procalcitonin group (n = 151), antibiotic treatment was based on serum procalcitonin concentrations as follows: strongly discouraged, less than 0.1 microg/L; discouraged, less than 0.25 microg/L; encouraged, greater than 0.25 microg/L; strongly encouraged, greater than 0.5 microg/L. The primary endpoint was antibiotic use; secondary endpoints were measures of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic outcome.

- **Results**: At baseline, both groups were similar regarding clinical, laboratory, and microbiology characteristics, and Pneumonia Severity Index. Procalcitonin guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.55; p < 0.001), antibiotic prescriptions on admission (85 vs. 99%; p < 0.001), and antibiotic treatment duration (median, 5 vs. 12 days; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated according to guidelines. After adjustment for Pneumonia Severity Index, the hazard ratio of antibiotic discontinuation was higher.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^114t41w2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most international guidelines recommend that empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) be based on the site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards due to limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability or because of unrecognized pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside the ICU has not yet been established.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116xUUHf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza. In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%); therefore, antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with antibiotic stewardship (AS) considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels. We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.

### Testing strategies in the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^11331Ns8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia is challenging due to the broad range of clinical presentations, the potentially life-threatening nature of the illness, and the associated high costs of care. Initial testing strategies should accurately establish a diagnosis and prognosis to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The diagnosis is crucial for determining the need for antibiotic therapy, while the prognosis helps decide the site of care.

This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings – individually and in combination – in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia and predicting short-term risk of death from the infection. Additionally, we consider these test characteristics from the perspective of decision thresholds. While the history and physical examination alone cannot provide a high level of certainty in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, the absence of vital sign abnormalities considerably reduces the probability of the infection.

Chest radiography is considered the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis. However, its sensitivity and specificity are unknown, and there is limited data on the costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In the absence of empirical evidence, the decision to order a chest radiograph must rely on expert opinion to balance harms and benefits effectively. Once community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed, a combination of history and physical examination is used to guide management strategies.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: A network meta-analysis [^112SDUK2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) is the most life-threatening form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and often necessitates intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to invasive mechanical ventilation or septic shock requiring vasopressors. The overall mortality rate for SCAP exceeds 20%, and it is a leading cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Studies indicate that early administration of antibiotics can reduce hospital mortality and ICU admission rates; therefore, an appropriate initial antibiotic regimen is important for patients with SCAP.

The most frequently identified pathogens causing SCAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and atypical pathogens. Understanding these pathogens is critical as it informs the selection of appropriate initial empirical antibiotic regimens, which are essential for reducing mortality and ICU admissions in SCAP patients. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) and the latest European community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines recommend β-lactam antibiotics plus macrolides for patients with SCAP. The combination of β-lactam antibiotics and respiratory fluoroquinolones, however, remains controversial and lacks definitive evidence to support its superiority. Moreover, recent retrospective cohort studies have suggested that β-lactam antibiotics plus macrolides, fluoroquinolone monotherapy, and β-lactam antibiotics plus doxycycline may yield similar outcomes.

### Nonresponses and treatment failures with conventional empiric regimens in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^111YxkTE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Although most patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) respond to empiric therapy, a small number do not respond in the expected fashion. Age and underlying comorbid conditions have a strong influence on the course of the illness. Less common causes of treatment failures include overwhelming infection, antimicrobial resistance, and misdiagnosis. It is a common practice to initiate empiric antimicrobial treatment of CAP without microbiologic studies. Clinicians should carefully observe these patients for unusual or slow responses and be ready to pursue a more extensive search for the cause of treatment failure.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^113pECdX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death worldwide. Severe CAP refers to patients who have the severe disease with poor outcomes and require a higher level of care. Several criteria have been proposed to define severe CAP, with most reports simply defining it as CAP that necessitates intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Initial treatment of CAP is usually empirical since the microbial etiology cannot be predicted based on clinical presentation. Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy that is based on the location of care, with specific recommendations for those managed as outpatients, inpatients, and in ICUs. Adherence to initial antibiotic selection guidelines is associated with improved survival and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation for patients with severe CAP in ICU.

ICU admission policies and the availability of ICU beds vary widely across the world. The shortage of ICU beds is a daily problem in many hospitals, especially in under-resourced countries. Moreover, a category of severe CAP classified by the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) minor criteria may be under-recognized because patients may initially present with subtle findings. As many as 45% of patients with CAP who ultimately require ICU admission are initially admitted to a non-ICU setting. Consequently, in many hospitals, a substantial number of patients with severe CAP might be managed mainly in general wards due to limited ICU availability.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for *Streptococcus pneumoniae* plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen.

Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant *S. pneumoniae*. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Infectious diseases society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^115TUqhk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). High credibility.

The clinical tool "2007 IDSA/ATS criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia" is designed for the identification and stratification of patients with severe manifestations of community-acquired pneumonia. This tool aids in the decision-making process for hospitalization and intensive care unit admission, thereby optimizing patient management and resource allocation.

The criteria consist of two categories: minor and major.

- **Minor criteria**: Respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute, arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio less than 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion or disorientation, uremia (blood urea nitrogen greater than 20 mg/dL), leukopenia (white blood cell count less than 4,000/mL due to infection alone), thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000/mL), hypothermia (core temperature less than 36.8 degrees C), and hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.

- **Major criteria**: Septic shock requiring vasopressors and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The severity of community-acquired pneumonia is determined by the cumulative score of these criteria. A patient is considered to have severe community-acquired pneumonia if the score is 3 or more. If the score is less than 3, the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia are not met. This scoring system allows for a standardized approach in patient assessment.

### Validation of the Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society 2007 guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^111FBSzd]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Validate the Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society 2007 (IDSA/ATS 2007) criteria for predicting severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) and evaluate a health-services definition for SCAP. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at LDS Hospital, an academic tertiary care facility in the western United States. The study included consecutive patients with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, codes and chest radiographs consistent with community-acquired pneumonia from 1996 to 2006 seen at LDS Hospital. There were no interventions.

We utilized the electronic medical record to examine intensive care unit admission, intensive therapies received, predictors of severity, and 30-day mortality. Logistic regression models of mortality and disease severity were developed. The IDSA/ATS 2007 criteria were calculated along with three other pneumonia severity scores. SCAP was defined as receipt of intensive therapy in the intensive care unit. Among 2413 episodes of pneumonia, 1540 patients were admitted to the hospital, and 379 were admitted to the intensive care unit. Overall 30-day mortality was 3.7%, but it was 16% among intensive care patients.

The IDSA/ATS 2007 minor criteria predicted SCAP with an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.85–0.90), which improved to 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.88–0.92) with weighting. Competing models had an area under the curve of 0.76 to 0.83. Using four rather than three minor criteria improved the positive predictive value from 54% to 81%.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1113jsxi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the inpatient setting for nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend considering administering combination therapy with a β-lactam (such as ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftaroline, or ceftriaxone) and doxycycline 100 mg BID. This regimen is suggested as an alternative option for adult patients with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones.

### Empiric treatment in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia. Impact on mortality, length of stay and re-admission [^114GLxZQ]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To evaluate adherence to guidelines when choosing an empirical treatment and its impact upon the prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), a prospective multicentre study was conducted in 425 CAP patients hospitalized on a ward. Initial empirical treatment was classified as adhering or not to Spanish guidelines. Adherent treatment was defined as an initial antimicrobial regimen consisting of beta-lactams plus macrolides, beta-lactam monotherapy, and quinolones. Non-adherent treatments included macrolide monotherapy and other regimens. Initial severity was graded according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI). The endpoint variables were mortality, length of stay (LOS), and re-admission at 30 days.

Overall, the 30-day mortality was 8.2%, the mean LOS was 8 ± 5 days, and the global re-admission rate was 7.6%. Adherence to guidelines was 76.5%, and in most cases, the empirical treatment consisted of a beta-lactam and macrolide combination (57.4%). Logistic regression analysis showed that other regimens were associated with higher mortality (OR = 3, 95% CI 1.2–7.3) after adjusting for PSI and admitting hospital. Beta-lactam monotherapy was an independent risk factor for re-admission. LOS was independently associated with the admitting hospital and not with antibiotics.

A high adherence to CAP treatment guidelines was found, though with considerable variability in the empirical antibiotic treatment among hospitals. Non-adherent other regimens were associated with greater mortality. Beta-lactam monotherapy was associated with an increased re-admission.

### Empiric treatment of ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia: Always include treatment for atypical agents [^112c37dG]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

There are no data from proper studies to determine whether it is necessary to include antibiotics that are active against atypical pneumonia agents as part of the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Until such data are available, clinical judgment and the severity of the pneumonic illness are the best guides to empiric antimicrobial therapy.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^114pR1bB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine both direct and indirect evidence to compare initial antibiotic options for patients with SCAP. Our analysis provides important insights to guide clinical decision-making regarding antibiotic choice for these patients. From our analysis, we derived several key findings: β-lactam plus macrolide emerged as the best choice for patients with SCAP, in alignment with international guidelines. Fluoroquinolone monotherapy can be considered a reasonable alternative when β-lactam plus macrolide is not appropriate. However, β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone should be avoided.

Early antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with SCAP. Although atypical microorganisms are responsible for 8–20% of SCAP cases, their role in the disease process is significant. Therefore, empiric antibiotic treatment targeting atypical pathogens is associated with a reduction in clinical failure rates among hospitalized adults with CAP. In addition to their antibacterial effects, macrolides possess broad anti-inflammatory properties. When combined with β-lactams, macrolides improve early clinical responses, reduce inflammation, enhance gas exchange, alleviate sepsis and organ failure, and lower mortality risk. Consistent with the result of a previous study, we recommend β-lactam plus macrolide as the preferred empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized patients with SCAP.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^113aEzsS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qgUpP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and expenditure of resources. Guidelines for the management of CAP have been shown to improve clinical outcomes when followed; however, several issues remain unresolved. This review summarizes recent advances in this field and identifies priority needs for future research.

Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity. However, defining the most accurate and feasible rules for clinical practice is now necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still under debate, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and non-severe hospitalized patients, and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice treatments. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for non-severe patients, and the need for special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure.

Recent developments have significantly contributed to refining the management of CAP patients. However, various hot topics remain undefined and urgently require ad-hoc research to optimize outcomes and costs of treatment.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: Rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations concerning the diagnosis, optimal choice, timing, and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, as well as the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Guidelines are frequently utilized as a quick reference for these issues. Furthermore, possibilities for future research in these topics will be discussed.

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

The diagnosis and management of CAP have hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. In the coming years, improved diagnostic testing — radiologically by low-dose computed tomography or ultrasound, and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR — has the potential to significantly influence the choice and initiation of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing is anticipated to improve antibiotic de-escalation or facilitate early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are currently based on limited evidence and will be challenging to enhance.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^111rJW34]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Optimal antibiotic use is vital for effectively treating infections and protecting patients from antibiotic-associated adverse events, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and multidrug-resistant organisms. Pneumonia is the most common indication for inpatient antibiotic therapy and a major contributor to antibiotic overuse. Despite guidelines recommending a shorter antibiotic course, the majority of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) receive an excessive duration of therapy.

Several studies have demonstrated that antibiotic stewardship interventions can decrease excessive-duration antibiotic therapy for CAP, but data from large multihospital collaboratives are lacking. In 2017, the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS), a statewide collaborative quality initiative (CQI), began collecting data, sharing best practices, and benchmarking performance related to antibiotic duration for uncomplicated CAP. The resulting antibiotic use and patient outcomes from the first three years are described here.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116NEoCU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112hi12x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
