## Question

What dose of methylene blue is used in shock?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose of methylene blue used in shock. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and mechanism to anchor when methylene blue is appropriate. Then, I should verify the highest-quality dosing evidence from randomized trials. Next, I will review alternative dosing regimens from observational and pilot studies. After that, I need to check safety, toxicity thresholds, and monitoring. I will then consider special populations and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, cautious recommendation and note uncertainties that require larger trials before routine adoption.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions. Methylene blue is used as an adjunct in vasodilatory shock, particularly septic shock, where it inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase and modulates nitric oxide signaling to restore vascular tone; it is not a substitute for fluids and first-line vasopressors and should be considered after adequate resuscitation and norepinephrine initiation, ideally early in the course rather than as a last-ditch rescue, though the latter remains common practice [^113384oF] [^114hkDpJ] [^111NrYh2].

> I will now examine the highest-quality dosing regimen. The SHOCKEM-Blue randomized controlled trial used methylene blue 100 mg in 500 mL normal saline infused over 6 hours once daily for a total of 3 doses, initiated within 24 hours of septic shock onset. This strategy reduced time to vasopressor discontinuation and length of stay without serious adverse effects, and the total cumulative dose approximated 3.6 mg/kg over 54 hours in a typical 70 kg patient, which aligns with a pragmatic, fixed-dose approach in resource-limited settings [^111NrYh2] [^112cS4s5] [^112JwC3y].

> Wait, let me verify whether weight-based bolus regimens perform differently. A randomized, blinded study in septic cancer patients compared 1 mg/kg versus 4 mg/kg boluses followed by 0.25 mg/kg/h for 72 hours. Both reduced vasopressor requirements similarly, but the 4 mg/kg bolus arm showed a signal for improved survival versus placebo, suggesting that a higher initial bolus may confer benefit in some populations, albeit with low-certainty evidence and potential confounding [^116vd2B3] [^116jpqtH] [^111uBn4A].

> Next, I should review earlier and smaller studies to ensure consistency. Historical data include 1–2 mg/kg boluses, bolus plus infusion combinations, and continuous infusions ranging from 0.25 to 2 mg/kg/h, with signals of hemodynamic improvement but heterogeneity in design and outcomes; for example, a pilot RCT used 2 mg/kg bolus followed by escalating infusions up to 2 mg/kg/h, and observational cohorts have described 1–2 mg/kg boluses with or without infusions, reinforcing that multiple regimens have been used without a clearly superior standard to date [^1127Mv32] [^1172JZTs] [^11264nyM].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and toxicity thresholds before recommending higher doses. Methylene blue is generally well tolerated, but toxicity is dose related. Cumulative doses at or above 7 mg/kg risk methemoglobinemia and hemolysis, and single large doses of 3 mg/kg or more have been associated with hypotension, wheezing, and reduced oxygenation, so I need to ensure cumulative exposure remains below 7 mg/kg and avoid very high single boluses when possible [^113yXMqJ] [^112JwC3y] [^1155kbWo].

> I need to check special populations and practical administration details. In renal impairment or continuous renal replacement therapy, reduced clearance may increase exposure. While formal septic shock dosing guidance is lacking, methemoglobinemia labeling advises maximal single doses of 1 mg/kg with monitoring in significant renal dysfunction, so I should be conservative and consider dose reduction or extended intervals in these settings. Additionally, to mitigate extravasation risk and tissue necrosis, infusions should preferentially be delivered via a central line, and I should double-check diluent compatibility because some authors caution that normal saline may precipitate certain MB formulations, whereas others have safely used saline in trials. If precipitation is a concern, 5% dextrose is an alternative diluent, but I should reconcile this with local pharmacy guidance and trial practices before deciding [^1134nkof] [^112rQ2FA] [^111D8dHw] [^113yjnqH] [^1176meuo] [^1137oVBH].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions and monitoring so I don't overlook preventable harms. Methylene blue is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and can precipitate serotonin toxicity when combined with serotonergic agents; I should screen for SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, linezolid, and meperidine before use and avoid coadministration when feasible; during infusion, I should monitor MAP continuously, watch for methemoglobinemia with co-oximetry if high cumulative dosing is used, and anticipate blue discoloration of urine and skin that, while benign, can unblind caregivers in trials and may confuse pulse oximetry readings [^113384oF] [^112JwC3y].

> But wait, what about timing and the need for repeated dosing. The strongest signal for benefit comes when methylene blue is initiated early, within 24 hours of septic shock onset, and repeated daily dosing in SHOCKEM-Blue likely sustained nitric oxide pathway inhibition across the typical 2–3 day vasopressor window; mechanistic reasoning and observational data suggest that bolus plus infusion strategies may prolong effect, but high-quality comparative data are limited, so I should acknowledge uncertainty while favoring early initiation and considering a short infusion course if used [^111NrYh2] [^114N5z1j] [^1173Fs4T].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations before extrapolating adult regimens. Evidence in children is limited to case reports and small series; typical pediatric reports describe 1 mg/kg loading followed by 0.25 mg/kg/h infusions with hemodynamic improvement, but given the very low certainty, pediatric use should be exceptional and guided by specialist input, with careful attention to G6PD deficiency screening and cumulative dosing constraints [^114vgH82] [^117978iE] [^111t8Ttp].

> Let me synthesize a practical, cautious recommendation while keeping the evidence limitations front and center. For adult septic shock refractory to fluids and norepinephrine, a reasonable evidence-aligned approach is methylene blue 100 mg in 500 mL normal saline infused over 6 hours once daily for 3 days, initiated as early as feasible within 24 hours of shock onset, with a hard cap on cumulative exposure below 7 mg/kg and preference for central venous administration. Alternatively, in settings where weight-based dosing is preferred, a 1–2 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.25 mg/kg/h for up to 72 hours can be considered, recognizing that a 4 mg/kg bolus has shown a survival signal in one RCT but warrants careful safety monitoring and is not yet standard of care [^111NrYh2] [^112JwC3y] [^116vd2B3] [^113yXMqJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality benefit. While meta-analyses suggest potential improvements in vasopressor exposure and possibly mortality with non-adrenergic vasopressors including methylene blue, individual RCTs are underpowered for mortality, and heterogeneity is substantial. Therefore, methylene blue should remain adjunctive, not replace guideline-directed therapy, and clinicians should counsel teams that benefits are likely intermediate, such as faster vasopressor weaning and shorter ICU stay, rather than proven mortality reduction at this time [^115YHT4F] [^1164YMdb] [^114i4mJV].

> Finally, I need to ensure I've addressed key caveats. Methylene blue is not first-line therapy and should not delay antibiotics, fluids, and norepinephrine. Avoid in pregnancy and G6PD deficiency. Screen for serotonergic interactions. And if used for non-septic vasoplegia such as post–cardiopulmonary bypass or drug-induced shock, dosing remains empiric and should be individualized with attention to cumulative exposure and hemodynamic response, ideally within institutional protocols or research frameworks until larger multicenter trials confirm optimal dosing, timing, and patient selection [^114hkDpJ] [^113384oF] [^113NMyT6] [^112FrKjP].

Methylene blue is used as an adjunct in refractory vasodilatory shock, with **1–2 mg/kg IV bolus over 20–60 minutes** as the most common regimen, often followed by a continuous infusion at 0.25–2 mg/kg/hour for up to 72 hours [^1127Mv32] [^116jpqtH]. Early administration within 24 hours of shock onset is associated with improved hemodynamics and shorter vasopressor duration [^111NrYh2]. Cumulative doses should generally remain below 7 mg/kg to avoid toxicity; monitor for methemoglobinemia, serotonin toxicity, and local extravasation [^113yXMqJ] [^113yjnqH].

---

## Clinical indications and rationale

Methylene blue is indicated for refractory vasodilatory shock — including septic, postcardiotomy, anaphylactic, and drug-induced shock — characterized by **persistent hypotension despite fluids and high-dose vasopressors** [^113384oF]. It **restores vascular tone** by inhibiting nitric oxide–cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO–cGMP) signaling, thereby reducing vasopressor requirements and improving mean arterial pressure (MAP) [^113384oF] [^111iNuwe].

---

## Recommended dosing regimens

Several dosing regimens have been studied; the most commonly used and supported regimens include:

| **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Administration** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bolus dose | 1–2 mg/kg | IV bolus over 20–60 minutes | Single dose |
| Continuous infusion | 0.25–2 mg/kg/hour | IV infusion | Up to 72 hours |
| Combined regimen | 1–2 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 0.25–2 mg/kg/hour | IV bolus followed by infusion | Up to 72 hours |

---

These regimens are supported by clinical studies demonstrating **improved hemodynamics and reduced vasopressor requirements** without significant adverse effects when administered within the recommended dose ranges [^1127Mv32] [^114N5z1j].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimens

- **Early adjunctive methylene blue**: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that early administration of methylene blue (100 mg in 500 mL saline over 6 hours once daily for 3 days) significantly reduced vasopressor duration, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay without significant adverse effects [^111NrYh2] [^112cS4s5].
- **Bolus plus infusion**: A prospective study comparing high-dose (4 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.25 mg/kg/hour infusion) and low-dose (1 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.25 mg/kg/hour infusion) regimens found both effective in reducing vasopressor requirements, with no significant difference between groups [^116vd2B3] [^116jpqtH].
- **Continuous infusion**: Continuous infusion regimens (0.25–2 mg/kg/hour) have been shown to maintain hemodynamic stability and reduce vasopressor requirements, particularly when initiated early in the course of shock [^1127Mv32] [^115XB2Qa].

---

## Timing of administration

Early administration of methylene blue within 24 hours of shock onset is associated with **improved hemodynamic outcomes**, including reduced vasopressor duration and shorter ICU and hospital length of stay [^111NrYh2] [^114naJhP]. Delayed administration may reduce efficacy and is associated with poorer outcomes.

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Methylene blue is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should be aware of the following **safety considerations**:

- **Methemoglobinemia**: Monitor for methemoglobinemia, particularly with higher cumulative doses (> 7 mg/kg) [^113yXMqJ].
- **Serotonin toxicity**: Methylene blue is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and can precipitate serotonin toxicity when combined with serotonergic agents.
- **Local extravasation**: Avoid peripheral administration due to risk of local tissue necrosis; use central venous access when possible [^113yjnqH].
- **Other adverse effects**: Transient blue discoloration of skin and urine, nausea, vomiting, and allergic reactions.

---

## Special populations and adjustments

- **Renal impairment**: No specific dose adjustments are recommended, but careful monitoring is advised due to potential accumulation.
- **Pediatric patients**: Limited data suggest that pediatric dosing may follow adult regimens (1–2 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.25–2 mg/kg/hour infusion), but further studies are needed [^114vgH82] [^111t8Ttp].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Currently, there are **no universally accepted clinical guidelines** specifically for methylene blue dosing in shock. Expert consensus and available evidence support its use as an adjunctive therapy in refractory vasodilatory shock, with dosing regimens ranging from 1–2 mg/kg IV bolus to continuous infusions of 0.25–2 mg/kg/hour.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial bolus dose**: 1–2 mg/kg IV over 20–60 minutes.
- **Continuous infusion**: 0.25–2 mg/kg/hour for up to 72 hours.
- **Early administration**: Within 24 hours of shock onset for optimal efficacy.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for methemoglobinemia, serotonin toxicity, and local extravasation.
- **Cumulative dose**: Generally limit to ≤ 7 mg/kg to minimize toxicity risk [^1155kbWo].

Methylene blue is a **valuable adjunct** in refractory vasodilatory shock, with **1–2 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 0.25–2 mg/kg/hour infusion** as the most commonly used regimen. Early administration within 24 hours of shock onset is associated with improved hemodynamic outcomes, and careful monitoring is essential to minimize adverse effects.

Statistics

Statistical calculations were performed in Microsoft Excel® (Redmond, WA, USA). Where appropriate, the comparison of averages (in responders and non-responders) and standard deviations of demographics, MB dose, MAP, and reductions in vasopressor dosing were performed via Chi squared, Fisher's exact test, or two-tailed t-test with a p-value less than 0.05 considered as statistically significant. After using the F-test to assess for differences in variance, a two tailed t-test was used to compare sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores among MB responders versus non-responders. A power analysis was waived given that this was a retrospective review that included all possible patients receiving MB.

### Methylene blue in the treatment of refractory shock from an amlodipine overdose [^115qmQRf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Amlodipine is a potent vasodilator with a long half-life and delayed onset of action that is particularly concerning after an overdose. Vasodilation occurs through stimulation of nitric oxide release with increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. Methylene blue inhibits guanylate cyclase. This enzyme is responsible for the production of cGMP. Methylene blue also has the ability to scavenge nitric oxide, as well as inhibit nitric oxide synthase. We report the use of methylene blue for refractory shock in a patient with amlodipine toxicity.

Limitations

Some limitations should be acknowledged. First, this was a single-center study. As a one of the largest reference centers in Mexico, it is common that our patients have a relatively short ICU/hospital stance compared to other larger multicenter trials; as long as there is no need for strictly needed care, persistent organ failure or pending surgery/procedure, patients are discharged as rapidly as possible and followed up through outpatient visits. Thus, a different effect of MB on length of stay in other settings cannot be ruled out. Second, most patients were managed in other departments at the moment of septic shock identification before admission to ICU, the lack of trained healthcare staff and resources (ultrasound, invasive monitoring) might have led to sub-optimal resuscitation and worse patients' status, as shown by the relatively higher doses of norepinephrine compared to other larger RCTs of patients with septic shock. Therefore, although the time from enrollment to intervention was negligible, an improved response to MB at an earlier phase of the disease cannot be ruled out, as it has been suggested that MB could be more effective within an early "window of opportunity". Third, this trial took many years to complete as the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the recruitment rate, and the SSC guidelines were updated while this study was still ongoing. However, it is worth to note that the changes were few, and the resuscitation protocol in our study was still consistent with the new guidelines. For instance, we did not aim for a dose of 30 ml/kg of IV crystalloids at initial resuscitation, and this recommendation was downgraded; we also used IV corticosteroids in all patients while this recommendation was upgraded. Fourth, we did not measure cytokine or nitrate/nitrite serum levels to confirm the mechanism of the effects of MB, but this should not distract from the pragmatic finding that MB reduced vasopressor duration, and ICU and hospital length of stay. Fifth, as we excluded patients with COVID-19, the benefit of MB still needs to be confirmed for this subgroup in future RCTs. Sixth, despite the effort to maintain blinding regarding allocation, the high incidence of urine discoloration and continuous assessment of methemoglobin levels through co-oximetry could have led to identification of group assignment, therefore, a biased adjustment of vasopressors by clinicians cannot be ruled-out. Nonetheless, the similar MAP during the first 4 days (Fig. 2) and less fluid administration suggests that if present, this bias was minimal. Lastly, the difference in mortality trends between groups should be interpreted cautiously, as this study was underpowered to draw any conclusion on this outcome, and larger studies should confirm these results.

### Catastrophic cardiovascular adverse reactions to protamine are nitric oxide / cyclic guanosine monophosphate dependent and endothelium mediated: should methylene blue be the treatment of choice? [^113nkUu3]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical and experimental observations prove that heparin-neutralizing doses of protamine increase pulmonary artery pressures and decrease systemic BP. Protamine also increases myocardial oxygen consumption, cardiac output, and heart rate, and decreases systemic vascular resistance. These cardiovascular effects have clinical consequences that have justified studies in this area. Protamine adverse reactions usually have three different categories: systemic hypotension, anaphylactoid reactions, and catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The precise mechanism that explains protamine-mediated systemic hypotension is unknown. Four experimental protocols performed at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, studied the intrinsic mechanism of protamine vasodilation. The first study reported in vitro systemic and coronary vasodilation after protamine infusion. The second in vitro study suggested that the pulmonary circulation is extensively involved in the protamine-mediated effects on endothelial function. The third study, carried out in anesthetized dogs, reported the methylene blue and nitric oxide synthase blockers neutralization of the protamine vasodilatatory effects. The fourth study suggested that protamine also causes endothelium-dependent vasodilation in heart microvessels and conductance arteries by different mechanisms including hyperpolarization. Reviewing these experimental results and our clinical experience, we suggest methylene blue as a novel approach to prevent and treat hemodynamic complications caused by the use of protamine after cardiopulmonary bypass. In the absence of prospective clinical trials, a growing body of cumulative clinical evidence suggests that methylene blue may be strongly considered as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of distributive shock.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^112JwC3y]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding potential adverse effects, two prior small non-randomized studies suggested that MB could induce worsening of oxygenation due to pulmonary vasoconstriction. Gachot et al. reported a significant decrease of PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio from 229 to 162 after a 3 mg/kg bolus of MB over 10 min, and Weingartner et al. found a decrease of PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio from 168 to 132 after a dose of 4 mg/kg over 4 h; however, these detrimental effects were transient and not confirmed by other RCTs including ours, as most of our patients had ARDS diagnosis and the change in PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio and days of mechanical ventilation were similar between groups after treatment. Moreover, it is known that unlike the beneficial effects, the toxic profile of MB is dose related, so the rate/dose used in those non-randomized studies could have been unsafe. A dose of 1 mg/kg has been shown to be enough to improve MAP, left ventricular function and tissue oxygenation in human septic shock, while ≥ 7 mg/kg might compromise splanchnic perfusion and adverse effects are rarely present under 2 mg/kg. Besides, continuous prolonged infusion of MB may lead to higher cumulative doses, which might be toxic and result in methemoglobinemia; this is the pragmatic reason why we decided to administer a fixed dose of 100 mg vials (available presentation at our institution) assuming that most patients would receive at least 1 mg/kg while avoiding high cumulative doses. This schedule resulted in a total cumulative dose of 3.6 mg/kg over 54 h, which was sufficient to reduce vasopressor support with no detrimental effects in pulmonary, kidney, cardiac or liver function. Although methemoglobin levels were significantly higher in patients of MB, this elevation was far from the clinically relevant threshold of 10%.

### Methylene blue used in the treatment of refractory shock resulting from drug poisoning [^116AxdTB]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Methylene blue inhibits the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway, decreasing vasodilation and increasing responsiveness to vasopressors. It is reported to improve haemodynamics in distributive shock from various causes including septicaemia and post-cardiac surgery. Reports of use in overdose are limited. We describe the use of methylene blue to treat a case of refractory distributive shock following a mixed drug poisoning.

Case Details

A 41-year-old male presented following reported ingestion of 18 g extended-release quetiapine, 10 g controlled-release carbamazepine, 240 mg fluoxetine, 35 g enteric-coated sodium valproate and 375 mg oxazepam. He was comatose and intubated on presentation. Progressive hypotension developed. Echocardiogram revealed a hyperdynamic left ventricle, suggesting distributive shock. The patient remained hypotensive despite intravenous fluid boluses, escalating vasopressor infusions. Arterial blood gas revealed metabolic acidaemia and high lactate. Methylene blue was administered as loading-dose of 1.5 mg/kg and continuous infusion (1.5 mg/kg/h for 12 h, then 0.75 mg/kg/h for 12 h) resulting in rapid improvement in haemodynamic parameters and weaning of vasopressors. Serum quetiapine concentration was 18600 ng/mL (30–160 ng/mL), collected at the time of peak toxicity.

Conclusion

Severe quetiapine poisoning produces hypotension primarily from alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonism. Methylene blue may have utility in the treatment of distributive shock resulting from poisoning refractory to standard vasopressor therapy.

### Methylene blue for refractory shock in children: a systematic review and survey practice analysis [^114vgH82]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Shock refractory to fluid and catecholamine therapy has significant morbidity and mortality in children. The use of methylene blue to treat refractory shock in children is not well described. We aim to collect and summarize the literature and define physicians' practice patterns regarding the use of methylene blue to treat shock in children.

Design

We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane for studies involving the use of methylene blue for catecholamine-refractory shock from database inception to 2019. Collected studies were analyzed qualitatively. To describe practice patterns of methylene blue use, we electronically distributed a survey to U.S.-based pediatric critical care physicians. We assessed physician knowledge and experience with methylene blue. Survey responses were quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated.

Setting

Pediatric critical and cardiac care units.

Patients Or Subjects

Patients less than or equal to 25 years old with refractory shock treated with methylene blue.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

One-thousand two-hundred ninety-three abstracts met search criteria, 139 articles underwent full-text review, and 24 studies were included. Studies investigated refractory shock induced by a variety of etiologies and found that methylene blue was generally safe and increased mean arterial blood pressure. There is overall lack of studies, low number of study patients, and low quality of studies identified. Our survey had a 22.5% response rate, representing 125 institutions. Similar proportions of physicians reported using (40%) or never even considering (43%) methylene blue for shock. The most common reasons for not using methylene blue were unfamiliarity with this drug, its proper dosing, and lack of evidentiary support.

Conclusions

Methylene blue appears safe and may benefit children with refractory shock. There is a stark divide in familiarity and practice patterns regarding its use among physicians. Studies to formally assess safety and efficacy of methylene blue in treating pediatric shock are warranted.

### Methylene blue is associated with poor outcomes in vasoplegic shock [^114th5RS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether patients who received methylene blue as treatment for vasoplegia during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass had decreased morbidity and mortality.

Design

Retrospective analysis.

Setting

Single tertiary care university hospital.

Participants

Adult patients who suffered from vasoplegia and underwent all types of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at this institution between 2007 and 2008.

Interventions

With IRB approval, the authors reviewed the charts of the identified patients and divided them into 2 groups based on whether they had received methylene blue. Two hundred twenty-six patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria for the study. Fifty-seven of these patients had received methylene blue for vasoplegia. The authors collected data on preoperative and intraoperative variables as well as outcomes.

Measurements and Main Results

The patients who received methylene blue had higher rates of in-hospital mortality, a compilation of morbidities, as well as renal failure and hyperbilirubinemia. A multiple logistic regression model demonstrated that receiving methylene blue was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (p value: 0.007, OR 4.26, 95% CI: 1.49–12.12), compilation of morbidities (p value: 0.001, OR 4.80, 95% CI: 1.85–12.43), and hyperbilirubinemia (p value: < 0.001, OR 6.58, 95% CI: 2.91–14.89). Using propensity score matching, the association with morbidity was again seen but the association with mortality was not found.

Conclusions

The current study identified the use of methylene blue as treatment for vasoplegia to be independently associated with poor outcomes. While further studies are required, a thorough risk-benefit analysis should be applied before using methylene blue and, perhaps, it should be relegated to rescue use and not as first-line therapy.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^113ABE6r]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In a recent retrospective cohort study, the effects of different dosing strategies of MB (bolus, bolus + infusion, infusion only) were assessed in 209 patients with different types of shock (septic, cardiogenic, vasoplegic) who were receiving norepinephrine at doses > 0.1 mcg/kg/min and had lactate concentrations > 2 mmol/L. Survival was improved in the group receiving a bolus + infusion strategy. In a recent randomized, controlled and double-blinded trial, Ibarra-Estrada et al. assessed whether early adjunctive MB administration could reduce the time to vasopressor discontinuation in 92 patients with septic shock who were randomly assigned, within the first 24 h after the start of norepinephrine, to receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of either normal saline or MB once daily for a total of 3 doses. MB-treated patients had a shorter time to vasopressor discontinuation (69 h [IQR 59–83] vs 94 h [IQR 74–141]; p < 0.001), more vasopressor-free days at 28-days (p = 0.008), a shorter ICU length of stay by 1.5 days (p = 0.039), and a shorter hospital length of stay by 2.7 days (p = 0.027) than the control group. However, the study had some limitations, including that the associated green discoloration of the urine makes blinding of the study impossible. It would also have been interesting to have more information on cardiac function and on the potential benefit for the patient of reducing the time of exposure to high doses of norepinephrine.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^115VyE6Y]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition that affects millions of people around the world every year. Septic shock, the most severe form of sepsis, is associated with mortality rates of 35 to 50%. Septic shock typically requires the administration of vasopressors, and this treatment should be started without delay to avoid severe hypotension.

In current clinical practice, adrenergic agents are used as the first line vasopressors, acting to rapidly increase vascular tone and blood pressure (through α-1 adrenergic receptors). In addition, they have a short half-life, which facilitates dose titration. However, catecholamines have potential adverse effects. Adrenergic agents can induce myocardial ischemia and decrease regional blood flow; they also have metabolic effects, including causing hyperglycemia and increased cellular metabolism that can participate in the development of hyperlactatemia, and can exert immunomodulating effects. Norepinephrine is preferred as the first-choice vasopressor agent, because of its balanced pharmacodynamic profile with potent α-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation and modest β-1 adrenergic effects that can help to maintain cardiac output. Nevertheless, excessive vasoconstriction may increase ventricular afterload thus impairing right and left ventricular function, interfere with regional blood flow distribution, and alter the microcirculation.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^115Z2Rb6]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Are there any non-adrenergic alternatives to vasopressin?

The SSC guidelines suggest the use of angiotensin II in patients with septic shock, but the evidence is of very low-quality. In the ATHOS‐3 trial, angiotensin II was compared to placebo as second-line vasopressor in patients with vasoplegic shock (80% of whom had septic shock) who required norepinephrine doses > 0.2 µg/kg/min for > 6 h. Angiotensin II significantly increased MAP without increasing the doses of norepinephrine in 70% of patients, compared to the placebo group. No effect on 28-day mortality was found, but the trial was not designed to detect this. However, as 70% of patients in the ATHOS-3 trial and in the post hoc analysis had received vasopressin prior to randomization, it is not possible to draw any valid about the potential synergistic effect of combining vasopressin and angiotensin II in patients with septic shock.

In a multicenter retrospective cohort study, patients who received vasopressin were more likely to respond to angiotensin II administration (OR 6.05, 95% CI 1.98–18.6; p = 0.002). Nevertheless, the administration of vasopressin alongside angiotensin II was not associated with 30-day mortality. Furthermore, there was no difference in the requirement for continuous RRT or the incidence of acute kidney injury stages 2 or 3 between responders and non-responders to angiotensin II.

A meta-analysis of randomized trials showed that using non-adrenergic vasopressors including vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin in patients with septic shock was associated with a lower mortality rate. However, none of the individual non-adrenergic vasopressors showed significant survival benefits.

From a physiological point of view, we believe that it could make sense to adapt vasopressor therapy to the biological profile of patients with septic shock. Therefore, rather than a stepwise approach, a physiologically guided vasopressor approach may be more appropriate. Such an early multimodal vasopressor therapy approach would allow a combination of first-line vasopressors to be administered to patients with septic shock, targeting the different systems involved in cardiovascular homeostasis.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^113384oF]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

MB has a slightly different profile, as it is an inhibitor of the soluble guanylate cyclase enzyme (sGC), whose activation is important in the NO signaling pathway. sGC catalyzes the production of cGMP in response to NO, and cGMP produces vasorelaxation and inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth cells. Blocking sGC with MB can therefore counteract the hemodynamic effects of NO. Compared with non-selective NOS inhibitors, MB may therefore block some of the deleterious effects of NO, while potentially maintaining its beneficial ones. Use of MB has thus been proposed in septic shock, as in other forms of vasoplegic shock, mainly cardiac surgery, anaphylactic shock, or in reperfusion syndrome after liver transplantation.

MB is a non-expensive and widely available molecule, which has been most commonly used to treat severe methemoglobinemia in the context of poisoning. When administered intravenously, MB has an onset of action of 30–60 min with a terminal plasma half-life of 5–6 h. It is metabolized by the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys, so that patients with dysfunction of these organs have a higher risk of toxicity and drug interactions through cytochrome P450 inhibition. MB is generally well tolerated and toxicity is dose related; blue-green discoloration of urine, skin, and secretions is commonly described, which can interfere with the accuracy of pulse oximeter readings. More severe adverse effects, such as mesenteric vasoconstriction and paradoxical methemoglobinemia, have been reported with higher doses up to 4 mg/kg. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase A by MB can induce a serotonin syndrome. The use of MB is contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

### Amyl nitrite [^1142x8QK]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE:

Symptoms - Inhaled doses of 5 to 10 drops of amyl nitrite may cause violent flushing of the face, accompanied by a feeling of imminent bursting of the head and very excessive heart action. The inhalation of larger amounts may produce a feeling of suffocation and muscular weakness. Symptoms comparable to shock may be produced (such as weakness, restlessness, sweating, pallor, nausea, vomiting, syncope and incontinence) attributable to pooling of blood in the postarteriolar vessels and failure of the venous blood to return to the heart.

Treatment - Measures which facilitate venous return such as head-low posture, deep breathing and movement of extremities may be used. The use of epinephrine aggravates the shock- like reaction. Methylene blue should be injected for treatment of severe methemoglobinemia with dyspnea. For treating cyanide poisoning, methylene blue is contraindicated where nitrites cause iatrogenic methemoglobinemia.

### Methylene blue for the treatment of refractory septic shock secondary to listeriosis in a paediatric patient [^111t8Ttp]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Current therapies frequently used for refractory septic shock include hydrocortisone, vasopressin, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, inodilators, levosimendan and methylene blue. The evidence for these treatments is very limited. We present a case of a 5-year-old patient with refractory septic shock, secondary to Listeria monocytogenes meningitis. She presented with status epilepticus and developed septic shock. Shock persisted despite multiple high-dose vasoactive medications. ECMO support was not available. The medical team decided to use methylene blue to revert the vasoplegia, with excellent results. Shortly after the administration, vasopressors were weaned off and the high lactate cleared. She developed severe neurological sequelae due to brain haemorrhage secondary to the Listeria meningitis. The evidence supporting methylene blue for refractory septic shock in paediatric patients is limited. This case represents the effectiveness of this therapy without secondary effects.

We report the use of a single dose of methylene blue in a patient with burn-induced vasoplegia refractory to fluids, vasopressors, and steroids. Administration of methylene blue allowed for cessation of epinephrine infusion within 2 hours of administration, and reduction in excessive fluid resuscitation. The patient's clinical course continued for 2 months and was complicated by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, septic shock, poor skin graft adherence, renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy, cutaneous mucormycosis, and ultimately, withdrawal of care and death. Despite the eventual outcome, this is the longest reported survival following methylene blue administration for vasoplegia secondary to burn injury.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^1118g574]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a host's dysregulated response to an infection, characterized by endothelial dysfunction leading to increased vascular permeability, abnormal nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, vasodilation, among other systemic derangements. Along with antibiotics, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines recommend early fluid resuscitation as a cornerstone of management; however, only half of the patients respond to fluid challenges and their hemodynamic effects are transient, sometimes lasting as short as 10 min; so, vasopressors are needed to improve organ perfusion. Norepinephrine is the first-choice, but high doses increase the risk of adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmia, myocardial dysfunction, peripheral ischemia, and even immunosuppression. Therefore, a combination of agents targeting different systems involved in blood pressure regulation and endothelial function has been recently proposed. This "multimodal strategy" could help to restore tissue perfusion while decreasing the potential toxicity of single agents.

Methylene blue (MB) is a specific inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and its downstream enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Through its indirect pressor effects, it has been shown to restore vasoregulation in conditions of NO upregulation. However, most of the clinical research has been performed in vasoplegia following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), another form of vasodilatory shock similar to sepsis. Despite promising results of two small randomized controlled trials (RCT) with short follow-up (≤ 48 h) performed in patients with septic shock two decades ago, the momentum to further research was shortly lost.

Based on large datasets, it is increasingly recognized that a higher exposure to catecholamine vasopressors is associated with an increased risk of multiple organ failure and death in septic shock; thus, the time of norepinephrine requirement is a justified intermediate patient-centered outcome in order to pave the way for adding catecholamine-sparing agents to a multimodal strategy. We designed this RCT to assess if early adjunctive MB administration could reduce the time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with septic shock, as compared to placebo.

### The additional use of methylene blue has a decatecholaminisation effect on cardiac vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery [^115izxrP]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiac vasoplegia patients suffer from a severe systemic disease accompanied by operative stress and a high requirement of catecholamines. Additional MB administration to the standard treatment of CVS and over the first hours after admission to the ICU was accompanied by an increase in blood pressure followed by a decrease in vasopressor requirement. Early MB administration (during operation) in cardiac vasoplegic syndrome may be even more effective. A norepinephrine dose of 0.8 mg/h (0.15 μg*kg-1*min-1) followed by the need to ramp up the dose (≥ 0.1 mg*h-1) may serve as criteria for early MB administration. More prospective and randomized studies are necessary to further investigate the potential of MB administration on CVS after cardiac surgery.

### Methylene blue: magic bullet for vasoplegia? [^111iNuwe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Methylene blue (MB) has received much attention in the perioperative and critical care literature because of its ability to antagonize the profound vasodilation seen in distributive (also referred to as vasodilatory or vasoplegic) shock states. This review will discuss the pharmacologic properties of MB and review the critical care, liver transplantation, and cardiac anesthesia literature with respect to the efficacy and safety of MB for the treatment of shock. Although improved blood pressure has consistently been demonstrated with the use of MB in small trials and case reports, better oxygen delivery or decreased mortality with MB use has not been demonstrated. Large randomized controlled trials are still necessary to identify the role of MB in hemodynamic resuscitation of the critically ill.

### An updated "norepinephrine equivalent" score in intensive care as a marker of shock severity [^112uWBTn]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Vasopressors and fluids are the cornerstones for the treatment of shock. The current international guidelines on shock recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor and vasopressin as the second-line vasopressor. In clinical practice, due to drug availability, local practice variations, special settings, and ongoing research, several alternative vasoconstrictors and adjuncts are used in the absence of precise equivalent doses. Norepinephrine equivalence (NEE) is frequently used in clinical trials to overcome this heterogeneity and describe vasopressor support in a standardized manner. NEE quantifies the total amount of vasopressors, considering the potency of each such agent, which typically includes catecholamines, derivatives, and vasopressin. Intensive care studies use NEE as an eligibility criterion and also an outcome measure. On the other hand, NEE has several pitfalls which clinicians should know, important the lack of conversion of novel vasopressors such as angiotensin II and also adjuncts such as methylene blue, including a lack of high-quality data to support the equation and validate its predictive performance in all types of critical care practice. This review describes the history of NEE and suggests an updated formula incorporating novel vasopressors and adjuncts.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^111NrYh2]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Methylene blue (MB) has been tested as a rescue therapy for patients with refractory septic shock. However, there is a lack of evidence on MB as an adjuvant therapy, its' optimal timing, dosing and safety profile. We aimed to assess whether early adjunctive MB can reduce time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with septic shock.

Methods

In this single-center randomized controlled trial, we assigned patients with septic shock according to Sepsis-3 criteria to MB or placebo. Primary outcome was time to vasopressor discontinuation at 28 days. Secondary outcomes included vasopressor-free days at 28 days, days on mechanical ventilator, length of stay in ICU and hospital, and mortality at 28 days.

Results

Among 91 randomized patients, forty-five were assigned to MB and 46 to placebo. The MB group had a shorter time to vasopressor discontinuation (69 h [IQR 59–83] vs 94 h [IQR 74–141]; p < 0.001), one more day of vasopressor-free days at day 28 (p = 0.008), a shorter ICU length of stay by 1.5 days (p = 0.039) and shorter hospital length of stay by 2.7 days (p = 0.027) compared to patients in the control group. Days on mechanical ventilator and mortality were similar. There were no serious adverse effects related to MB administration.

Conclusion

In patients with septic shock, MB initiated within 24 h reduced time to vasopressor discontinuation and increased vasopressor-free days at 28 days. It also reduced length of stay in ICU and hospital without adverse effects. Our study supports further research regarding MB in larger randomized clinical trials.

### Methylene blue administration in septic shock: a retrospective cohort study [^116926wC]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the epidemiology of methylene blue (MB) use in septic shock and explore the association between MB dose and hospital outcomes.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

United States.

Patients

Eight hundred fifty-nine thousand eight hundred sixty-eight adult (≥ 18 yr) patients from 1100 centers with a diagnosis of septic shock (sepsis with vasopressor administration), discharged from Premier Healthcare Database hospitals in the United States from 2008 to 2021.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We included patients who received MB at any point during hospitalization (to describe utilization), then separately focused on those who received MB within the first 3 hospital days (to examine association of dose with outcomes). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. We used mixed-effects multivariable regression models to evaluate the MB use and the association between MB dose (modeled as a five-knot restricted cubic spline) and outcomes. Among patients with septic shock, 4082 patients (0.5%) from 663 hospitals received at least one dose of MB. Patients receiving MB tended to be younger and received major surgery. Hospitals in which MB was administered were larger urban teaching hospitals. After multivariable adjustment, use of MB was lower in 2016–2020 than in 2008. Of 2507 patients (61.4%) who received MB within the first 3 days of hospitalization, 375 (15.0%) died in hospital. Our spline analysis suggests a nonlinear association between MB dosing and outcomes among patients receiving MB early in their hospitalization.

Conclusions

Use of MB in septic shock is rare in the United States, but with substantial inter-hospital variability and decreased use over time through 2020. Randomized evidence is required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MB.

### An updated "norepinephrine equivalent" score in intensive care as a marker of shock severity [^114aQsUD]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, there is no randomized trial comparing the potency of methylene blue with that of other vasoconstrictors. A single-center randomized trial assessing the efficacy of methylene blue in septic shock reported that the doses for methylene blue infusion ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/kg/h. Accordingly, we arbitrarily applied a correction factor of 0.2 to the dose of methylene blue in mg/kg/h.

Therefore, we have updated the NEE equation incorporating vasoconstrictors commonly used in recent years. Figure 1 and Table 1 describe our final modified NEE calculation formula. If we compare our formula with the one by Goradia et al. the correction factors for angiotensin II are inconsistent even after the adjustment of the unit used (2.5 vs. 10). The main reason for the difference is the data source for the correction factor estimation. While Goradia et al. used a pilot single-center randomized trial published in 2012 in intensive care unit settings, we used a subsequent multicenter randomized trial published in 2017. Since the pilot trial was small in sample size and had baseline imbalances between angiotensin and placebo arms, we used only the larger trial to better estimate the equipotency of angiotensin II.

All the studies we used to update the NEE formula are listed in Table 2.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^112oqKFd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a potentially fatal organ failure that can arise from an overreaction of the host to an infection. Despite being the leading cause of mortality within hospitals, it is treatable with timely and early therapies.

The Third International Consensus definitions, or Sepsis-3, are used in the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC). Sepsis was defined as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection". A score of two or more on the Quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) indicates organ dysfunction. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which major circulatory, cellular, and metabolic changes are associated with higher mortality than with sepsis alone. In euvolemic patients, to be diagnosed with septic shock a patient must be on a vasopressor to reach a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg and with a serum lactate above 2 mmol/L.

The cornerstone of treating septic shock is administering, in the first hour, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics. The goal of management is to keep the patient hemodynamically stable until the antibiotics start working to combat the infection. Low-dose corticosteroids are prescribed for non-responders. Further research is required to determine whether other medications can aid non-responders as well as to enhance overall outcomes. A nitric oxide inhibitor called methylene blue (MB) can reverse the vasodilatation that occurs early in septic shock. Vasodilatation is caused by soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which is activated by nitric oxide (NO). Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) are then activated. Methylene blue inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and blocks sGC with selectivity. As a result, it affects the microcirculation only slightly. Intravenous MB acts within 30 to 60 min. Peak concentration is at 30 min. In addition to the kidneys, it is eliminated by the bile and fecal pathways. A plasma half-life of 5 to 6 h has led multiple investigators to administer a 0.25–2 mg/kg/h infusion for a duration of up to 3 days after a bolus dosage.

The aim of the trial is to compare the effects of high and low bolus doses of MB in sepsis in cancer patients. The main hypothesis of the study is that MB infusion would decrease the need for vasopressor infusion and that the initial high bolus dose of MB would be more beneficial than the low dose.

### Vasoplegia treatments: the past, the present, and the future [^116Zh8jA]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Methylene blue

Inhibition of excessive production and activity of both NO and cGMP may be critical in the treatment of refractory vasodilatory shock occurring in cardiac bypass, septic shock, poisoning, and anaphylaxis patients. Methylene blue (MB) has several actions that may counteract the effect of increased NOS stimulation. First, it may antagonize endothelial NOS activity. Furthermore, it may scavenge NO directly and inhibit guanylate cyclase activity. Experimental animal studies report that, in addition to a reduction in vasopressor requirements, inotropic support is reduced after the administration of MB, likely due to attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion injury. In a human septic shock study, MAP and cardiac index were both found to be increased. A systematic review of the literature regarding the use of MB in sepsis by Kwok and Howes concluded that, while the studies were mostly observational, MB increased systemic vascular resistances and MAP; however, its effects on oxygen delivery and mortality are unknown. Moreover, all of the aforementioned studies are relatively old and likely do not take into account current recommendations.

The use of MB has been proposed not only for septic shock but also for treating vasoplegia after cardiac surgery, drug poisoning, anaphylactic shock, and post-reperfusion syndrome after liver transplantation. Similar to septic shock, however, data are currently insufficient to propose MB as a first line agent.

The potential dangers of treatments targeting iNOS overexpression in septic shock should nonetheless be kept in mind. For example, non-selective iNOS blockers, while improving systemic vascular resistance and MAP, also reduce cardiac output and increase mortality in patients with septic shock. Similarly, non-selective iNOS inhibition with tilarginine versus placebo in cardiogenic shock patients failed to reduce the mortality rate at 30 days. Interestingly, there was also no difference in hemodynamic outcomes such as duration of shock. This negative result may be the consequence of the inhibition of other beneficial NO isoforms.

Despite these limitations, the place of MB in vasoplegia treatment is currently being evaluated in a number of ongoing studies (NCT03038503, NCT01797978, NCT03120637).

### Methylene blue for distributive shock: a potential new use of an old antidote [^113SnYAi]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Methylene blue is used primarily in the treatment of patients with methemoglobinemia. Most recently, methylene blue has been used as a treatment for refractory distributive shock from a variety of causes such as sepsis and anaphylaxis. Many studies suggest that the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of distributive shock. There are some experimental and clinical experiences with the use of methylene blue as a selective inhibitor of the NO-cGMP pathway. Methylene blue may play a role in the treatment of distributive shock when standard treatment fails.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^114i4mJV]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The potential benefits of using agents that act on NO pathways in septic shock is still unclear. Although most evidence comes from small studies and remains largely anecdotal, the use of non-selective NO inhibitors (e.g. L-NMMA and L-NNA) in septic shock has not been shown to provide any substantial benefit in patients with septic shock and use of an iNOS inhibitor increased mortality. MB clearly increases vascular tone and MAP, and seems to maintain cardiac contractility, but without evidence of an increase in cellular oxygen availability. Apart from a consistent reduction in vasopressor requirements with the use of MB, no significant clinically relevant benefit has been demonstrated. The decreased doses of adrenergic agents may be beneficial by reducing the unwanted adverse effects of these agents, but this remains hypothetical as surrogate outcomes, such as time to shock reversal and adverse effect profiles, have not been included in most studies. To elucidate the best timing, dosage, and administration strategy for MB in septic shock patients and finally clarify whether the use of MB really has beneficial or detrimental clinically relevant effects (Table 1), a large multicenter randomized controlled trial should be considered, perhaps using the same protocol as that in the recent study by Ibarra-Estrada et al. in which MB administration appeared safe and effective. Despite some positive findings in recent studies, the significant limitations of the available data, given the small sample sizes and heterogeneity, warrant further assessment of safety and some consistent evidence of advantageous clinical benefit before routine use of MB in septic shock can be considered.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^114pFHEo]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, most studies on the use of MB in septic shock have been observational, with small, highly heterogeneous sample sizes and poor methodologic quality, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding best clinical practice in this context. More than 25 years ago, Preiser et al. reported the hemodynamic effects of MB in 14 patients with septic shock. The authors observed an increase in MAP, associated with an increase in left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) from 42.5 ± 17.9 g/m to 48.9 ± 14.5 g/m, indicating that myocardial function was well preserved. Other investigators reported that MB infusion increased MAP, prevented the decrease in stroke volume and left ventricular stroke work index, and was associated with some reduction in the need for standard vasopressor agents. However, enthusiasm for use of all NO inhibitors in septic shock rapidly decreased after the results of the L-NMMA trial, mentioned earlier, were published in 2004. Nevertheless, given the issues associated with adrenergic vasopressors discussed earlier, there is renewed interest in the potential role of MB in these patients.

### Methylene blue monotherapy compared with combination therapy with hydroxocobalamin for the treatment of refractory vasoplegic syndrome: ARetrospective cohort study [^115nJhfk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of methylene blue with combination therapy with hydroxocobalamin in patients experiencing vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary medical center.

Participants

Patients who received methylene blue with or without hydroxocobalamin for refractory vasoplegic syndrome rescue therapy.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was 0.the ability to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg beyond 1hour after study drug administration. Other pertinent outcomes included MAP at hours 6, 12, and 24 post-administration; both raw and proportional changes of vasopressor doses from baseline at hours 1, 6, 12, and 24 post-administration; and change in pulmonary artery catheter hemodynamics. Overall, 28 doses were administered in 14 patients in the monotherapy group and 17 doses (10 methylene blue, 7 hydroxocobalamin) were administered in 6 patients in the combination therapy group. There were no differences in ability to maintain MAP at 1hour, with 71% of the monotherapy and 82% of combination therapy patients meeting MAP goals (p = 0.49). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated vasopressor reductions at 6, 12, and 24hours in both groups, but only significant reductions at 1hour were observed in the combination therapy group (-0.06 µg/kg/min; p = 0.003) but not in the monotherapy group (-0.015 µg/kg/min; p = 0.14).

Conclusion

This is the first study to compare methylene blue monotherapy with combination therapy, which suggests there may be an advantage to combination therapy. Further characterization of ideal dosing, timing, and agent selection should be investigated on a larger scale format.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^116jpqtH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Septic shock is a common threat, and is the primary cause of death in almost all critical care units. Mortality of septic shock remains exceedingly high. The early use of methylene blue (MB) in different doses as adjunctive to vasopressors has promising results.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comprised 90 patients divided into 3 groups: Group A received a 100 mL 0.9% NaCl placebo over 20 min; Group B received an MB bolus of 1 mg/kg in 100 mL 0.9% NaCl, and Group C received MB bolus of 4 mg/kg in 100 mL 0.9% NaCl during the same period. Groups B and C were given a 0.25 mg/kg/hour infusion of MB for 72 h after the bolus dose. All patients were started on noradrenaline at an infusion rate of 0.1–0.2 µ/kg/min and were adjusted accordingly to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Time of vasopressor discontinuation was the primary outcome while total doses of vasopressors, ventilation days, vasopressors free days, total ICU stay, total hospital stay, and mortality rate were the secondary outcomes.

Results

Groups B and C exhibited significantly decreased time to vasopressor termination, and vasopressor-free days at 28 days in comparison to Group A. However, there was no significant difference between Groups B and C. Groups B and C had significantly lower noradrenaline dosages compared to Group A, however, no significant difference between Group B and Group C was found. The difference between the three groups in mortality rate was near statistical significance (p = 0.083). Using the logistic regression model, the 4 mg/kg group was protective against mortality with a hazard ratio of 0.29 (95%CI: 0.09–0.90).

Conclusion

In cancer patients with septic shock, early adjunctive MB delivery reduces the time to a vasopressor stoppage and increases the vasopressor-free days. No significant difference between high and low MB bolus doses, and no significant adverse effects were noted. Compared to placebo, the 4 mg/kg bolus dose shows a survival advantage.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114PPAqS]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was mortality at the longest available follow-up, given that mortality is the most frequently reported patient-important primary outcome in critical care RCTs. Secondary outcomes included renal replacement therapy (RRT), days of mechanical ventilation, days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, days of hospital stay, atrial fibrillation, vasopressor-free days at day 28, and dose of noradrenaline. Dose of noradrenaline refers to the noradrenaline equivalent dose observed at the longest follow-up available.

Statistical analysis

Initially, we categorized all the included RCTs into one of three distinct groups — septic shock, cardiac surgery, or non-cardiac surgery — based on the majority population in each study. Meta-analysis was performed separately for these three groups. Subgroup analysis was conducted according to type of non-adrenergic agents (vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin), comparator (placebo and adrenergic agents), baseline vasopressor dose (above or below the median value in septic shock), exclusion of studies assessing nitric oxide scavengers (methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin), and studies with overall low risk of bias. We also performed the following sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome: timing of assessment (< 28 days, 28 or 30 days, and > 30 days), exclusion of a study using dopamine as control treatment, exclusion of studies using selepressin as the intervention, timing of administration (first-line versus second- or third-line therapy), studies published in high-impact journals (the complete journal selection is detailed in the Table S1), and studies published before versus after 2014.

Throughout this study, we calculated individual and pooled effects estimate (risk ratio [RR] for binary variables and mean difference [MD] or standardized mean difference [SMD] for continuous variables) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a Mantel–Haenszel random-effects model for all the outcomes assuming heterogeneity of treatment effects due to clinical heterogeneity among studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistics, and publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of funnel plots. We used Review Manager 5.4 and considered two-sided p values < 0.05 statistically significant.

To assess the possible effect modification for mortality by baseline vasopressor dose, we performed a meta-regression analysis using a mixed-effects model. A noradrenaline equivalent score was used to calculate the total vasopressor dose. The analysis was performed using R 4.0.1.

Vasoactive Medications in Refractory Hypotension

The treatment of refractory hypotension in CS represents a significant challenge. In the setting of severe metabolic acidosis, which occurs due to tissue hypoxia and subsequent activation of anaerobic metabolic pathways, both in vivo and ex vivo experimental data has demonstrated reduced vascular and cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines. The relatively preserved vasopressor effects in the setting of acidosis of vasopressin and methylene blue render these drugs a reasonable choice to trial as salvage therapy in cases of catecholamine‐refractory vasoplegia.

### Hydroxocobalamin for vasodilatory hypotension in shock: a systematic review with meta-analysis for comparison to methylene blue [^114jKqxB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydroxocobalamin inhibits nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation, and has been used in settings of refractory shock. However, its effectiveness and role in treating hypotension remain unclear. The authors systematically searched Ovid Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection for clinical studies reporting on adult persons who received hydroxocobalamin for vasodilatory shock. A meta-analysis was performed with random-effects models comparing the hemodynamic effects of hydroxocobalamin to methylene blue. The Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used to assess the risk of bias. A total of 24 studies were identified and comprised mainly of case reports (n = 12), case series (n = 9), and 3 cohort studies. Hydroxocobalamin was applied mainly for cardiac surgery vasoplegia, but also was reported in the settings of liver transplantation, septic shock, drug-induced hypotension, and noncardiac postoperative vasoplegia. In the pooled analysis, hydroxocobalamin was associated with a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 1 hour than methylene blue (mean difference 7.80, 95% CI 2.63–12.98). There were no significant differences in change in MAP (mean difference -4.57, 95% CI -16.05 to 6.91) or vasopressor dosage (mean difference -0.03, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.06) at 1 hour compared to baseline between hydroxocobalamin and methylene blue. Mortality was also similar (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.42–2.03). The evidence supporting the use of hydroxocobalamin for shock is limited to anecdotal reports and a few cohort studies. Hydroxocobalamin appears to positively affect hemodynamics in shock, albeit similar to methylene blue.

### Association of methylene blue dosing with hemodynamic response for the treatment of vasoplegia [^1173Fs4T]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the hemodynamic response of methylene blue dosing regimens (bolus v bolus plus infusion) for the treatment of vasoplegia.

Design

A retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting

A single-center academic medical center.

Participants

Patients who underwent cardiac surgery at Cleveland Clinic and received methylene blue between 2016 and 2019. Patients were excluded from the analysis if methylene blue was initiated > 48 hours after surgery, if the cardiac index was < 2.0 L/min/m 2, or if they returned to the operating room for postoperative hemorrhage.

Interventions

Methylene blue bolus-only regimens versus bolus plus continuous infusion methylene blue regimens.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was vasopressor requirement over 48 hours (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours) after methylene blue initiation. Other hemodynamic outcomes evaluated included the rate of methylene blue response, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) values over time. In total, 44 patients were included in the analysis, 33 of whom only received a methylene blue bolus. Vasopressor requirements at baseline were 95 (95% CI: 70–122) µg/min norepinephrine equivalent (NE) in the bolus-only group and 100 (86–130) µg/min in the infusion group. Vasopressor requirements decreased at each time point in both groups and were similar throughout (hour 1 mean [95% CI] NE, bolus 79 [67–91] µg/min v bolus plus infusion 84 [63–104] µg/min; p = 0.71). MAP, SVR, and rates of methylene blue response were similar between groups at all time points. Clinical outcomes also were similar between groups.

Conclusions

The addition of a methylene blue continuous infusion did not significantly improve hemodynamic response. Bolus-only dosing of methylene blue may be sufficient for the treatment of vasoplegia after cardiac surgery.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^116vd2B3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Several clinical trials and meta-analyses provided evidence indicating that MB may decrease short-term mortality in patients with septic shock. Additional findings indicate that the injection of MB may improve hemodynamic status, elevate MAP, decrease the duration of vasopressor exposure, and shorten the time of hospitalization. However. different dose regimens of MB were evaluated varying from bolus delivery to bolus administration followed by continuous infusion, or continuous infusion only. So far, no research has explored the ideal dosage strategy for patients with septic shock. Based on a recent study, we adopted the bolus + continuous infusion strategy. This strategy was found to be associated with decreased 28-day mortality. We used a 4 mg/kg bolus dose aiming to enhance the effectiveness of MB based on a previous dose-finding study. This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study that tested 3 bolus doses of MB, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 7 mg/kg over 20 min in mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock. The authors concluded that MB increases MAP, improves left ventricular filling and function, and raises cardiac output in a dose-dependent manner. We hypothesized that the high dose would be more effective in the current group of cancer patients with septic shock. Nevertheless, our results did not completely substantiate this idea.

In this prospective study, the 1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg bolus doses were almost equally effective adjuvants for the treatment of septic shock. We found that MB had a positive impact on noradrenaline requirement in septic shock as it significantly reduced the time to discontinue vasopressor administration and vasopressor-free days compared to the placebo group. Noradrenaline doses over time points and its total consumption at 28 days were significantly lower with the use of MB irrespective of the bolus dose used. Serum lactate was lower and MAP higher in the methylene blue groups. PaO 2 /FiO 2 and RSBI also improved with the use of methylene blue. However, the effect on mortality of the two used doses was found to be insignificant. Nevertheless, an important observation was that the 4 mg/kg dose had a survival advantage when compared to the control group with a hazard ratio of 0.29 (95%CI: 0.09–0.90). We do not have a clear explanation of this survival advantage of the high-dose bolus. However, this might stem from early intensified control of noradrenaline action, which may limit its serious adverse effects.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^114N5z1j]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The most common use of MB for septic shock is reported as single infusions due to extrapolation from the predominant literature on CPB; but unlike sepsis, the systemic inflammatory insult of CPB which occurs in up to 50% of the patients is limited to a few hours. By contrast, the duration of the inflammatory insult in septic shock is less predictable, and we know that the expected duration of vasopressor requirement is of 2–3 days even in optimal conditions as in recent clinical trials. This is the reason we decided to administer MB in repeated doses. Considering that NE requirement was significantly lower in MB than in control group only after the second dose (Fig. 2), we believe our positive findings were in part due to this approach, which provided a longer timeframe of iNOS and sGC inhibition. Data from a recent large retrospective study support this assumption; Sari-Yavuz et al. studied different modes of administration of MB in critically-ill patients with shock, and they reported that the length of inhibition of the NO pathway could influence the response to MB, rather than the cumulative dose.

Introduction: Generalized vasodilation with nonresponding hypotension is present in half death cases due to septicaemia. Methylene blue could be used as a valuable complement in refractory hypotension treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of methylene blue as contributory treatment in patients with septic shock

Methods: A controlled, randomized, double blinded, clinical trial was performed. 60 patients were divided in two groups. A Group received a single dose of methylene blue calculated 2 mg/kg per body weight diluted in 100 cc of 5% dextrose infused in 60 min. and C Group, (control) received 100 cc of 5% dextrose infused in 60 min. Basal measurements of study variables were taken (MBP, lactate, base deficit, central venous saturation and CO2 delta) prior blue methylene administration and every hour afterwards, until MBP > 65 mmHg without vasopressor or 72 hours passed after shock began. Data about total noradrenaline dose in mg, length of stay, mechanical ventilation length and mortality was recorded

Results: MBP increased progressively first 6 hours after methylene blue infusion in A Group 22% and C Group 9.2% (p: < 0.05), steadily until 72 hour follow up. Noradrenaline dose decreased in the first 6 hours, on A Group an 86%, C Group was 56% (p: < 0.05). Lactate clearance first 6 hours was 62% in A Group, in contrast with C Group with 33% clearance (p: < 0.05). Mortality at ICU discharge on A Group was 20.0% and C Group was 36.6% (p: < 0.05) without variation at 21 days

Conclusions: Methylene blue is effective as contributory in septic shock treatment.

### Methylene blue reduces mortality in critically ill and perioperative patients: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1164YMdb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Vasodilatory hypotension is common in critically ill and perioperative patients, and is associated with adverse outcomes. As a nitric oxide production inhibitor, methylene blue (MB) exerts its vasoconstrictor property and is an adjuvant for catecholamine-refractory vasodilatory shock. However, the effects of MB on clinically relevant outcomes remain unclear. Therefore, the authors performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials on MB in critically ill and perioperative patients. The authors searched through databases for randomized trials on MB in critically ill and perioperative patients, which yielded 11 studies consisting of 556 patients. The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters and organ dysfunction (PROSPERO: CRD42023409243). Nine out of the 11 included randomized trials reported mortality, which was significantly lower in the MB group (risk ratio, 0.60 [95% CI 0.43–0.84] p = 0.003), with findings confirmed in septic shock and cardiac surgery subgroups. The authors found reduced lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (mean difference [MD], -0.9 days [95% CI -1.06 to -0.77] p < 0.001) and in the hospital (MD, -2.2 days [95% CI, -2.68 to -1.70] p < 0.001) in the MB group. MB was associated with increased mean arterial pressure (MD, 8.4 mmHg [95% CI 5.01–11.75] p < 0.001) and systemic vascular resistance (MD, 94.5 dyn/s/cm 5 [95% CI 17.73–171.15] p = 0.02), with no difference in cardiac output (standardized MD, 0.16 [95% CI, -0.25 to 0.57] p = 0.45). This meta-analysis showed that MB reverses vasodilation in critically ill and perioperative patients and might improve survival. Further adequately powered randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^1173T1Cr]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this single-center RCT, we found that adjunctive MB administered within 24 h of septic shock diagnosis reduced time to vasopressor discontinuation, and importantly, no severe adverse effects were detected. The clinical implications of our results might shift the current understanding of MB as a rescue therapy to an adjunctive one at earlier stages of the disease. Due to its safety profile, wider availability and lower cost than other catecholamine-sparing agents, MB could emerge as a viable therapy within a multimodal strategy to maintain MAP and improve tissue perfusion, while decreasing the risk of high-dose vasopressors.

To our knowledge, this is the largest RCT comparing MB vs placebo in patients with septic shock. In the study by Kirov et al. in 2001, they randomized 20 patients with septic shock to placebo or a bolus injection of 2 mg/kg of MB, followed by a continuous 4-h infusion to a total dose of 5.75 mg/kg, and followed patients up to 24 h. Although more patients died in the control group (7 vs 3) and duration of vasopressor support was shorter in MB group (71 h vs 93 h), these differences were not significant. In 2002, Memis et al. randomized 30 patients with septic shock to placebo or an infusion of MB at 3 mg/kg over 6 h, with a follow-up of 48 h. They found no differences in cytokine levels or any other relevant outcome; nonetheless, they reported a significant but transient increase in MAP in patients of MB group. Shortly after publication of these 2 promising studies, a large phase III multicenter RCT which included 797 patients with septic shock was published. López et al. randomized patients to placebo or the NOS inhibitor N (G)-methyl-L-arginine hydrochloride (546C88). The study was terminated early due to a significant increase by 10% in mortality of cardiovascular cause at 28 days. This seems to have halted the enthusiasm in research about NO inhibition; however, it is important to note that this molecule is non-selective, inhibiting both inducible and constitutive isoforms of NOS (unlike MB which selectively inhibits the inducible form). Sparing the constitutive isoform is important to maintain homeostasis even in sepsis; for instance, to improve microcirculatory flow, increase blood flow to ischemic areas, scavenge oxygen-free radicals, and enhance microbial killing by macrophages. It has been postulated that a global inhibition of NO is associated with detrimental effects in sepsis that can result in accelerated organ damage; thus, a more downstream inhibition within the NO cascade as provided by MB could be a better approach. In line with these assumptions, MB was associated with a reduction in mortality in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis pooling observational and RCT studies.

### Improvement in hemodynamics after methylene blue administration in drug-induced vasodilatory shock: a case report [^116UqMwp]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study is to describe a case where methylene blue improved hemodynamics in a poisoned patient.

Case Report

This is a single case report where a poisoned patient developed vasodilatory shock following ingestion of atenolol, amlodipine, and valsartan. Shock persisted after multiple therapies including vasopressors, high-dose insulin, hemodialysis, and 20% intravenous fat emulsion. Methylene blue (2 mg/kg IV over 30 min) was administered in the ICU with temporal improvement as measured by pulmonary artery catheter hemodynamic data pre- and post-methylene blue administration. Within 1 h of methylene blue administration, systemic vascular resistance improved (240 dyn s/cm5 increased to 1204 dyn s/cm5), and vasopressor requirements decreased with maintenance of mean arterial pressure 60 mmHg.

Discussion

Methylene blue may improve hemodynamics in drug-induced vasodilatory shock and should be considered in critically ill patients poisoned with vasodilatory medications refractory to standard therapies.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^115rARsX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Similar outcomes of MB use were reported in previous trials with different dosing regimens. A bolus of 4 mg/kg of MB over 1 h was investigated in ten patients with severe septic shock. The authors showed a positive impact on systemic parameters including arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and left ventricular stroke volume. However, it exerted a negative impact on pulmonary circulation and gas exchange. Although they showed a reduction of serum lactate, they could not explain it by improvement in tissue perfusion. This may be due to an improvement in oxygen utilization at a cellular level or a direct reduction property of MB. Worth noting is that in this pilot study patients were already suffering from severe septic shock and respiratory failure. With the same high bolus dose of 4 mg/kg, we did not observe a negative adverse effect on oxygenation or gas exchange. In the current study, serum lactate showed a continuous reduction that extended to 24 h after cessation of MB infusion.

In refractory septic shock, 1 mg/kg MB infusion increased SVR and MAP. A bolus of 2 mg/kg MB, followed by infusion at an increasing rate of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg/hr for 1 h lowered the noradrenaline requirement in septic shock patients. MB infusion at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/hr for 6 h positively impacted MAP with no effect on mortality rates. A more recent randomized trial examined the efficacy of a daily continuous infusion of 100 mg of MB over 6 h for 3 days in septic shock. MB infusion was associated with a shorter time to vasopressor discontinuation, more vasopressor-free days, and a shorter length of stay in the ICU and hospital compared to a placebo control group. No mortality benefit was noted. A meta-analysis of 6 RCTs including 214 patients showed that MB improved MAP and decreased serum lactate with a non-significant decrease in mortality.

### Methylene blue (Provayblue) [^113yXMqJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Hypotension, wheezing and reduced oxygenation have been reported in patients who received methylene blue class products in single doses of 3 mg/kg or more.

Administration of large intravenous doses (cumulative dose ≥ 7 mg/kg) of a methylene blue class product caused nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, chest tightness, tachycardia, apprehension, tremor, mydriasis, blue staining of the urine, the skin and mucous membranes, abdominal pain, dizziness, paresthesia, headache, confusion, mild methemoglobinemia (up to 7%) and electrocardiogram changes (T-wave flattening or inversion). These effects lasted 2–12 hours following administration.

A severe overdosage (single dose of 20 mg/kg or more) of a methylene blue class product caused severe intravascular hemolysis, hyperbilirubinemia and death.

In case of overdose of PROVAYBLUE, maintain the patient under observation until signs and symptoms have resolved, monitor for cardiopulmonary, hematologic and neurologic toxicities, and institute supportive measures as necessary.

Several systematic reviews or meta-analyses of MB studies in shock have also been published, but all are based on very limited data. In a systematic literature review published in 2010, which included 11 studies (8 observational) in which MB was used for the treatment of septic shock, the authors concluded that MB was associated with short-term improvement in hemodynamic parameters, but little or no benefit on clinical outcomes. They highlighted that in all of the studies MB was administered late in the course of the disease, with important variations in the dose range (1–4 mg/kg) and administration strategy (bolus, infusion, bolus + infusion, for example) across studies. In a meta-analysis of 15 studies in patients with vasodilatory shock, published in 2022, use of MB was associated with a reduction in mortality, but it is important to point out that this study pooled observational and RCT studies, with patients from different etiologies of vasoplegia (surgery, septic shock, etc.). Two recent meta-analyses included the study by Ibarra-Estrada et al. In a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials in perioperative or critically ill patients, Pruna et al. suggested that MB administration may be associated with improved hemodynamics, reduced ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and lower mortality (relative risk 0.60 [95% CI, 0.43–0.84]; p = 0.003), while in a meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials assessing MB use in patients with distributive shock, Huang et al. reported reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay in MB-treated patients, but no effect on mortality. The authors of these meta-analyses highlighted the limitations due to the small population sizes and heterogeneity of the included studies.

### Methylene blue reverses recalcitrant shock in β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose [^111Zdv39]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

β-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity generally present with bradycardia and hypotension. A 69-year-old woman presented after a suicide attempt with a β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose. Her blood pressure was 69/35 mm Hg and her HR was in the 40s. She was treated with calcium chloride, glucagon, a dextrose-insulin infusion and three vasopressors, but remained hypotensive. She suffered two cardiac arrests and required a transvenous pacemaker. When all interventions failed, she was started on a methylene blue infusion for refractory vasodilatory shock which resulted in a dramatic improvement in her blood pressure. The patient was successfully weaned off all vasopressors and from mechanical ventilation without any end-organ damage.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^113HTLDW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Refractory vasodilatory shock is a state of uncontrolled vasodilation associated with underlying inflammation and endothelial dysregulation. Rescue therapy for vasoplegia refractory to catecholamines includes methylene blue (MB) which restores vascular tone. We hypothesized that (1) at least 40% of critically ill patients would respond positively to MB administration and (2) that those who responded to MB would have a survival benefit.

Methods

This study was a retrospective review that included all adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit treated with MB for the indication of refractory vasodilatory shock. Responders to MB were identified as those with a ≥ 10% increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) within the first 1–2 hours after administration. We examined the association of mortality to the groups of responders versus non-responders to MB. A subgroup analysis in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was also performed. Statistical calculations were performed in Microsoft Excel® (Redmond, WA, USA). Where appropriate, the comparison of averages and standard deviations of demographics, dosing, MAP, and reductions in vasopressor dosing were performed via Chi squared, Fisher's exact test, or two-tailed t-test with a p-value < 0.05 being considered as statistically significant. After using the F-test to assess for differences in variance, the proper two tailed t-test was used to compare SOFA scores among responders versus non-responders.

Results

A total of 223 patients were included in the responder analysis; 88 (39.5%) had a ≥ 10% increase in MAP post-MB administration that was not associated with a significant change in norepinephrine requirements between responders versus non-responders (p = 0.41). There was a non-statistically significant trend (21.6% vs 14.8%, p = 0.19) toward improved survival to hospital discharge in the MB responder group compared to the non-responder group. In 70 patients undergoing CRRT, there were 33 responders who were more likely to survive than those who were not (p = 0.0111).

Conclusions

In patients with refractory shock receiving MB, there is a non-statistically significant trend toward improved outcomes in responders based on a MAP increase > 10%. Patients supported with CRRT who were identified as responders had decreased ICU mortality compared to non-responders.

### Methylene blue: an antidote for methemoglobinemia and beyond [^112vVyjR]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Methylene blue has been in medicinal use for centuries and is best known as an antidotal treatment for acquired methemoglobinemia (MetHB). More recently, methylene blue has gained recognition for its efficacious use in the treatment of ifosfamide neurotoxicity and refractory vasoplegic shock in both the pediatric and adult critical care literature, extending its use beyond MetHB. Methylene blue's mechanism of action is somewhat complex and based partly on its oxidizing capabilities, ironically the same mechanism that causes MetHB. This review will examine methylene blue's use in the treatment of acquired MetHB and ifosfamide neurotoxicity and review the current literature regarding its role in critically ill pediatric and adult patients with refractory vasoplegic shock. Methylene blue's pharmacologic actions, dosing, and adverse effects will also be discussed.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^1172JZTs]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There are currently limited pharmacologic therapies for patients presenting with vasoplegia. In this retrospective single institutional study, 233 patients received MB in the setting of shock (at least 72.5% of which were vasodilatory), of which 88 (39.5%) had a ≥ 10% increase in MAP within two hours of administration. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward improved survival to hospital discharge in patients with a response to MB. The dosing of MB may also play a role in identifying responders. Although the results were not statistically significant, MB responders were more likely to receive bolus dosing plus an infusion (44.3%) when compared to non-responders (33.3%). There was not a fixed protocol for dosing administration in this retrospective study and the pharmacokinetics of the drug may favor bolus and infusion dosing over bolus only dosing; the average duration of infusion for MB responders was 11.8 ± 9.5 hours.

The use of MB for vasodilatory shock has been described in the literature over the last thirty years in the setting of sepsis, post-cardiopulmonary bypass vasoplegia, anaphylaxis, liver failure, and drug-induced shock. Although studies have shown improvements in MAP and systemic vascular resistance from baseline after MB administration, a statistically significant improvement in survival has not been reliably shown. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, 546C88, in septic shock found a higher likelihood of resolution of shock at 72 hours. However, a subsequent larger trial of treatment with 546C88 in patients with septic shock was halted early due to a statistically significant increase in 28 day mortality due to cardiovascular causes. Following this study, the further investigation of NOS inhibitors lost traction, however, a closer look at the findings suggests that some patients with very high cardiac outputs may have derived benefit. Furthermore, MB may target iNOS as opposed to 546C88 which is a non-specific NOS inhibitor.

### Methylene blue for vasoplegia during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support [^112dyLG9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The treatment of refractory vasodilatory shock in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an area in which there is minimal literature. Based on previous literature, the authors hypothesized that at least 40% of ECMO patients with vasoplegia would respond positively to methylene blue (MB) administration and that those who responded to MB would have increased survival.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting

Single institution, quaternary care hospital.

Participants

The study comprised 45 patients who received MB for vasoplegia during ECMO.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 45 patients who received MB, 25 patients (55.6%) experienced a ≥ 10% increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and a reduction in norepinephrine dosing in the one-to-two hour interval after MB administration. There was a trend for improvement in survival to discharge for those who responded to MB (32% v 10%; p = 0.15). In addition, patients who did not have at least a > 5% increase in MAP (29 experienced a > 5% increase and 16 experienced a ≤ 5% increase) after MB administration, experienced 100% mortality (p = 0.008).

Conclusion

This study suggested that approximately 50% of ECMO patients with vasoplegia can be expected to respond to MB with a > 10% MAP improvement. The lack of a blood pressure response > 5% after MB administration may portend poor survival. Larger prospective studies are needed to verify these preliminary results.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^1144Mm1K]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Septic shock typically requires the administration of vasopressors. Adrenergic agents remain the first choice, namely norepinephrine. However, their use to counteract life-threatening hypotension comes with potential adverse effects, so that non-adrenergic vasopressors may also be considered. The use of agents that act through different mechanisms may also provide an advantage. Nitric oxide (NO) is the main driver of the vasodilation that leads to hypotension in septic shock, so several agents have been tested to counteract its effects. The use of non-selective NO synthase inhibitors has been of questionable benefit. Methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, an important enzyme involved in the NO signaling pathway in the vascular smooth muscle cell, has also been proposed. However, more than 25 years since the first clinical evaluation of MB administration in septic shock, the safety and benefits of its use are still not fully established, and it should not be used routinely in clinical practice until further evidence of its efficacy is available.

### Vasopressor therapy in critically ill patients with shock [^114hkDpJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasopressors are administered to critically ill patients with vasodilatory shock not responsive to volume resuscitation, and less often in cardiogenic shock, and hypovolemic shock.

Objectives

The objectives are to review safety and efficacy of vasopressors, pathophysiology, agents that decrease vasopressor dose, predictive biomarkers, β1-blockers, and directions for research.

Methods

The quality of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).

Results

Vasopressors bind adrenergic: α1, α2, β1, β2; vasopressin: AVPR1a, AVPR1B, AVPR2; angiotensin II: AG1, AG2; and dopamine: DA1, DA2 receptors inducing vasoconstriction. Vasopressor choice and dose vary because of patients and physician practice. Adverse effects include excessive vasoconstriction, organ ischemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia, tachycardia, and tachyarrhythmias. No randomized controlled trials of vasopressors showed a significant difference in 28-day mortality rate. Norepinephrine is the first-choice vasopressor in vasodilatory shock after adequate volume resuscitation. Some strategies that decrease norepinephrine dose (vasopressin, angiotensin II) have not decreased 28-day mortality while corticosteroids have decreased 28-day mortality significantly in some (two large trials) but not all trials. In norepinephrine-refractory patients, vasopressin or epinephrine may be added. A new vasopressor, angiotensin II, may be useful in profoundly hypotensive patients. Dobutamine may be added because vasopressors may decrease ventricular contractility. Dopamine is recommended only in bradycardic patients. There are potent vasopressors with limited evidence (e.g. methylene blue, metaraminol) and novel vasopressors in development (selepressin).

Conclusions

Norepinephrine is first choice followed by vasopressin or epinephrine. Angiotensin II and dopamine have limited indications. In future, predictive biomarkers may guide vasopressor selection and novel vasopressors may emerge.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus methylene blue for the treatment of vasoplegic shock associated with cardiopulmonary bypass [^116zVUPK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare changes in vasopressor requirements and hemodynamic responses after hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue administration for vasoplegic shock (VS).

Design

Retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting

Single-center, academic medical center.

Patients

Cardiothoracic surgery adult patients.

Interventions

Hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Measurements

The primary outcome was a change in vasopressor requirements over the first 24 hours (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours) after hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue initiation. Secondary outcomes included changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance, and lactate.

Main Results

A total of 120 adult patients who received hydroxocobalamin (n = 77) or methylene blue (n = 43) were included. Vasopressor requirements at baseline were 0.34 µg/kg/min (95% CI 0.28–0.4) norepinephrine equivalent (NEE) in the hydroxocobalamin group, and 0.59 µg/kg/min (95% CI 0.52–0.66) NEE in the methylene blue group; p < 0.001. Vasopressor requirements decreased significantly at each time point within each group (hour 1 mean [95% CI] NEE, hydroxocobalamin 0.27 µg/kg/min [0.21–0.33]; methylene blue 0.44 µg/kg/min [0.38–0.51]; p < 0.001). The mean MAP at baseline was 65 mmHg (95% CI 63–67) in the hydroxocobalamin group, and 57 mmHg (95% CI 54–59) in the methylene blue group; p < 0.001. The mean MAP increased significantly from baseline at each time point within each group (hour 1 mean [95% CI] hydroxocobalamin 73 mmHg [71–75]; methylene blue 67 mmHg [65–70]; p < 0.001). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, a significantly greater reduction in vasopressor requirements and an increase in MAP were noted in the hydroxocobalamin group compared with the methylene blue group.

Conclusions

Hydroxocobalamin was associated with a greater reduction in vasopressor requirements than methylene blue in treating VS associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Discussion

Key findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 RCTs, we evaluated the effects of non-adrenergic vasopressors on clinical outcomes in three distinct populations. The use of non-adrenergic agents was associated with a reduced mortality risk in patients with septic shock. It was also associated with reduced RRT use and occurrence of atrial fibrillation both in patients with septic shock and in those undergoing cardiac surgery. Moreover, we observed shortened ICU and hospital stays in cardiac surgery settings. Finally, noradrenaline dose was decreased across all three settings.

Relationship with previous literature

To our knowledge, this systematic review is the most updated and comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of non-adrenergic vasopressors in various etiologies. Unlike previous meta-analyses confined to specific vasopressors (vasopressin and its analogues, angiotensin II, or methylene blue) and specific populations (septic shock, septic shock and cardiac surgery, cardiac surgery, or any surgery), our review included all non-adrenergic agents available in three different settings (septic shock, cardiac surgery, and non-cardiac surgery). This inclusive approach increased the number of studies and sample size, while maintaining separate analyses according to study populations to take into account the heterogeneity of treatment effects in different settings.

Mortality

In patients with septic shock, we observed a mortality reduction, which was mainly driven by vasopressin and methylene blue. This finding aligns with previous meta-analyses. However, it should be noted that such significant mortality reduction was not confirmed when each non-adrenergic agent was analyzed separately. On the other hand, in cardiac and non-cardiac settings, similar to previous meta-analyses in surgical settings, mortality differences did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, the overall analysis and the vast majority of sensitivity analyses across three different populations found a pooled RR < 1 for mortality.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^115XB2Qa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Exploring this concept further should also include whether the duration of vasodilation prior to MB administration plays a role in identifying responders versus non-responders. A randomized controlled study in cardiac surgical patients at high risk of post-operative vasoplegia demonstrated that preoperative MB administration reduced the incidence and severity of vasoplegic syndrome in both the operative and postoperative time frames and reduced ICU and hospital length of stay. Mehaffey et al subsequently found that early (in the operating room) administration of MB was associated with improved survival and a reduction of the risk-adjusted rate of major adverse events compared to late (in the ICU) administration of MB in cardiac surgical patients. There may be a role for identifying high risk patients for vasoplegia outside of the cardiac surgical population and studying early versus late MB administration. The use of MB in this study was at the discretion of the care team and not based on a protocol. Identifying "trigger" situations where patients may qualify for MB administration based on persistently low MAP in the setting of appropriate volume resuscitation may allow for better standardization and study of the potential benefit of MB for vasoplegia.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^112CG993]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Between October 2016 to May 2020, we identified 306 ICU patients that received MB. After excluding patients receiving either ECMO or VAD therapies (n = 70), 236 patients remained for analysis. A further 13 patients were excluded from any analysis comparing MB responders vs. non-responders due to incomplete data. Of the 223 patients included in the final MB cohort comparison analysis, 88 (39.5%) had a ≥ 10% increase in MAP in the first 1–2 hours post-MB administration and were considered MB responders whereas the remaining 135 (60.5%) patients were considered MB non-responders (Figs. 1 and 2). There was no significant difference in gender, age, weight, SOFA score, CRRT requirement, or norepinephrine dose 1 hour prior to administration of MB between groups. There was also no significant difference in administration of MB: bolus dose, use of infusion, infusion rate or duration between the responders and non-responders (Table 1). There was a statistically significant difference in volume resuscitation (within 24 hours after MB administration) between responders and non-responders to MB (3.6 ± 3.2L in responders vs. 2.5 ± 3.1L in non-responders) (p = 0.01). The average MAP prior to MB administration was significantly lower in responders (61.3 ± 9.2 mmHg) compared to non-responders (67 ± 9.3) (p < 0.001). Following MB administration, the average MAP was higher in responders (76.4 ± 11.1) compared to non-responders (61 ± 15.5) (p < 0.001).

In comparing hospital survivors (n = 39, 16.5%) and non-survivors (n = 197, 83.5%), there was no difference in gender, age, weight, or ICU LOS. Additionally, there was no significant difference in administration of MB in terms of dose of bolus, use of infusion, infusion rate or duration (Table 3). Hospital survivors were less likely to require CRRT (p < 0.0001), had lower SOFA scores (p = 0.0007), and had a longer hospital length of stay (p = 0.004) compared to non-survivors (Table 2). Survivors had a significant increase in MAP compared to non-survivors at 2 hours (p = 0.03), 4 hours (p = 0.0001), and 12 hours (p = 0.0001) post-MB administration. Concurrently, in survivors there was a significant decrease in norepinephrine requirements at 1 hour (p = 0.0003) and 2 hours (p < 0.0001) post-MB administration (Table 2).

Patients undergoing CRRT were additionally analyzed and identified as responders based on a norepinephrine dose requirement decrease of ≥ 10% after two hours. The 70 patients requiring CRRT were analyzed as a subgroup; 33 were found to be MB responders and 37 were non-responders. There were 12 survivors in the responder group (63.6% hospital mortality) and 4 survivors in the non-responder group (89.2% hospital mortality). Within the CRRT subgroup, hospital mortality was significantly lower in the responder group (p = 0.0111) despite a lack of difference in SOFA score (12.96 ± 2.64 vs 14 ± 2.34, p = 0.16) or gender (p = 0.48).

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^114Pihg2]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Methylene blue (MB) has been tested as a rescue therapy for patients with refractory septic shock. However, there is a lack of evidence on MB as an adjuvant therapy, its' optimal timing, dosing and safety profile. We aimed to assess whether early adjunctive MB can reduce time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with septic shock.

Methods

In this single-center randomized controlled trial, we assigned patients with septic shock according to Sepsis-3 criteria to MB or placebo. Primary outcome was time to vasopressor discontinuation at 28 days. Secondary outcomes included vasopressor-free days at 28 days, days on mechanical ventilator, length of stay in ICU and hospital, and mortality at 28 days.

Results

Among 91 randomized patients, forty-five were assigned to MB and 46 to placebo. The MB group had a shorter time to vasopressor discontinuation (69 h [IQR 59–83] vs 94 h [IQR 74–141]; p < 0.001), one more day of vasopressor-free days at day 28 (p = 0.008), a shorter ICU length of stay by 1.5 days (p = 0.039) and shorter hospital length of stay by 2.7 days (p = 0.027) compared to patients in the control group. Days on mechanical ventilator and mortality were similar. There were no serious adverse effects related to MB administration.

Conclusion

In patients with septic shock, MB initiated within 24 h reduced time to vasopressor discontinuation and increased vasopressor-free days at 28 days. It also reduced length of stay in ICU and hospital without adverse effects. Our study supports further research regarding MB in larger randomized clinical trials. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT04446871, June 25, 2020, retrospectively registered.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^112aGTvA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasodilatory shock is an important problem in the intensive care unit that is associated with multiple coexisting disease pathologies. Refractory vasodilatory shock, or vasoplegia, is a state of uncontrolled vasodilation thought to be chiefly mediated by dysregulation of nitric oxide (NO) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and likely also associated with underlying inflammation and endothelial dysregulation. NO is generated via nitric oxide synthase and results in vasodilation due to the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate production (cGMP) which subsequently mediates vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Definitions of vasoplegia vary, but most sources define it as requiring vasopressor doses ranging from above 0.2 mcg/kg/min to 0.5 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalents or more, with a cardiac index (CI) of at least 2.2 L/min/m 2 and difficulty maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The use of CI to define vasoplegia can make diagnosis difficult given the trend in less frequent use of pulmonary artery catheters.

Rescue therapy for vasoplegia refractory to catecholamines includes vasopressin, methylene blue (MB), corticosteroids, angiotensin II, ascorbic acid, and hydroxocobalamin. The routine use of these adjunct agents has not been standardized due to limited, inconsistent data and cost. Methylene blue (ProvayBlue™) inhibits endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), sGC, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). MB restores vascular tone and due to the selective blockade of both sGC and iNOS, and it is considered more targeted to the dysregulation of the microcirculation in the setting of NO upregulation.

We report our institutional experience with the use of intravenous MB for refractory shock in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. In accordance with the current literature, we hypothesized that (1) at least 40% of critically ill patients would respond positively to MB administration and (2) that those who responded to MB would have a survival benefit. Mortality in responders versus non-responders was assessed and a subgroup analysis in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was also performed.

### Methylene blue for the treatment of refractory anaphylaxis without hypotension [^111HT8uf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction treated primarily with epinephrine. Methylene blue, a competitive inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, interferes with the vasodilatory actions of nitric oxide. It has recently been proposed by the Joint Taskforce on Practice Parameters as an alternative treatment for anaphylaxis with hypotension that is not responsive to classical therapy. Little evidence supports its use in normotensive patients with refractory anaphylaxis. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with severe anaphylaxis unresponsive to epinephrine. Physical examination revealed marked respiratory distress, raised oral lesions, and altered mental status but lacked hypotension. After infusion of methylene blue, symptom resolution occurred almost immediately, and intubation was spared. Side effects were minimal. We propose methylene blue as a safe treatment option for refractory anaphylaxis, whether with or without hypotension.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1116ofTU]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (see Supplementary material for completed checklist). We registered this study in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42024505039). Our review question was built using the following PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study design) criteria: adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia (P); non-adrenergic vasopressors (I); adrenergic vasopressors or placebo (C); mortality at the longest follow-up available (O); RCTs (S).

Search strategy and selection criteria

Four researchers independently searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant studies from inception to January 29, 2024. The complete search strategies are presented in the Supplementary material. We included RCTs comparing non-adrenergic vasopressors with adrenergic vasopressors or placebo in adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia. Non-adrenergic vasopressors included vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin. Exclusion criteria were non-randomized trials, quasi-randomized trials, observational studies, systematic reviews, commentaries, editorials, narrative reviews, animal studies, or conference abstracts. We also excluded studies without mortality data or enrolling pediatric patients (≤ 15 years old). No restriction was applied to language. After removing duplicates, four investigators assessed eligibility at the title/abstract level. Then, four investigators evaluated the full text of all potentially relevant articles. In case of disagreement, the final assessment was discussed with a senior investigator.

Data collection

From eligible studies, two investigators independently extracted the following variables using a standardized data collection form: first author name, publication year, number of participating centers, patient population, number of patients in the non-adrenergic and control group, the non-adrenergic vasopressor, the comparator, baseline vasopressor dose, type of comparator drug, and outcome data.

Risk of bias assessment

The risk of bias of each included RCT was assessed independently by two investigators using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials version 2 (RoB 2). The overall certainty of the evidence was evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The GRADEpro software was used to create the GRADE evidence profile table.

### Efficacy of methylene blue in an experimental model of calcium channel blocker-induced shock [^117LhAiK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Calcium channel blocker poisonings account for a substantial number of reported deaths from cardiovascular drugs. Although supportive care is the mainstay of treatment, experimental therapies such as high-dose insulin-euglycemia and lipid emulsion have been studied in animal models and used in humans. In the most severe cases, even aggressive care is inadequate and deaths occur. In both experimental models and clinical cases of vasodilatory shock, methylene blue improves hemodynamic measures. It acts as a nitric oxide scavenger and inhibits guanylate cyclase that is responsible for the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Excessive cGMP production is associated with refractory vasodilatory shock in sepsis and anaphylaxis. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of methylene blue in an animal model of amlodipine-induced shock.

Methods

Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized, ventilated, and instrumented for continuous blood pressure and pulse rate monitoring. The dose of amlodipine that produced death within 60 minutes was 17 mg/kg per hour (LD50). Rats were divided into 2 groups: amlodipine followed by methylene blue or amlodipine followed by normal saline solution, with 15 rats in each group. Rats received methylene blue at 2 mg/kg during 5 minutes or an equivalent amount of normal saline solution in 3 intervals from the start of the protocol: minutes 5, 30, and 60. The animals were observed for a total of 2 hours after the start of the protocol. Mortality risk and survival time were analyzed with Fisher's exact test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the log rank test.

Results

Overall, 1 of 15 rats (7%) in the saline solution-treated group survived to 120 minutes compared with 5 of 15 (33%) in the methylene blue-treated group (difference -26%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -54% to 0.3%). The median survival time for the normal saline solution group was 42 minutes (95% CI 28.1 to 55.9 minutes); for the methylene blue group, 109 minutes (95% CI 93.9 to 124.1 minutes). Pulse rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) differences between groups were analyzed until 60 minutes. Pulse rate was significantly higher in the methylene blue-treated group beginning 25 minutes after the start of the amlodipine infusion (95% CI 30 to 113 minutes) that was analyzed until 60 minutes. MAP was significantly higher in the methylene blue-treated group starting 25 minutes after the amlodipine infusion (95% CI 2 to 30 minutes) that was analyzed until 60 minutes.

Conclusion

Methylene blue did not result in a significant difference in mortality risk. There was an increased pulse rate, MAP, and median survival time in the methylene blue group.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^111uBn4A]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Another point is cardiac ischemia. In this study, some ECG ischemic changes in a few patients were identified. These changes were transient and disappeared while the MB infusion was continuous. It may be attributed to a temporary loss of the beneficial vasodilatory effects of NO on myocardial blood flow due to MB administration.

Limitations

Some limitations should be admitted. First, this was a single-center study. However, as the largest reference center for cancer care in Egypt, this study exhibited the results of using MB in a special group of patients with different types of cancer as the primary disease. They were relatively younger than patients admitted to the ICUs of general hospitals with septic shock. Most patients were already managed in other departments of the NCI while diagnosed with septic shock. Therefore, nosocomial infection is a very common occurrence in such a patient group. Another limitation is that we did not study the other factors contributing to mortality to reach a robust conclusion about the effect of MB on mortality. We did not measure cytokine or nitrate/nitrite serum levels to settle the mechanism of the effects of MB. The study lacked complete blinding due to the presence of bluish coloration on the skin and secretions caused by the administration of methylene blue. However, we kept the blinding of patients and outcome assessors for groups allocated to low and high MB doses.

While acknowledging these limitations, our work contributes to the existing knowledge on the impact of MB on septic shock. To our knowledge, the present work is the first to provide a comparison between the standard bolus dosage of 1 mg and a high dose of 4 mg/kg. Hence, we have determined that MB is safe at this targeted dosage in cancer patients.

In conclusion, in septic shock, early adjunctive MB delivery during the first two hours of vasopressor initiation was associated with early discontinuation and reduced total consumption of noradrenaline. The 1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg bolus doses of MB were similarly effective. Compared to the placebo control group, the 4 mg/kg bolus dose had a survival advantage. However, there was no significant effect on mortality for the 1 mg/kg bolus. No major side effects were observed. There were no significant adverse effects in both dose regimens.

We recommend initiating MB treatment in a bolus dose of 4 mg/kg bolus dose followed by 0.25 mg/kg/hour for 72 h in patients with septic shock within 2 h of starting vasopressors. Monitoring of possible adverse effects is essential during MB treatment.

### Methylene blue for refractory shock in polytraumatized patient: a case report [^113KDh2B]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Methylene blue (MB) has been advocated for the treatment of shock refractory to standard measures. MB is proposed to increase blood pressure in shock by interfering with guanylate cyclase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Several studies have evaluated the vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effects of MB in septic shock patients. However, there is a paucity of studies involving trauma patients.

Case Report

A 4-year-old boy was hit by a truck while riding his bicycle and was treated with fluid resuscitation at the emergency department and then taken to the operating room for damage-control surgery. He had liver, diaphragm, rectal, and thoracic injuries. At the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), he remained hypotensive despite volume, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine infusion. A dose of 0.5 mg/kg of i.v. MB was administered. During the next 2 h after MB administration, we were able to wean him off norepinephrine, and doses of epinephrine and dopamine were reduced. Ultimately, he was discharged from the PICU 13 days later in good condition. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Trauma patients who have experienced bleeding and survived the initial insult are still at risk of dying from continuing systemic hypoperfusion and the resultant multiple organ dysfunctions. Use of a low dose of MB as an adjuvant to treat shock might improve survival of these patients.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^117P14ds]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Trial design and oversight

We conducted an investigator-initiated, parallel, double blinded, randomized controlled trial at an academic reference center in Mexico, in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). The study was approved by the institutional review board "Comité de Ética en Investigación Hospital Civil Fray Antonio Alcalde" (HCG/CEI-0252/17) and performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04446871) after inclusion of 17 patients. Informed consent was obtained from all patients or decision makers.

Patients

Patients aged ≥ 18 years with septic shock as defined by Sepsis-3 criteria (highly suspected or confirmed infection, requiring norepinephrine to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, and serum lactate > 2 mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation) were assessed for eligibility.

Exclusion criteria included > 24 h since initiation of norepinephrine, pregnancy, high probability of death within 48 h, concurrent hemorrhagic, obstructive or hypovolemic shock, pending damage control surgery, major burn injury, personal or familiar history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, allergy to methylene blue, phenothiazines, or food dyes, recent intake (4-weeks) of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and refusal of the patient or decision maker to participate. During the beginning of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, data safety monitoring board did not allow us to recruit patients with this diagnosis, due to the unknown pathophysiologic underpinnings and the uncertainties about response to MB.

Randomization, intervention and measurements

After signing informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to receive MB using a predetermined randomization sequence prepared in sealed opaque envelopes. The sequence was generated by computer with a 1:1 allocation ratio, using permuted blocks with a size of 4. Critical care physicians were responsible for assignment of intervention. Patients, clinicians, investigators and outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment received.

Patients assigned to MB group received an intravenous (IV) infusion of 100 mg of MB in 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution over 6 h once daily for a total of 3 doses. Patients assigned to control group received the same dose of 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride without MB. In order to avoid visual identification of the infusion, all infusion bags and polyvinylchloride lines were prepared at central pharmacy with opaque envelopes.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^113AJX31]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The results of the subgroup analysis of patients undergoing CRRT are intriguing. Patients who required CRRT had significantly higher SOFA scores (13.5 ± 2.5) than those patients who did not require CRRT (11.3 ± 2.0) (p < 0.001). In the subgroup of patients supported by CRRT that were identified as MB responders, hospital mortality was lower (63.6%) compared to those who did not respond to MB (89.2%). This may be due to the reduced clearance of MB in patients requiring CRRT, effectively increasing the amount of drug the patients were exposed to which may also inform the dose of MB that is required to provide benefit. Tumlin et al demonstrated that patients with vasodilatory shock and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy had an improved MAP response and survival when treated with angiotensin II compared with placebo. In another study, MB administration demonstrated a renoprotective effect with improved creatinine clearance and decreased excretion of tubular damage markers, which could partially explain the improved clinically outcome of MB responders. It may be that responders within this CRRT subgroup to rescue agents (such as MB and angiotensin II) derived greater survival benefit. The need for renal replacement therapy in the setting of shock is associated with poor outcomes and if this finding is replicated in other cohorts, perhaps MB could play a special role in this patient population. A prospective study comparing the administration of methylene blue to angiotensin II in patients undergoing CRRT with vasoplegia is warranted to determine the relative efficacy of the two agents in this patient population.

Future areas of (ideally prospective) research must include answering the question of whether certain sub-populations are more likely to respond to MB such as those supported with ECMO, those suffering from post-cardiotomy shock, and those requiring CRRT.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^112cS4s5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The study SHOCKEM-Blue was published by Miguel Ibarra-Estrada and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Crit Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the trial question was: what is the role of early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock? In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the population was: 91 patients (36 female, 55 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with septic shock according to Sepsis-3 criteria. The key exclusion criteria were > 24 hours since initiation of norepinephrine; pregnancy; high probability of death within 48 hours; concurrent hemorrhagic, obstructive or hypovolemic shock; pending damage control surgery; major burn injury. In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the interventions were: n = 45 methylene blue (intravenous infusion at a dose of 100 mg in 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution for 6 hours once a day for a total of 3 doses) n = 46 placebo (intravenous infusion of 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution for 6 hours once a day for a total of 3 doses). In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in time to discontinuation of vasopressors at day 28 (69 hours vs. 94 hours; AD -25 hours, 95% CI -39.83 to -10.17). In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median vasopressor-free days at 28 days (23.9 days vs. 19.5 days; MD 4.4, 95% CI 1.15 to 7.65) Significant decrease in hospital length of stay (9 days vs. 10.5 days; AD -1.5 days, 95% CI -2.83 to -0.17) No significant difference in death at day 28 (33% vs. 46%; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05). In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in ejection fraction, serum creatinine, bilirubin, and liver aminotransferases. significant difference in methemoglobin saturation (2.9% vs. 0.5%). In the SHOCKEM-Blue study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with septic shock according to Sepsis-3 criteria, methylene blue was superior to placebo with respect to time to discontinuation of vasopressors at day 28.

### Methylene blue and epinephrine: a synergetic association for anaphylactic shock treatment [^112sx9F3]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Severe hypotension resulting from anaphylactic shock may be refractory to epinephrine and impair cerebral oxygenation and metabolism contributing to anaphylactic shock morbidity and mortality. Refractoriness to epinephrine could be corrected by nitric oxide pathway inhibitors such as methylene blue.

Objectives

To compare the systemic and regional (brain and skeletal muscle) effects of epinephrine and methylene blue given alone or in combination in a rat model of anaphylactic shock.

Design

Prospective laboratory study.

Setting

University laboratory.

Subjects

Male Brown-Norway rats (n = 60).

Interventions

After sensitization and induction of anaphylactic shock by ovalbumin, animals received either vehicle (ovalbumin group) or a 3-mg/kg methylene blue bolus (methylene blue group) or epinephrine (epinephrine group) or both (methylene blue-epinephrine group). Sensitized control rats received only vehicle and no ovalbumin (control group).

Measurement and Main Results

Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, cerebral blood flow, skeletal muscular oxygen partial pressure, cerebral oxygen partial pressure, skeletal muscular, and cerebral interstitial lactate/pyruvate ratio were measured. Cleaved caspase 3 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression were analyzed in the cerebral cortex by Western blot. Without treatment, rats died rapidly within 15 mins from a decrease in cardiac output and mean arterial pressure, whereas treated rats survived until the end of the experiment. Methylene blue alone extended survival time but without significant improvement of hemodynamic variables and tissue perfusion and did not prevent neuronal injury. Epinephrine restored partially systemic hemodynamic variables and cerebral perfusion preventing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Compared with epinephrine alone, the methylene blue-epinephrine association avoided neuronal excitotoxicity and had an additive effect both on hemodynamic variables and for prevention of brain ischemia. Neither treatment could significantly restore cardiac output or prevent muscular compartment ischemia and microvascular leakage.

Conclusions

Anaphylactic shock is associated with severe impairment of cerebral blood flow despite correction of arterial hypotension. Epinephrine must still be considered as the first-line vasoconstrictive agent to treat anaphylactic shock. The epinephrine-methylene blue association was the most effective treatment to prevent cerebral ischemia and could be used in anaphylactic shock refractory to epinephrine.

### A novel use of methylene blue in the pediatric ICU [^117978iE]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Methylene blue (MB) is a medication commonly used to treat methemoglobinemia, reducing methemoglobin to hemoglobin. A novel use of MB, as detailed here, is in the treatment of refractory hypotension. A number of reports have detailed use of MB for this purpose in adults, but few data in pediatrics. A 22-month-old girl with Noonan syndrome, biventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic positive pressure ventilation developed shock with tachycardia, hypotension, and fever after 3 days of diarrhea. She was critically ill, with warm extremities, bounding pulses, and brisk capillary refill. Laboratory tests revealed metabolic acidosis, low mixed venous oxygen saturation, and leukocytosis with bandemia. Treatment of severe septic shock was initiated with fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, sedation, and paralysis. She remained hypotensive despite norepinephrine at 0.7 μg/kg per minute, dopamine at 20 μg/kg per minute, and vasopressin at 0.04 U/kg per hour. Her vasoplegic shock worsened, despite aggressive conventional therapy. Intravenous MB was initiated, with a loading dose of 1 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 0.25 mg/kg per hour. Upon initiation of MB, her systolic blood pressure increased by 33 points (40% increase), and diastolic blood pressure increased by 20 points (46% increase). She was able to wean off all inotropes quickly after initiation of MB. MB should be considered in the setting of refractory vasoplegic shock in the PICU.

### Comparative study between high and low dose methylene blue infusion in septic cancer patients: a randomized, blinded, controlled study [^113t6aGX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

A case study showed that a bolus of 3 mg/kg for 20 min, followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h for 48 h early in septic shock reduced lactate levels, inflammatory cytokines, and the dose of vasopressors. Twenty-four hours after the MB was suspended, there was a rise in serum lactate and a return of noradrenaline to 0.03 µg/kg/min. This finding may be an indicator of the importance of continuous MB infusion to help maintain hemodynamics and tissue perfusion.

We believe that MB as a bolus + continuous infusion might prolong suppression of the NO pathway, which is accomplished in two phases: iNO synthase inhibition and the downstream sGC. Nevertheless, we failed to prove the hypothesis of a higher effect with a high bolus dose of MB. This may be attributed to the unpredictable duration of systemic inflammation in septic shock. Thus, the cumulative dose of MB appears more valuable than the bolus dose in septic shock, probably due to a half-life of 5–6 h.

Elevated MB in whole blood exceeds plasma concentration, indicating accumulation in blood cells. Acute inflammation triggers NO generation by immune cells, including macrophages, therefore augmenting the inflammatory stimulus. This might suppress an excessive inflammatory reaction in septic shock, which leads to hemodynamic derangement.

MB has the advantage of being a selective inhibitor of iNOS, sparing the constitutive isoform, therefore enhancing microcirculatory flow, increasing blood flow to ischemic regions, scavenging oxygen-free radicals, and promoting microbial death by macrophages. Also, MB can act as an antioxidant to decrease oxidative stress and lower plasma levels of IL-6.

When using MB in septic shock treatment, several points should be considered. One is toxicity. A one-time bolus of 1–2 mg/kg MB was shown to be safe in sepsis and was not associated with the development of methemoglobinemia. The current study provided evidence of the safety of a 4 mg/kg bolus dose. We did not observe adverse effects of MB on the circulatory, respiratory, or metabolic levels. Besides, no cases of methemoglobinemia were recorded. The continuous and extended infusion of MB can result in increased cumulative dosages, which may have hazardous effects. A recommended total cumulative dose of 5.75 mg/kg for continuous infusion in cases of septic shock was recommended. Higher dosages may result in methemoglobinemia. Therefore, the current work made use of a dosage of 0.25 mg/kg/h.

### A systematic analysis of methylene blue for drug-induced shock [^113NuBrH]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Pharmacologically induced shock can be refractory to standard resuscitation. Methylene blue (MB) acts to prevent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and may be a potential treatment for refractory shock.

Objective

A systematic analysis of the literature to evaluate MB in pharmacologically induced shock. Primary outcome was survival and secondary outcome was hemodynamic improvement.

Materials and Methods

A search of MedLine/PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, TOXLINE, Google Scholar and Google was performed 10 August 2015 using a combination of text words and keywords related to MB, shock and specific drugs. We included primary literature articles reporting clinical outcomes in humans.

Results

The searches yielded 928 citations, with 255 exact duplicates. Of the 673 entries screened, 16 citations met study criteria and comprised 17 cases. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) represented ten cases (six amlodipine, two verapamil, and two diltiazem), atenolol three cases as coingestant with amlodipine, five metformin, one ibuprofen, and one multidrug (quetiapine, carbamazepine, valproic acid, oxazepam, and fluoxetine). Twelve patients survived and nine had hemodynamic improvement following MB administration. Four did not respond to MB but survived with other advanced resuscitative measures. None of the seven cases had BP improvement and four died when lipid was given prior to MB, compared to one death and nine cases of BP improvement when lipid was not given. In all cases, MB was used after failing several other treatments. Bolus doses ranging from 1 to 3mg/kg, with repeat boluses or maintenance infusions. Reported adverse events were temporary self-limited blue discolorations.

Conclusion

While there are compelling cases describing an improved hemodynamic status following MB, there are also several cases without observed change. Currently, there is not enough evidence available to recommend the routine administration of MB in refractory pharmacologically induced shock.

### Drug diluent and efficacy of methylene blue in septic shock: authors' reply [^112ySX1N]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug manufacturers are usually compelled to warn about possible interactions of certain compounds based on pre-clinical data. A common example is norepinephrine bitartrate, whose manufacturers warn about possible inactivation if prepared with NS due to oxidation; however, stability of norepinephrine in NS for prolonged time has been confirmed for decades. Patients are always closely monitored for any potential adverse effects in RCTs, and although our results could be considered as reassuring, we recognize the importance of post-marketing drug safety surveillance in real-world settings, and urge clinicians to strictly adhere to specifications of manufacturers along with local pharmacy department policies. Notwithstanding, we would like to pinpoint other pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic factors that could have improved the efficacy of MB in our trial even more than the use of NS; namely, an initial 1 mg/kg bolus, doses of 2–3 mg/kg instead of fixed 100 mg, continuous infusion, repeated doses until shock resolution instead of a fixed 3-doses scheme, and especially, aiming for an earlier administration after septic shock diagnosis, as it has been suggested that efficacy could be enhanced if MB is used within the first 8 h.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^11264nyM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Survival to discharge

A total of 88 (39.5%) patients had a ≥ 10% increase in MAP in the first 1–2 hours post-MB administration and considered MB responders, and this MAP increase was not associated with a statistically significant change in norepinephrine requirements when compared to non-responders (49 ± 30.5 mcg/min) vs. (53 ± 44.1 mcg/min) (p = 0.41). Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in vasopressin requirements between responders (0.06 ± 0.03 units/min) and non-responders (0.05 ± 0.02 unit/min) (p = 0.11) or epinephrine requirements between responders (6.1 ± 3.9 mcg/min) and non-responders (6.9 ± 5.8 mcg/min) (p = 0.36). The institutional culture is to titrate norepinephrine for MAP goals and remain on a fixed dose of vasopressin and epinephrine. There was a trend in improved survival to hospital discharge in the MB responder group compared to the non-responder group, but this result was not statistically significant (21.6% vs 14.8%, p = 0.19).

Additional results

Bolus doses of MB were 1.68 ± 0.5 mg/kg in responders vs 1.71 ± 0.4 mg/kg in non-responders (p = 0.62). Responders tended to have an improvement in norepinephrine requirements within 1 hour after MB administration. Patients were separated into groups based on the indication for MB as documented and defined by the physician team (Table 2) into vasodilatory shock, 171 (72.5%), post-cardiotomy shock, 40 (16.9%), and other etiologies, 25 (10.6%). There were no statistically significant differences in survival based on these groupings. There was no difference in lactate level (mmol/L) 1 hour prior to MB administration between responders (8.7 ± 5.1) and non-responders (8.2 ± 5.4) (p = 0.46). There was also no difference in lactate level 2 hours after MB administration between responders (10.3 ± 6.1) and non-responders (9.0 ± 5.2) (p = 0.48).

### Methylene blue as adjunctive therapy in septic shock: correct drug diluent derives optimal efficacy [^1176meuo]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

We read with a great interest, the randomized controlled trial "Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock" published by Ibarra-Estrada et al. in Critical care recently. We would like to congratulate all the authors of the study for addressing such an important aspect in critical care and trying to answer the research question by conducting a randomized controlled trial.

The authors have concluded that the use of methylene blue (MB) within 24 h in patients with septic shock reduces the duration of vasopressor use, cumulative fluid balance, hospital and intensive care unit stay without significant adverse events as compared to placebo.

In methodology, authors mentioned that patients assigned to MB group received an intravenous (IV) infusion of 100 mg MB in 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.

We would like to highlight that since MB is a hypotonic solution with osmolarity of about 10–15 mOsm/kg, dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride solution, could lead to precipitation of MB, as the presence of chloride (Cl −) ions reduces the solubility of MB. Precipitation of a drug in a solution can reduce its therapeutic efficacy due to drug inactivation, can occlude the infusion lines, may cause thrombophlebitis or rarely particulate embolization and multiple organ dysfunction.

Therefore, to avoid precipitation of MB in a solution and to improve its clinical efficacy without adversely affecting the patient, we suggest that MB should be diluted in either a sterile water or 5% dextrose solution before intravenous administration.

### A review of methylene blue treatment for cardiovascular collapse [^117QEeh3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, methylene blue (MB) has been used for multiple purposes, including as an antidote for toxin-induced and hereditary methemoglobinemia, ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, and ackee fruit and cyanide poisoning; as an aniline dye derivative, antimalarial agent, and antidepressant.

Discussion

Most recently, the use of MB has been advocated as a potential adjunct in the treatment of shock states. Our article reviews the role of MB in septic shock, anaphylactic shock, and toxin-induced shock. MB is proposed to increase blood pressure in these shock states by interfering with guanylate cyclase activity, and preventing cyclic guanosine monophosphate production and vasodilatation.

Summary

MB may be an adjunct in the treatment of septic shock, anaphylactic shock, and toxin-induced shock.

### Early adjunctive methylene blue in patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^114naJhP]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, early adjunctive MB administration reduced vasopressor duration, cumulative fluid balance, and ICU and hospital length of stay among patients with septic shock, as compared with placebo. There were no severe adverse effects related to its use. Our results support the continuous research of MB as an early adjunctive therapy in patients with septic shock to confirm the potential benefit in larger multicenter randomized clinical trials.

### Administration of methylene blue in septic shock: pros and cons [^116ehWiJ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Several agents have been tested as NOS inhibitors, with the hypothesis that blocking or modulating the excessive iNOS activity would be beneficial in this setting. NOS inhibitors may act to reverse the negative pathophysiological effects of NO overproduction on vascular tone and the hyporeactivity to vasopressor agents during sepsis. In the clinical trial setting, the principal agents that have been used in sepsis for this purpose are non-selective NOS inhibitors, such as methylarginine (L-NMMA) and nitroarginine (L-NNA). These agents have been shown to increase systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure (MAP). It is important to remember however that blocking the NO pathway in septic shock is much more than just the effects on macrovascular hemodynamics, myocardial function, and hyporesponsiveness to adrenergic agents. The role of NO in sepsis is essential for the normal microvascular and immune responses to infection; therefore, global inhibition of NO synthesis in septic shock could be deleterious. Its multiple actions probably explain why the expected improvement in some macrocirculatory variables (for example, increase in MAP, SVR) with non-selective NO inhibitors does not translate directly into further clinical benefits, and may be harmful. Indeed, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial by Lopez et al. showed that use of L-NMMA in septic shock patients increased 28-day mortality from 49 to 59%.

### Drug diluent and efficacy of methylene blue in septic shock: authors' reply [^1137oVBH]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

We thank Dubey et al. for their interest in our recently published randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the use of methylene blue (MB) in patients with septic shock. They rise an interesting and justified debate about MB clinical administration.

We are aware that some manufacturers warn about possible precipitation of MB when diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline, NS); however, this is not the case for all MB compounds, as the main clinical reference that supports this warning is an isolated report in which a hospital that usually diluted a generic formulation of MB in NS (as we do) had to switch to ProbayBlue® due to local shortage in 2017. During administration of the second dose, they found a precipitate in intravenous tubing with no harm to the patient.

Drug stability for infusions beyond 1–2 h could also be questioned due to scarcity of data, but MB has been safely diluted in NS in clinical studies even at higher concentrations than we used, including two other RCTs in patients with septic shock; our preparation consisted of a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml administered over 6 h, while Memis et al. used > 2 mg/ml over 6 h and Kirov et al. infused 5 mg/ml over 4 h. Based on these data and our previous unpublished local experience for a decade, we decided to use NS due to its more favorable distribution, as it is widely known that administration of 5% dextrose impacts mainly the intracellular compartment, with negligible effect on intravascular when compared to NS, even in cases when capillary integrity is present.

### Infusion of methylene blue in human septic shock: a pilot, randomized, controlled study [^1127Mv32]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of continuous infusion of methylene blue (MB), an inhibitor of the nitric oxide pathway, on hemodynamics and organ functions in human septic shock.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, pilot study.

Setting

Multidisciplinary intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Twenty patients with septic shock diagnosed < 24 hrs before randomization.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either MB (MB group, n = 10) or isotonic saline (control group, n = 10), adjunctive to conventional treatment. MB was administered as an intravenous bolus injection (2 mg/kg), followed 2 hrs later by infusion at stepwise increasing rates of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg/hr that were maintained for 1 hr each. During infusion, mean arterial pressure was maintained between 70 and 90 mm Hg, while attempting to reduce concurrent adrenergic support.

Measurements and Main Results

Hemodynamics and organ function variables were assessed over a 24-hr period, and the survival rate at day 28 was noted. Infusion of MB prevented the stroke volume and the left-ventricular stroke work indexes from falling and increased mean arterial pressure. Compared with the control group, MB reduced the requirement for norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine by as much as 87%, 81%, and 40%, respectively. Oxygen delivery remained unchanged in the MB group and decreased in the control group. MB also reduced the body temperature and the plasma concentration of nitrates/nitrites. Leukocytes and organ function variables such as bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, urea, and creatinine were not significantly affected. Platelet count decreased in both groups. Five patients treated with MB survived vs. three patients receiving conventional treatment.

Conclusions

In human septic shock, continuously infused MB counteracts myocardial depression, maintains oxygen transport, and reduces concurrent adrenergic support. Infusion of MB appears to have no significant adverse effects on the selected organ function variables.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus methylene blue for treatment of vasoplegic shock following cardiopulmonary bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1142wUkd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence of the hemodynamic effects and vasopressor requirements of adult cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegic shock treated with hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Multi-institutional.

Participants

Adult cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegic shock.

Interventions

Administration of hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 263 patients in four retrospective observational studies were included in a pooled analysis. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, vasopressor requirement at 1 hour (mean difference [MD]: 0.00 mcg/kg/min norepinephrine equivalent [NEE], 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.09 to 0.08). Hydroxocobalamin was associated with a significant improvement in mean arterial pressure at 1 hour (MD: 5.30 mmHg, 95% CI: 2.98 to 7.62), total vasopressor dose at 1 hour (MD: -0.13 mcg/kg/min NEE, 95% CI: -0.25 to -0.01), total vasopressor at 6 hours (MD: -0.15 mcg/kg/min NEE, 95% CI: -0.21 to -0.08). No differences were observed in systemic vascular resistance or mortality between groups. Three studies were deemed at moderate risk of bias and one at serious risk.

Conclusions

Hydroxocobalamin has been shown to have a beneficial effect on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements in vasoplegic cardiac surgery patients compared with methylene blue, although evidence is limited, and further well-powered randomized controlled trials are required.

### Local cutaneous necrosis secondary to a prolonged peripheral infusion of methylene blue in vasodilatory shock [^113yjnqH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of methylene blue extravasation and subsequent tissue necrosis in a patient with refractory septic shock.

Case Summary

A 47-year-old female presented with febrile neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy. The patient quickly decompensated to refractory septic shock in the critical care unit despite implementation of early goal-directed therapy as well as intravenous norepinephrine and vasopressin to stabilize her hemodynamic status. She received a 16-hour infusion of 1% methylene blue 0.25 mg•kg(-1)•h(-1), titrated up to 0.5 mg•kg(-1)•h(-1), via a peripheral intravenous catheter. Ten hours after the start of the methylene blue infusion, she experienced a local extravasation injury, which led to distal digital necrosis. While her hemodynamic status improved dramatically, allowing discharge from the intensive care unit and eventually to home, the extravasation site became necrotic and required debridement and skin graft.

Discussion

Methylene blue is a vasoactive chemical that has been shown to provide hemodynamic stability in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Methylene blue administration is not considered standard of practice in the treatment of refractory septic shock and many aspects of its dosing, route, duration, and adverse effects are poorly described. As such, there is little guidance for its administration. We postulate that, in our patient, in the presence of systemic vasopressin and norepinephrine, methylene blue caused extensive vasoconstriction at the site of extravasation, resulting in tissue ischemia and necrosis. Tissue necrosis secondary to peripheral intravenous extravasation has not been previously described and is not listed as an adverse outcome on the drug monograph. The Naranjo probability scale indicates that the tissue necrosis was probably caused by the methylene blue extravasation.

Conclusions

To mitigate future risk to limb and skin, we recommend that methylene blue infusions be delivered via central venous catheter. Extra care should be given to patients with risk factors for extravasation, such as sedation, presence of systemic disease, proximal intravenous puncture sites, and improperly placed catheters.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^1155kbWo]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

1.6 Treatment of toxic methemoglobinemia

Halt Exposure

The agent precipitating methemoglobinemia should be stopped or removed.
Supportive Therapy

Intravenous hydration and oxygen supplementation should be instituted. If necessary, cardiopulmonary support with mechanical ventilation and pressor support are indicated. For endogenous reducing enzymes to be effective, adequate glucose must be available. Glucose is also needed to form NADPH via the hexose monophosphate shunt, which is necessary for methylene blue (see below) to be effective.

Infants with methemoglobinemia resulting from diarrhea and acidosis may improve with aggressive hydration and bicarbonate to correct the acidosis alone as long as the methemoglobin level is < 20%.
Methylene Blue (Methylthioninium chloride)

Methylene Blue (MB) is the primary treatment for decreasing MetHb levels. It acts by accepting an electron from NADPH, and, in its new form, leukomethylene blue acts to reduce the 3+ ferric state back to the 2+ ferrous state in erythrocytes. The usual starting dose is 1–2 mg/kg (0.2 mL/kg of a 1% solution) infused intravenously over 3 to 5 minu. The dose may be repeated at 1 mg/kg if methemoglobinemia does not significantly decrease within 30–60 min. Methylene blue should reduce MetHb levels significantly in less than an hour. Risk of worsening of methemoglobinemia increases with repeated doses, with toxic levels of MB reached at a total dose > 7 mg/kg. A rebound phenomenon of increased MetHb levels after completion of therapy is attributed to the reversal of the reduction reaction. In cases of worsening methemoglobinemia after MB treatment, urgent exchange transfusion should be performed.

### The additional use of methylene blue has a decatecholaminisation effect on cardiac vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery [^114Zyt68]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The first positive hemodynamic effect of MB in cardiac surgery was reported 1996. In that study Andrade et al. reported using 1.5 mg*kg − 1 of MB in six patients with vasoplegic syndrome. After MB administration, SVRI increased from 868 to 1693 dyn*s*cm − 5 *m − 2. It is supposed that MB's vasoconstrictive effect is caused by two mechanisms: MB inhibits inducible NO synthase, thus reducing the vasodilating ligand, and MB binds competitively to the heme group of guanylate cyclase, thus additionally reducing the receptor binding site for vasodilation. The result is catecholamine-independent vasoconstriction. The administration of MB can therefore reduce catecholamine requirement and catecholaminergic stress in critically ill patients. This therapeutic approach is known as decatecholaminisation. But insufficient hemodynamic effects after MB administration have also been reported. MB's variable vasoconstrictive effect may be explained by the non-standardized administration of MB; in these studies the time point of MB administration, dosage etc. differed considerably, thereby explaining the various reactions to MB. There are some side effects and complications associated with MB administration. These undesirable MB effects can be categorized into minor and severe complications. Classic minor side effects such as dizziness and nausea were not detectable in any of our patients, though these minor side effects may not have been apparent in our study as all patients were intubated and sedated during MB treatment. The administration of MB can also result in microcirculation disorders and local cutaneous necrosis. Whether there is a beneficial or harmful MB effect on mesenteric perfusion in vasoplegic shock is still unclear. The use of MB in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient patients triggers severe hemolytic crisis in these patients and therefore must be avoided. The mean MB dose in our study was 2.0 mg*kg − 1, which corresponds to that of others studies and is described as a safe standard dose. In our study, a small group of twelve patients received an unintentionally higher dose of MB (4.5 mg*kg − 1–5.5 mg*kg − 1). Neither the standard dose group (< 2.0 mg*kg − 1) nor the maximum dose group (4.5 mg*kg − 1–5.5 mg*kg − 1) experienced any minor or serious side effects in our study.

### Does methylene blue administration to septic shock patients affect vascular permeability and blood volume? [^116mXwi4]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of the inhibition of guanylate cyclase, an enzyme involved in sepsis-related vascular and myocardial dysfunctions, on hemodynamic variables including blood volume and pulmonary vascular permeability during septic shock.

Design

Prospective, open study with repeated measurements.

Setting

A medicosurgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Fifteen patients with septic shock associated with persisting hypotension despite conventional treatment including fluid loading, vasopressors, and inotropes.

Interventions

A fiberoptic catheter was inserted for the determination of blood and extravascular volumes by the thermal-dye double indicator technique, using indocyanine green (COLD system). A bolus dose of methylene blue (3 mg/kg) was infused intravenously over 10 mins. COLD-derived variables were recorded before methylene blue and 20 mins, 1 hr, and 2 hrs after the end of methylene blue infusion.

Measurements and Main Results

Standard hemodynamic and oxygen-derived variables; total, intrathoracic, systolic, and diastolic cardiac blood volumes; extravascular lung water; plasma osmolarity; and lactate and protein concentrations were recorded. Mean arterial and pulmonary artery pressures, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, and left ventricular stroke work index increased, and blood lactate transiently decreased after methylene blue (p < .05). The other variables recorded were unchanged during the 2-hr period following methylene blue infusion.

Conclusions

This study confirmed the acute vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effects of methylene blue during septic shock. These effects were not associated with changes in blood volume, myocardial diastolic function, or pulmonary vascular permeability assessed by extravascular lung water.
