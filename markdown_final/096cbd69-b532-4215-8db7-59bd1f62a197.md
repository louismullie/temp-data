## Question

What is the likely culprit if a patient is on the max dose of linzess, daily MiraLAX, and magnesium with reports of frothy stool with air bubbles

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is the likely culprit for frothy stool with visible air bubbles in a patient on max-dose linaclotide (Linzess), daily polyethylene glycol 3350 (MiraLAX), and magnesium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about each drug's mechanism and adverse effects. Then, I should review guideline positions on combining a GC-C secretagogue with osmotic laxatives in IBS-C/CIC. Next, I will consider the pathophysiology linking rapid transit, fermentation, gas trapping, and frothy stool. After that, I should identify the likeliest primary driver and exacerbating factors. Finally, I will outline a management plan, verify dosing and monitoring, and consider alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and adverse effects of linaclotide. Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that increases intestinal chloride/bicarbonate secretion, raises luminal water, and accelerates GI transit; diarrhea is the most common adverse reaction, and flatulence, abdominal distension, and pain are also reported, all of which could plausibly contribute to bubbly or "frothy" liquid stool in the right context [^112DBnzc] [^114umxBu].

> I need to check polyethylene glycol 3350 next. PEG 3350 retains water osmotically, softens stool, and is not metabolized by intestinal bacteria; typical adverse effects include bloating and, at higher exposures, diarrhea, making it a plausible contributor to a watery, gas-admixed stool matrix when combined with a secretagogue like linaclotide [^112yMpUK].

> I will now examine magnesium hydroxide's role. Magnesium hydroxide is a saline osmotic laxative that increases intraluminal water; while it does not itself generate gas, the added fluid load can amplify distension and speed transit when layered on top of a secretagogue and PEG, potentially worsening gas trapping and stool frothiness, with added caution in renal impairment for hypermagnesemia risk [^116qJSgW].

> Hold on, let me think about the pathophysiology behind frothy stool with visible air bubbles. Accelerated transit from linaclotide can deliver incompletely digested carbohydrates to the colon, where bacterial fermentation produces hydrogen, methane, and CO2; when excess luminal water is present, gas can be trapped and dispersed in the liquid stool, creating a bubbly, frothy appearance that may persist even after bowel movements, consistent with the observation that bloating responses can lag behind evacuation [^112KcQCc].

> Let me synthesize the cascade effect. First, linaclotide increases secretion and accelerates transit; second, rapid transit increases delivery of fermentable substrates to the colon; third, fermentation generates gas; fourth, PEG and magnesium add further osmotic water, lowering viscosity and facilitating foam formation from gas-fluid mixing. Initially I thought "MiraLAX provides additional substrate for fermentation", but wait, let me verify — PEG 3350 is not metabolized by colonic bacteria, so it does not serve as a fermentation substrate; the correct mechanism is that PEG augments luminal water, which disperses and traps fermentation gases into a froth, especially when transit is brisk [^112DBnzc] [^112yMpUK].

> Next, I should review guidelines to avoid overreaching. The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology suggests considering avoidance of osmotic laxatives such as PEG to improve overall symptoms in IBS-C, which flags PEG as potentially counterproductive in this phenotype; meanwhile, AGA/ACG guidelines for CIC list both PEG and linaclotide as effective options, but they present them as individual therapies rather than endorsing routine combination, and BSG recommends linaclotide as a second-line agent in IBS-C with diarrhea as a common adverse effect, reinforcing caution with additive secretory/osmotic load [^117PX13z] [^111N88LR] [^112t69Kc] [^115Z5Yi7].

> I should confirm the most likely primary culprit. Given the mechanism and dose-response adverse-effect profile, max-dose linaclotide is the key initiator via accelerated transit and increased secretion, with recognized flatulence, urgency, and diarrhea as dose-related AEs; for IBS-C, the labeled dose is 290 mcg daily, which is often clinically effective but can produce gas-laden loose stools, especially when combined with other osmotics [^114cDfRY] [^112DBnzc] [^114umxBu].

> Let me consider the contribution of PEG and magnesium more carefully. While neither directly increases gas production, both raise luminal water, thereby enhancing gas dispersion and trapping; PEG can cause bloating by itself, and stacking PEG plus magnesium on top of linaclotide likely shifts the stool matrix toward a low-viscosity, foam-prone state with visible bubbles, consistent with the clinical description of frothy stool [^112yMpUK] [^116qJSgW].

> Hold on, I should verify that the recommended management aligns with evidence and guidelines. The pragmatic first step is to de-escalate redundant osmotic load: discontinue PEG and magnesium, continue linaclotide monotherapy, and reassess over an adequate trial period because symptomatic domains like bloating may lag; if constipation persists despite tolerability limits, consider switching classes rather than layering osmotics, for example to a 5-HT4 agonist such as prucalopride, which carries strong AGA/ACG support for CIC, while closely monitoring for dehydration or excessive diarrhea [^112KcQCc] [^115kwVxD] [^112t69Kc].

> But wait, what if symptoms remain ambiguous after de-escalation. I should double-check for red flags and alternative contributors to gas and bloating that can coexist with IBS-C/CIC, while recognizing that in typical IBS-C presentations, a symptom-targeted approach with guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy and careful titration is appropriate; shared decision-making about dosing and side effects is essential in this functional disorder framework [^1136Cs1v] [^115KZRZZ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. The frothy, bubbly stool is best explained by linaclotide-driven accelerated transit and secretion, with PEG and magnesium amplifying luminal water and gas trapping; linaclotide is the primary driver, while PEG and magnesium are significant exacerbators in this triple-laxative regimen. De-escalate to linaclotide monotherapy, avoid PEG in IBS-C as per CAG guidance, and, if needed, pivot to an alternative class like prucalopride rather than stacking osmotics with a secretagogue, all while monitoring for tolerability and response over an appropriate window [^116R6uJW] [^117PX13z] [^115kwVxD] [^112t69Kc].

---

The most likely cause of frothy stool with air bubbles in a patient on maximum-dose linaclotide, daily polyethylene glycol, and magnesium is **excessive intestinal gas from rapid transit and osmotic load**. Linaclotide increases intestinal secretion and accelerates transit [^112DBnzc], while polyethylene glycol [^112yMpUK] and magnesium [^116qJSgW] draw water into the lumen; together, they cause loose, frothy stools with entrained gas from bacterial fermentation and swallowed air. This is a common, expected effect of these agents, not an adverse reaction; consider **reducing doses or spacing administration** to improve tolerability [^115kwVxD] [^116R6uJW].

## Pharmacological mechanisms and gastrointestinal effects

### Linaclotide (Linzess)

- **Mechanism of action**: Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that increases intracellular cGMP, stimulating chloride and bicarbonate secretion via CFTR, increasing intestinal fluid, and accelerating transit [^112DBnzc] [^111ytHaN].

- **Clinical effects**: Diarrhea is the most common adverse effect (> 10%) [^114umxBu], with flatulence, abdominal distension, and urgency [^1154CF3m] also reported.

- **Dose-related effects**: Higher doses increase secretory and motility effects, leading to looser, more frequent stools with gas and froth [^114AGkTk].

---

### Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX)

- **Mechanism of action**: PEG is a non-absorbable osmotic laxative [^112yMpUK] that retains water in the lumen, softening stool and increasing frequency [^115kwVxD].

- **Clinical effects**: Common effects include diarrhea [^112yMpUK], bloating, and flatulence from increased water content and bacterial fermentation [^115VE9SK].

- **Duration of use**: Prolonged or high-dose use can cause persistent diarrhea and gas.

---

### Magnesium-containing laxatives

- **Mechanism of action**: Magnesium salts are osmotic laxatives [^116qJSgW] that draw water into the intestine, increasing volume and transit.

- **Clinical effects**: Diarrhea, bloating, and flatulence are common [^116qJSgW] due to osmotic water retention and fermentation.

- **Dose-related effects**: Higher doses increase diarrhea and gas [^116qJSgW].

## Pathophysiology of frothy stool with air bubbles

Frothy stools with visible air bubbles reflect **increased intraluminal gas and rapid intestinal transit**, which trap bubbles within loose stool. Gas arises from bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and osmotic agents, producing hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide, while accelerated transit from linaclotide and osmotic laxatives reduces gas absorption [^111ytHaN] and promotes bubble entrapment. Swallowed air (aerophagia) can further contribute, particularly when transit is rapid.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting medication-induced frothy stools

Clinical data show that linaclotide **commonly causes diarrhea and flatulence** [^114umxBu] [^112DBnzc], consistent with frothy, gas-containing stools [^1154CF3m]. Similarly, polyethylene glycol frequently produces diarrhea, bloating, and flatulence, particularly with prolonged or high-dose use [^112yMpUK]. Magnesium-containing laxatives commonly cause diarrhea and gas, especially at higher doses [^116qJSgW].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While **medication effects are most likely**, the differential includes small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and carbohydrate malabsorption (e.g. lactose intolerance), both causing excess fermentation and gas. Functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea or a mixed pattern, should also be considered [^115PVfkn].

---

## Clinical management and recommendations

Management includes adjusting medications by **reducing doses or spacing administration** to reduce the overall osmotic load and gas [^115kwVxD]. Dietary measures such as limiting fermentable carbohydrates (a low-FODMAP approach) may reduce fermentation. If symptoms persist despite these steps, consider breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^112qQXco] and evaluation for malabsorption.

---

The most likely cause of frothy stools with air bubbles in this setting is **excessive intestinal gas from rapid transit and osmotic load** due to linaclotide, polyethylene glycol, and magnesium [^112DBnzc] [^112yMpUK]. This reflects their expected pharmacologic effects [^115kwVxD]; **dose reduction or spacing** can improve tolerability.

### Novel pharmacological therapies for management of chronic constipation [^116qJSgW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Laxatives can be classified as lubricant, emollients, stimulants, osmotic, and rectal laxatives. The osmotic laxatives are generally the first choice and include nonabsorbable sugars (lactulose), saline (magnesium hydroxide), and polyethylene glycol.

A recent review based on evidence evaluated the efficacy and safety of laxatives in chronic constipation. Only the solutions of polyethylene glycol and lactulose showed a high level of evidence and were assigned a grade A recommendation to polyethylene glycol and lactulose solutions; grade B to methylcellulose and sorbitol; and grade C for magnesium hydroxide. Paraffin and glycerin suppositories showed no scientific evidence.

Osmotic laxatives are indicated in patients with slow colonic transit, when other measures outlined above are not sufficient, and in patients with anismus. An adequate water intake is recommended during their use, and monitoring of electrolyte levels is advised; similarly, caution in patients with renal insufficiency should be taken, as magnesium salts may cause hypermagnesemia.

Lubricants are indicated less frequently because of their adverse effects. Mineral oil may inhibit the absorption of liposoluble vitamins and calcium. In children and the elderly, it has been reported that mineral oil increases the risk for aspiration and lipoid pneumonia.

Stimulant or irritant laxatives can be aggressive and are rarely indicated as long-term treatment. They should be used in cases of transient constipation. Prolonged use of stimulant laxatives may cause melanosis coli or electrolyte imbalances.

- **General precautions**: Patients presenting with complaints of constipation should undergo a thorough medical history and physical examination to identify any associated metabolic, endocrine, or neurogenic conditions, and medication usage. A diagnostic evaluation should include a structural examination of the colon. Patients should also be educated about healthy defecatory and eating habits, such as consuming high-fiber diets, and engaging in lifestyle changes like adequate dietary fiber and fluid intake, and regular exercise to promote more regular bowel habits.

Polyethylene glycol 3350, NF should be administered after being dissolved in approximately 4–8 ounces of water, juice, soda, coffee, or tea.

- **Information for patients**: Polyethylene glycol 3350, NF softens stool and increases bowel movement frequency by retaining water in the stool. It should always be taken by mouth after being dissolved in 4–8 ounces of water, juice, soda, coffee, or tea. If unusual cramps, bloating, or diarrhea occur, consult your physician. Two to four days may be required to produce a bowel movement. This product should be used for two weeks or less, or as directed by a physician. Prolonged, frequent, or excessive use of polyethylene glycol 3350, NF may result in electrolyte imbalance and dependence on laxatives.

### Linaclotide reduced response time for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation symptoms: Analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials [^112KcQCc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Our analyses of early and late responders demonstrated variations in patterns of response. Although not all patients within this pooled population responded within 12 weeks, responses occurred later than 4 weeks but before 12 weeks in 1 in 6 patients for abdominal pain and in approximately 1 in 10 patients for CSBM frequency. Importantly, fewer than 1 in 5 patients did not meet criteria for either an abdominal pain or CSBM frequency response by 12 weeks. This emphasizes the need to allow sufficient time for a drug to work. It is, of course, in the best interests of the patient to suspend treatment in cases of futility or intolerable side effects; however, in certain countries, guidelines preclude continued treatment with linaclotide in some patients who may still benefit. For example, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends stopping linaclotide treatment if no response is seen within 4 weeks. Our analyses show that before 12 weeks, 1 in 6 and 1 in 10 patients might still have met criteria for an abdominal pain and CSBM frequency response, respectively.

In these analyses, abdominal bloating response lagged behind the response for other abdominal symptoms; reasons for this remain unclear because the pathophysiology of abdominal bloating is not fully understood. However, it has previously been shown that a BM does not always lead to a reduction in a patient's bloating score. Theoretically, medications that accelerate transit, such as linaclotide, should improve abdominal bloating and distension.

### Do patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have an altered gut flora [^116UGhqw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

The description of the de novo development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) following an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis (postinfectious IBS) illustrates the potential for a luminal factor (a bacterial pathogen) to cause this common gastrointestinal ailment. As a consequence of these and other observations, as well as results from experiments involving animal models, the enteric flora and the immune response that it generates in the host have, somewhat surprisingly, become central in IBS research, with their potential to induce the pathophysiological changes associated with IBS. While evidence for immune dysfunction both in the mucosa and systemically continues to accumulate, methodological limitations have hampered a full delineation of the nature of the microbiota in IBS. The latter is eagerly awaited and may yet provide a firm rationale for the use of certain probiotics and antibiotics in IBS, whose benefits have now been described with some consistency.

### Alosetron [^116HMjG7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Serious complications of constipation**: Some patients have experienced serious complications of constipation without warning. Serious complications of constipation, including obstruction, ileus, impaction, toxic megacolon, and secondary bowel ischemia, have been reported with the use of alosetron tablets during clinical trials. Complications have occurred with both the standard 1 mg twice-daily dose and lower doses. However, a dose-response relationship has not been established for these serious complications. The incidence of serious complications of constipation was approximately 0.1% (1 per 1,000 patients) in women receiving either alosetron tablets or placebo. Additionally, rare cases of perforation and death have been reported in postmarketing clinical practice. In some cases, complications of constipation required intestinal surgery, such as colectomy. Patients who are elderly, debilitated, or taking additional medications that decrease gastrointestinal motility may be at greater risk for complications. Alosetron tablets should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop constipation [see Boxed Warning].

- **Ischemic colitis**: Some patients have experienced ischemic colitis without warning. Ischemic colitis has been reported in patients receiving alosetron tablets in clinical trials as well as during marketed use of the drug. In IBS clinical trials, the cumulative incidence of ischemic colitis in women receiving alosetron tablets was 0.2% (2 per 1,000 patients, 95% confidence interval 1 to 3) through 3 months.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^114c4aqJ]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of side effects of cancer therapies, particularly chemotherapy, plays a significant role in the management of these conditions. Cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have a direct effect on the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, causing inflammation, oedema, ulceration, and atrophy. Increased bowel permeability, combined with the secondary effects of immunosuppression, predisposes patients to an elevated risk of GI transmural infections, which can potentially lead to septicaemia, shock, associated hypotension, and secondary mucosal ischaemia.

New-onset lactose intolerance is responsible for diarrhoea and bloating during 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy in 10% of patients. Clinical experience suggests that small bowel bacterial overgrowth, bile acid malabsorption, and pancreatic insufficiency are three other important contributory factors to chemotherapy-induced GI symptoms.

Hepatic side effects include reactivation of hepatitis B, severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (especially with oxaliplatin-based regimens), and steatosis. Following treatment with irinotecan in particular, steatosis may progress to steatohepatitis. This condition may be exacerbated by pre-existing conditions such as alcohol excess, diabetes, and obesity. Both steatosis and steatohepatitis are potentially reversible after cessation of chemotherapy but may occasionally contribute to morbidity and mortality. The detailed management of these conditions is described elsewhere.

Chronic GI side effects of chemotherapy have not been systematically or prospectively studied. However, clinical experience suggests that a small proportion of patients continue to experience ongoing GI problems, including constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, bloating, and pain. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth may also be a contributing factor.

### Linzess [^1154fza5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of Linzess in patients with functional constipation (FC) under 6 years of age or in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) under 18 years of age have not been established.

- **Juvenile animal toxicity data**: In toxicology studies in neonatal mice, oral administration of linaclotide at 10 mcg/kg/day caused deaths on post-natal day 7 (human age equivalent of approximately 0 to 28 days). These deaths were due to rapid and severe dehydration produced by significant fluid shifts into the intestinal lumen resulting from GC-C agonism in neonatal mice [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	- Tolerability to linaclotide increases with age in juvenile mice. In 2-week-old mice, linaclotide was well tolerated at a dose of 50 mcg/kg/day, but deaths occurred following a single oral dose of 100 mcg/kg. In 3-week-old mice, linaclotide was well tolerated at 100 mcg/kg/day, but deaths occurred following a single oral dose of 600 mcg/kg.

- **Geriatric use**: Of 2,219 IBS-C patients in the placebo-controlled clinical studies of Linzess (Trials 1, 2, and 6), 154 (7%) were 65 years of age and over, while 34 (2%) were 75 years and over. Clinical studies of Linzess did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

	- Of 2,498 chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) patients in the placebo-controlled clinical studies of Linzess (Trials 3, 4, and 5), 273 (11%) were 65 years of age and over, while 56 (2%) were 75 years and over. Clinical studies of Linzess…

### Recognizing and defining occasional constipation: Expert consensus recommendations [^113PDBZJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common problem affecting 15% of the population and is often self-diagnosed and self-managed. Over the past three decades, there have been significant advances in our understanding and management of chronic constipation, with the emerging recognition that occasional constipation (OC) is another subtype that falls outside traditional classifications. The purpose of this review was to describe the process of developing and proposing a new definition for OC based on expert consensus. This takes into consideration the multifactorial nature of the problem, such as alterations in bowel habits that include stool frequency and difficulty with stool passage, perception of the sufferer, duration of symptoms, and potential responsiveness to treatment.

Leading gastroenterologists from five countries met virtually on multiple occasions through an online digital platform to discuss the problem of OC and recommended a practical, user-friendly definition: "OC can be defined as intermittent or occasional symptomatic alteration(s) in bowel habit. This includes a bothersome reduction in the frequency of bowel movements and/or difficulty with passage of stools but without alarming features. Bowel symptoms may last for a few days or a few weeks, and episodes may require modification of lifestyle, dietary habits, and/or use of over-the-counter laxatives or bulking agents to restore a satisfactory bowel habit". Prospective studies are required to validate this definition and determine OC prevalence in the community. This review highlights knowledge gaps and could provide an impetus for future research.

### Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: suggestions from a multidisciplinary expert board [^1121mGCt]. Supportive care in cancer (2019). Low credibility.

From the palliative care physician's perspective, a significant issue is the lack of awareness among patients about symptoms as they are primarily focused on pain and their illness. In home palliative care, nurses have a critical role in educating patients, assessing symptoms, and identifying appropriate treatments.

Reports on bowel function in medical records are typically sparse. For opioid-naïve patients, maintaining a diary that records the frequency of bowel movements, stool consistency, and the use of laxatives — before and after starting opioid therapy — is advisable. This approach helps clinicians identify differences between pre- and post-prescriptive phases and formulate a definitive diagnosis of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD).

In selected cases where physical examination is inconclusive, an abdominal X-ray might be useful. However, it is often challenging to perform for patients in palliative care programs, especially those receiving care at home.

- **Measuring treatment efficacy**: It is equally important to assess the effectiveness of treatment and the need for possible adjustments. Despite validated measurement scales being available, they are rarely used in clinical practice and are mostly confined to clinical research. An example of a useful tool is the Bowel Function Index (BFI), which is typically based on three parameters:
	- Ease of defecation
	- Feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation
	- Personal judgment of constipation

The BFI is a valid tool for the subjective evaluation of OIBD by patients. Additionally, it is important to consistently monitor and record the frequency of bowel movements. It is also essential to note that although three bowel movements per week are the baseline, further evaluation is necessary if this frequency is not met.

### Treatment of chronic constipation: Current pharmacologic approaches and future directions [^115VE9SK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common condition that affects up to 27% of the population. Dietary and lifestyle measures are usually the first-line therapy. However, if these fail to have an effect, a variety of prescription and consumer laxatives are available. Traditional laxatives include bulking agents, osmotic agents, stool softeners, and stimulants of the gastrointestinal tract. All have been found to be more effective than placebo at relieving symptoms of constipation, but these results have been obtained primarily in short (4-week) trials, and no class of laxative has been shown to be superior to another.

Traditional laxatives work in many, but not all, patients. Some patients cannot cope with the side effects, unpleasant taste, the requirements of the dosing regimen, or the notion of dose increase. New enterokinetic agents that affect peristalsis through selective interaction with 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptors and novel agents acting on intestinal secretion could offer an alternative option for patients with chronic constipation who cannot get adequate relief from laxatives.

### What is the role of stimulant laxatives in the management of childhood constipation and soiling [^116kLz4F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Constipation is extremely common in childhood and may lead to overflow soiling or encopresis. Standard treatment of more severe cases involves emptying the bowels of impacted feces using oral or rectal laxatives and then maintaining regular bowel movements with the continuation of osmotic and stimulant laxatives.

- **Objectives**: The review aimed to determine the effect of stimulant laxative treatment in children with chronic constipation who may also suffer from soiling or encopresis.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Database of Randomised Controlled Trials was searched. Additional citations were sought through hand searching of pediatric journals and contact with known professionals in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: All identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of stimulant laxatives to children with either placebo or alternative treatment were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: No trials were found that met the selection criteria.

- **Main results**: No trials were found that adequately met the selection criteria.

- **Reviewer's conclusions**: The need exists to establish a secure footing for treatment decisions, and adequately sized trials are required to provide comparative data on commonly used drugs.

### Influence of trial sample size on treatment effect estimates: meta-epidemiological study [^115t1GD8]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of trial sample size on treatment effect estimates within meta-analyses. It was designed as a meta-epidemiological study.

The data sources comprised 93 meta-analyses consisting of 735 randomized controlled trials assessing therapeutic interventions with binary outcomes. These meta-analyses were published in the 10 leading journals of each medical subject category of the Journal Citation Reports or in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Data extraction involved collecting sample size, outcome data, and risk of bias from each trial.

- **Data synthesis**: Trials within each meta-analysis were sorted by sample size into quarters (from quarter 1 with 25% of the smallest trials to quarter 4 with 25% of the largest trials) and by size groups across meta-analyses (ranging from < 50 to ≥ 1000 patients). Treatment effects were compared within each meta-analysis between quarters or between size groups by average ratios of odds ratios. A ratio of odds ratios less than 1 indicates larger effects in smaller trials.

Results indicated that treatment effect estimates were significantly larger in smaller trials, regardless of sample size. Compared with quarter 4, which included the largest trials, treatment effects were on average 32% larger in trials in quarter 1 (which included the smallest trials; ratio of odds ratios 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.82), 17% larger in trials in quarter 2 (0.83, 0.75 to 0.91), and 12% larger in trials in quarter 3 (0.88, 0.82 to 0.95). Similar results were obtained when comparing treatment effect estimates between different size groups.

### Current management strategies and therapeutic targets in chronic constipation [^112qS6Wd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Constipated patients who are refractory to simple lifestyle interventions will usually resort to laxatives, whether prescribed or over the counter. Clinical trial evidence is scarce for older medications such as laxatives, especially with a condition as chronic and subjective as constipation. Newer polyethylene glycol-based laxatives have been investigated under rigorous clinical trial settings, but comparisons between different laxatives are not available. Newer prokinetic agents targeting peristalsis, intestinal secretion, and colonic flora have been developed for laxative-refractory constipation. This review focuses on the evidence for each of these agents and the relative indications for each of them.

### Linzess [^116gvKvg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Linzess is contraindicated in patients less than 2 years of age. In nonclinical studies, deaths occurred within 24 hours in neonatal mice (human age equivalent of approximately 0 to 28 days) following oral administration of linaclotide, which increased fluid secretion as a consequence of age-dependent elevated GC-C agonism resulting in rapid and severe dehydration [see juvenile animal toxicity data].

A clinical GC-C ontogeny study in children 6 months to less than 18 years of age (N = 99) was conducted to measure GC-C mRNA expression levels in duodenal and colonic samples. This was to evaluate the risk of diarrhea and severe dehydration due to GC-C agonism. The results showed no age-dependent trend in GC-C intestinal expression in children 2 to less than 18 years of age. However, there was insufficient data on GC-C intestinal expression to assess the risk of developing diarrhea and its potentially serious consequences in children less than 2 years of age [see warnings and precautions (5.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of Linzess for the treatment of functional constipation (FC) in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age have been established. Use of Linzess for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. The safety of Linzess in adult and pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age in clinical studies was similar [see adverse reactions (6.1) and clinical studies (14.3)].

### American gastroenterological association-american college of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: Pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^115kwVxD]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults.

- **Methods**: The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

- **Results**: The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults.

For most patients, the long-term improvement of symptoms is the objective of treatment. However, very limited data are available on the longevity of therapeutic interventions aimed at "normalizing" small intestinal dysbiosis. In conjunction with the obvious lack of a generally accepted gold standard for the diagnosis of SIBO, there are considerable knowledge gaps regarding therapeutic measures intended to cure SIBO and provide long-lasting improvements for patients with this condition.

### Diagnosis and management of IBS [^115PVfkn]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. IBS is considered a functional bowel disorder, which means it is not defined by structural or biochemical abnormalities, and is diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Limited and judicious use of diagnostic testing is recommended, particularly for patients with typical IBS symptoms without alarm signs.

Management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes the establishment of an effective patient-provider relationship, education, reassurance, dietary alterations, pharmacotherapy, and behavioral and psychological treatment. Patient-centered care is recommended, focusing on the patient's most bothersome and impactful symptoms, their preferences and previous experiences with treatment, and addressing factors associated with the onset and exacerbation of symptoms. Pharmacotherapy is typically targeted against the predominant symptom.

This review discusses evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of IBS. An improved understanding of the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IBS will lead to greater patient satisfaction as well as reduced healthcare costs.

### European society of neurogastroenterology and motility guidelines on functional constipation in adults [^116SX8LV]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common disorder with a reported prevalence ranging from 3% to 27% in the general population. Several management strategies, including diagnostic tests, empiric treatments, and specific treatments, have been developed. Our aim was to develop European guidelines for the clinical management of constipation.

- **Design**: After a thorough review of the literature by experts in relevant fields, including gastroenterologists, surgeons, general practitioners, radiologists, and experts in gastrointestinal motility testing from various European countries, a Delphi consensus process was used to produce statements and practical algorithms for the management of chronic constipation.

- **Key results**: Seventy-three final statements were agreed upon after the Delphi process. The level of evidence for most statements was low or very low. A high level of evidence was agreed only for anorectal manometry as a comprehensive evaluation of anorectal function and for treatment with osmotic laxatives, especially polyethylene glycol, the prokinetic drug prucalopride, secretagogues such as linaclotide and lubiprostone, and PAMORAs for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation. However, the level of agreement between the authors was good for most statements (80% or more of the authors). The greatest disagreement was related to the surgical management of constipation.

- **Conclusions and inferences**: European guidelines on chronic constipation, with recommendations and algorithms, were developed by experts. Despite the high level of agreement between the different experts, the document provides a comprehensive overview of current practices.

### Low-dose linaclotide (72 μg) for chronic idiopathic constipation: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114AGkTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

As in previous linaclotide studies, adverse events (AEs) were elicited from patients via non-leading questions and were all recorded and analyzed; however, "diarrhea" was not objectively defined as part of the AE reporting process. Thus, it is difficult to interpret whether diarrhea reported as an AE simply represented a significant change in stool consistency or frequency, as would be expected from a drug like linaclotide, or truly represented an adverse event. For patients with chronic constipation, looser stools may be welcome, and in linaclotide clinical trials are actually associated with higher treatment satisfaction.

A better measure of the impact of diarrhea on patients than simple prevalence may be to look at dropout rates due to diarrhea, as this provides a measure of a patient's willingness to continue therapy. In the present study, dropout rates due to diarrhea were low across all groups (< 5%). Serious adverse events were infrequent and balanced across treatment groups (≤ 1% of patients in any group). In both trials, there were no clinically meaningful differences observed in clinical laboratory or vital signs parameters between the linaclotide and placebo groups. Therefore, when considering both treatment efficacy and tolerability in clinical practice, we hypothesize that patients with milder constipation or a greater responsiveness to GC-C agonism may obtain sufficient benefit with the 72-μg dose. Similarly, patients with more severe constipation and abdominal symptoms, or less sensitivity to GC-C agonism, may benefit from the higher, 145-μg dose.

### Versacloz [^111kCzbJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of Versacloz, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post-marketing experience, effects reported range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, and intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2)]. These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk for severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Prior to initiating Versacloz, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in patients treated with Versacloz. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives.

### Clinical response to linaclotide at week 4 predicts sustained response in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and improvements in digestive and extra-digestive symptoms [^116hataW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

IBS-C is a chronic condition requiring long-term management. Patient dissatisfaction with available treatment options or lack of response to treatment can result in negative outcomes such as repeated physician consultations, use of multiple treatments (over-the-counter or prescription medications), medication switching, use of unproven medications, or unnecessary surgery. Therefore, it is important to understand the effectiveness of any treatment over time. The ability to identify patients who will or will not respond to a treatment, both in the short and long term, would be of substantial clinical value. This understanding will be important in establishing reasonable patient, prescriber, and payer expectations of the effectiveness of a treatment.

Treatment recommendations for linaclotide suggest a first follow-up visit 4 weeks after initiation, with a second visit at 12 weeks and periodically thereafter, depending on the individual patient's needs. The aim of this study was to identify factors that may help predict a short- and long-term clinical response to linaclotide and to assess the impact of linaclotide on IBS-C symptoms, including GI, digestive nonintestinal, and extra-digestive symptoms after 12 weeks.

### Novel and alternative therapies for childhood constipation [^115U2adq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common and distressing pediatric problem. Even though the prevalence of this disorder has increased, the treatment of constipation in children is still largely based on clinical experience rather than on evidence-based studies.

The currently recommended treatment includes education, disimpaction, and maintenance therapy, consisting of dietary changes, behavioral modification, and the use of laxatives. Among osmotic agents, polyethylene glycol solutions appear to be the first-line drug to use in pediatrics. Although these measures are effective in the majority of children, a sizable proportion needs long-term therapy. Chronicity may significantly interfere with the child's emotional growth and development.

Advances in the understanding of the gastrointestinal enteric nervous system and epithelial function have led to the development of new classes of drugs. These include substances that bind to serotonin receptors or are chloride channel activators. Further studies are needed to assess the benefits and risks of these new drugs.

### 'Gut health': a new objective in medicine [^113CxRVX]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Despite an increasing number of validated laboratory methods for the objective assessment of bowel function, the perception of the individual should never be ignored. Only direct conversation between a doctor and patient provides the opportunity to register GI-specific sensations that are pleasant, primarily related to meal intake and the evacuation of feces, such as gratifying sensations like satiation and complete rectal evacuation. Other physiological events, such as eructation and the emission of wind from the anus, may also contribute to GI well-being. Sensations related to thirst, taste, smell, and the desire for specific types of foods (such as salts or sweets) should also be considered part of this concept. Patients with so-called functional GI diseases lose such pleasant sensations, which will be modulated by age, sex, cultural background, and psychological stress.

- **How to maintain gut health**: Our knowledge about how to maintain or restore gut health is limited in evidence-based medicine terms, but general observations suggest a wide range of possible ways to support gut health and GI well-being. Medical research is much more focused on the treatment of defined GI disease rather than on the secondary or even primary prevention of disease. For example, we know of several effective drugs to treat acute IBD and a few to support remission, but almost nothing to prevent IBD. This situation might be related not only to pathophysiological circumstances.

### Novel pharmacological therapies for management of chronic constipation [^1125G4vf]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

- **Fiber and bulk forming agents**: The fiber and bulking agents are the most similar to the physiological mechanisms of evacuation. Fiber decreases colonic transit time, increases stool volume, decreases intracolonic pressure (especially at the rectal sigmoid, which reduces patient discomfort), reduces bile salt concentration (implying decreased gut contractile activity), and produces changes in the colonic microbial mass, favoring the growth of the bacterial population.

There are different types of fiber, both natural and synthetic. The most common among natural fibers is wheat bran (20 g/d), and synthetic methylcellulose (4 g/d) is commonly used through commercial preparations based on seeds. However, the most frequently used are psyllium derivatives (10 to 20 g/d). The appropriate dose should be achieved gradually, with a focus on ensuring a plentiful water intake. A positive response to fiber may take 4 to 6 weeks; therefore, it is advisable to maintain dietary fiber treatment for 1 to 2 months before considering treatment failure.

Some patients cannot tolerate fiber due to excessive bloating and gas production. Psyllium acts like a dietary fiber and is acted upon by colonic bacteria, resulting in meteorism, bloating, and flatulence. Synthetic agents such as methylcellulose and polycarbophil are not degraded by bacterial enzymes of the intestinal flora, thus avoiding gas formation.

A significant advantage of these agents is the lack of systemic side effects, allowing for long-term use. Contraindications for their use include intestinal obstruction and hypersensitivity.

### Mirtazapine for gastrointestinal and neuropsychological symptoms in older adults with irritable bowel syndrome [^113AVtEs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common and potentially modifiable contributor to excess disability, morbidity, and poor quality of life. Predominantly bowel habit-driven, IBS is a pleomorphic disorder with psychiatric and medical comorbidities including anxiety, depression, insomnia, migraine headache, diarrhea, nausea, poor appetite, pruritus/skin atopy, and fibromyalgia. Clinical trials of pharmacological interventions for IBS have largely focused on younger adults. However, a growing number of adults aged 65 and older are living with IBS, reflecting both the aging of patients with IBS and an increase in newly diagnosed older patients.

Currently, there are no data to guide clinicians in the safe and effective use of medications (e.g. anticholinergic antispasmodics such as dicyclomine (Bentyl) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline) for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) predominance in the geriatric population. These medications — especially anticholinergics and TCAs — carry a high risk of adverse effects (ADE), such as confusion, drowsiness, and urinary retention in older adults and are included in the Beers List of potentially inappropriate drugs for the elderly. Recent AGA guidelines on the use of eluxadoline, rifaximin, alosetron, loperamide, TCAs, and antispasmodics provide little guidance on treating the elderly population with IBS-D.

Similar to the 2022 AGA guidelines, the United European Gastroenterology and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility also emphasized the complexity of choice and the side effect profiles.

### Gastrointestinal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^113TYyvo]. The Lancet Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

There is growing recognition that gastrointestinal dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Virtually all parts of the gastrointestinal tract can be affected, in some cases early in the disease course. Weight loss is common but poorly understood in people with PD. Dysphagia can result from dysfunction at the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus, and may predispose individuals to aspiration (accidental inhalation of food or liquid). Gastroparesis can produce various symptoms in patients with PD and may cause erratic absorption of drugs given to treat the disorder. Bowel dysfunction can consist of both slowed colonic transit with consequent reduced bowel-movement frequency and difficulty with the act of defecation itself, including excessive straining and incomplete emptying. Recognition of these gastrointestinal complications can lead to earlier and potentially more effective therapeutic intervention.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^114mVvv2]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The panel recognizes that the BFI may be insufficient in some clinical settings. As such, the BFI may be supplemented with additional outcome measures as necessary on the basis of clinical judgment and individual patient needs. Changes from baseline in BM frequency may be relevant for patients who are able to accurately recall this information. The BSFS may be helpful as a patient education tool and in patients who require a visual method of communication, such as those with cognitive impairment, advanced or serious illness, or other challenges including verbal difficulties and low literacy level.

The panel acknowledges that the BFI may not precisely capture the symptoms and outcomes relevant in OIC. Therefore, development and validation of additional assessment tools for OIC that have comparable or better practicality and ease of use are warranted. For optimal efficiency, future tools might comprise a single question that incorporates the most important aspects of OIC (e.g. "While on opioid therapy, do you have painful or difficult BMs that have not been relieved by laxatives?"). A tool that has the flexibility to be either patient or clinician administered may minimize the potential for clinician bias while maintaining the option, if needed, to avoid patient miscommunication or misinterpretation. Additional clinical studies are needed to help improve understanding of baseline bowel habits and the effectiveness of OTC therapies in OIC.

### Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^115htQ4u]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder encountered in gastroenterology practice, and it also constitutes a significant component of primary care practices. Although the classic IBS symptoms, such as lower abdominal pain, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits, are easily recognizable to most physicians, diagnosing IBS remains a challenge due to the absence of anatomic or physiologic markers. Consequently, the diagnosis of IBS must be based on clinical evaluation.

Over the last 15 years, several symptom-based diagnostic criteria have been proposed, with the most recent being the Rome II criteria. These criteria demonstrate reasonable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing IBS. However, their role in clinical practice remains ill-defined. A literature review shows that in patients without alarm symptoms, the Rome criteria have a positive predictive value of approximately 98%, and additional diagnostic tests yield no more than 2%.

Diagnostic evaluation should also include a psychosocial assessment, specifically addressing any history of sexual or physical abuse, as these factors significantly influence management strategies and treatment success.

### Magnetic resonance imaging reveals novel insights into the dual mode of action of bisacodyl: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in constipation [^114iBHhm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

- **Study highlights**:

	- **What is the knowledge on the topic**: Bisacodyl is an effective laxative that stimulates motility and secretion; however, previous techniques have not been able to simultaneously assess both secretion and motility in humans or its impact on gut water content.

	- **What question did this study address**: Our primary endpoint was the effect of bisacodyl on the water content of the ascending colon using the MRI parameter T1, a novel method for non-invasively assessing luminal water content. We also investigated whether repeated dosing was more effective than a single dose and why.

	- **What does this study add to our knowledge**: Compared to a placebo, a single dose of bisacodyl exhibits a predominantly prokinetic effect, accelerating whole gut transit and reducing the time from dose ingestion to defecation without altering small or large bowel water content or stool consistency. In contrast, three repeated daily doses increase both small bowel water content and the wateriness of colonic contents as assessed by T1. They also stimulate mass movements, which accelerate gut transit, soften stool, and reduce time to defecation.

	- **How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science**: Patients who do not respond to a single dose of 5 mg bisacodyl should be encouraged to take repeated daily doses, which may soften stool and relieve constipation. MRI can evaluate in detail the mode of action of drugs that alter both intestinal secretions and motility with a relatively small number needed to test.

### Functional bowel disorders [^116mMFZM]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Employing a consensus approach, our working team critically considered the available evidence and multinational expert criticism, revised the Rome II diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders, and updated diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder (FBD) requires characteristic symptoms during the last 3 months and onset greater than or equal to 6 months ago. Alarm symptoms suggest the possibility of structural disease but do not necessarily negate a diagnosis of an FBD.

- **Symptom identification**: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are best identified by symptom-based approaches.

- **IBS subtyping**: Subtyping of IBS is controversial, and we suggest it be based on stool form, which can be aided by use of the Bristol Stool Form Scale.

- **Diagnostic testing**: Diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features.

- **Treatment of FBDs**: Treatment is based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance. Alterations in diet, drug treatment aimed at predominant symptoms, and psychotherapy may be beneficial.

### Irritable bowel syndrome subtypes according to bowel habit: revisiting the alternating subtype [^114yS7MW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Disturbed bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation, are key manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In some patients, diarrhea and constipation alternate, giving rise to the so-called alternating subtype.

- **Aims**: To assess IBS subtype breakdown (constipation (C-IBS), diarrhea (D-IBS), or alternating (A-IBS)) according to the Rome II criteria and patients' self-assessment. The study also evaluates the predominance in the alternating subtype (i.e. constipation, diarrhea, or neither) and the medical and personal impact, including health-related quality of life (HRQoL), of the different IBS subtypes.

- **Subjects and methods**: Two thousand individuals were selected randomly to represent the general population and were classified as potential IBS subjects (n = 281) or as non-potential IBS subjects (n = 1719) according to a validated questionnaire. Bowel habit classification was determined using the Rome II IBS supportive symptoms.

- **Results**: Among 201 subjects meeting the Rome I criteria, 15% presented with D-IBS, 44% presented with C-IBS, 19% presented with A-IBS, and 22% presented with normal bowel habits. Among the 63 subjects meeting the Rome II criteria, 23% presented with A-IBS. According to the subjects' self-assessment, of those meeting the Rome I criteria, 16% considered themselves to have D-IBS, 66% to have C-IBS, and 18% to have A-IBS. In subjects meeting the Rome II criteria, 24% considered themselves to have A-IBS. Among those classified with A-IBS by the Rome II criteria, most considered themselves to be constipated. Regardless of the subtype self-classification, most subjects reported.

### Clozaril [^1119Bo5Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Gastrointestinal hypomotility with severe complications**: Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of Clozaril, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post-marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increase the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, which can result in fecal impaction, megacolon, intestinal obstruction, ischemia, infarction, perforation, ulceration, or necrosis [see Adverse Reaction (6.2)]. These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk of severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis; therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Prior to initiating Clozaril, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in Clozaril-treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives.

### Linaclotide reduced response time for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation symptoms: Analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials [^114m4aFa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic condition affecting between 3% and 10% of the global population. IBS is most common in individuals aged 18–39 years and women. The diagnostic criteria for IBS include: abdominal pain occurring at least 1 day per week, on average, in the past 3 months, associated with two or more of the following: pain related to defecation and/or a change in stool form and/or frequency. Changes in bowel function define the different subtypes of IBS. Evidence suggests that patients with IBS with constipation (IBS-C) experience more frequent and bothersome abdominal pain than patients with other subtypes.

Owing to its heterogeneous pathogenesis, there is no single effective therapy for IBS. Patients with similar symptoms can respond differently to the same treatment. Many are likely to suffer from chronic symptoms; numerous patients have complex treatment histories spanning many years and have tried multiple interventions.

Although there are many dietary, behavioral, over-the-counter, and prescription drugs for IBS-C, these have varying degrees of impact on constipation and/or abdominal symptoms. Among patients with IBS-C in the United States, less than 15% reported being very satisfied with over-the-counter treatments, and less than 20% had tried a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription drug. Similarly, physicians reported having low levels of satisfaction with both over-the-counter and prescription drugs for IBS-C. Given the variable symptom profile and unpredictable responses to treatment, managing IBS-C remains a challenge.

### Diagnosing the patient with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits: Is it irritable bowel syndrome [^1116jvCm]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Diagnosing a patient who presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits can be challenging. Although serious organic illnesses can cause these symptoms, irritable bowel syndrome is commonly responsible. It can be difficult to properly evaluate these patients without overusing diagnostic tests and consultations.

A practical approach for diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome is suggested, using the Rome II criteria and the presence of alarm symptoms such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, fever, or frequent nocturnal symptoms as starting points. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are not met, it is acceptable to reevaluate the patient at a later date. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are met, the patient should be categorized based on age:

- **Patients 50 years or younger**: Can be evaluated on the basis of predominant symptoms — constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
- **Patients older than 50 years**: Should be fully evaluated and considered for gastroenterology referral.

If alarm symptoms are present, a full evaluation should be performed (and gastroenterology referral considered), regardless of the patient's age.

### Effect of 5 days linaclotide on transit and bowel function in females with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [^111ytHaN]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Oral linaclotide, a novel agonist of guanylate cyclase-C, stimulates intestinal fluid secretion and transit and decreases visceral hypersensitivity in animal studies. In healthy volunteers, linaclotide was safe, well tolerated, increased stool frequency, and decreased stool consistency and time to first bowel movement. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of oral linaclotide, 100 and 1000 micrograms once daily, in 36 women with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome; colonic transit was normal in more than 50% of patients.

- **Methods**: Participants underwent 5-day baseline and 5-day treatment periods; gastrointestinal transit (by validated scintigraphy) and bowel function (by daily diaries) were assessed. Treatment effects were compared using analysis of covariance (baseline colonic transit as covariate) with pairwise comparisons of each dose vs. placebo.

- **Results**: There was a significant overall treatment effect on ascending colon emptying half-time (P = 0.015) and overall colonic transit at 48 hours (P = 0.02) but not overall transit at 24 hours (P = ns), with a significant acceleration by linaclotide 1000 micrograms vs placebo (P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively) but no significant effect of linaclotide 100-microgram dose. There were significant overall treatment effects on stool frequency, stool consistency, ease of passage, and time to first bowel movement with a strong dose response for stool consistency (overall, P < .001). No safety issues were identified.

- **Conclusions**: In women with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, [additional text appears cut off]

Patients with functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) may also present with other co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation or diarrhea. Though these symptoms should not be ignored, there is little evidence suggesting that treating these symptoms and improving bowel habits will, in isolation, improve FACP.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^112jQiWM]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although this consensus article is not intended to provide specific treatment recommendations, it highlights the need to consider selected factors before evaluating whether treatment with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) prescription medication is warranted. In anticipation of potential OIC development with long-term opioid use, treatment guidelines recommend the initiation of a prophylactic bowel regimen. This may involve increased fluid and fiber intake, stool softeners, and/or laxatives.

When a diagnosis of OIC is suspected despite prophylactic treatment, clinicians should confirm that the initiation of opioid therapy has led to a change from baseline in the patient's typical bowel habits, as defined by Camilleri et al, before considering further or alternative interventions. First-line approaches to intervention also include dietary changes, over-the-counter (OTC) treatments, and exercise. However, prophylactic and first-line OTC therapies for OIC may not consistently and predictably lead to desired treatment responses. Additionally, the number and quality of OIC studies on such therapies are inadequate to determine their efficacy and tolerability. Nevertheless, the panel believes that the accessibility and relatively low risk of dietary and OTC options justify their prophylactic and first-line use for OIC.

Enemas/rectal suppositories and manual evacuation, which are sometimes recommended for patients with constipation, are associated with invasiveness and discomfort.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^114yh8BM]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Although constipation can be a chronic and severe problem, it is largely treated empirically. Evidence for the efficacy of some of the older laxatives from well-designed trials is limited. Patients often report high levels of dissatisfaction with their treatment, which is attributed to a lack of efficacy or unpleasant side effects. Management guidelines and recommendations are limited and do not sufficiently include treatments that became available more recently, such as prokinetic agents in Europe.

- **Purpose**: We present an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and available guidelines for the treatment of chronic constipation. Recent data is included on the efficacy and potential clinical use of the more newly available therapeutic agents. Based on published algorithms and guidelines on the management of chronic constipation, secondary pathologies and causes are first excluded. Then, diet, lifestyle, and, if available, behavioral measures can be adopted. If these fail, bulk-forming, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives can be used. If symptoms are not satisfactorily resolved, a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride can be prescribed. Biofeedback is recommended as a treatment for chronic constipation in patients with disordered defecation. Surgery should only be considered once all other treatment options have been exhausted.

### Efficacy and safety of linaclotide for opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic noncancer pain syndromes from a phase 2 randomized study [^115xU3hg]. Pain (2020). Low credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation is the most common GI adverse effect attributed to opioid use (number needed to harm: ∼3.3) and can lead to reductions in, or discontinuation of, opioid therapy that may result in inadequate pain control and decreased quality of life. Lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter laxatives are recommended first-line therapies for OIC; however, they do not directly target the underlying etiology of OIC and are ineffective in approximately 50% to 90% of patients with self-identified OIC. When these measures are ineffective, recent guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association Institute recommend the initiation of prescription laxatives. Linaclotide functions locally in the intestinal lumen, activating guanylate cyclase-C, stimulating fluid secretion, and increasing GI transit, which potentially mitigates the constipating effects of opioids on the GI tract.

### Role of microbiota in the pathogenesis of functional disorders of the lower GI tract: Work in progress [^114XcPk4]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Functional bowel disorders significantly affect a large proportion of people worldwide. Patients suffer from longstanding symptoms of abdominal pain or discomfort in combination with abnormal bowel habits. The evidence for the role of microbiota is currently contradictory and descriptive. This review aims to summarize the reasons for this inconsistency, which include methodological differences in DNA extraction and sample handling. Other factors, such as diet, prior antibiotic use, and transit, are major determinants of microbiota but are difficult to control. Randomized studies of specific interventions, in which such factors are varied, may improve the reproducibility and consistency of findings in future research.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation — a European perspective [^116Sqwxs]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

The duration and characteristics of the patient's symptoms must be assessed to distinguish chronic from transient constipation. Transient constipation can be easily recognized by a history indicating that constipation started at a time of change in dietary habits, mobility, or lifestyle. Secondary constipation, as a consequence of other factors, should be identified and treated accordingly.

- **Diagnostic resources**: The Rome III classification system is widely recognized as the only standardized symptom-based diagnostic criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), including chronic constipation. Other definitions of chronic constipation are consistent with the Rome III criteria but are less quantitative and more subjective. Although clinicians are aware of the Rome criteria, these are used principally for research purposes and are not widely applied in clinical practice, with the possible exception of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the Rome Foundation diagnostic algorithm project has recently published a new set of clinical algorithms for FGIDs, including chronic constipation, which actively use the Rome criteria for diagnostic and therapeutic management.

- **Bristol stool form scale**: The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) is a useful visual aid designed to assist in the evaluation of patients with constipation. It uses simple visual descriptors to illustrate common stool forms.

### Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: Suggestions from a multidisciplinary expert board [^11169Xvj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

From the palliative care physician's perspective, the most recent guidelines include indications often unfeasible for fragile patients in a palliative care setting, such as increased physical activity or specific dietary regimes. Ensuring an adequate intake of liquids can be difficult. Consequently, the prescription of osmotic or softening laxatives is often problematic, and too frequently, there is a tendency to intervene with enemas and manual evacuation. These procedures are invasive and potentially painful, especially in the home setting, where the care burden lies primarily on the caregiver. Despite these challenges, specific recommendations for the management of constipation in palliative care settings have been made.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^111UjDkE]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In view of the lack of a standardized definition for opioid-induced constipation (OIC), robust research guiding therapy for this condition is limited. At the time of writing, OIC has been predominantly managed with nonspecific laxative regimens. Existing treatment standards for OIC suggest that opioid rotation, increased fluid and fiber intake, exercise, and over-the-counter (OTC) stool softeners, natural dietary supplements, and laxatives should be considered before evaluating a patient's need for prescription medications.

Most of these options are well-tolerated, readily available, and therefore recommended as first-line treatments. However, first-line agents are neither sufficiently supported by high-quality evidence nor associated with specific targeting of the opioid receptor-mediated mechanism of OIC. Survey results have shown that only 46% of laxative-treated patients with OIC achieve their desired treatment outcomes frequently (i.e. more than 50% of the time). A 2013 systematic review concluded that large, well-designed studies of laxative efficacy in the treatment of OIC are needed.

### Is chronic use of stimulant laxatives harmful to the colon [^111yGmfc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Although stimulant laxatives cause structural damage to surface epithelial cells that is of uncertain functional significance, there is no convincing evidence that their chronic use causes structural or functional impairment of enteric nerves or intestinal smooth muscle. Nor are there reliable data to link the chronic use of stimulant laxatives to colorectal cancer and other tumors. The risks of laxative abuse have been overemphasized, which has minimized their rational use by physicians. Stimulant laxatives may be used chronically when patients fail to respond adequately to bulk or osmotic laxatives alone. These can be combined with bulk or osmotic laxatives in sufficient amounts to soften the stool, or they can be used alone, according to clinical circumstances. The dose of such agents should be titrated to effect. Bisacodyl may be used if anthraquinone laxatives are unsatisfactory.

### Chronic constipation [^115p1xMU]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a prevalent condition that severely impacts the quality of life of those affected. Several types of primary chronic constipation, which show substantial overlap, have been described, including normal-transit constipation, rectal evacuation disorders, and slow-transit constipation. Diagnosis of primary chronic constipation involves a multi-step process initiated by the exclusion of 'alarm' features, such as unintentional weight loss or rectal bleeding, which might indicate organic diseases, such as polyps or tumors, and a therapeutic trial with first-line treatments like dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, and over-the-counter laxatives.

If symptoms do not improve, investigations to diagnose rectal evacuation disorders and slow-transit constipation are performed, including digital rectal examination, anorectal structure and function testing (such as the balloon expulsion test, anorectal manometry, or defecography), or colonic transit tests, such as the radiopaque marker test, wireless motility capsule test, scintigraphy, or colonic manometry. The mainstays of treatment are diet and lifestyle interventions, pharmacological therapy, and, rarely, surgery. This Primer provides an introduction to the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnosis, management, and quality of life associated with the commonly encountered clinical problem of chronic constipation in adults unrelated to opioid abuse.
